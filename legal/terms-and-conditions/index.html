        <h1>Matrix.org Homeserver Terms and Conditions</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Please read this document carefully before accessing or using this service!</p>
<h1 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="1-1-english-not-legalese">1.1 English, Not Legalese</h2>
<p>Most Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written
by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.</p>
<p>We decided to use plain English as much as possible, to make our terms as clear
as possible. Some sections still have room for improvement - we plan to tackle
these over time.</p>
<p>When you read ‘the matrix.org homeserver’ or ‘the Service’ below, it refers to
the services made available at <strong>matrix.org</strong> which store your account and
personal conversation history, provide services such as bots and bridges, and
communicate via the open Matrix decentralised communication protocol with the
public Matrix Network.</p>
<p>Where you read <em>New Vector</em>, <em>New Vector Ltd.</em> or <em>we <em>or</em> us</em> below, it refers
to the company we created in July 2017 to hire the Matrix core team and support
Matrix’s development and so run the matrix.org homeserver: New Vector Ltd., and
its French subsidiary: New Vector SARL and their agents. <strong>This agreement does
not apply to Matrix servers run by anyone else - Matrix is an open network like
the Web and this agreement only applies to the server (matrix.org) provided by
New Vector Ltd.</strong></p>
<p>If this agreement is not acceptable, please use a Matrix server provided by
someone else!</p>

<p>Should you have other questions or concerns about this document, please send us
an email at <a href="mailto:support@matrix.org">support@matrix.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="1-2-using-the-service-means-accepting-these-terms">1.2 Using The Service Means Accepting These Terms</h2>
<p>By accessing or using the Service in any way, whether you have created a Matrix
account on the matrix.org homeserver, or whether you are accessing content
federated from the matrix.org homeserver to another Matrix homeserver, or are
just browsing rooms as an unauthenticated guest, you agree to and are bound by
the terms and conditions written in this document.</p>
<p>If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this
document, please use a Matrix server provided by someone else and refrain from
accessing content federated from this server.</p>
<h2 id="1-3-this-is-a-living-document">1.3 This Is a Living Document</h2>
<p>This is a living document. With your help, we want to make it the best in the
industry.</p>
<p>If you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or if you think of something
that should be added, please get in touch! We’re all ears! Email
support@matrix.org and we’ll chat.</p>
<p>We don’t amend this document for any specific users or use case, but if your
proposed changes apply to all of our users, we’ll be happy to update it for
everyone. Scroll to the bottom to see the history so far.</p>
<p>We will likely improve this document over time. By continuing to use the
Service, you will implicitly accept the changes we make.</p>
<p>Your access and use of the Service is always subject to the most current version
of this document.</p>
<h2 id="1-4-breach-of-terms">1.4 Breach of Terms</h2>
<p>If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your
authorization to access or use the Service automatically terminates. </p>
<p>We may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part
of the Service at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or
liability to you. </p>
<p>If you think we removed your access by mistake, send an email to
<a href="mailto:support@matrix.org">support@matrix.org</a> and we’ll give you our
reasoning.</p>
<h1 id="2-support">2. Support</h1>
<p>Support for the matrix.org homeserver is provided on a best effort basis by New
Vector Ltd - however, support is often available from the wider Matrix
Community in the public Matrix Support rooms (as listed in the 
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/+matrix:matrix.org">+matrix:matrix.org</a> community).</p>
<p>Queries sent to <a href="mailto:support@matrix.org">support@matrix.org</a> will be
addressed on a best-effort basis by the paid team. Phone support is not
provided.</p>
<p>We love Matrix and will support our users as much as we can, but we are also a
small team and value our work/life balance. This means that although we’ll try
our best, we do not provide 24/7 support.</p>
<h1 id="3-intellectual-property-rights">3. Intellectual Property Rights</h1>
<p><em>Note on Plain English: We know that the language in this section still reads
like legalese - this will be improved in later revisions of this document.</em></p>
<h2 id="3-1-who-owns-the-ip-of-my-messages-and-files">3.1 Who Owns the IP of My Messages and Files?</h2>
<p>We do not claim intellectual property rights over rooms, message content or
files uploaded to the Service.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that we have no liability of any kind should anyone
you granted access to your messages or files modify, destroy, corrupt, copy or
distribute them, or violate the terms of use or other limitations that you may
impose on the use of your shared content.</p>
<p>We may pre-screen user messages or files to prevent spam and other abuse, and we
may remove any messages or files (including entire rooms) from the matrix.org
homeserver for any reason without notice at our sole discretion. By posting or
uploading your messages or files, you represent and warrant that you own or
otherwise control all of the intellectual property rights and other rights to
your user materials as described in these Terms of Use, including all the
rights necessary for you to post or upload said messages or files.</p>
<p>You are solely and entirely responsible for all of your messages and files that
you post or otherwise submit via the Service. You shall assume all risks
associated with the use of said content including any reliance on the accuracy,
completeness or usefulness. New Vector does not guarantee the accuracy,
integrity or quality of your messages or files.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that by accessing or using the Service, you may be
exposed to user materials from others that are offensive, indecent or otherwise
objectionable.</p>
<h1 id="4-reliability">4. Reliability</h1>
<h2 id="4-1-do-you-guarantee-that-the-service-will-be-accessible-at-all-times">4.1 Do You Guarantee That The Service Will Be Accessible at All Times?</h2>
<p>In short, we do not. Like all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable
to the inherent unreliability of the Internet. We do not offer contracted SLA
for availability of the Service and your data.</p>
<p>We monitor the Service closely and have set up automated alarms to be notified
(via email, push notifications and phone calls) when the matrix.org homeserver
is under stress, so that we can deal with the issue before it becomes a problem
that might impact customer access.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that New Vector Ltd. shall not be liable for any
failure to store your materials on the matrix.org homeserver at any time.</p>
<h1 id="5-app-developers">5. App Developers</h1>
<p>We encourage you to write software that uses the Matrix Protocol and interfaces
with the Service! </p>
<p>The Matrix Protocol and our implementation will change over time, and we may
change or deprecate APIs or behaviour for any feature of the Service from time
to time - it is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you make
to or via our Service are compatible with then-current APIs for the Service. We
will always try to inform you of any changes with reasonable notice so you can
adjust your Application, but we are under no obligation to do so.</p>
<p>Provided that you comply with the terms of this Agreement and our policies and
procedures, you may use the Service to execute Applications owned by you. You
are solely responsible for your Applications, including any data, text, images
or content they contain.</p>
<h1 id="6-play-nice-clauses">6. Play Nice Clauses</h1>
<p><em>Note on Plain English: We know that the language in this section still reads
like legalese - this will be improved in later revisions of this document.</em></p>
<h2 id="6-1-use-of-the-service">6.1 Use of The Service</h2>
<p>You agree that you shall not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use or attempt to gain unauthorised access to or use another’s account,
password, data, or computer systems or networks connected to the matrix.org
homeserver, whether through malicious attacks, password mining or any other
means.</li>
<li>Access or attempt to access any material that you are not authorized to
access.</li>
<li>Submit or transmit any material that violates or infringes the rights of
others including, without limitation, patent, trademark, trade secret,
copyright, publicity, or other proprietary rights. Please see our
<a href="https://matrix.org/copyright-notice">Copyright Policy</a> for further details.</li>
<li>Disrupt or interfere with the security of, or otherwise cause harm to, the
matrix.org homeserver, systems resources, accounts, passwords, servers or
networks connected to or accessible through the Service or any affiliated or
linked sites.</li>
<li>Use the Service to transmit unsolicited or bulk communications to anyone at
all, be they users of the Service, federated Matrix homeservers, or connected
on a bridged network.</li>
<li>Post or otherwise submit any software, programs or files in a manner that is
intended to cause harm or disruption of another’s equipment, software or
other property, including any corrupted files, time bombs, Trojan horses,
viruses and worms.</li>
<li>Disrupt, interfere or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the
Service.</li>
<li>Access or use the Service in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden
or impair any server we run or the network(s) connected to the Service.</li>
<li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations related to the access to or use of
the Service, or engage in any activity prohibited by the Terms of Use.</li>
<li>Use the Service for any unlawful purposes or in support of illegal activities
under UK/EU law. By using the Service, you agree to comply with all
applicable laws governing your online conduct and content</li>
<li>Act in a way that is in violation of our <a href="/legal/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>
in rooms that are part of the Matrix community (
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/+matrix:matrix.org">+matrix:matrix.org</a>).</li>
<li>Violate the rights of New Vector or any third party (including rights of
privacy and publicity) or abuse, defame, harass, stalk or threaten another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Materials and Services provided by third parties are governed by separate
agreements accompanying such materials and services. New Vector Ltd. offers no
guarantees and assumes no responsibility or liability of any type with respect
to the third-party services, including any liability resulting from
incompatibility between a third-party service, the matrix.org service or
another third-party service. You agree that you will not hold New Vector Ltd.
responsible or liable with respect to the third-party services.</p>
<h2 id="6-1-1-room-aliases-on-the-matrix-org-homeserver">6.1.1 Room Aliases on the Matrix.org Homeserver</h2>
<p>An outside organisation can claim ownership over room aliases bearing that
organisation's names or identifiers. If you represent an organisation, and
would like to take over a room alias for it, please <a href="mailto:support@matrix.org">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>We want users on the matrix.org homeserver to be able to engage in a healthy,
approachable community. To maintain a good user experience we reserve the right
to remove or modify room aliases.</p>
<h2 id="6-2-illegal-content">6.2 Illegal Content</h2>
<p>Any content containing or promoting indecent images/depictions of children is
illegal and utterly prohibited on the Service. When we become aware of such
content, we refer the details to the relevant authorities. If you’ve found an
account, room or group being used for the distribution or promotion of child
sexual exploitation, please share the details in an email to <a href="mailto:abuse@matrix.org">abuse@matrix.org</a>.</p>
<h1 id="7-restriction-and-termination-of-use">7. Restriction and Termination of Use</h1>
<p>We may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part
of the Service at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or
liability to you.</p>
<h1 id="8-encryption">8. Encryption</h1>
<p>The Services may allow you to encrypt your communications end-to-end between
devices. There may be restrictions and limitations on the import, possession,
use, transfer and/or export of strong encryption technology under the laws of
the country in which you intend to use the Service. It is your sole obligation
and responsibility to check such restrictions and limitations before using the
Service and to comply with them. We reserve the right to suspend the Service
immediately and without notice if we determine, in our sole judgment, that the
Service is being used in violation of local regulations governing the use of
cryptographic technologies (even though we have no responsibility to make such
determination).</p>
<h1 id="9-links-to-third-party-sites">9. Links to Third Party Sites</h1>
<p>The Service may include links that will take you to other sites outside of the
the Service. The linked sites are provided as a convenience and the inclusion
of the links do not imply any endorsement by us of any linked site. We have no
control of the linked sites and you therefore acknowledge and agree that we are
not responsible for the contents of any linked site, any link contained in a
linked site or any changes or updates to a linked site. You further acknowledge
and agree that we are not responsible for any form of transmission
(e.g. webcasting) received from any linked site.</p>
<h1 id="10-warranties-and-disclaimers">10. Warranties and Disclaimers</h1>
<p>The matrix.org service is provided by New Vector under these terms of use &quot;as
is&quot; without warranty of any kind, either express, implied, statutory or
otherwise, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of title,
non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Without
limiting the foregoing, New Vector makes no warranty that:</p>
<ol>
<li>the Service will meet your requirements;</li>
<li>the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free;</li>
<li>the quality of the Service will meet your expectations; and</li>
<li>any errors or defects in the Service will be corrected.</li>
</ol>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<ol>
<li>New Vector does not control, endorse, or accept responsibility for any
materials or services offered by third parties (except where stated 
otherwise), including third-party vendors and third parties accessible 
through linked sites;</li>
<li>New Vector makes no representations or warranties whatsoever about any such
third parties, their materials or services;</li>
<li>any dealings you may have with such third parties are at your own risk; and</li>
<li>New Vector shall not be liable or responsible for any materials or services 
offered by third parties.</li>
</ol>
<p>New Vector does not control or endorse the materials or message content found in
any rooms or communities. To the maximum extent permitted by law, New Vector
Ltd. will have no liability related to user materials arising under
intellectual property rights, libel, privacy, publicity, obscenity or other
laws. New Vector Ltd. also disclaims all liability with respect to the misuse,
loss, modification or unavailability of any user messages or files.</p>
<p>The use of the Service is done at your own discretion and risk and with your
agreement that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer
system, loss of data or other harm that results from such activities. New
Vector assumes no liability for any computer virus or other similar software
code that is downloaded to your computer from the site or in connection with
any services or materials. No advice or information, whether oral or written,
obtained by you from New Vector or via the site, services or materials shall
create any warranty not expressly stated in the terms of use. New Vector will
not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using
your password or account with respect to the site or any services or materials,
either with or without your knowledge.</p>
<p>Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
limitations on how long an implied warranty may last, so the above limitations
may not apply to you. To the extent permissible, any implied warranties are
limited to ninety days.</p>
<h1 id="11-indemnity-and-liability">11. Indemnity and Liability</h1>
<p><em>Note on Plain English: We know that the language in this section still reads
like legalese - this will be improved in later revisions of this document.</em></p>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold New Vector and its officers, co-branders, other
partners and employees harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of:</p>
<ol>
<li>your user materials and any other content (e.g. computer viruses) that you
may submit, post to or transmit through the Service, including a third 
party’s use of such user materials or content (e.g. reliance on the accuracy,
completeness or usefulness of your user materials);</li>
<li>your access to or use of the Service (including any use by your employees,
contractors or agents and all uses of your usernames and passwords, whether 
or not actually or expressly authorized by you, in connection with the 
Service);</li>
<li>your connection to the Service;</li>
<li>your violation of the Terms of Use;</li>
<li>your infringement of any third party’s intellectual property rights when
using any of the software made available on the Service;</li>
<li>your violation of any rights of any third party;</li>
<li>your access to or use of linked sites and your connections thereto; or</li>
<li>any dealings between you and any third parties advertising or promoting via
the Service.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="12-emergency-service-calls">12. Emergency Service Calls</h1>
<p>The Service does not and is not intended to support or carry emergency calls to
any emergency services (e.g. E911 or 112 numbers). We are not liable for any
claims, damages or loss which arise from this limitation.</p>
<h1 id="13-limitation-of-liability">13. Limitation of Liability</h1>
<p><em>Note on Plain English: We know that the language in this section still reads
like legalese - this will be improved in later revisions of this document.</em></p>
<p>In no event shall New Vector, its officers, directors, employees, partners or
suppliers be liable to you or any third party for any special, punitive,
incidental, indirect or consequential damages or losses of any kind, or any
damages or losses whatsoever, including those resulting from loss of use, data
or profits, whether or not foreseeable or if New Vector has been advised of the
possibility of such damages or losses, and on any theory of liability,
including breach of contract or warranty, negligence or other tortious action,
or any other claim arising out of or in connection with:</p>
<ol>
<li>the access or use of or the inability to access or use the Service;</li>
<li>the statements or actions of any third party on or via the site, services or 
materials;</li>
<li>any dealings with vendors or other third parties;</li>
<li>any unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions, user 
materials or other data;</li>
<li>any information that is sent or received or not sent or received;</li>
<li>any failure to store or loss of data, files, materials or other content;</li>
<li>any services available that are delayed or interrupted;</li>
<li>any web site referenced or linked to from this site; or</li>
<li>your access to or use of or inability to access or use any linked site.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some jurisdictions prohibit the exclusion or limitation of liability for
consequential or incidental damages. Accordingly, the limitations and
exclusions set forth above may not apply to you.</p>
<h1 id="14-governing-law-and-jurisdiction">14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h1>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales, excluding its
conflict of law provisions. Unless contrary to the law where you reside, all
disputes relating to this Agreement are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the courts of England and Wales and you expressly consent to the exercise of
personal jurisdiction in the courts of England and Wales in connection with any
such dispute. This Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</p>
<h1 id="15-general">15. General</h1>
<p>The Service is licensed, not sold, to you by New Vector Ltd for use strictly in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Ownership of the
Service shall at all times remain with New Vector Ltd. Access to the Service is
provided to you only to allow you to exercise your rights under this
Agreement.</p>
<h2 id="15-1-grant-of-licence">15.1 Grant of Licence</h2>
<p>Subject to your acceptance of, and compliance with, this Agreement and any
payment requirements for the Service (if applicable), New Vector Ltd hereby
grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable,
non-sublicensable licence, in and under our intellectual property rights, to
access and use the Services, solely in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features
provided by us that augment or enhance the current Service shall also
constitute &quot;Service&quot; and shall be subject to these terms and conditions. All
rights not expressly granted under this Agreement are retained by New Vector
Ltd.</p>
<p>You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when
you use other New Vector services, third party content or third party software.
If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the
Terms of Use, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision shall be
enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the
parties as reflected by that provision, and the remainder of the Terms of Use
shall continue in full force and effect. Any failure by New Vector to enforce
or exercise any provision of the Terms of Use or related right shall not
constitute a waiver of that right or provision. The section titles used in the
Terms of Use are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or
contractual effect.</p>

<p><strong>A note to other startups:</strong> this document was heavily inspired by <a href="https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/tos/">Balsamiq’s
plain English ToS document</a>. We were
impressed by their championing of plain English, and wanted to reproduce that
as much as possible in our own legal documentation. Feel free to draw similar
inspiration from this document, though be sure to get any documents you produce
checked over by a lawyer. Good luck!</p>
