<p>We have interns! In addition to Matrix.org's participation in Google Summer of Code, Element has funded two Outreachy interns to work on backend projects, and we're overjoyed to welcome the following folks to Matrix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shay (Outreachy) is focused on modernizing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent">Sydent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a>, our reference implementations of a Matrix Identity Server and a Matrix Push Gateway respectively.</li>

<li>Callum (GSoC) is working on adding support for restricting homeserver registration to users with pre-shared invite codes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Welcome Callum, Meenal, and Shay!</p>
<p>We're also working to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10062">unify and standardize the module API</a> which is used to extend Synapse, and your feedback would be very welcome. Similarly, if you have any experience with adding custom modules to Docker images or Debian packages and have thoughts on how we should best support that (or just examples of projects which do that well), please weigh in at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9944">#9944</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, we're looking forward to the release of Synapse 1.35 which will bring significant improvements to memory use during room joins, but that's for next week. üòâ</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:pixie.town">f0x</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a smart media worker/proxy, to offload initial spikes in traffic for homeservers behind slower network uplinks.</p>
<p>There's a <code>&lt;remote&gt;</code> component that sits on a small vps, handling the upload and download endpoints (and soon, thumbnails), with an in-memory cache to quickly respond to requests.
Media still gets forwarded to the <code>&lt;local&gt;</code> component where it gets stored in Synapse's media folder with an accompanying database entry, so all media is still stored long-term in the way Synapse expects it to be, so the proxy can be removed at any point. </p>
<p>Currently not production ready but you're welcome to snoop around the repo :)</p>
<p>https://git.pixie.town/f0x/synapse-media-proxy</p>

<p>Seems like quite a useful project! Other adventures in splitting out the media

<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks, some of you (well, frankly most of you) wanted to hear about our plans for libera.chat. I've been hard at work
this week building a brand new bridge which is hosted on the libera.chat homeserver and it's nearly ready to go. We're just making a few final
preparations before taking it out of beta, but it's currently available as a portaling bridge. You can currently reach any channel on libera.chat by joining
<code>#&lt;channel_name&gt;:libera.chat</code>. You can also add the homeserver to your room directory in your Matrix client to search all the bridged rooms.</p>
<p>We're also hanging out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libera-matrix:libera.chat">#libera-matrix:libera.chat</a>, if you have any questions. Of course, the bridge is proving to be very popular so please be patient :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definitely one of the most sought-after Matrix bridges lately.
Props to Half-Shot, Libera.Chat and everyone else for getting
it all together in such short notice.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="plumbing-irc-channels-older-wrench">Plumbing IRC channels üßë‚Äçüîß</h4>
<p>Somewhat experimental feature that has landed this week is the ability to use single puppeting in a public Matrix room to bridge IRC channels.</p>
<p>This support comes through a new <code>PLUMB</code> admin command for network rooms that will ask the bridge bot to join a public Matrix room and an IRC channel.</p>
<p>On IRC side there will be only a single user/bot that will relay messages from Matrix users. This is a stop-gap between fully puppeting Matrix users on IRC and doesn't need explicit permission from an IRC network to use by channel operators as long as bots are allowed.</p>
<p>On Matrix side puppets will join and leave based on their presence on the IRC channel. The bridge bot does not need any special permissions in a room as it doesn't do permission synchronization so it can be kept without any power levels.</p>
<p>Unplumbing a room is as simple as kicking the bridge out and it will take the puppets with it.</p>
<p>As this is a fairly new feature it does have some rough edges so feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>With all this said, if you're in the need to bridge any IRC channel on any network with little friction, Heisenbridge should have you covered!</p>
<h4 id="sasl-support-unloc">SASL support üîí</h4>
<p>If you're using Heisenbridge to connect to Libera.Chat from a network block that has SASL enforcement enabled (like some VPS providers) you can now configure SASL credentials to authenticate at connection time to bypass this restriction.</p>
<p>This only implements SASL PLAIN for now. Certificate authentication may be looked at in the future.</p>
<h4 id="but-that-s-not-all">But that's not all</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identd will now always provide a unique ident for everyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved detection for stalled connections</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IRC user ghosting issues fixed for good ü§û</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server TLS cert checking fixes, self-signed support</p>

bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week brings a variety of assorted bugfixes &amp; feature improvements in the <code>testing</code> branch. Included are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for <code>m.sticker</code> events for LINE stickers (with an option to use <code>m.image</code> if preferred)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear resolution of LINE emojis, and a config option to scale them (since they're tiny by default)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less frequent re-downloading of already-seen LINE stickers/emoji (there are limits to this, but it's still an improvement)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Option to disable syncing LINE stickers/emoji (in case re-hosting LINE imagery is a liability)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More reliable message syncing (should never get &quot;Decrypting message...&quot; or invisible images/stickers/emoji anymore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix crashes during inbound message &amp; read receipt syncing of multi-user rooms</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like last time, testing is much appreciated üòÄ</p>
<p>Remaining big tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rework message syncing so that receiving a message doesn't require &quot;viewing&quot; the LINE chat in the Puppeteer-controlled browser, which will make LINE send a read receipt even though you may not actually have read the message yourself (I mentioned this a while ago; it's still a todo)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for multiple bridge users at once (A public instance of the bridge will only be considered once multi-user support is ready)</p>

<p>Since <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/21/this-week-in-matrix-2021-05-21#fractal">last week</a>, a couple things landed in <code>fractal-next</code>.

K√©vin did an <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/759">internal restructuring of how we handle the SyncResponse in !759</a>.

He also switched from comrak to <a href="https://docs.rs/ruma/0.1.1/ruma/events/room/message/struct.TextMessageEventContent.html#method.markdown">ruma‚Äôs markdown</a> in <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/756">!756</a>.

<h3 id="element-client-updates">Element Client Updates</h3>
<p>Crafted by the <a href="https://element.io">Element</a> teams.</p>
<p><strong>Delight</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spaces: We‚Äôve been listening to, investigating, triaging and organising feedback from the beta so far. There‚Äôs a lot to get through, but thanks to everyone who has submitted feedback in-app in Element so far! The insight has been invaluable and is instrumental in shaping up our next milestones.</li>
<li>Papercuts: We‚Äôre also organising and fixing small issues throughout Element, biasing for highly visible issues which have the greatest impact and reach, affectionately titled ‚Äòpapercuts‚Äô. Expect more info on these soon, but for now a fun one to highlight is we‚Äôre implementing <a href="https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash">blurhash</a> on Web &amp; Android (with iOS to follow soon after) to improve previewing and viewing images, especially when on low bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Web</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1.7.29 released
<ul>
<li>Improved startup performance by focusing decryption on recent rooms</li>
<li>Fixed reaction duplication</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sorting out why we sometimes see &quot;<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9422#issuecomment-843366412">missing translations</a>&quot; hopefully for good this time</li>
<li>Continuing to improve application performance</li>
<li>Started work on Apple silicon desktop builds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We continued to work on technical subjects:
<ul>
<li>Stabilisation and performance improvements</li>
<li>New logging system. It will be possible to disable all logs for MatrixSDK, MatrixKit and Element-iOS</li>
<li>The code that manages application navigation in Element-iOS has been updated. It will allow us to add a slide menu to display things like user spaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Element Android 1.1.8 has been released on the beta track of the Google PlayStore. It will probably be pushed to production at the beginning of next week. The Android matrix SDK2 has also been released.</li>
<li>This week, we implemented the ability to change the network when looking in the room directory. Also gitter.im has been added to the default network list. See some screenshots in <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/3419">https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/3419</a> </li>
<li>Lots of improvements regarding Spaces have also landed to develop.</li>
<li>Besides that, we are still fixing issues and perform regular maintenance on the project</li>

<p>Dendrite is nearing beta! Today we will be cutting a candidate 0.1.0rc1 version after a week of hunting and fixing bugs. We are on track to release version 0.1.0 next week, at which point we will be inviting people to try installing and using Dendrite!</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initial sync is fixed after a bug caused us to fall back on incremental sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP header is now handled properly when MIME-formatted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal API calls over HTTP in polylith mode now use their own HTTP client with higher timeouts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now tries harder to find missing auth events, using fetcher workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer falls back on <code>/state</code> unnecessarily, which was the cause of a major memory leak and high CPU usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation HTTP calls now include the <code>User-Agent</code> header</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The event <code>depth</code> field is now ignored in the federation API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We now report the password change capability properly (thanks <a href="https://github.com/bn4t">bn4t</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registration flows now include the <code>completed</code> field after a failure (thanks <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug in the previous event updater in the roomserver has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where we didn't check our own old verify keys when verifying event signatures is fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where we didn't handle event ID domains being different to the event origin in earlier room versions has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLS fingerprints have been removed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 77%, same as last week</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, we updated some of our documentation and created a whole new set of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">easy first issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted">medium to hard issues</a> for contributors.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jason:zemos.net">Jason</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix Construct supports aarch64 (ARMv8) architectures. The experience has been phenomenal, with performance exceeding all expectations. Last week I wrote about all new vector code inside Construct using SSE through AVX-512 hardware acceleration in servers; that same code is now accelerated by SVE (Scalable Vector Extensions) on ARM architectures when you compile with clang.</p>
<p>This result is important: ARM virtual machines are offered at a significantly lower price compared to x86 from the same vendor. The systems are cheaper, require less power, but generally perform worse. The trick is to optimize the software for the weaker hardware. The benefit allows, for example, Matrix server hosts running Construct to make th eir profit margin from the lower TCO, getting more out of every computing cycle.</p>

<p>I made a Signal bridge using <a href="https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald">signald</a>.</p>
<p>Currently it supports bridging messages, reactions and signal read receipts. End-to-bridge encryption also exists (mautrix-python does all the work there). The bridge can be linked as a secondary device and possibly even registered as the main device, but I didn't actually test registering yet. Setup instructions are currently somewhat non-existent, but it's mostly the same as my other bridges plus signald as a separate daemon.</p>

Now we are working on improving performance when sending messages to rooms, and also improving global UX, especially of the home (rooms list). Search messages (in clear rooms for the moment) is coming soon, and it will be also possible to filter the room members list.</p>
<p>We will also spend some time on the new Android SDK, https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2, which is for the moment a quick extract of what we have in Element Android. We have to take care of it as a real product now: document it properly, set up CI, export Javadoc, develop a sample app, etc.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Signature verification has been updated to not fail if the event <code>origin</code> field is missing (although it still requires a signature from the domain of the <code>sender</code> field)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of places where we use SQL transactions have been updated with safe wrappers (thanks <a href="https://github.com/samcday">samcday</a>!)</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/22/synapse-1-20-0-released">1.20.0</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.1">1.20.1</a>) highlights include shadow banning support and including unread message counts in the sync response. This will help client developers and is a precursor to improving notification support.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also been looking at adding monitoring to get a better sense of which rooms are most expensive from a state resolution perspective, we also want a better way to track federation lag.</p>
<p>Up next we‚Äôll move all background tasks away from the main process and try it out on matrix.org, we are hoping for a 10-15% saving in CPU. Event persistence sharding, specifically the new stream token format is on hold slightly while we work on a nasty race condition on start up of the event persister. We hope to get back to the main sharding project next week.</p>

<h3 id="the-construct">The Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jason:zemos.net">Jason</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix concludes a summer of Construct where several transformative rounds of optimization took place. I'd like to talk about these achievements and why they are important for
future directions.</p>
<p>Over the summer, Construct introduced new vector extensions to the project. As server software, our primary target is the datacenter which (for now) is dominated by x86 hardware. The latest features of x86 chips include AVX-2, AVX-512, and on-die GPU. These advancements are important because they help mitigate current limitations of hardware, such as the cubic relationship between a processor's frequency and its power consumption. These limitations mean that CPU cores aren't completing more cycles-per-second every iteration of their development -- they're not getting much faster.</p>
<p>The problem with threads is that they can introduce a lot of complications to a project. Construct is able to forego multi-threading as a network server because it is primarily IO-bound. The benefits to a single-thread design in both performance and simplicity cannot be overstated. This is why Construct stands to benefit the most from features which allow more work to be accomplished at every individual computing cycle.</p>
<p>Construct undertook several endeavors over the summer which directly leverage platforms featuring SSE, AVX, AVX-512, etc. As an added bonus, our approach is designed to effortlessly port to ARM's Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) as it becomes available (inside datacenters too!). Our focus has been JSON, Unicode, and finally Base64. Detailed explanations for each of these will need to be discussed in their own posts, but in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Matrix specifies a canonical form of JSON which is not necessarily the same as the JSON the server receives. Therefor it is imperative that Construct is liberal with what JSON it accepts and correct with its transformation into canonical JSON. Over the summer, a portion of Construct's canonical transform received some optimization to go beyond the default method of character-by-character read-modify-write. As seen in [1], a streaming hardware-accelerated transform now processes at least 16 characters at a time (with more possible) without forward branching except for the parts where transformation needs to occur. One of these transformations is UTF-16 to UTF-8 surrogate conversion, which leads into the second endeavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construct introduced a completely branch-free Unicode toolset in [2]. Among the functions offered is a custom transform of UTF-16 surrogate pairs to UTF-8 sequences. Using the new vector registers, Construct can transform two UTF-16 surrogates in parallel to output two UTF-8 sequences, or two UTF-16 surrogates in a pair to output one UTF-8 sequence. Unfortunately, these specific functions were written at fixed vector widths, so more work needs to be done to really take advantage of the widest hardware. Each surrogate is 6 bytes, and a surrogate pair is 12 bytes; therefor we cannot make use of the last 4 bytes of a 16 byte vector. However, with a little more work this approach can be extended to a 64 byte vector, capable of decoding 5 surrogate pairs and 10 individual surrogates in parallel!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professor Daniel Lemire recently published a paper about fast Base64 from hardware acceleration in [3]. This approach is extremely elegant on the 64-byte-wide AVX-512 system. Prior to Construct's implementation of this in [4], the Boost library base64 encoding and decoding took roughly 20 and 25 cycles per character respectively. Our implementation on the same system, an old system with only SSE2 (not even AVX-512!) yields 5 and 6 cycles per character!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this helps lay a foundation for Construct to introduce Federated Media Rooms sometime in the future. Currently, Construct stores media in a separate database. Recently there's been work on a separate branch at [5] which stores actual file block inside events using Base64. It is for this reason sub-cycle and branchless JSON parsing and Base64 encoding is essential for maximum performance. The result is worthwhile, as the latency for querying the media database is slower than parsing and decoding the event content already in-hand.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Construct is available at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct</a> and don't forget to idle and perform <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:maunium.net">#construct:maunium.net</a></p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I present you a new project I've been working on for some time. It's a bot that allows you to use the admin API through matrix, by typing commands to the bot. The inspiration comes from the OperServ-like bots that allow IRC operators to administrate an IRC server.</p>
<p>The bot exposes some of the available admin APIs and aims to provide some more high level commands by combining different APIs. There is currently one &quot;high level command&quot;, <code>!room garbage-collect</code>, which allow you to purge from your HS all rooms without local users.</p>
<p>The project is written in crystal and is my first project in this language. It should be stable in normal conditions, but don't hesitate to fill issues. A Docker image is provided for more convenience.</p>

<p>This would allow other matrix clients on your phone to get their push
notifications through your gotify client, instead of needing to run a process
each. Great for battery life without proprietary Google blobs!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@js:nil.im">js</a> got Synapse running in a car on a German highway:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-09-25-njVLa-matrix_car.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the setup is a cigarette lighter to 2x 230V converter, one being used to power the RockPro64, the other being used to power my notebook. My notebook is connected to the hotspot from my phone, while also being connected to a USB ethernet, the other end of which is plugged into the RockPro64. </p>
<p>The notebook then acts as a gateway, as well as SSHing to a tiny VPS with -R, to get a public port, and forwarding that traffic to the RockPro64.</p>

<p>Maybe one day we'll all have an embedded Synapse homeserver in our cars. P2P E2EE

<h3 id="matrix-voip-tester">Matrix VoIP Tester</h3>

<p>I have been through the perils of setting up a TURN server and having VoIP continue to fail, whilst spending hours scratching my head and staring at Wireshark without getting anywhere. When I was given free reign over project choice last year during my internship, I chose to start a tool that tests your homeserver's VoIP configuration, hoping it would be useful to both me and the community at large.</p>
<p>It saw some progress but I never managed to iron out some of the 'last few things' or put a pretty front on it ‚Äî until about 2 weeks ago, when I got some more time to do it.</p>
<p>There are known issues ‚Äî such as the scores being very arbitrary, wrong and misleading; it crashes Chromium every time (on my machine) and it completely misbehaves in Brave Browser (on my machine). It may also not be the prettiest (but hopefully it is at least somewhat inoffensive). I hope to work on these annoying issues soon.</p>
<p>I have deployed a test instance at <a href="https://test.voip.librepush.net">https://test.voip.librepush.net</a> ‚Äî it can be tried in a WebRTC-supporting browser (probably Firefox if you want half a chance). Please don't take it to heart if you get a Fail or Poor score ‚Äî it's probably not your fault. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oliver was interning with us at Element this Summer. Fixing up and releasing
this VoIP tester was part of it, but he's still working on it in his spare
time even though his internship has finished :)</p>
<p>Through this I found out that I forgot to turn on my turnserver on my
homeserver again. Thanks Oliver!</p>

Synapse users are still allowed to join and <code>!ping</code>, but all the pongs will come from non-Synapse servers.</p>
<p>Based on observations in that room so far, the new server implementations don't like eachother very much.</p>

                <p>On April 14th, the Spec Core Team conducted a long-overdue retrospective
about the things that were working in the
<a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">Matrix Spec Proposal process</a>,
and those that were not.</p>
<p>The most glaring item on the list was the sluggish pace that many Matrix
Spec Changes (MSCs) take throughout the proposal process, as well as the
general lack of activity from the Spec Core Team members on proposals that
have not yet started a Final Comment Period.</p>
<p>We deeply apologize for the frustration this has likely caused many MSC
authors, and want to shed some light on the reasoning behind it, and what we
plan to do to prevent leaving authors in the dark about why there may be no
Spec Core Team activity on their proposal.</p>
<h2 id="proposal-triaging">Proposal Triaging</h2>
<p>There are currently 136 open MSCs that have yet to undergo Final Comment
Period (FCP), 75 of which are marked as proposal-in-review, and 20 that have
a FCP proposed. Relative to the 65 MSCs that have ever been closed, this is a
lot of outstanding ideas, features and maintenance changes.</p>
<p>The Spec Core Team itself is made up of 8 members, each of which have
separate full-time jobs. All team members are well-placed to be on the team
given their wide breadth of knowledge across the Matrix ecosystem,
however the majority are some of the most busy pushing forward Matrix's
reference implementations - without which, Matrix will unquestionably fail.
This limits the amount of MSCs that the team can effectively work on at a
given time.</p>
<p>The team understands that there are MSCs that provide incredibly useful
features, such as
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2191">support for LaTeX in messages</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">the ability to &quot;knock&quot; on rooms</a>,
and would undoubtedly like to see them land at some point.</p>
<p>But there is also a large backlog of MSCs that provide even more fundamental
fixes and additions to the protocol that the team needs to prioritise. These
include things like
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2472">cross-signing devices</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">the communities rewrite</a> and
finally merging
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849">reactions and edits</a> into the spec.</p>
<p>While we announce what MSCs we're focusing on during a given week during
<a href="https://matrix.org/twim">TWIM</a>, it's not as clear which items we're looking
to pull from the backlog next. To help tackle this, and to help keep us
honest, we've begun putting each MSC into either &quot;feature&quot;, &quot;maintenance&quot;, or
&quot;core&quot; buckets. This materialises in the form of github tags, which can be
used to filter the list of MSCs like so:
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%3Afeature">feature</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%3Amaintenance">maintenance</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%3Acore">core</a>.
For a given timespan, we‚Äôll pick a track and pull MSCs out of that category
when possible. More information about MSC categories are now detailed on
<a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals#categories">the proposals page</a>.</p>
<p>As for the next 6 to 12 months, we plan to work on items from the ‚Äúcore‚Äù
category. We need to get Matrix to a point where it can compete with other,
proprietary chat protocols and items in &quot;core&quot; are decidedly the proposals
that will take us the furthest in that direction. This doesn't mean we won't
occasionally look at an MSC in a different category, but it will heavily
influence our prioritisation.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>We'll try this approach out over the next few months and see how it goes. The
next Spec Core Team retro will occur in the middle of May, where we will
review the process once again.</p>
<p>For now, if you have any feedback please come and chat with us in
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> :)</p>

                <p>It‚Äôs that time of year again! Matrix.org is once again participating in the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> program. We have been allocated four student slots by Google this year, and narrowing the 18 proposals we received down to just four was a very difficult task.</p>
<p>In the end, we have decided on the following four students and their proposed projects:</p>
<p>Alexey Andreyev‚Äôs proposal involves adding end-to-end encryption to <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> for future support in Qt/libQMatrixClient-based clients such as <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral/">Spectral</a>. They will be mentored by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>, lead developer of libQMatrixClient, and our own end-to-end encryption expert, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg:matrix.org">uhoreg</a>.</p>
<p>Kai Hiller‚Äôs proposal for more reliable third-party protocol <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/bridges">bridges</a> includes adding the ability to notify the user when a message fails to reach its final destination despite being accepted by the bridge. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@half-shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>.</p>
<p>Eisha Chen-yen-su‚Äôs proposal for Matrix Visualisations aims to ‚Äúdevelop a tool which will visualise the event Directed Acyclic Graph data structure which describes the conversation history in a room. It will be a real-time visualisation of the DAG of a given Matrix room, as seen from the perspective of one or more HomeServers (HSes).‚Äù They state that ‚Äúthis tool will be useful for debugging or administration of Matrix HSes by making people able to easily see how the federation process works‚Äù. They have already posted prototypes of their tool in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gsoc:matrix.org">#gsoc:matrix.org</a>, and it‚Äôs all written in Rust! Which makes their mentor, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@erikj:jki.re">erikj</a>, very happy.</p>
<p>And finally, Cnly‚Äôs proposal for working towards completion of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>‚Äôs Client-Server API. The proposal also touches on general improvements to the codebase and increasing test coverage. Cnly will be mentored by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">babolivier</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the selected students. We look forward to participating with you on completing your project over the course of the summer holidays.</p>
<p>If your proposal was not selected, do not give up hope! Being an active member of the Matrix community and having a deep understanding of the ecosystem and its projects is a big part of what we look for when choosing candidates. If you stick around, you have a strong chance of being chosen in a subsequent year. </p>
<p>We will not be sharing individual‚Äôs proposal documents, but students are free to share them as they please.</p>
