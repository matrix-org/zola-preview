<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite is nearing beta! Today we will be cutting a candidate 0.1.0rc1 version after a week of hunting and fixing bugs. We are on track to release version 0.1.0 next week, at which point we will be inviting people to try installing and using Dendrite!</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initial sync is fixed after a bug caused us to fall back on incremental sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP header is now handled properly when MIME-formatted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal API calls over HTTP in polylith mode now use their own HTTP client with higher timeouts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now tries harder to find missing auth events, using fetcher workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer falls back on <code>/state</code> unnecessarily, which was the cause of a major memory leak and high CPU usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation HTTP calls now include the <code>User-Agent</code> header</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The event <code>depth</code> field is now ignored in the federation API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We now report the password change capability properly (thanks <a href="https://github.com/bn4t">bn4t</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registration flows now include the <code>completed</code> field after a failure (thanks <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug in the previous event updater in the roomserver has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where we didn't check our own old verify keys when verifying event signatures is fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where we didn't handle event ID domains being different to the event origin in earlier room versions has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLS fingerprints have been removed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 77%, same as last week</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, we updated some of our documentation and created a whole new set of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">easy first issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted">medium to hard issues</a> for contributors.</p>

<h3 id="the-construct">The Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jason:zemos.net">Jason</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix Construct supports aarch64 (ARMv8) architectures. The experience has been phenomenal, with performance exceeding all expectations. Last week I wrote about all new vector code inside Construct using SSE through AVX-512 hardware acceleration in servers; that same code is now accelerated by SVE (Scalable Vector Extensions) on ARM architectures when you compile with clang.</p>
<p>This result is important: ARM virtual machines are offered at a significantly lower price compared to x86 from the same vendor. The systems are cheaper, require less power, but generally perform worse. The trick is to optimize the software for the weaker hardware. The benefit allows, for example, Matrix server hosts running Construct to make th eir profit margin from the lower TCO, getting more out of every computing cycle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I made a Signal bridge using <a href="https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald">signald</a>.</p>
<p>Currently it supports bridging messages, reactions and signal read receipts. End-to-bridge encryption also exists (mautrix-python does all the work there). The bridge can be linked as a secondary device and possibly even registered as the main device, but I didn't actually test registering yet. Setup instructions are currently somewhat non-existent, but it's mostly the same as my other bridges plus signald as a separate daemon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week released <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/releases/tag/v1.7.8">v1.7.8</a></p>
<p>Highlights include</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Secure Backup has been moved out of the registration flow to a toast when you first encounter an E2EE room, which simplifies the new user experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added options to hide various UI features when hosting a custom Element</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from that we continue to improve on widget support for resizable widgets, modal widgets and generally making widgets better.</p>
<p>We are also continuing to work on instrumenting the app, improving mobile support for matrix.to and making jitsi calling more reliable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Element Android: Version 1.0.8 is now available on the stores, it fixes issues with verification and PIN code among other issues (see <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/releases/tag/v1.0.8">https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/releases/tag/v1.0.8</a> for more details). Now we are working on improving performance when sending messages to rooms, and also improving global UX, especially of the home (rooms list). Search messages (in clear rooms for the moment) is coming soon, and it will be also possible to filter the room members list.</p>
<p>We will also spend some time on the new Android SDK, https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2, which is for the moment a quick extract of what we have in Element Android. We have to take care of it as a real product now: document it properly, set up CI, export Javadoc, develop a sample app, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>t2bot.io has crossed 1M monthly active users</p>
<p>All of these users are Telegram/Discord users that have been brought into Matrix over the last 30 days. This doesn't appear to be a temporary spike either: over the last 8 weeks t2bot.io has been hovering at 900-950 thousand monthly active users, up from 600-700 thousand. Record-setting traffic levels have also been achieved, with matrix.org being able to keep up for the first time in a long while.</p>
<p>Overall it's a good sign to see so many communities making the jump to Matrix and sticking around ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has mostly been spent trying to improve stability and to fix bugs ahead of the beta release, which is so far still planned to go ahead in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Room version 6 is now the default for newly created rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soft-fail of events that aren't allowed by the current room state is now implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for configuring <code>old_verify_keys</code> has been added to the Dendrite config</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correct formatting for signing key IDs is now enforced in the configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initial support for peeking over federation (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2444">MSC2444</a>) is in progress and it &quot;even works!&quot; (thanks Matthew!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federated joins will now continue being processed even if the client gives up on the join due to a HTTP timeout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backoff code has been refactored a bit more, and now correctly affects device list syncing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/make_join</code> now errors correctly if a federated user tries to join a room which all members have left</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where a single user could start multiple simultaneous federated joins to the same room has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some initial (but unfinished) support for the <code>/key/v2/query</code> notary endpoint has been added</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signature verification has been updated to not fail if the event <code>origin</code> field is missing (although it still requires a signature from the domain of the <code>sender</code> field)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of places where we use SQL transactions have been updated with safe wrappers (thanks <a href="https://github.com/samcday">samcday</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A couple of error codes on invite endpoints for room version 6 JSON violations have been fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly for federation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 77%, up from 74% last week</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/22/synapse-1-20-0-released">1.20.0</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.1">1.20.1</a>) highlights include shadow banning support and including unread message counts in the sync response. This will help client developers and is a precursor to improving notification support.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also been looking at adding monitoring to get a better sense of which rooms are most expensive from a state resolution perspective, we also want a better way to track federation lag.</p>
<p>Up next we‚Äôll move all background tasks away from the main process and try it out on matrix.org, we are hoping for a 10-15% saving in CPU. Event persistence sharding, specifically the new stream token format is on hold slightly while we work on a nasty race condition on start up of the event persister. We hope to get back to the main sharding project next week.</p>

<h3 id="the-construct">The Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jason:zemos.net">Jason</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix concludes a summer of Construct where several transformative rounds of optimization took place. I'd like to talk about these achievements and why they are important for
future directions.</p>
<p>Over the summer, Construct introduced new vector extensions to the project. As server software, our primary target is the datacenter which (for now) is dominated by x86 hardware. The latest features of x86 chips include AVX-2, AVX-512, and on-die GPU. These advancements are important because they help mitigate current limitations of hardware, such as the cubic relationship between a processor's frequency and its power consumption. These limitations mean that CPU cores aren't completing more cycles-per-second every iteration of their development -- they're not getting much faster.</p>
<p>The problem with threads is that they can introduce a lot of complications to a project. Construct is able to forego multi-threading as a network server because it is primarily IO-bound. The benefits to a single-thread design in both performance and simplicity cannot be overstated. This is why Construct stands to benefit the most from features which allow more work to be accomplished at every individual computing cycle.</p>
<p>Construct undertook several endeavors over the summer which directly leverage platforms featuring SSE, AVX, AVX-512, etc. As an added bonus, our approach is designed to effortlessly port to ARM's Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) as it becomes available (inside datacenters too!). Our focus has been JSON, Unicode, and finally Base64. Detailed explanations for each of these will need to be discussed in their own posts, but in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Matrix specifies a canonical form of JSON which is not necessarily the same as the JSON the server receives. Therefor it is imperative that Construct is liberal with what JSON it accepts and correct with its transformation into canonical JSON. Over the summer, a portion of Construct's canonical transform received some optimization to go beyond the default method of character-by-character read-modify-write. As seen in [1], a streaming hardware-accelerated transform now processes at least 16 characters at a time (with more possible) without forward branching except for the parts where transformation needs to occur. One of these transformations is UTF-16 to UTF-8 surrogate conversion, which leads into the second endeavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construct introduced a completely branch-free Unicode toolset in [2]. Among the functions offered is a custom transform of UTF-16 surrogate pairs to UTF-8 sequences. Using the new vector registers, Construct can transform two UTF-16 surrogates in parallel to output two UTF-8 sequences, or two UTF-16 surrogates in a pair to output one UTF-8 sequence. Unfortunately, these specific functions were written at fixed vector widths, so more work needs to be done to really take advantage of the widest hardware. Each surrogate is 6 bytes, and a surrogate pair is 12 bytes; therefor we cannot make use of the last 4 bytes of a 16 byte vector. However, with a little more work this approach can be extended to a 64 byte vector, capable of decoding 5 surrogate pairs and 10 individual surrogates in parallel!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professor Daniel Lemire recently published a paper about fast Base64 from hardware acceleration in [3]. This approach is extremely elegant on the 64-byte-wide AVX-512 system. Prior to Construct's implementation of this in [4], the Boost library base64 encoding and decoding took roughly 20 and 25 cycles per character respectively. Our implementation on the same system, an old system with only SSE2 (not even AVX-512!) yields 5 and 6 cycles per character!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this helps lay a foundation for Construct to introduce Federated Media Rooms sometime in the future. Currently, Construct stores media in a separate database. Recently there's been work on a separate branch at [5] which stores actual file block inside events using Base64. It is for this reason sub-cycle and branchless JSON parsing and Base64 encoding is essential for maximum performance. The result is worthwhile, as the latency for querying the media database is slower than parsing and decoding the event content already in-hand.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Construct is available at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct</a> and don't forget to idle and perform <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:maunium.net">#construct:maunium.net</a></p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I present you a new project I've been working on for some time. It's a bot that allows you to use the admin API through matrix, by typing commands to the bot. The inspiration comes from the OperServ-like bots that allow IRC operators to administrate an IRC server.</p>
<p>The bot exposes some of the available admin APIs and aims to provide some more high level commands by combining different APIs. There is currently one &quot;high level command&quot;, <code>!room garbage-collect</code>, which allow you to purge from your HS all rooms without local users.</p>
<p>The project is written in crystal and is my first project in this language. It should be stable in normal conditions, but don't hesitate to fill issues. A Docker image is provided for more convenience.</p>

<p>I have been through the perils of setting up a TURN server and having VoIP continue to fail, whilst spending hours scratching my head and staring at Wireshark without getting anywhere. When I was given free reign over project choice last year during my internship, I chose to start a tool that tests your homeserver's VoIP configuration, hoping it would be useful to both me and the community at large.</p>
<p>It saw some progress but I never managed to iron out some of the 'last few things' or put a pretty front on it ‚Äî until about 2 weeks ago, when I got some more time to do it.</p>
<p>There are known issues ‚Äî such as the scores being very arbitrary, wrong and misleading; it crashes Chromium every time (on my machine) and it completely misbehaves in Brave Browser (on my machine). It may also not be the prettiest (but hopefully it is at least somewhat inoffensive). I hope to work on these annoying issues soon.</p>

                <p>On April 14th, the Spec Core Team conducted a long-overdue retrospective
about the things that were working in the
<a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">Matrix Spec Proposal process</a>,
and those that were not.</p>
<p>The most glaring item on the list was the sluggish pace that many Matrix
Spec Changes (MSCs) take throughout the proposal process, as well as the
general lack of activity from the Spec Core Team members on proposals that
have not yet started a Final Comment Period.</p>
<p>We deeply apologize for the frustration this has likely caused many MSC
authors, and want to shed some light on the reasoning behind it, and what we
plan to do to prevent leaving authors in the dark about why there may be no
Spec Core Team activity on their proposal.</p>
<h2 id="proposal-triaging">Proposal Triaging</h2>
<p>There are currently 136 open MSCs that have yet to undergo Final Comment
Period (FCP), 75 of which are marked as proposal-in-review, and 20 that have
a FCP proposed. Relative to the 65 MSCs that have ever been closed, this is a
lot of outstanding ideas, features and maintenance changes.</p>
<p>The Spec Core Team itself is made up of 8 members, each of which have
separate full-time jobs. All team members are well-placed to be on the team
given their wide breadth of knowledge across the Matrix ecosystem,
however the majority are some of the most busy pushing forward Matrix's
reference implementations - without which, Matrix will unquestionably fail.
This limits the amount of MSCs that the team can effectively work on at a
given time.</p>
<p>The team understands that there are MSCs that provide incredibly useful
features, such as
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2191">support for LaTeX in messages</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">the ability to &quot;knock&quot; on rooms</a>,
and would undoubtedly like to see them land at some point.</p>
<p>But there is also a large backlog of MSCs that provide even more fundamental
fixes and additions to the protocol that the team needs to prioritise. These
include things like
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2472">cross-signing devices</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">the communities rewrite</a> and
finally merging
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849">reactions and edits</a> into the spec.</p>
<p>While we announce what MSCs we're focusing on during a given week during
<a href="https://matrix.org/twim">TWIM</a>, it's not as clear which items we're looking
to pull from the backlog next. To help tackle this, and to help keep us
honest, we've begun putting each MSC into either &quot;feature&quot;, &quot;maintenance&quot;, or
&quot;core&quot; buckets. This materialises in the form of github tags, which can be
used to filter the list of MSCs like so:
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%3Afeature">feature</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%3Amaintenance">maintenance</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%3Acore">core</a>.
For a given timespan, we‚Äôll pick a track and pull MSCs out of that category
when possible. More information about MSC categories are now detailed on
<a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals#categories">the proposals page</a>.</p>
<p>As for the next 6 to 12 months, we plan to work on items from the ‚Äúcore‚Äù
category. We need to get Matrix to a point where it can compete with other,
proprietary chat protocols and items in &quot;core&quot; are decidedly the proposals
that will take us the furthest in that direction. This doesn't mean we won't
occasionally look at an MSC in a different category, but it will heavily
influence our prioritisation.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>We'll try this approach out over the next few months and see how it goes. The
next Spec Core Team retro will occur in the middle of May, where we will
review the process once again.</p>
<p>For now, if you have any feedback please come and chat with us in

                <p>It‚Äôs that time of year again! Matrix.org is once again participating in the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> program. We have been allocated four student slots by Google this year, and narrowing the 18 proposals we received down to just four was a very difficult task.</p>
<p>In the end, we have decided on the following four students and their proposed projects:</p>
<p>Alexey Andreyev‚Äôs proposal involves adding end-to-end encryption to <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> for future support in Qt/libQMatrixClient-based clients such as <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral/">Spectral</a>. They will be mentored by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>, lead developer of libQMatrixClient, and our own end-to-end encryption expert, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg:matrix.org">uhoreg</a>.</p>
<p>Kai Hiller‚Äôs proposal for more reliable third-party protocol <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/bridges">bridges</a> includes adding the ability to notify the user when a message fails to reach its final destination despite being accepted by the bridge. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@half-shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>.</p>
<p>Eisha Chen-yen-su‚Äôs proposal for Matrix Visualisations aims to ‚Äúdevelop a tool which will visualise the event Directed Acyclic Graph data structure which describes the conversation history in a room. It will be a real-time visualisation of the DAG of a given Matrix room, as seen from the perspective of one or more HomeServers (HSes).‚Äù They state that ‚Äúthis tool will be useful for debugging or administration of Matrix HSes by making people able to easily see how the federation process works‚Äù. They have already posted prototypes of their tool in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gsoc:matrix.org">#gsoc:matrix.org</a>, and it‚Äôs all written in Rust! Which makes their mentor, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@erikj:jki.re">erikj</a>, very happy.</p>
<p>And finally, Cnly‚Äôs proposal for working towards completion of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>‚Äôs Client-Server API. The proposal also touches on general improvements to the codebase and increasing test coverage. Cnly will be mentored by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">babolivier</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the selected students. We look forward to participating with you on completing your project over the course of the summer holidays.</p>
<p>If your proposal was not selected, do not give up hope! Being an active member of the Matrix community and having a deep understanding of the ecosystem and its projects is a big part of what we look for when choosing candidates. If you stick around, you have a strong chance of being chosen in a subsequent year. </p>
<p>We will not be sharing individual‚Äôs proposal documents, but students are free to share them as they please.</p>
