<p>This week Neil and Matthew are talking about recent security issues - this is a really long and detailed chat, but you can skip to around the 32 minute mark to hear about other news - including progress on reactions. Reminder that for a good &quot;big picture&quot; overview of the progress of Matrix, you can look at the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/9">Homeserver High Level Roadmap</a>.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Neil, Synapse-dev wrangler:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reactions continues at full speed, we have a draft PR and will be implementing over the coming week. The ability to blacklist IPs over federation will land imminently, as well as a nasty device management bug that led to a spate of E2E errors. Next week is all about Reactions, resuming work on the small homeserver project and finally getting back to Synapse 1.0 blockers following all the remediation drama of the past few weeks. With any luck weâ€™ll have a new Synapse release for you next week.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a> received a configuration file. The configuration file adds the ability to configure multiple Homeservers and pantalaimon will run having each Homeserver exposed on a different TCP port.</li>
<li>The panctl utility has received support for more commands, it now has the ability to accept SAS requests, confirm them, import/export keys, list pan users as well as list devices of users. Completions for the commands were also added.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the development pace has been reduced lately, the Fractal team managed to make significant progress towards the 4.2 release. More specifically since our previous news, Chris has landed much of his adaptive view work to get Fractal in a mobile friendly state so itâ€™s ready to run on the Librem 5 once Purism starts shipping them. But he didnâ€™t stop there: eager to see his awesome work in the hands of many people (figuratively, the literal application will have to wait for the phone to be out ðŸ˜›) as soon as possible, he tackled a few bugs that we really wanted to get sorted out before we got a new version out.</p>
<p>Alexandre also <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/commit/152255031400049a30667c581c0dc31a4ef03146">prepared the changelog</a> with a birdâ€™s-eye view of all changes that happened since 4.0.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we had a few external contributions for features such as network proxy support and typing notifications.</p>

<h3 id="new-hangouts-bridge-from-tulir-mautrix">New Hangouts bridge from tulir / mautrix</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been using his <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python">mautrix-python</a> lib, which was recently used to enable his <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> bridge, to bring a new method for Matrix-Hangouts bridging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New bridge again, this time it's Hangouts: https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#hangouts:maunium.net">#hangouts:maunium.net</a>. As with the Messenger bridge, currently the main difference to matrix-puppet-hangouts is multi-user support (also no hacky JS/Python mixing).</p>
<p>Before making mautrix-hangouts, I put a bunch of the generic bridging parts of mautrix-facebook into mautrix-python's bridge module and used that in both bridges. After Debian 10 is released, I'll drop Python 3.5 compatibility in mautrix-telegram and move it to use mautrix-python and the bridge module too.</p>
<p>Next week I'm planning on adding a bunch of features to both my new bridges, such as bridging formatting and remaining media types (so no new bridges planned for now :D).</p>

<h3 id="qmatrixclient-is-now-quotient">QMatrixClient is now &quot;Quotient&quot;</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vote on a new name for the QMatrixClient project has been going on over the past week.<br />
<strong>We have a winner now, and the new name is &quot;Quotient&quot;!</strong> In the nearest weeks, expect changes in the library code (it's going to be libQuotient from the next release), room aliases (already ongoing), links to the repos etc. etc. Where possible, we're going to smoothen the migration path by providing legacy fallbacks (e.g., the new C++ namespace, Quotient, will be introduced but the old one, QMatrixClient, will stay its synonym, although deprecated).<br />
Just in case you missed all the previous mentions of the topic - it's only related to the overall project and the library, but not the client - its name remains Quaternion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why rename?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the previous name has been a bit clumsy and, most importantly, the project is no more focusing just on client-side but on a wider set of applications of Matrix (no homeserver in plans though). See also the recent backlog of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#qmatrixclient:matrix.org">#qmatrixclient:matrix.org</a> (now also <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#quotient:matrix.org">#quotient:matrix.org</a>) earlier this week for the whole discussion</p>

<p><a href="http://opsdroid.readthedocs.io/">Opsdroid</a> 0.15 has been released, with <em>a lot</em> of matrix focused updates.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:feneas.org">jaywink</a>, maintainer of <a href="https://the-federation.info">https://the-federation.info</a>, told us what we all know to be true: Matrix is great and is getting more popular:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrix (Synapse) jumps to second place in <a href="https://the-federation.info">https://the-federation.info</a> site, which lists servers of the federated social web. Help us map the true size of the Matrixverse by adding your server by going a <code>https://the-federation.info/register/yourdomain.tld</code>. Note, SRV and well-known lookups not yet working, so registration needs to happen with the Matrix server real domain (and port if any).</p>

<p>Big release for Quaternion this week, following lots of work on <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a>. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> reports that:</p>
<p>Quaternion is now officially at version 0.0.9.4! Optional native scrollbar for the timeline, files uploading, initial support of matrix.to links (the foundation for future Matrix URIs), first complete translations, and much much more - the long list is here: https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.9.4. Packagers are advised to take a look at the building and packaging section of the release notes: there are a few updates for you there.</p>
<h2 id="spectral">Spectral</h2>
<p>Continuing the QT-client theme, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> has released a new version of <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a> to FlatHub, join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#spectral:matrix.org">#spectral:matrix.org</a> for more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version of Spectral is released on Flathub this week! The last release is half a year ago, and there are a lot of changes since then, including a better UI, bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Changelog:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>Increase minimum Qt version to 5.12.
</span><span>Redesigned UI.
</span><span>Emoji and username auto completion in text input.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We (<a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</a>) are looking for a new maintainer!</p>
<p>What are we looking for in a maintainer?<br />
You wouldn't have to be super active, however a few minutes per day would be greatly appreciated. You'd be responsible of reviewing PRs! Because of this not being afraid of Typescript and not being afraid of Discord is required - no need to be at pro-level!</p>
<p>So we are basically looking for someone who can help us look over PRs and maybe do some themself. If you think you are interested, please message us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discord:half-shot.uk">our matrix room</a>!</p>

<h3 id="bridging-facebook-messenger">Bridging Facebook Messenger</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made a new Facebook Messenger bridge: https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#facebook:maunium.net">#facebook:maunium.net</a>. Currently the main difference to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-facebook">matrix-puppet-facebook</a> is multi-user support like my WhatsApp and Telegram bridges. The bridge is Python and the code structure is similar to <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>, so I'll probably eventually create a generic bridge library out of the common parts.</p>

<h2 id="sdks-and-frameworks">SDKs and Frameworks</h2>
<h3 id="ruby-sdk">Ruby SDK</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ananace/">Ananace</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Working on the <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby SDK</a> again, planning to try and get it to the point where I feel comfortable calling it a provisionary 1.0 release. I want to propose additions to various software using it after all, and that tends to look better if it's 1.0 - or close. ðŸ˜ƒ</p>

<h2 id="synapse-the-road-to-1-0">Synapse, the road to 1.0</h2>
<p>Neil, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">Synapse</a> overlord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week we carried on with Synapse 1.0 work, in particular <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4364">server key signing validity</a>, a config option to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4967">verify federation certificates</a> to support MSC1711 and support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4982">3PID unbinding APIs</a> (MSC1915). Outside of that we've been thinking about how to improve room upgrades for private rooms and landed the preparatory work for a refactor of the room directory.</p>
<p>Coming up next, we'll continue to bash out 1.0 blockers, Hawkowl has started work on optimising for small hosted homeservers, and anoa will be working on the new super fast room directory. Finally Erik has started work on aggregations support so clients will be able to offer things like edits and reactions ?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com/">https://www.arewereadyyet.com/</a> is now just shy of 64%, keep going.</p>

<h2 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/pull/541">Dockerfile for sytest</a> running against Dendrite approved. Close to being able to run Dendrite against sytest. Also using sytest's new test white/blacklist functionality to include a list of tests that Dendrite is known to pass in the repo. When people make new PRs that allow Dendrite to pass new tests, they can also append the names of the tests to the testfile to help automatically track Dendrite's improving progress. Look forward to seeing further progress post Synapse 1.0.</p>

<h2 id="net-core-synchrotron">.NET Core Synchrotron</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This weekend I took a brief pause from doing matrix work, and then went back into it by finishing the feature set for the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/synapse-netcore-workers/pull/48">.NET Core Synchrotron</a>. It's &quot;feature complete&quot; meaning all specced features of sync are in this branch, excluding legacy endpoints. There are a few bugs logged against it and it's really only useful as a super early test, while I fix some of the p1 bugs.</p>
<p>The federation sender continues to be reliable and stable, and we are prepping for the release of synapse 0.99.3 which made a few changes to the replication stream. For more info, please see <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/synapse-netcore-workers">https://github.com/turt2live/synapse-netcore-workers</a></p>

<h2 id="pattle-has-now-moved-to-flutter">Pattle has now moved to Flutter</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a> has officially discontinued the previous version of Pattle, and is focused on their Flutter SDK and new version of Pattle based on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After some silence here but a lot of development, Pattle has now moved to Flutter. The new app is available in the same F-droid repository, you can just update. Note that you will have to log in again. If there are issues with updating, try removing the old app and installing the new one.</p>
<p>Also note that this version is still very basic and does not have all features of the old Pattle unfortunately. The reason that I chose to already replace it on the repo is that the old app will not receive updates anymore.</p>
<p>The current features are logging in and an overview of all chats. What <em>is</em> new is that data is now stored locally, so you won't have to do an initial sync everytime you open the app (which was the case with old app). What's also new is that I've decided to use more red, because.. I like red.</p>
<p>There is still a lot to do! Please notify me of anything that you think is missing, even though some things may be obvious (sorting chats based on date, chat avatars), some may not be as obvious to me!</p>
<p>If you'd like to contribute, the new repo is <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app">here</a>. Note that many contributions will probably start at the SDK level. Pattle uses my own Dart SDK, which you can find <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/library/matrix-dart-sdk">here</a>.</p>
<p>There is at the moment a very specific bug in Flutter, where on Android 7.1 with release builds, the app crashes when building a list widget. If you use Android 7.1 (like me) and you crash after logging in, that's the reason. It seems I can't do anything about it, sorry.</p>

<p>Aqueous now comes with room categories and history messages support.
Also, a lot of code refactoring is going on to change the backend store from plain json file to sqlite, which should improve the performance a lot.

<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Neil, Synapse overseer, reports on the acceleration towards <em>1.0</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have much improved sytest support for Synapse worker mode, Hawkowl landed a brand new super fast super shiny user directory implementation, Brendan fixed a bunch of niggles in <a href="/federationtester">the federation tester</a> and we <em>finally</em> got to the bottom of our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4956">sync caching bug that obscured accepting invites</a> (thanks richvdh for sticking with it). Erik solved our presence spamming bug and anoa fixed some LDAP auth bugs and submitted a PR for certificate checking - one of our final blockers for Synapse 1.0. For all the latest checkout out our latest release candidate <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.3rc1">0.99.3rc1</a>.<br />
Next week, we'll ship 0.99.3, we'll be looking at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4364">server key validity periods</a>, adding a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1915">3PID unbind API</a> and starting work on tuning low powered Synapse installations.<br />
<a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com/">https://www.arewereadyyet.com/</a> is still rising so keep banging to everyone you know that they ensure their federation certificates are valid.</p>

<h2 id="pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/poljar">poljar</a> gave this update on his new project <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a> is a new project that acts as a reverse proxy for clients to connect to. Once a client is connected Pantalaimon handles end to end encryption for the client transparently.<br />
The project is only a week old but already at a working prototype phase. A demo can be found here: <a href="http://webmshare.com/play/Qn4wg">http://webmshare.com/play/Qn4wg</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a huge gain! Use of this project, as you will see in the video, permits any Matrix client to support End-to-End encryption of messages, by handling encryption/decryption in a daemon rather than in the client.</p>
<p><a href="http://webmshare.com/play/Qn4wg">Watch the video</a>, and you'll see <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a>, which does not support encryption, chatting in an encrypted room.

<h2 id="construct">Construct</h2>
<p>Report from the Construct team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The matrix Construct server has made significant progress this week implementing the 1.0 specification and is very close to a 1.0 release! Special thanks to our star tester Yan Minari and expert Matrix consultants Tulir and Max and C++ developers Jason of Zemos and Mujx of nheko for all their hard work to make this happen. The Construct now fully supports IPv6 and is ready to participate in fully end-to-to-end encrypted ipv6 networks like <code>#yggdrasil:matrix.org</code> and <code>#cjdns:matrix.org</code>.<br />This week also saw additions for .well-known support, <code>m.fully_read</code> and even DNS caching inside a matrix room shared between servers (which is really cool if you ask me).</p>
<p>I'd like to recognize our testers for their invaluable contributions this week, only a fraction of which are documented here: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/issues">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/issues</a> leading to the 1.0 release.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Construct is written in C++ for maximum performance and scalability. It is the first fully federating server after the Synapse reference implementation. Your contributions in code and participation are essential to bring Construct to its upcoming release; get involved at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct</a> and in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#zemos-test:matrix.org">#zemos-test:matrix.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="riot-web">Riot Web</h2>
<p>From the team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've been upgrading and optimising our Jitsi instance so people should see more reliable video conference calls, especially if they avoid connecting from Firefox over poor connections.<br />We've been squashing scroll jumps (where the timeline pops out of position unexpectedly due to images loading, etc.). We've come up with a radical reimplementation of the timeline (which should be imperceptible, except it doesn't jump) - try it out on <a href="https://riot.im/develop">https://riot.im/develop</a> now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bruno, who has been working on scroll functional for Riot deserves a call-out - scrolling in new Riot web works great, and he may now be the most qualified dev on <code>scroll: anchor</code> outside of Mozilla or Googleâ€¦</p>
<p>You can now get all Riot updates from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#riot-web-announcements:matrix.org">#riot-web-announcements:matrix.org</a>, the official room of Riot web announcements! You can especially get this update, which was also featured on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Attention Riot Web Admins! We reset Scalar tokens to address a potential security vuln. with some clients - if you run your own Riot instance please upgrade to at least v1.0.4 to keep using integrations (widgets, sticker picker, any bots and bridges configured through Scalar).</p>

<p>Quick note that nheko (v 0.6.3) is now packaged for FreeBSD as well. The C++ code was fine (we use Clang, that does trip up some people) but I have Opinions about the CMake code (in particular that the find code for nlohmann/json.hpp, lmdb++.h and tweeny.h could use a lot of work -- if I feel perky I may come up with a PR).

<p>Neil, Synapse-dev wrangler #1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Huge thanks to everyone who has helped increase the number of â€˜1.0 ready' synapse installs. If you don't know what this means, <a href="/blog/2019/03/15/matrix-1-0-https-arewereadyyet-com/">see our blog</a>. <a href="https://arewereadyyet.com">https://arewereadyyet.com</a> reports &gt; 60% adoption on a per server basis, and high 90s on a per user basis. We are now really close to being able to ship a 1.0 release candidate and start the 2 week countdown before releasing 1.0 proper.</p>
<p>This week we have focussed on performance, richvdh has been working on batching of outgoing read receipts and hawkowl shipped a much more performant implementation of user search. Erik has been putting the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/rust-synapse-compress-state">state compressor</a> through its paces, he saw one room compress down to 1% of its original size. Andrew has been focusing on ensuring spec compliance on various Synapse endpoints and is currently looking at some bugs in the federation tester.</p>

<p>As part of the project, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a> also announced the intention to create a Dart SDK:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm currently working on a <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/library/matrix-dart-sdk">Matrix SDK for Dart</a>, which will be used for the <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app">Pattle rewrite in Flutter</a>.
The reason for this is outlined <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/android#future">here</a>. To summarize: My goal for Pattle is to release for not only Android but also iOS and web, with a single code base. Other reasons include that Android native development is just bad, and the fact that I'm not too happy with the official Matrix Android SDK design and documentation.
I will maintain and also add some features to the current version of Pattle, to try things out. The Flutter version will replace the native one once the features are in sync.</p>

<h2 id="dimension-sticker-packs">Dimension sticker packs</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> has introduced sticker packs for <a href="https://dimension.t2bot.io/">Dimension</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dimension now has beta support for custom sticker packs. To create a sticker pack:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
 	<li>Start a conversation with @stickers:t2bot.io</li>
 	<li>Say <code>!stickers newpack</code> and follow the prompts.</li>
 	<li>Share the URL with your friends.</li>
</ol>
To add the sticker pack to your sticker picker:
<ol>
 	<li>Make sure you're using Dimension as your integration manager.
<ul>
 	<li>Not sure if you are? Click the 4 squares in the top right of the room in Riot - if the dialog is titled "Dimension", you're all set :)</li>
 	<li>If you aren't, check out <a href="https://dimension.t2bot.io">https://dimension.t2bot.io</a></li>

 	<li>Click on the smiley face to the right of where you type messages then the Edit button in the top right.</li>
 	<li>Paste the URL of the sticker pack into the box and click "Add Stickerpack".</li>
 	<li>Start using your new stickers.</li>
</ol>

<p>These instructions are also available at <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension/blob/master/docs/custom_stickerpacks.md">https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension/blob/master/docs/custom_stickerpacks.md</a> as is the admin/operator guide for running your own sticker bot (you're not stuck with using t2bot.io unless you want to be).<br />Custom sticker packs are still beta while the proposals to share this with the wider Matrix ecosystem are still works in progress. This serves as a proof of concept to see how crazy of an idea it is to have stickerpacks-as-rooms (yes, they're just plain Matrix rooms under the hood) and what needs ironing out before moving ahead with the MSC.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-notification-profile-manager">matrix-notification-profile-manager</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a> has created a notification profile manager:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past few weeks, I grew a bit fed up of always having to turn on and off every notification rule each time I'm having a slight change in what I'm working on or depending on what mood I was in (e.g. want to focus only on work-related stuff and nothing else, don't want to hear about work at all, somewhere in the middle, etc.), so I built a <a href="https://github.com/babolivier/matrix-notification-profile-manager">notification profile manager for Matrix</a>. It's available both as a command line interface or a Go package in case people want to build on top of it.</p>
<p>It allows one to take a snapshot of their current notifications settings and save that as a profile, so that this profile can be applied later. It also allows one to delete a profile or list the existing profiles (more features to be added as time goes by). In order to make the whole thing interoperable with other projects building on top of the Go package, it also uses the user's account data on the user's Matrix homeserver to store profiles.</p>

Actual Matrix integration will come when the gui components are ready.</p>
<p>Neo is now partly integrated with <code>matrix-js-sdk</code> because I grew tired of having to write my own mock events. There's a basic authentication flow, with 0 error handling, and parsing of <code>m.text</code> and <code>m.image</code> events</p>

<p>This React Native client is not announced so <a href="https://github.com/limvot/bubbles">don't look at it</a></p>
<p>My pal Doug shared his frustration with the broader state of the chat ecosystem after <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/hottest-chat-app-teens-google-docs/584857/">reading that teens now use Google Docs for their chat needs</a> (and not the chat feature, the document itself!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love that you've got Amazon with their Alexa messaging, Apple in their own bubble with iMessage, Facebook doing chat 3-ways and Google trying 50 ways to do chat. And that's before you even get into things like Slack, Discord, Telegram, Riot, Line, WeChat etc etc. And then the current hot way to chat is in a document...
I mean, <strong>how much money is being invested in trying to create the perfect chat solution?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a> announced <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/android">Pattle</a>, a Matrix client for Android:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey all, I've been working on my Matrix Android app, Pattle! The goal of Pattle is to be an easy to use app for Matrix, with it's design inspired by popular apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram. <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/android">Development happens here</a>, and contributions are encouraged! The app is not currently suited for daily use, but some functionality is there, such as registering, logging in and viewing chats.
Currently it's an Android only app using the official Matrix Android SDK, but the plan is to support iOS and web too, in the future.
There's also a sort of <a href="https://docs.pattle.im/design/philosophy/">design document</a> available, stating how Pattle differs from standard Matrix apps and what it's goals are. The intent of the design document is to make development easier later on for other platforms</p>

Translators are still strongly encouraged to push forward - due to all the features and fixes, there are many untranslated strings across the board!

<p>From Neil of the Synapse-team</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Folks, in the run up to Synapse 1.0, if you are running your own homeserver now would be an excellent time to check that your TLS certificates are up to date. Point your server name at <a href="/federationtester/">https://matrix.org/federationtester/</a> and if there are errors check our handy FAQ on how to fix it. If you do not have valid TLS certificates Synapse 1.0 will refuse to federate with you.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">benpa</a> has put together a federation checker to quantify how many homeservers are 1.0 ready - <a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com">https://www.arewereadyyet.com/</a> - It currently stands at 50.5% let's try and get that to 60% over the weekend.</p>
<p>Aside from all that, the team have been working on preparing for Synapse 1.0, you can <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">track our progress here</a>. We promise not to just land 1.0 out of the blue - we'll give everyone a 2 week warning to give stragglers a chance to get their certificates in order.</p>

<p>And this week we have Neil and Erik talking about this in more detail on Matrix Live</p>

<p>First Release Candidate of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">Jeon</a> Project with upcoming Client-Server API 0.5, Server-Server API 0.1.1, Application API 0.1, Identity API 0.2 and Push API 0.1.
Also the RC of the <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk">jmsdk</a> has been prepared with Java Matrix Client for Client-Server API 0.5.
Changes in the C2S: Added the <code>m.push_rules</code> event, removed presence list methods and other minor fixes.
Added S2S API of the 0.1.1 version.
I prepared a very simple page <a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/">https://ma1uta.github.io/</a> with links to the swagger schemas (json and yaml) for all Matrix API which generated from the Jeon code.</p>

<p>There's a lot of progress, a few endpoints and features have been implemented this week such as Room Tags and all of the spec features for /createRoom. Most of the progress has been with testing and bugfixes thanks to Yan Minari, and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> and mujx.
We've fixed several interactions with synapse such as invite accept/deny and synapse's ability to join and leave construct created rooms without any issues.
Lastly and most important, we've generated an official issues list thanks again to our star tester Yan Minari available here <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/issues">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/issues</a></p>

<h2 id="opensaps-open-slack-api-server">OpenSAPS: Open Slack API Server</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@pztrn:pztrn.name">pztrn</a> has created a new mechanism for relaying apps that use Slack webhooks into Matrix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To everyone who wonders how to connect his application to Matrix (at least for notifications of some kind) - use <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">OpenSAPS</a>! It just reached v0.1.0. <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">OpenSAPS</a> stands for Open Slack API Server and able to retransmit messages from applications (like Gitlab or everything that can send data to Slack) to somewhere else. Right now these &quot;somewhere else&quot; is a Telegram (with HTTP proxy support) and Matrix! Written in Golang to ensure minimal memory footprint. Take a look at <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps</a> Tested with Gitlab and Gitea but should work with almost any service. Join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opensaps:pztrn.name">#opensaps:pztrn.name</a> to talk with developers or get help. BTW, there is OpenSAPS instance in our room that transmits everything from gitlab.com into room! (almost) immediately after 0.1.0 comes <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps/tags/v0.1.1">0.1.1</a>, with fixed URLs parsing and fixed inability to login into servers which use .well-known for delegation. It should work [with other webhooks]. If something strange happens there is also a possibility to write own parser to make everything work :)â€š Tested with Gitlab and Gitea ATM. Share application names that work, I'll start to make a list of them. :D</p>

<hr />
<p>Matrix is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an open standard for <em>interoperable</em>, <em>decentralised</em>, <em>real-time communication</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this article we'll benefit from all three of these attributes:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><em>interoperable:</em> we'll see how Matrix can be made to interact with WhatsApp</li>
 	<li><em>decentralised</em>: you can perform this on your own server while still enjoying the benefits of being connected to the rest of the Matrix federation</li>
 	<li><em>real-time communication</em>: we'll see how to send and receive messages in real-time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="install-your-homeserver-and-install-mautrix-whatsapp-the-whatsapp-bridge">Install your homeserver and install mautrix-whatsapp, the WhatsApp bridge</h2>
<p>Firstly, you need to have a Matrix homeserver installed. If you don't currently have one, take a look at the instructions at <a href="/docs/guides/installing-synapse">Installing Synapse</a>, and also in the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse README</a>.</p>
<p>Next, install <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> by following the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp/wiki">mautrix-whatsapp/wiki</a>.</p>
<p>If you are starting from scratch, I suggest you take a look at <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>, as this project will enable you to deploy Synapse, <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> and other components easily.</p>
<p>For example, if you have an existing deployment using <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>, you can add <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> simply by adding the following line to your configuration file:</p>
<pre><code class="yaml language-yaml">matrix_mautrix_whatsapp_enabled: true
</code></pre>
<p>... and re-running the setup:</p>
<pre><code class="unix language-unix">ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all
</code></pre>
<p>Either way, you will soon have a functioning Matrix Synapse homeserver and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> installed with it. Next, we will set up an Android VM.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-an-android-vm">Set up an Android VM</h2>
<p>The best way to run an Android Virtual Machine is to use the Android Studio tools from Google. First, <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/install">install Android Studio</a>, making sure to follow the post-install steps, as they will install additional tools we need, including AVD Manager.</p>
<p>Once installed, run AVD manager by choosing <code>Tools -&gt; AVD Manager</code> from the menu.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to create a new virtual machine, in this example I have a Nexus 5X running Android 9, but almost any configuration is fine here. Make sure that you give the device access to the Play Store.</p>
<img src="/docs/img/avd.png" alt="" />
<h2 id="install-whatsapp-and-sign-in">Install WhatsApp and sign-in</h2>
<p>Launch the Virtual Device, the open the Play Store and sign in. Now use the Play Store to install WhatsApp on the Virtual Device.</p>
<p>You will be asked to verify your phone number, use your number on another device to complete this step.</p>
<center>
<img src="/docs/img/nexus5.png" /></center>
<h2 id="setup-mautrix-whatsapp-bridge">Setup mautrix-whatsapp bridge</h2>
<p>Now that you have WhatsApp working in a VM, and Matrix working on your server, it's time to bridge them together!</p>
<p>Per the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp/wiki">mautrix-whatsapp/wiki</a>, you must start a new chat with <strong>@whatsappbot:<em>&lt;yourdomain</em>&gt;</strong>. Type <code>login</code> to begin the authentication process.</p>
<p>mautrix-whatsapp operates by using the WhatsApp Web feature of WhatsApp - which means it uses a QR code that you must now scan on the device running WhatsApp - which in your case is the AVD. In order to scan the presented QR code, set your AVD camera to passthrough the camera device on your host machine - see the images below.</p>
<img src="/docs/img/camera1.png" alt="" />
<img src="/docs/img/camera2.png" alt="" />
<p>Once this is complete, you can type <code>sync</code>, to start bridging contacts, and <code>sync --create</code> to automatically create room invites.</p>
<p>And that's it! You may need to take a little time to watch the sync happen, particularly if you have a very large number of chats on the WhatsApp side, but there is no further configuration needed.</p>

<p>A whole bunch of small stuff I did, mostly just additional exposed methods and parameters, and some fixed issues as well. I did add support for HS URL discovery using both SRV and .well-known though, which I think is probably the largest new feature.</p>

<p>A project rarely seen has received a lot of attention this week!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has been working on federation workers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a federation worker for synapse written in .NET to improve outgoing federation performance.

<p>I'm also working on my own netcore workers project by setting up an appservice sender.

<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>Clean up c++ code</li>
 	<li>Make the c++ code less heavy, we should focus on speed</li>
 	<li>Offload js code to direct qml binding, with this i mean instead of having ablock if-else code that modifies qml object that runs on component load, we do this directly in qml: see 0a800fc and https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriksblob/0a800fcdc0af4fa2e08526dbff88e06bcb591779/uMatriks/componentsChatItem.qml as an example for a cleaner code</li>
 	<li>Make all ui depended calls async, we should NEVER block ui</li>
 	<li>Offload heavy js logic to c++</li>
 	<li>Cleaner UI, with less crust</li>
 	<li>Async everything</li>
 	<li>Merge our WIP call support</li>
 	<li>Finish impl of call support (maybe move to a standalone webrtc module)</li>
 	<li>Slowly start moving to QQC2</li>
 	<li>Implement reply</li>

<h2 id="matrix-archive-keyring">matrix-archive-keyring</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been working on new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've paused porting Synapse to OpenBSD this week, while I attempt to both fix and <em>revert</em> some security issues caused by <code>sudo apt-key add</code> for Matrix.org and Riot.im packages for Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution users.<br /><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4609">matrix-org/synapse PR #4609</a> was my first attempt to fix the problem, however I fell short this time in ease-of-use and my implementation had other issues. (Read: The <code>repo-key.asc</code> downloaded from Matrix.org Debian repository should go to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>, and must not be added by <code>apt-key add</code> or added to <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d</code> directly. I attempted the latter with my first PR; but that would've allowed the Matrix.org signing key to also be used to verify packages from Debian's main repositories. Yikes!)<br />As my second attempt, I'm now creating a new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>. There's multiple things this package intends to do:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>A post-install script to remove any previously added Matrix.org package signing keys from <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg</code>. (This is the file <code>apt-key add</code> most commonly uses, and the most commonly found bad advice on the Internet.)</li>
 	<li>Convert <code>repo-key.asc</code> to a de-armorized <code>.gpg</code> format, understood better by apt(8). (Essentially, <code>gpg --dearmor</code>.)</li>
 	<li>Install the converted <code>.gpg</code> key to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>.</li>
 	<li>Make sure <code>apt(8)</code> uses the newly added key for Matrix.org repository only?</li>
 	<li>Deliver any updates to <code>repo-key.asc</code> directly to you via <code>apt upgrade</code>. Your operating system might then also do it automatically for you if <code>unattended-upgrades(8)</code> is installed on your system. ?</li>
 	<li>Make sure everything goes away when this keyring package is uninstalled. No more <code>sudo sh -c 'apt-key del C35EB17E1EAE708E6603A9B3AD0592FE47F0DF61; rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> to get rid of the repository.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I have one more interesting enhancement to disclose.<br />We can ask you with <code>debconf</code> if you want to install <code>deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian $(lsb_release -cs) main</code> to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> while you're installing the new keyring with <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code>.<br />You'll most likely notice the difference in install instructions, as a result of this package. Before and after:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># Before
sudo apt install -y lsb-release curl apt-transport-https
echo "deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian `lsb_release -cs` main" |
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list
curl "https://matrix.org/packages/debian/repo-key.asc" |
    sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
<pre><code># After
sudo apt install matrix-archive-keyring
sudo sh -c 'apt update && apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are a Debian or Ubuntu user and Synapse homeserver operator using Matrix.org repositories, I'll be towncrying when this package becomes available as much as I can. All you should need to do then is <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code> and it should patch the security holes in your operating system if you've formerly installed packages from Matrix.org or Riot.im! (The command may change a bit, because next Debian operating system release &quot;Buster&quot; has entered soft-freeze just today (2019-02-12) and not accepting new packages into that release.)<br />PS: I'm at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#debian-matrix:matrix.org">#debian-matrix:matrix.org</a>, please come talk to us if Debian packaging interests you!</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/kamax-io/grid/gridepo">Gridepo</a>, as a Matrix Homeserver, is gaining basic support for Matrix Client API. We have basic login, room creation, message sending and sync working! A little screen recording of the progress can be viewed <a href="https://kamax.io/_matrix/media/v1/download/kamax.io/EOMDDlNERTqalHvADhokyItG">here</a> for live action with Riot. As a reminder, Gridepo is a clean rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a>.</p>
<p>This is not usable yet outside of a dev environment but we should have a first usable version with federation in a couple of weeks!</p>
