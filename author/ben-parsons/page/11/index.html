Brendan on the progress of the Dendrite audit:
<blockquote>Dendrite's audit is finally coming to an end! I'm happy to say I just finished the “data collection” phase, in which I looked at everything that needs to be either fixed or implemented in Dendrite. This represents 90% of the work and around 3 weeks of full-time work. All that's left to do now is some triaging in the data (<a href="https://cloud.abolivier.bzh/index.php/s/qXi2KFjCQk2c6eG">which is available here</a>, by the way), into order to have a clear view on what's left to do in the audit.

On this subject, it's always worth thinking about the importance of openness and interoperability in messaging. This <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/lessons-vendor-lock-messaging">recent article in Linux Journal</a> is a reminder of the need to avoid proprietary vendor lock in, and mentions both XMPP and Matrix.

It's the 28th of December as I write this, and I hope you had a good year. Long as it is, I recommend reading <a href="/blog/2018/12/25/the-2018-matrix-holiday-special/">Matthew's write-up of the year</a>, as it covers a lot of ground!
<p>Many of the core team have been out of the office this week, but there are still plenty of updates to share from the Matrix ecosystem!</p>
<h2 id="mxisdv122">mxisd v1.2.2</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> released mxisd v1.2.2:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a> had a Holiday-special release: <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.2.2">v1.2.2</a> before v1.3.0.
<p>This release introduces two new big features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Username login rewriting via 3PID to allow advanced flows, like bypassing the synapse restriction of having numerical usernames for non-guest users</li>
 	<li>Support for multiple Base DNs for LDAP backends</li>
</ul>
Work has started on v1.3.0 so this is definitely the last release before a non-backward compatible release.</blockquote>

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:feneas.org">Jason Robinson</a>:
<blockquote>I started work on a Prometheus Alertmanager bot for Matrix. The basic idea is that Alertmanager can send webhook alert events to the bot which will then send the formatted events to configured rooms based on the alert receiver.

From the release notes:
<blockquote>New features:
<ul>
 	<li>Enhanced history view with adaptive layout, day divider</li>

 	<li>Larger display of emoji-only messages</li>
 	<li>Some performance improvements</li>
 	<li>Opening a room jumps to first unread message</li>
</ul>
Bugfixes:

When a <code>matrix.to</code> or <code>view.matrix.org</code> URL is used this app is activated. It adds a little snippet with the Room Title and Topic (if the room is peekable from matrix.org). In future it'll work for event permalinks, but currently there is no support for peeking context/event in Matrix API.<br /><br />Example can be seen at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to/issues/52#issuecomment-449878490">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to/issues/52#issuecomment-449878490</a>.

<h2 id="seeyounextyear">See you next year</h2>
So there you have it.
<p>I'm at 35c3 with some known characters from the Matrix world (as well as 15,000 others.) If you're here too, come visit us in our assembly, and also make sure to come to Dijkstra tomorrow to watch me present a look back at on the last year: <a href="https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9400.html">https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9400.html</a>. We have recorded a message for Matrix Live from 35c3, but will post tomorrow with some more footage from the event.</p>
<p>Otherwise, see you next year Matrix fan!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">You may have seen that <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> been working fearlessly and tirelessly on bridges for many, many months. In this episode of Matrix Live Half-Shot chats with Matthew about his work, progress and achievements, with a focus on recent <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a> and XMPP work. Audio is not amazing, but worth listening to get acquainted with recent work.</p>

As a note from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>:
<blockquote>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a> bridge gained a XMPP specific backend for better performance when you want to do just xmpp bridging. It's rather quick right now, and needs dogfooding.</blockquote>

<p>Purism announced they are sponsoring <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a> development, starting with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@iamjsparber:matrix.org">Julian Sparber</a> working last month to improve the message view. You can <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2018/12/03/better-room-history-in-fractal/">read about his progress here</a>. Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>Before, there was a jarring cut when new messages were loaded, but now you can just scroll upward and older messages are loaded continuously.<br />The part I'm most excited about is the new "new message divider". When the user opens a room they can directly start reading the conversation from the last seen message and they don't need to search for the new message divider. Not only has the UX gotten a lot better, but also the underlying code is much cleaner now.<br />I also spent some time on making message rendering faster. I replaced the RegExp with more efficient code, this made the rendering much faster (from ~10ms to ~ 1ms) for every single message.<br />In summary, all of these things improve Fractal's UX a lot and make it feel more like a modern messaging app.</blockquote>

This week they have been working on merging changes to the specification:<br /><blockquote>Work on the Informo specifications has slowed down a bit in the last couple of weeks, though since the last update we did manage to get some relatively big SCSs merged into the specs, including <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/9">SCS #9</a> (rendered <a href="https://specs.informo.network/information-distribution/article/">here</a>) which specifies how information sources must publish their information through the federation, and <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/11">SCS #11</a> (rendered <a href="https://specs.informo.network/information-distribution/source/">here</a>) which describes how sources must register themselves in order to be picked up by clients, and handle localisation. ?<br />There's still a couple of big items to take care of before we can cut a 1.0 release of the Informo specs but this is definitely a huge step towards this goal.</blockquote>

Last night Half-Shot &amp; Neil &amp; Brendan went to see the <a href="https://redecentralize.org/">Redecentralize</a> folk at their meetup:
<blockquote>Beer! And pizza! And also Redecentralize<br />We chatted to a nice bunch of folks both demoing their decentralized projects and talked to the likes of scuttlebutt, BBC, IPFS and more. Was a interesting experience having around 8 minutes to quickly explain to newcomers what Matrix is and why they should use it in a speed dating format. We chatted (and demoed) bridges, <a href="https://riot.im/experimental/">new-riot</a> and generally how it all fits together. There were a lot of very interesting people with different profiles and backgrounds, and diversified questions which lead to a lot of interesting discussions.</blockquote>
<small>Note for the confused: the <em>format of the meetup</em> was comparable to speed dating. There is no suggestion that Matrix should be used at regular speed dating.

Longer than usual episode of Matrix Live this week. Amber talks to Neil about the works she's been doing over the last few months to port Synapse from Python 2 to Python 3. Recommended for anyone who's been following along the progress of Synapse, or who wants a good intro on the benefits of Python 3 over Python 2.

<h2 id="zerophone">ZeroPhone</h2>
This week we learned about ZeroPhone, a fairly mature project aiming to <a href="https://wiki.zerophone.org/index.php/Main_Page">build a working cellphone on top of a Raspberry Pi Zero</a>.
<blockquote>an open-source smartphone that can be assembled for 50$ in parts. It is Linux-powered, with UI software written in Python.
Currently, ZeroPhone is based on Raspberry Pi Zero, SIM800L GSM modem and 1.3" OLED screen and button interface.</blockquote>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@adam:thebeckmeyers.xyz">&amp;Adam</a> was the first to bring it to our attention:
<blockquote>I stumbled across this blog post which mentions a matrix app in a project to create an open, hackable phone out of a raspberry pi. It's old news at this point I guess, but I don't think I've seen it mentioned here, so I thought it might be a neat thing worth featuring: <a href="https://zerophone.github.io/newsletter/ZeroPhone-Weekly-No.-16/">https://zerophone.github.io/newsletter/ZeroPhone-Weekly-No.-16/</a></blockquote>
The creator of the Matrix app, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@derivmug:matrix.org">derivmug</a> also arrived to tell us about his work:
<blockquote>Hey everyone, I have been suggested to post about the <a href="https://wiki.zerophone.org/index.php/Main_Page">Zerophone project here</a>. I have written a basic matrix client for it. It's basically a simple phone based on a raspberry pi zero, focused on privacy, security and hackability.</blockquote>
The client app is built using the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a>, I'm also hoping to chat to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@derivmug:matrix.org">derivmug</a> as part of a future Matrix Live. <a href="https://github.com/ZeroPhone/ZPUI/tree/devel/apps/matrix">Take a look at the code here</a>.

He recently added Matrix to the list of protocols he scrapes and lists:
<blockquote>Matrix (or more specifically, Synapse) servers are now visible on the The Federation info website at <a href="https://the-federation.info/matrix%7Csynapse">https://the-federation.info/matrix%7Csynapse</a>. The website collects lists of servers for various federation protocols (like Matrix, ActivityPub, Diaspora, etc). If a server outputs usage information, it also shows some historical information for servers and projects. Currently the information available from Synapse on the site is just version, availability of registrations and (obviously) domain name. If you want to register your server, check https://the-federation.info/info for more details. Tips also welcome on how to register other Matrix server projects and how to get more data out of servers.</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a>:</p>
<blockquote>matrix-appservice-discord received a lot of work these past days.
Not only the usual small bugfixes, but also some rather big changes:
The parsers for both Discord-&gt;Matrix sending and Matrix-&gt;Discord sending were re-written completely to properly handle things (and thus, at the same time, crunch a bunch of edge-case bugs!).
In addition, the long-awaited highlighting issues with @ everyone and @ here (on discord) and @ room (on matrix) were addressed.
Some of these things are still in PR stage, but expected to be merged soon!</blockquote>

 	<li>These three SSO-related MSCs are derived from work being done for a large-scale Matrix deployment for a New Vector customer which we should be able to talk about in future. Improving SSO and other auth/identity work in Matrix is vital, and needless to say we're trying to ensure all the resulting work ends up in the spec to the benefit of the whole ecosystem :)</li>

<a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> reports that:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a> has received a lot of updates in the last few weeks. Although mostly bug fixes and improvements, there's added support for streaming downloads from remote servers. This is mostly useful when someone posts a 100mb video in a room: previously the media repo would download the entire thing then send it over to you. Now it'll send you the video while it also caches it.</blockquote>
<h2 id="matrixdockeransibledeploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</h2>
Big update from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> this week:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> has received some updates in the past few weeks - fixing minor bugs, improving documentation, adding support for additional <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a>/<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web">Riot</a> features, etc.
<p>Most notably (in oldest to most-recent order):</p>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> heard you like playbooks, so he made it possible to <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/commit/67e2bf285d44c0cb392ba1e28e615053b748c03c">run the playbook from another playbook</a>. Thanks Cadair!</li>
 	<li>some <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#bc-break-renaming-playbook-variables">configuration renaming</a> to make things more consistent. Most people would likely be unaffected.</li>
 	<li>support has been added for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#postgres-11-support">Postgres 11</a>. Upgrading is possible and easy (as a related success story, Aaron Raimist shared that he recently upgraded his ~40GB database)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#ssl-protocols-used-to-serve-riot-and-synapse">more flexible and more secure-by-default TLS configuration</a>. Thanks Aaron Raimist!</li>
 	<li>the ability to <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#customize-parts-of-riots-config">customize more parts of riot-web</a>. Thanks Aaron Raimist!</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#ability-to-set-synapse-log-levels">better control over Synapse logging</a>. Thanks Aaron Raimist!</li>
 	<li>the ability to <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#support-for-controlling-public-registration-and-room-auto-join">set up a public server</a> and the ability to make use of Synapse's \\"auto-join\\" feature. Until now, the playbook was only suited for setting up a private server, but with this, setting up public servers is now a possibility. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/anadahz">@anadahz</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm quite happy that the playbook is getting more contributions from others now and is improving in such diverse ways!</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com">#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com</a> support room in Matrix is now bridged to the <code>#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</code> IRC Freenode channel, making it easier for people to get support when they don't have a working homeserver.</p>

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has been working on <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a>:
<blockquote>the work on lazy-loading in <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> has advanced to the point when client authors may start trying to integrate it in their applications (welcome to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#qmatrixclient:matrix.org">#qmatrixclient:matrix.org</a> for details - it's a bit rough around the edges yet).</blockquote>
<h2 id="spectral">Spectral</h2>
This week <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> has been working to give <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a> a more Material design oriented UI.

<h2 id="smsmatrix">SMSMatrix</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@swedneck:swedneck.xyz">swedneck</a> reports that:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/tijder/SmsMatrix">SMSMatrix</a> now has a room (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#smsmatrix:matrix.org">#smsmatrix:matrix.org</a>). SMSMatrix is a simple bridge between Matrix and SMS, developed by tijder. You install an android app and register a bot account which will invite you to direct chats under the name of anyone who sends you an SMS, which will then act as a normal SMS conversation.</blockquote>
I had a very quick play with this tool and it works great - a good way to quickly bridge SMS to Matrix.

<h2 id="riot">Riot</h2>
News from the <a href="https://riot.im/">Riot</a> teams:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-android-redesign-PoC/tree/develop">Android rewrite is continuing in Kotlin</a> - lots of infrastructure work over the last few weeks</li>
 	<li>E2E key backups landed in Riot/iOS develop (but no UI yet, as we finalise the implementation first on Riot/Web)</li>
 	<li>E2E key backups also landed in Riot/Web develop (but with placeholder UI)</li>
 	<li>E2E key backups in dev on Riot/Android too (using Realm for storage!)</li>
 	<li>Lots of work from uhoreg on E2E cross-signing
</li>
 	<li>Work on the Riot/Web redesign paused for a week due to other commitments but as of Nov 26th we're back on the case again, making up for lost time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
Most of the focus from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">Synapse</a> team this week has been on the new version using Python 3:
<ul>
 	<li>Py3 is finished, other than Debian packages - ongoing debate on whether they should use a virtualenv or depend on debian dependencies, and who should maintain them in a Py3 world…</li>
 	<li>Lots of running around on final Py3 bugs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="matrixappservicepurple">matrix-appservice-purple</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has continued work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a>.
<h2 id="modular">Modular</h2>
<a href="https://www.modular.im/">Modular.im</a> provides Hosted Homeservers for Matrix.
<ul>
 	<li>Modular now has full support for Custom DNS (letting you point your own SRV records at it)</li>
 	<li>Lots of work on a migration tool to allow folks to easily shift Matrix accounts between servers, as well as (in future) migrations from HipChat, Slack &amp; others.</li>
</ul>

This will be fixed later this week.<br />Together with the ongoing work on refactoring room state cache and lazy-loading this makes Quaternion quite prone to regressions: unless you want to help to iron them out, it's advised to stick with Quaternion 0.0.9.3 and wait for further announcements.<br />By the way, the latest Quaternion release is now available in OpenSUSE Tumbleweed rolling distribution.</blockquote><br /><h2 id="synapse0339rc1">Synapse 0.33.9rc1</h2><br /><blockquote>Synapse has a new release candidate - 0.33.9rc1 - If you'd like to help us test it, you can <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.9rc1">get it here</a>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Shoutout to our new member of the team, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a> who did a lot of the review work behind the scenes for this release. Also, thank you to everyone who submitted a PR or an issue!</blockquote>
<h2 id="matrixpuppetslackv180released">matrix-puppet-slack v1.8.0 released</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@root:thomasprofitt.com">tom</a> came out of the wild to tell us about <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack">matrix-puppet-slack</a>:
<blockquote>TWIM (but actually over the last few weeks), thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://github.com/d3m3vilurr">a new contributor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack">matrix-puppet-slack</a> v1.7.0 and v1.8.0 have been released, fixing a number of old and new issues and adding support for new types of Slack events, including bidirectional @-mentions, Slack-to-Matrix typing notifications, fixing Slack-to-Matrix image/file uploads with comments, and more!
The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-bridge/">matrix-puppet-bridge</a> projects have gotten relatively quiet over the past year or so, but there's still plenty of bridges with plenty of features to implement and plenty of bugs to fix (and, even more importantly, bugs to <em>report</em>!) for any would-be-contributors who'd like to use a trusted Matrix homeserver as their double-puppetting Slack/iMessage/Facebook/GroupMe/iChat/Skype/Hangouts/Signal/Tox client from which to brag to their friends on the other platforms about how great Matrix is.</blockquote>

<h2 id="maubotmanagementuiprogress">maubot management UI progress</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been making big progress on his <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a> management UI:
<blockquote>The maubot management UI has progressed well, but isn't quite ready yet. I think it should be usable by Next Week in Matrix.
It can be used to set up and configure a maubot instance and plugins. Once it's ready, it should be possible to do everything except installing maubot itself through the UI: installing and updating plugins, adding matrix clients, configuring plugin instances, viewing logs, etc.</blockquote>

<h2 id="hkbotisanantiabusebot">HK Bot is an anti-abuse bot</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee">Coffee</a> continues his streak of TWIM mentions by bringing a new bot to combat abuse:
<blockquote><a href="https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/HKBot">HK Bot</a> is an anti-abuse bot for public <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a> chatrooms.
This is a bot that really shouldn't exist, but since some people just like to make others' lives more difficult, here we are.
The purpose of this bot is twofold. It can automatically oversee rooms and respond to abuse, based on programmable pattern rules, providing a stop-gap measure in case no human moderators are nearby. It can also automate some tedious tasks via its command interface, the primary one being the complete redaction of all of an abuser's messages.
HK Bot is still under construction and contains dangerous features. Use with caution.</blockquote>
<h2 id="xsampatoipabot">X-SAMPA to IPA bot</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dandellion:dodsorf.as">Dandellion</a> "made an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA">X-SAMPA</a> to IPA bot based on matrix-bot-sdk and discord's conniebot". This bot essentially lets you use ASCII characters to get an output in IPA. The advantage of this is that you can much more easily type and transmit pronunciation (because you don't need to find the characters).
<blockquote>I'll just have to make it a bit more configurable, but then I'll throw the source up
When making constructed languages and talking about linguistics, it's nice to get an easily readable IPA representation of a word, but it's really hard to write IPA, which is why x-sampa exists as a way to input IPA with a normal keyboard!</blockquote>
<h2 id="informo">Informo</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@vabd:weu.informo.network">vabd</a>, the unknown organiser of Informo provided an update about the spec:
<blockquote>A handful of SCS (Specs Changes Submissions) to the <a href="https://specs.informo.network">Informo specifications</a> have been happening over the last week and a half, with some of them still open to public review for at least a few days before being merged into the specs.

<h2 id="fractal">Fractal</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@iamjsparber:matrix.org">Julian Sparber</a> has been working on message rendering in <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a>:
<blockquote>I increased message rendering performance in the room history. Also the history doesn't move it's position anymore when older messages are loaded, which results in a much better experience. All the changes are in master, but we didn't make a new release.</blockquote>
<h2 id="videointrotomatrixandriotinfrench">Video intro to Matrix and Riot in French</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nouts:matrix.org">Nouts</a>:
<blockquote>I have made a video about Riot which could fit in the Guides on matrix.org. It's for beginners, in French. It's 6 months old, but I just uploaded it on youtube.

<h2 id="morethingsthisweek">More Things This Week</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> introduces a new client built on JavaFX: no code yet, but it's built on the previous <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta">Java Matrix</a> work he's been doing. "It will be cross-platform (linux,windows,osx I hope) client with supports of the multi accounts."
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> also continued work on bridging via libpurple: &quot;I've nearly got group chats working, with invites (and hopefully people joining and leaving them showing up properly) as well as user's having profiles.&quot;</p>
<p>Work continues on <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">Koma</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Since the last TWIM update, koma is updated to kotlin 1.3, experimental coroutines are replaced with stable ones. The changes are being tested and should be merged soon. A new contributor has joined, so expect development to speed up a bit.</blockquote>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a>, a Matrix client built using <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libqmatrixclient</a>, runs great on macOS. I'm excited because I get to play with another client! <a href="https://bintray.com/encombhat/Spectral/Spectral#files">Find .dmgs on bintray</a>.

This week, the first steps were taken in the creation of the Matrix Foundation! Read our <a href="/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2/">blog post from earlier this week</a> for more:
<blockquote>in preparation for the upcoming Matrix 1.0 release, we've been moving ahead with the rest of the open governance plan – and we're happy to announce that as of a few hours ago, the <strong>initial incarnation of The Matrix.org Foundation exists!</strong><br />Watch this space over the coming weeks as we announce the Guardians and finish bootstrapping the Foundation into its final long-term form! Meanwhile, any questions: come ask in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org</a></blockquote><br /><h2 id="hellomatrix">Hello Matrix</h2><br />Alex has managed the invaluable <a href="https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php">https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php</a> for some years, but in two weeks time will be making some changes to the page:<br /><blockquote>Just wanted to let everyone know that changes are coming to the server list: I've put up a notice on the site that starting Nov 16th I will only show a curated list of servers I would recommend to join.<br />This reduces the workload for me quite a bit and avoids me becoming some kind of arbiter on what encompasses the Matrix universe… I think it is also more useful for users who are looking for a server to join.<br />And there is always <a href="https://matrixstats.org">matrixstats.org</a> for those who are looking for a more complete-ish list of known homeservers.</blockquote><br />However, if you have ideas on how to continue the project, or would like to step up and get involved in maintaining a list using data and tools from Hello Matrix, please <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">contact me</a>. Alex told me:<br /><blockquote>if you find someone willing to take up the project of a more automated, self-service and complete list at a later date, I am more than willing to hand over all the stuff I currently have and might also lend a helping hand myself (if I have time then).</blockquote>
<h2 id="maubotmanagementapi">maubot management API</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has continued work on the revamped, now-Pythonic <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a>, and has added a management API:
<blockquote>The <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a> management API I mentioned last week is now mostly ready. It should be possible to use it to set up a maubot instance and plugins without filling the database manually. There's no UI yet though, so it still means <code>curl</code>ing manually.<br />The management API also supports the fancy plugin reloading stuff which was the &gt; reason I rewrote maubot in python: You can <code>POST</code> an updated plugin to the API and it'll install it without having to restart.<br />I also made a bunch of plugins while working on the API that I used to test the API: a <a href="https://github.com/maubot/dice">dice rolling/calculator bot</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/maubot/media">bot that replies with the MXC URI of images you send it</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/maubot/echo">simple echo/ping bot</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/maubot/xkcd">xkcd bot</a><br /><br />Next steps are making the management UI, a few more plugins and making setup and development instructions so that other people could run it and make plugins</blockquote><br /><h2 id="announcingthefractalhackfestinseville">Announcing the Fractal Hackfest in Seville</h2><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bertob:matrix.org">Tobias Bernard</a> officially announced the second ever Fractal hackfest:<br /><blockquote>there's going to be a Fractal hackfest in Seville in December https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2018/10/26/fractal-hackfest-in-seville</blockquote>

<blockquote>My lightweight bot/client framework, <a href="https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/matrix-client-core">matrix-client-core</a>, received its first tag ever. Version 0.0.1 is relatively stable, and lies on the doorstep of some refactoring work (ongoing) which should keep the master branch backwards compatible for now, but could make things less stable as I add new commits.</blockquote><br />It turns out this isn't strictly a new project:<br /><blockquote>[it has] been there all along, quietly powering FAQBot and all of my bots. ? Maybe I have failed to explicitly indicate it as such up until now. (oops)</blockquote>
Always good news to see more bot-creation tooling!
<h2 id="synapse0338">Synapse 0.33.8</h2>
<a href="/blog/2018/11/01/synapse-v0-33-8-is-here/">Synapse 0.33.8 was released</a>, and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrew:shadura.me">andrewsh</a> made sure it was updated on Debian. <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixdotorg/synapse/">Docker packages</a> are also updated.

<h2 id="nsfwimagedetectionapionmatrix">NSFW image detection API (on Matrix)</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> is often found working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a> (previously 'Matrique'.) This week, he has been building <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nsfw:encom.eu.org">@nsfw:encom.eu.org</a>, which is a bot designed to give scores for how likely an image should be classified as NSFW. It's a simple mechanism, you give it an image, it gives you a JSON object with the result. For example:
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nsfw-bot.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3734" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nsfw-bot.png" alt="" width="936" height="1004" /></a></p>
<p>My avatar returned less than 1% probability of being NSFW, which I was actually a little offended by.</p>
<p>To talk more about the bot and it's development, chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nsfw:encom.eu.org">#nsfw:encom.eu.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gamingdiscordbridging">Gaming Discord bridging</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@swedneck:swedneck.xyz">swedneck</a> has been dutifully bridging channels from the Linux Gaming discord.

<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> is forced by his employers to use Viber, so is thinking of creating a Matrix bridge.</li>
 	<li>I spent some time this week repeatedly installing Synapse, then working with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@natrius:matrix.org">Stefan</a> to create a new, hopefully definitive installation guide (available soon). I can also personally recommend <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> project, this is a great way to get a Synapse installation (and more!) running.</li>
 	<li>lately in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> posters have been providing much clearer and atomic updates, which I like a lot</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="matrixliveseason3episode2">Matrix Live, season 3 episode 2</h2>
We continue the new season of Matrix Live. This re-booted season has a slightly different format to previous: in each outing, there will be a single deep-dive topic. This week, Matthew and recent-Matrix-arrival Nad discuss UX for E2E encryption key handling. This is an unsurprisingly complex design question, both in terms of how it should behave and how it should look. Nad shared his <a href="/blog/2018/11/02/user-experience-preview-end-to-end-encryption-by-default/">latest thinking in a blog post earlier today</a>, and you can watch the video below.
