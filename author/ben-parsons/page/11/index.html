<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Neil from Synapseland:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week privacy items have dominated, but we‚Äôve also been edging towards getting our room directory improvements out, shipping a new configuration creator and making further progress on the federation side bus project to improve performance of smaller instances.</p>
<p>We also deployed open tracing on matrix.org, which will help a lot in tracking down all sorts of strange behaviour in the wild and fixing some bugs in the sqlite -&gt; postgres migrator.</p>
<p>Next week we‚Äôll land the room directory improvements, much of the privacy work, and have the configuration creator ready for testing.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p>Jason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">Construct</a> added user room listing support so that you can find out what public rooms a user is a member of should they choose to not be invisible. To find out the list of rooms for a user, simply open the room directory in Riot and type a user mxid starting with @...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Construct is implementing the concept of invisibility for users:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exact mechanism for invisibility is not completely finished but there are obviously some limitations for this feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only users who are local to the server can set any kind of invisibility. Remote users are always fully listed. One day when the spec has &quot;user's rooms&quot; we would be glad to adhere to an <code>m.user.invisible</code>-etc configuration state event in such a room</li>
<li>Since there is no federation support for user's rooms list publication, the rooms list for a user is limited to what the server knows (rooms it has seen the user in).</li>
</ul>
<p>Construct is eager to implement any MSC's regarding user room and group membership listing over the federation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Construct is written for maximum performance in C++, and is developing rapidly - join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:maunium.net">#construct:maunium.net</a> for more info.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I decided to make a minor mautrix-telegram release with some small fixes, since v0.7.0 will take a while still. v0.6.1-rc2 is out now, the full release will probably happen next week if nobody finds any problems. Main changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalid reply fallbacks sent by Riot web in edits are now ignored</li>
<li>User and portal sync errors are now caught so that the <code>sync</code> command wouldn't fail if one telegram chat disappears.</li>

<p>Tidy update from Bruno this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we were doing the last bits of the privacy work, and fixing bugs and adding a format bar in the new composer (still behind labs flag).</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also been planning the First Time User Experience work, which will start at full speed next week. This is an effort to address some issues that new users hit in the first days of using Riot. See <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/projects/16#card-25137120">https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/projects/16#card-25137120</a> and Matthew talking over the details at <a href="https://youtu.be/JYsiHSL0lEA?t=710">https://youtu.be/JYsiHSL0lEA?t=710</a>. Letterboxes in the left panel will likely only be removed as part of the new community project though, as we need parts of the new community UX to keep things usable for power users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, if you're using <a href="https://riot.im/develop">https://riot.im/develop</a> please enable the new composer in Labs, it works well and deserves testing.</p>
<h3 id="continuum-desktop-client-many-updates">Continuum desktop client, many updates</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uforia:matrix.org">yuforia</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/koma-im/continuum-desktop">Continuum</a> desktop client written in pure Kotlin, version 0.9.20:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated login page appearance</li>
<li>Added validation to user ID and server address fields</li>
<li>The server address gets automatically filled with <code>https://</code> followed by server name when user ID is being typed</li>
<li>After signing in, the token and server address are automatically saved</li>
<li>Added progress indicator when being signed in. It doesn't block user from controlling Continuum,  pressing Esc will cancel the signing-in process.</li>
<li>Speed up application start-up by drawing the window and opening the database in parallel. Now the window typically appears within half a second with its size and position on screen restored to be the same as the last time it was opened. The most recently used accounts get loaded and automatically filled within a second.</li>
<li>Added drop shadow effect to scroll-to-latest-messages button to increase contrast</li>
<li>Fix: Always retry synchronization after getting a network error. Previous versions didn't retrieve new messages in a timely manner when the network is unreliable. A delay is added if the error is not a time-out to avoid stressing the homeserver.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2019-09-06-continuum.png" alt="continuum" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma-library">koma</a> the Kotlin library behind Continuum:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix suspend/hibernate detection. Synchronization is restarted automatically after the computer resumes from sleeping. The reason is that any previously opened connection is unlikely to be still alive, opening new connections reduces delay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix incorrect interface declaration that caused login to fail</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Expect the new version to be on most platforms in 2 days.</p>
<p>It's not the biggest release, but a release nonetheless.</p>
<h4 id="changes">Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Separate public and personal chats</li>
<li>Use a bullhorn icon for public chats without an avatar</li>
<li>Fix sync being started multiple times on startup</li>
<li>Fix the <code>room.member_count</code> error (might require clearing of data)</li>
<li>Many SDK changes, for features in future releases</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Inspired by a question in the Matrix HQ channel, I've built a (rudimentary) room list viewer at <a href="https://matrix-rooms.cryto.net/">https://matrix-rooms.cryto.net/</a> - you can just enter a homeserver (hostname) and see all the public rooms on it, without needing to log into anything. This might be useful for showing other people what kinds of rooms exist on Matrix!</p>

<p>I made a few spec proposals: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2244">MSC2244: Mass redactions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2246">MSC2246: Asynchronous media uploads</a>. Mass redactions are useful for fighting spam (and bridging telegram deletions) more efficiently. Asynchronous media uploads would make it possible for bridges (like telegram) to handle messages synchronously and thus keep message ordering without blocking all messages behind some media upload.</p>

<p>Jason from Construct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct added support for server notice rooms. As the server administrator I've placed quick access to the server control room for myself in this section.</p>
<p>Construct has also added support for the server-side commands <code>\\read &lt;room-tag&gt;</code>, for example <code>\\read m.low_priority</code> will mark all low-priority tagged rooms as read. The command <code>\\read *</code> also will mark all rooms as read.</p>
<p>Also, we now allow users to configure whether they transmit typing events by setting state events in their home-room. If a user creates an event with the <code>type</code> of <code>ircd.typing.disable.send</code> and the <code>state_key</code> of the room_id, typing events will not be sent to that room for them. Further variations exist, such as <code>ircd.typing.disable.sync</code> to prevent the client from receiving typing events for a particular room or all rooms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Slack bridge has had a whole week of care applied to it. We've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/152">switched the bridge entirely over to Typescript</a>, and overhauled large parts of the codebase to make future work easier (for ex, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/185">using the Slack node library rather than request calls</a>). If that's not exciting enough, we've also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/164">added support for the RTM API</a>, which means the bridge can use websockets when talking to slack. This gives us nice things like typing updates, and the ability to deploy without needing a webserver to listen for events. Release 1.0 is imminent, but before then we are hoping to land <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/186">Postgresql support</a> so that the bridge can scale up to meet the high demands placed upon it.</p>

Next week it‚Äôs all about getting the room directory out of the door, shipping the installer and continuing on with the privacy project. We are in the early stages of a project designed to reduce the load caused by outbound SSL connections, it is looking very promising. We‚Äôre also going to give the sqlite-&gt;postgres porting script some love as well as working on some message retention ideas, and also ways to reduce the meta data we store.</p>

While those who choose to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/matrixdotorg">sponsor Matrix development on Patreon</a> have always been blessed with branded t-shirts, it was otherwise very difficult to obtain official merch.</p>
<p>Today, those dark times have ended, as we announce the <strong><a href="https://shop.matrix.org/">Official Matrix Merch Store</a></strong>!</p>
<p>Now available from <strong><a href="https://shop.matrix.org/">shop.matrix.org</a></strong>, we‚Äôre offering packs of Stickers, T-Shirts, and Hoodies!</p>
<p>Stickers are provided in three types: hexagonal Matrix and Riot stickers, and rectangular transparent Matrix stickers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.matrix.org/"><img src="/blog/img/2019-08-09-stickers.jpg" alt="stickers" /></a></p>
<p>T-Shirts are available in all sizes and in Unisex and Women's editions. We‚Äôre using Gildan SoftStyle t-shirts, which are popular amongst printed shirts for being both soft and durable.</p>

<p>Huge update from Andrew:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week‚Äôs stats for Dendrite are in! <strong>4 authors</strong> have pushed <strong>11 commits</strong> to master and <strong>11 commits</strong> to all branches. On master, <strong>48 files</strong> have changed and there have been <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/compare/master@%7B1564757067%7D...master">676 additions and 146 deletions</a>.</p>
<p>Of note are the following merged PRs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/693">Implement client single event retrieval - #671</a>
<ul>
<li>You can now request a single event from Dendrite‚Äôs DB, assuming you have permission to view it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Very old PRs from CromFR have been updated and finally merged! These lay the groundwork for providing filters across various API endpoints (used in search, /sync, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/692">Add typingserver service to docker-compose</a>
<ul>
<li>Another fairly old PR by <a href="https://github.com/viccuad">viccuad</a> (their first for Dendrite!) finally reviewed and merged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/706">Fix permission and 404 response for alias deletion - #654</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/774">Replace membership and visibility values with constants</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/726">Implement profile retrieval over federation - fixes #651</a> (this one is very useful), and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/772">Fix transaction IDs in transaction cache have global scope</a>
<ul>
<li>A myriad of changes and fixes by cnly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have a number of PRs that were moved forward but not merged. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/405">Add auth fallback endpoint</a> (our oldest PR at the moment!) which we mentioned last week is so very close, but not quite there in time for this TWIM.</p>
<p>In terms of passing Sytests, Dendrite now passes <strong>172 tests</strong>, up from <strong>167</strong> last week. This is out of <strong>761 tests</strong> in total. So just a small bump (0.6%), but note that things that are crucial for Dendrite development at the moment, such as federating, only cover a small subset of tests, so each passing one can bring us much closer to getting Dendrite usable day-to-day.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>From Neil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The big news this week we‚Äôve landed some massive DB improvements (https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/5706) which should make message sending on matrix.org (and any other server) feel noticeably snappier. :) It'll be in the next release.</p>
<p>Outside of perf, we‚Äôve also been continuing with our privacy project, sydent now supports hashing third party identifiers instead of storing the raw form, and in the coming week we‚Äôll look at minimising the meta data we store. You can track our progress across the full project here (<a href="https://vector-im.github.io/feature-dashboard/#/plan?label=privacy-sprint&amp;repo=matrix-org/synapse&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-web&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-ios&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-android&amp;repo=vector-im/riotX-android&amp;repo=matrix-org/matrix-doc&amp;repo=matrix-org/sydent">https://vector-im.github.io/feature-dashboard/#/plan?label=privacy-sprint&amp;repo=matrix-org/synapse&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-web&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-ios&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-android&amp;repo=vector-im/riotX-android&amp;repo=matrix-org/matrix-doc&amp;repo=matrix-org/sydent</a>)</p>
<p>Work continues on our installer to make it easier to configure Synapse and we‚Äôll be looking for some community feedback rsn. The room directory revamp is now very close and we hope to have something live on matrix.org in about a week.</p>
<p>Finally we‚Äôre working on improving the efficiency of smaller instances sending messages into large rooms, we‚Äôre still at the design stage, but it will make a huge difference for anyone self hosting.</p>

<p>If you fancy running highly experimental software on your homeserver which might break things, I have two things for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-key-server">matrix-key-server</a> ( #matrix-key-server:t2bot.io ) is an implementation of a Matrix key server with notary support. Although it follows the specification, it has not been tested against Synapse. It is however fully featured: check it out on the federation tester ( <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/#keys.t2host.io">https://federationtester.matrix.org/#keys.t2host.io</a> ) or by querying it yourself ( <a href="https://keys.t2host.io/_matrix/key/v2/query/matrix.org">https://keys.t2host.io/_matrix/key/v2/query/matrix.org</a> ).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-room-directory-server">matrix-room-directory-server</a> ( #matrix-room-directory:t2bot.io ) is less experimental than the key server but is still very early days. Currently it only offers the ability to manipulate the federated public room directory for your server, but in future it is planned to be its own standalone directory server (room aliases without having to run a whole homeserver). Check it out by searching the t2bot.io room directory from your client.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been making big updates to two of his bridges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> can now bridge formatting, mentions, replies and reactions in both directions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also a logout command now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>'s switch to <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python">mautrix-python</a> is nearly finished (i.e. it didn't cause any errors for the past few days when testing in production). The main reason for the switch is using one Matrix library for all my python bridges. It also means the bridging code like double puppeting and command handling I shared between mautrix-facebook and mautrix-hangouts is now also used in mautrix-telegram.</p>
<p>Visible changes directly caused by using mautrix-python:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logs are now colorful.</li>
<li>Python 3.5 is no longer supported.</li>
<li>The bridge will refuse to start without access to the base config file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes that happened during the switch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telegram &quot;Saved Messages&quot; can now be bridged even when using double puppeting.</li>
<li>Mentions on Telegram are marked as read when using double puppeting (messages were already being marked as read, but mentions weren't).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, this actually happened last week and the week before that, but anyway: I've moved the CI and docker registry of my active projects to a self-hosted GitLab at <a href="https://mau.dev">mau.dev</a>.
Specifically, the CI/docker registry for all four mautrix bridges and maubot and automatic builds for gomuks have been moved. My maubot plugins also have automatic .mbp builds in the CI. For the docker registry, prepending <code>dock.mau.dev/</code> to the existing image names will work.
The old places (docker hub, dl.maunium.net) won't get new builds anymore. The repos on GitHub are still the &quot;canonical&quot; repos, but they're mirrored more or less instantly with <a href="https://github.com/tulir/maumirror">maumirror</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> will probably get some sort of history filling in the near-ish future</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm going to add some way to put bridged rooms into personal communities for filtering purposes. Not yet sure if it'll be fully built into the bridges or some kind of an external script</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've just released <a href="https://github.com/devture/email2matrix">Email2Matrix</a> - an SMTP server that can relay incoming messages over to Matrix based on mappings defined in a configuration file.</p>
<p>While it can also be installed standalone and work with any Matrix homeserver (see its documentation), the simplest way to install it is using <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-email2matrix.md">guide for Email2Matrix installation</a>.</p>
<p>The configuration process (users, rooms, mappings) is quite manual, but it's simple and has worked well for me for the past year and a half.
I've only just polished it up a bit, released and integrated with the Ansible playbook, so others could benefit from it too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we‚Äôve been working on implementing identifier hashing in sydent, a brand new installer for Synapse, we‚Äôve trialled some new db perf improvements which look very promising (more on this soon) and finally very close to an all new implementation of room search.</p>
<p>Next week we‚Äôll push out the all new Sygnal, continue with the installer and room search and pick up some tasks under our privacy umbrella to ensure that Synapse is not holding onto any data that it does not strictly need to.</p>

<h3 id="neo-huge-update">Neo huge update!</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@joepie91:pixie.town">joepie91</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lots of news about <a href="https://neo.pixie.town/app/">Neo</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li>There's now an additional maintainer (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@joepie91:pixie.town">joepie91</a>)!</li>
<li>A lot of the internals have been refactored, so they should be more maintainable and reliable going forward. Also some future work planned on refactoring the state handling using Redux, which should make it <em>much</em> faster to fix issues and add new features in the future. There are even some ideas already for a future plugin API!</li>
<li>Display has been improved in a lot of places. Error messages are now more clearly formatted, images in reply-quotes are now shown as thumbnails rather than just a filename, and the reply-to popup now shows the full event that you're replying to properly. The chat window now correctly sticks to the bottom when you're scrolled to the end and receive new messages, even when an image or video loads - though per-room scroll position restoration isn't done yet.</li>
<li>There's now an experimental compact mode! It uses a more IRC-client-like layout for messages, and generally just fits more content onto the screen. It can be enabled with an <a href="https://git.pixie.town/neo/neo#experimental-features">experimental flag</a>. A screenshot of the compact mode can be found <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2dLyQ49.png">here</a>.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I finished version 1.5 of my small command line based federation tester. The bash script relies heavily on popular Unix tools like awk, curl, jq, sed and so on. Compared to <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org">https://federationtester.matrix.org</a>, the outputs are a little more detailed and additional tests are performed, especially on the supported SSL protocols. Currently, it has only been tested under Linux.<br />
The current version improves the handling of port in the .well-known and DNS SRV configuration.<br />

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jan.christian:gruenhage.xyz">jcgruenhage</a> has been working on a bot in relation to the startup he's working with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made a bot for issuing Json Web Tokens to matrix users based on what homeserver they are on. It's implemented as a <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a> plugin (best way to write bots right now) and licensed under the AGPLv3. You can find it over at <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/bots/jwt">https://gitlab.com/famedly/bots/jwt</a>, and talk about it in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#jwt-bot:famedly.de">#jwt-bot:famedly.de</a><br />
As for the usecase, we want to give people from customer homeservers access to an API component, but don't want to maintain a separate account database. This way, they can request a token from the bot and then use that to interact with the API component</p>

<p>This week we shipped two new versions, 1.2 (<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/25/synapse-1-2-0-released">https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/25/synapse-1-2-0-released</a>) and 1.2.1(<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/26/critical-security-update-synapse-1-2-1-released">https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/26/critical-security-update-synapse-1-2-1-released</a>). 1.2.1 contains critical security updates, the bugs are long lived and not regressions introduced in 1.2 so all admins are encouraged to upgrade asap.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also been having some success in improving database performance and hope to ship that rsn so everyone can benefit.</p>
<p>Next week</p>
<p>We‚Äôll continue on db perf, improving logging verbosity (through recategorising some log lines) and generally looking to improve the experience for those admins running on smaller instances.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@eisha:matrix.org">Eisha</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The GSoc project ‚ÄúMatrix Visualisations‚Äù has continued its progression during the second period:</p>
<p>A ‚Äúmulti-view‚Äù has been implemented for the frontend application. It means that it is now possible to independently view multiple DAGs at the same time in the same canvas. It can be useful for observing the same DAG but on different HS‚Äôs, at the same time. The only current limitation is that you have to use the same backend for every view (with CS API or with the backend talking to a Synapse PostgreSQL database). This change took a long time as it required to make a lot of changes in the code.</p>
<p>The implementation of the support of the Federation API within the backend is in progress. It is slowly progressing as it needed some discussion before starting the work on it and its implementation requires me to become familiar with a lot of new things, regarding the federation process and the authentication of requests between HS‚Äôs.</p>

<p>I've been playing with Pattle 0.10 and have to say, it feels silky smooth to scroll with. It's really making me look again at Flutter development.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a>, project lead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version has been pushed to F-droid and TestFlight!</p>
<p>Note that for TestFlight the new version will be available in a few days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve scrolling through chat messages!
<ul>
<li>Messages are now paginated under the hood, before the whole message list was rebuild when loading more messages, causing a jittery scrolling experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support typing notifications!
<ul>
<li>Typing notifications are shown and send while typing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add chat settings screen
<ul>
<li>Currently you can see the chat name, avatar, description and members. More will be added in the future.</li>
<li>You can go to the chat settings screen by clicking on the title of the chat. This'll probably change in the future (at least to be easier).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reverse swipe direction of images (thanks Nathan!)</li>
<li>Fix ripple not showing on send button</li>
<li>Make UI refreshing more efficient</li>
<li>The App Store (iOS) name is now 'Pattle' instead of 'Pattle IM'</li>
<li>When a chat is open, the UI will only be rebuild if <em>that</em> chat has updates.</li>
<li>Lot's of code clean ups and improvements, mostly in the SDK</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What's coming up?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A release on Google Play!</li>
<li>A release on the official F-droid repo!</li>
<li>Remove Cupertino specific styling on iOS
<ul>
<li>Will now use Material Design, but altered for iOS. Having the discrepancy between Cupertino and Material was also the reason why some things didn't show up in iOS or why some things would be blue instead of the Pattle red.</li>
</ul>

<li>Notifications!? (F-droid)</li>

<p>This second version of Picard adds support for reacting to creation of new rooms on slack in real time as well as implementing a set of commands for creating new bridged rooms from either matrix or slack. In addition to this, Picard has matrix commands for inviting you to all the bridged rooms in the communtiy and automatically inviting you to new rooms as they are created. Finally, we have added support for sending welcome messages to all new members of your slack team or matrix community in a DM with the bot, which we are using to explain the chat setup to users and giving them a private place to issue commands.</p>
<p>This is uses <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/skill-picard">matrix-appservice-slack</a> for actually sending events in bridged rooms, and PIcard itself is a skill for the <a href="https://opsdroid.readthedocs.io/">opsdroid</a> bot framework #opsdroid-general:matrix.org  and uses the <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/database-matrix/">matrix-database</a> plugin for opsdroid which uses matrix room state to back the opsdroid memory.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/pull/111">bridge SDK PR</a> has been merged to develop, now providing bridges the benefit of error reporting. The modifications to the SDK are non-breaking, but activation of the feature requires small changes to the bridge using it. But be warned, everything is still under an unstable prefix and rightly so ‚Äì the implementation is still subject to change.
&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The MSC didn't get much love in public, but the concepts required to evolve it are taking shape. It was contemplated to piggyback on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1410">MSC 1410: Rich Bridging</a> and to add a retry mechanism. So heads up for more to come on this front.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3246">display of bridge errors</a> in Riot Web is now a PR and in the state of getting its last few kinks removed. It will start to be available under a lab flag soon.</p>
<p>With everything getting to play together nicely, there will be the first rooms enabling bridge errors to test the code in the wild. Stabilizing the code for everyday use and getting the MSC into a respectable form are the next goals for the project. Those will help in fostering broader adoption among bridges and clients.</p>

We have a number of community PRs still with active members, but most are waiting for reviews, which <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> is working towards.</p>
<h4 id="the-plan">The Plan</h4>
<p>A couple TWIMs ago we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/05/this-week-in-matrix-2019-07-05">teased</a> that Dendrite had a plan in the works. Well one meeting later and here is the proposal:</p>
<p>It will take a while for Dendrite to become feature complete with Synapse, but we‚Äôd like people to be able to actually use Dendrite before then. Instead of waiting for feature-completeness, we propose a set of milestones for Dendrite development to reach and prioritize development for.</p>
<p>These milestones are currently listed on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/milestones">Dendrite‚Äôs github</a>. The first is ‚ÄúBot Hosting‚Äù, which means, once complete, Dendrite would be suitable as a ‚Äúbot hub‚Äù, allowing server admins to run massive bridges on top of Dendrite while taking advantage of its horizontal-scaling capabilities. As written in the description, this goal includes basic CS API support, as well as federation with other homeservers. At this stage Dendrite should already be usable in rooms with other Synapse servers, which should make it a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>After that is several more milestones, each representing another use case that Dendrite can fill.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt be alarmed at the currently quite small percentage of completeness, as these milestones have just been built from the open issue list. We‚Äôre actually quite far along to #1 already :)</p>
<p>We also want to mention that the milestones aren‚Äôt completely built yet - there‚Äôs still a few more issues to comb through. It‚Äôs taken a few days as <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> can‚Äôt help himself to fix things as he goes along. A few open issues have also been closed as they had already been fixed earlier.</p>
<p>This is all mentioned in this week‚Äôs Matrix Live above by the way, so be sure to catch for some extra details if you‚Äôre interested.</p>
<p>We look forward to shipping you a working Dendrite soon‚Ñ¢. And as always feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!yjVgJUsMLYLAONsoii:jki.re?via=matrix.org&amp;via=privacytools.io&amp;via=ru-matrix.org">#dendrite-dev:matrix.org</a> for discussion.</p>

It only needs a username / password or access token, server fqdn and roomid as argument or provided by a configuration file. Arguments can overwrite settings from the file, for e.g. using same credentials but different channel. If no access token is provided, a new one will be requested and used to send the message. You can use the script for e.g. cronjobs, nagios notifications or ci pipelines. An example for a cronjob and a nagios notification script is also provided.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A bit of everything this week, we‚Äôve made changes to support the upcoming edits and reactions release, worked on soft log out, experimented with improving general perf for small homeservers, landed open tracing support, improved db query load.<br />
Next week we‚Äôll see about landing the small homeserver perf improvements, work on id hashing in sydent, fix some e2ee bugs (made easier to track down with OpenTracing), do some more database performance work and start gradually rolling out the new Sygnal instance.</p>

<p>Jason back on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix, <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">Construct</a> made the crazy-loading mode of client sync the default. Crazy-loading is an approach to initial sync that goes beyond lazy-loading for a better UX. It's even backwards compatible with clients that don't support lazy-loading.</p>
<p>Construct also made significant progress on implementing version 3 and 4 rooms during the week. This is nearly complete, and should be ready for testing by the weekend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good to know there is progress with new room versions as more and more rooms start to be moved over to v4. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#zemos-test:matrix.org">#zemos-test:matrix.org</a> for testing and more info.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jimmycuadra:matrix.org">Jimmy</a> provided <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/this-week-in-ruma-2019-07-07/">This Week in Ruma</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Work continues on the major revamp of ruma-events mentioned in the last update.<br />
...<br />
There are also a few modules that are somewhat blocked on an issue in ring. Some of the types in ruma-events contain types from ruma-signatures which don't implement Clone and PartialEq because they contain types from ring which don't.<br />
...<br />
Rust 1.36 was released, and it includes stabilization of the Future trait, one of the long-awaited building blocks for first-class async support in Rust. [...] the biggest reason for Ruma's development hiatus is waiting for async networking in Rust to mature, and this is one of the final pieces of foundational support we've been waiting for. The remaining pieces are async/await syntax, which is expected in either the next version or the one following it, and finally, waiting for important libraries like Hyper and Tokio, as well as web frameworks, to adopt the new stuff.</p>

<p>Also, the first block of E2EE functionality from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aa13q:matrix.org">aa13q</a> has been merged to libQuotient master - so far it's just uploading the keys but receiving messages is already well in the works!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack">the slack bridge</a> has had another RC release this week 0.3.0-rc2 which has been deployed onto matrix.org :). In other news, we are nearly done with the port of the bridge to Typescript (slated for the 0.4 release) which has allowed us to clean up the codebase significantly and <strong>splat</strong> a lot of bugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm for any movement toward TypeScript - seems to be a winner in the JS-world. Says Half-Shot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm a bit fanatical about Typescript, it's objectively better to write things in TS than JS if you have the freedom to do so. It's also allowed us to keep the bug count down on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">Discord bridge</a>, so I'm starting to look at the other bridges for typescript support too.</p>

<p>Thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kai:nasnotfound.de">Kai</a> for this update!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new Spec proposal <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2162">MSC2162: Signaling Errors at Bridges</a> landed! It is about adding permanent errors: The ability of bridges to mark events as not delivered to all participants. While there is already code supporting the feature, the Spec process is important for getting everyone on board and finding potential problems with the current approach.</p>
<p>In spite of being a relatively small proposal, there were already a lot of suggestions and directions in which it can evolve. Shoutout and thanks to everyone who already contributed to it with their comments!</p>
<p>Meanwhile on the more practical front a <a href="https://github.com/V02460/matrix-react-sdk/tree/reliable_riot">fork of Riot Web</a> was extended to now support the actual visual display of bridge error markings on messages.</p>

Also a lot of changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bubble shapes for pending events are fixed.</li>
<li>You can set device name when logging in. This becomes important as libQuotient begins to upload one-time device key as part of E2EE implementation.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Continuum now preserves media content URI (mxc://) internally in order to treat them specially, instead of converting to all URI to http (or https) upon receiving.<br />
This week's version never considers cached mxc resources stale and no network request will be performed for refreshing.<br />
Continuum also loads previews for http image links in text messages automatically. The usual http cache control rules are still followed in those cases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Riot v1.3.0-rc.1 is now ready for testing at <a href="https://riot.im/staging">https://riot.im/staging</a>. This includes some last minute polish of reactions and edits, and also adds initial support for soft logout. This release will have reactions and message editing enabled via configuration on riot.im once it stabilises.<br />
Self-hosted installs that wish to do the same would need to alter their config.json in similar fashion. This is because these features currently depend on unstable APIs, and we don't want to move them out of labs and fully on by default until that is resolved.</p>

<h3 id="riot-ios">Riot iOS</h3>

<li>Reactions with non-unicode keys</li>
<li>Original event in the edit history (need homeserver update)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upgraded rooms are now autojoined when tapping on the upgraded banner</li>
<li>File upload from the room screen and from the share extension</li>
<li>Crypto: logs have been improved and a script has been created to help to debug e2e bugs (see the screenshot at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/pull/692">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/pull/692</a>)</li>

<p>The playbook now contains a new <strong>Synapse Maintenance</strong> documentation page and an easy/safe way to run <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/synapse_scripts">synapse-janitor</a>.</p>
<p>To give an example, using <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/synapse_scripts">synapse-janitor</a> and a full Postgres <code>VACUUM</code> yielded a 29% reduction in disk space used by Postgres on my personal homeserver (5.3GB -&gt; 3.8GB).</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts-thought-balloon">Final thoughts üí≠</h2>
<p>I had/stole the idea to create a bot which uses message edits to send frames of an ASCII-art animation. I indeed created the bot, which works to a degree, but is quickly punished by rate-limiting, which limits the effectiveness.

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>'s work on <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> is interesting for bot or other client devs, and there is a new guide available: <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-matrix-bot-sdk">http://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-matrix-bot-sdk</a></p>
