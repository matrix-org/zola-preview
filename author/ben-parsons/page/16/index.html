<p>If you've spent any time using Matrix public rooms, you've probably seen the bot <code>DSN Traveller</code>. This is a post-grad project from Florian Jacob, an informatics student at the <a href="https://kit.edu/">Karlsruhe Institute for Technology</a>. This week, Florian handed in his thesis on Matrix!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, I could show that Matrix has few large but many small servers. Large servers reduce the overall network load, but a significant fraction of the load is concentrated in them. Introducing more small servers would further increase the load concentration. The Matrix event graph as a Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type showed to be well-suited for reliable messaging and history synchronization, and is applicable beyond Matrix.<br />I'm now working on a scientific paper on the results, which will boil down the more than 80 pages of the thesis to something much more digestible. ? You'll hear it in TWIM when that is finished!</p>
<p>Room for discussions: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dsn-traveller:matrix.org">#dsn-traveller:matrix.org</a><br />Website with more information on the DSN Traveller: <a href="https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/">https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really is exciting stuff! The thesis will be made available online in the future (we'll post it here.) Florian is also hoping to continue his work into Matrix research:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm currently in the process of trying to secure funding for a doctorate with Matrix as the topic, as that's where I can proof experience.</p>

<p>As you may know, although he's now back studying for the final year of his Computer Science degree, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> will continue to dedicate some time to bridge maintenance. He's been working on <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/irc-conntrack/">IRC Connection Tracker</a>, the next gen bridge for Matrix-IRC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IRC connection tracker has had yet more code and love applied to it. The headline changes are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>We now have a fully working IRC client that can connect to an IRCd, join channels and chat. These client's persist over &gt; the lifetime of the service.</li>
 	<li>There is a tool included with the service <code>ircctl</code> which allows you to spawn and use connections en masse. It also lets &gt; you list the state of the currently connected clients.</li>
 	<li>Work has just begun on a client library for connecting this up to the bridge, but should be swiftly completed thanks to…</li>
 	<li>A brand new spec website in the works for describing the protocol (thanks Brendan for pointing me in the right direction)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>This week in Fractal, more refactoring and small bugfixes. About 50 commits by 5 people, one of which made their first contributions this week (congrats Rasmus!).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@iamjsparber:matrix.org">Julian Sparber</a>, who was part of <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a> on the Fractal team, has been working on Room History:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The room history refactor I was working on for fractal is upstream, now we can start to improve how messages are displayed and make the loading of older messages better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Julian is also pleased to still be heavily involved with Fractal outside GSOC.</p>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/2018/09/24/synapse-0-33-5-released/">Synapse 0.33.5.1</a> was released with Py3 beta support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0.33.5.1 is an interesting release. On the one hand it contains the usual bug fixes and performance improvements of a point release, but it also our first versioned release where monolith installs can be run under Python 3.5 and 3.6! Python 3 support is very much in beta, so please be cautious but if you would like to try running under a py3 environment we'd love to get your feedback.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/avhost/docker-matrix/tags/">https://hub.docker.com/r/avhost/docker-matrix/tags/</a> for Python 3 docker images of Synapse, look for the <code>v0.33.5.1.dev.py3</code> tag.<br />Says <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mathijs:matrix.vgorcum.com">Mathijs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is functional, but much like python3 support it is still a work in progress, hence the larger size</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jan.christian:gruenhage.xyz">jcg</a> has set up hypertrix.ovh:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I spent last night setting up hypertrix.ovh, a matrix server only listening on <a href="https://docs.meshwith.me/">Hyperboria</a>, a cjdns based end-to-end encrypted IPv6 overlay mesh network. I'd be glad if someone could be found to peer and federate with me there! Registration is open, but your client needs to be connected to Hyperboria to be able to talk to the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are currently using Hyperboria, go join hypertrix.ovh, or start your matrix server listening on it, and go chat to JC!</p>
<h2 id="seaglass">Seaglass</h2>
<p>Lots of discussion about this project, specifically the question of how to efficiently render Rich Text. macOS does not make this easy, so a solution being considered is to use a WebKit for room rendering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebKit has the advantage of being super super fast on macOS, and also very low overheads<br />The current approach uses Cocoa NSTableViews and it's horrible because Apple clearly couldn't decide how they wanted them to work and therefore it's not very optimised<br />Moving to WebKit only adds about 16mb to the RAM usage and redraws far faster than the NSTableViews can when resizing etc, and we'll save a lot on the text formatting too which currently is a bit of a mess</p>

<h2 id="spec">Spec</h2>
<p>September was mainly spent cleaning up loose ends on the Spec after <a href="/blog/2018/09/03/matrix-spec-update-august-2018/">all the releases at the end of August</a>, and catching up on the never-ending maintenance burden of improving Synapse.  However, in October the plan is to to go back again to working full out on the S2S r0 release. Wish us luck...</p>
<h2 id="riot">Riot</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Lazy loading members is now on by default on riot.im/develop - reducing Riot's RAM by 3-5x.  Please give it a go and test it before we ship it in Riot 0.17 (probably next week) so we can iron out any last bugs (which will probably look like user profiles going missing)</li>
 	<li>Lazy loading also ships by default in Riot/iOS in Testflight 0.7.4 - if you want in on Testflight let us know in #riot-ios:matrix.org and we'll share an invite link!</li>
 	<li>Lazy loading in Riot/Android coming real soon now; it's behind a labs flag on the develop branch if you want to experiment.</li>
 	<li>Travis has started attacking the Riot/Web '<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/projects/12">First Impressions</a>' project (starting with unbreaking onboarding in Riot/Web when GDPR consent is enabled)</li>
 	<li>Lots and lots of UX work from Nad on E2E, Communities, Onboarding and the overall redesign, complete with a <a href="https://twitter.com/RiotChat/status/1044609832609861632">redesign workshop</a> with Jouni.</li>
 	<li>Aiming for end of Oct for first cut of redesign to be live as an experimental branch on riot.im.</li>
 	<li>Lots and lots of E2E implementation work in general; backups, cross-signing, and verification.</li>
</ul>

<p>Massive update from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> about his <a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">Jeon</a> project! This update brings Jeon into line with the most recent updates to the Client-Server, Application Service, Push and Identity APIs.</p>
<p>In ma1uta's words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeon is a set of the java interfaces and classes which describes the Matrix API.</p>
<ul>
 	<li>client-api: r0.4.0-1 corresponds to the r0.4.0 C2S API.</li>
 	<li>application-api: r0.1.0-1 corresponse to the r0.1.0 AS API,</li>
 	<li>push-api: r0.1.0-1 corresponds to the r0.1.0 PUSH API,</li>
 	<li>identity-api: r0.1.0-1 corresponds to the r0.1.0 IS API.</li>
 	<li>All artefacts available from the Maven Central Repository.</li>
</ul>
Major changes:
<ul>
 	<li>Full support for the corresponding Matrix api.</li>
 	<li>Changed version for displaying the Matrix api version.</li>
 	<li>Added support to the asynchronous responses.</li>
</ul>
Also updated the swagger schemas generated from the code:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/c2s.json">https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/c2s.json</a> - C2S API</li>
 	<li><a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/as.json">https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/as.json</a> - AS API</li>
 	<li><a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/push.json">https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/push.json</a> - PUSH API</li>
 	<li><a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/id.json">https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/id.json</a> - IS API</li>
</ul>
And the first hotfix: application-api r0.1.0-2 with fixed url (/transactions has been changes to the _matrix/app/v1/transactions). And this release will break all AS because synapse sends transactions to the old url.

<h2 id="voip-signalling-support-has-landed-in-libqmatrixclient">VoIP signalling support has landed in libQMatrixClient</h2>
<p>Exciting times for <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a>!! Thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>, developer of libQMatrixClient and <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After some pretty long time of being in a PR/fork, VoIP signalling support has landed in libQMatrixClient! Many thanks to mariogrip (the founder of UBports) for the initial code and to delijati (a developer behind <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a>) for getting it to work with the most recent library.<br />The actual VoIP stack does not come included, client developers have to take whatever WebRTC implementation is available for their platform and glue the pieces together. However, as the example of uMatriks shows, this now becomes relatively easy if your platform is on good terms with WebRTC (like UBports). I look forward to further work with UBports community on keeping this platform a first-class Matrix citizen.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/djmaze/synapse-purge/">synapse-purge</a> tool allows homeserver admins to free disk space by purging old room events from the synapse database.

<p>Erik's state compressor tool is pretty much finished, we've been starting to run it on things and it reduces disk usage for the state group table by at least 10x.</p>

<p>Rendering performance has been massively increased (if you ignore the occasional bug). Resizing the window shouldn't be so slow anymore and a lot of avatar image operations are no longer repeated unnecessarily</p>
<p>Other than that this week has mostly featured lots and lots of bug fixes, hopefully lots of crashes fixed.</p>

<h3 id="riot-web-0-16-4-released">Riot Web 0.16.4 released</h3>

<h3 id="matrix-js-sdk-v0-11-0-released"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">matrix-js-sdk</a> v0.11.0 released</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/releases">This release contains</a> support for lazy loading room members, and also some breaking changes relating to <code>startClient()</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>Support for lazy loading members. This should improve performance for users who joined big rooms a lot. Pass to <code>lazyLoadMembers = true</code> option when calling <code>startClient</code>.</li>
 	<li><code>MatrixClient::startClient</code> now returns a Promise. No method should be called on the client before that promise resolves. Before this method didn't return anything.</li>
 	<li>A new <code>CATCHUP</code> sync state, emitted by <code>MatrixClient#"sync"</code> and returned by <code>MatrixClient::getSyncState()</code>, when doing initial sync after the <code>ERROR</code> state. See <code>MatrixClient</code> documentation for details.</li>
 	<li><code>RoomState::maySendEvent('m.room.message', userId)</code> & <code>RoomState::maySendMessage(userId)</code> do not check the membership of the user anymore, only the power level. To check if the syncing user is allowed to write in a room, use <code>Room::maySendMessage()</code> as <code>RoomState</code> is not always aware of the syncing user's membership anymore, in case lazy loading of members is enabled.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Synapse 0.33.4 <a href="/blog/2018/09/11/synapse-0-33-4-released/">was released</a>, with a whole host of bug fixes, some enhancements to resource usage management and a bunch of internal changes in readiness for room member state lazy loading and our ongoing port to Python 3.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Python 3 support for monolithic (non-worker) Synapses has finally landed on the develop branch, thanks to massive work from hawkowl and notafile - if you want to help us test and flush out any remaining byte/utf8 style errors, please create a virtualenv for python 3.6 or 3.5 (twisted doesn't support 3.7 yet) and point the develop branch of Synapse at it, tail the logs for ERRORs and report them via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues">Github</a> if/when you see them.  In practice it seems pretty stable though, and noticeably reduces RAM and speeds things up thanks to improved GC and general performance work in Python.</p>
<p>We've also discovered that <a href="http://jemalloc.net/">jemalloc</a> works <em>very</em> well at improving RAM usage on Python 2 under Linux (we haven't tried it on Python 3 yet) by providing a more fragmentation-resistant malloc implementation; if you are having problems with your Synapse RAM spiking up we recommend giving it a go.  All of the Matrix.org server is using it now.</p>
<p>Also, lots of ops work this week; Erik has prototyped a <a href="https://github.com/erikjohnston/rust-synapse-compress-state">new storage strategy for state groups</a> which shrinks storage requirements by 10x, we'll be applying this shortly to Matrix.org otherwise we're going to run out of disk space.  There was also a regression on Synapse develop on federation, where outbound requests would get stuck and never retry - this impacted the matrix.org server badly over the course of the week, but as of Friday night we have a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3875/files">workaround</a> in place.  We're not aware of it affecting anyone other than the matrix.org deployment (and we haven't got to the root cause yet).</p>
<h2 id="construct-homeserver-progress">Construct homeserver progress</h2>
<p>This week:</p>

<h2 id="irc-connection-tracker">IRC Connection Tracker</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> is continuing to work on the project to split out IRC connection management from the IRC bridge, letting the bridge be restarted without interrupting IRC connections!</p>
<p>The project is going quite well, and is going to be used on matrix.org once production ready which will really speed up upgrades and give us near zero downtime indifferent to the size of the bridge.</p>
<p>At the moment the project has the ability to spin up and maintain connections, however the connections are not supporting IRC fully yet as there are bits to do on the parsing and maintaining state side. There is also work on a top-like tool to visualise and control the service outside of the bridge so we can quickly handle any oddities if they come up. Finally, it allows you to hot reload the configuration without dropping existing connections!</p>
<p>On the work done to support this on matrix-appservice-bridge, there is basic support for stating connections on the bridge but it's in early stages at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="spec">Spec</h2>
<p>Travis has been tidying up loose bits on the Matrix spec this week:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>experimenting with splitting out the "Room" specific bits of the spec into a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1669">dedicated section</a> rather than being split between the CS and SS APIs;</li>
 	<li>trying to pin down a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1607">formal grammar for room aliases</a></li>
 	<li>...and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1598">identifiers in general</a>.</li>
</ul>
In practice, finalising the S2S API is now blocked on proving the implementation on Synapse; work on this will resume next week and then we'll document the end result and ship the r0 at last.  Timings are going to be completely determined by available manpower and what level of ops distractions we face (c.f. the Synapse section above...).  Whilst we're waiting for the final S2S details to get hashed out, Travis is going to be helping on Riot dev, to try to stop <a href="https://twitter.com/amarendra/status/1040782285807603714">stuff like this</a>, as there's no point in having the platonic ideal of a perfect spec if actual users are unable to benefit from it.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev:matrix.org</a> was reborn as a new room a couple of weeks ago to flush out old corrupted events, but maybe not everyone knows.

<p>Finally, there's been a massive amount of work on the <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a> side of things to soft-launch <a href="https://modular.im">Modular</a> - a paid hosting platform for Matrix servers (and, in future, paid integrations).  At this point we're looking for early adopters who want a dedicated Riot+Synapse for communities or companies of 50 or more users - but don't want to have to run it themselves.  Modular takes the homeserver hosting we've already been providing for <a href="https://chat.status.im">Status</a>, <a href="https://tadhack.riot.im">TADHack</a> and others, and turns it into a mass-market product.  The pricing for early adopters is over 5x cheaper than Slack, so if you've been dying to have a reliable, fast and expertly maintained homeserver without any of the headaches of admining one yourself, please head over to <a href="https://modular.im">https://modular.im</a> and give it a whirl and let us know how it goes!  This is also a great way to support Matrix development in general, as money from Modular will directly keep the core Matrix team funded to work on Matrix.  Once we're happy with the soft-launch and have incorporated any feedback we'll start yelling about it as loud as we can :)</p>
<h2 id="matrix-live">Matrix Live</h2>
<p>We've had a bit of an accidental hiatus on Matrix Live thanks to getting submerged all the different project endgames happening atm (spec releases, lazy loading, Modular, Riot redesign etc), and for the last few Fridays we've got to midnight and beyond with too much still on the todo list to justify recording a video.  But to avoid completely falling behind, here's a slightly exhausted Saturday morning update instead (warning: Matthew is not a morning person).</p>

                <p>Recently I've been working to improve some of the content on the <a href="http://matrix.org">matrix.org</a> website.</p>
<p>Firstly <strong><a href="/docs/guides/faq">the FAQ</a></strong> now has updated content and a more presentable menu.</p>
<p>We have a <strong><a href="/docs/guides/">Guides Index</a></strong>, which includes a clarified guide list, plus links to off-site contributions from the community. It's possible to click &quot;recommend&quot; on these items if you've had a good experience with them. If you have documentation or guides you'd like to see added to the list, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">contact me on Matrix</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org">make a pull request on the site repo</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, as part of a programme to improve visibility on projects in the Matrix ecosystem, we are introducing the &quot;<strong><a href="/docs/projects/clients-matrix">Matrix Clients Matrix</a></strong>&quot;. This is a list of some of the most popular current Matrix clients in the ecosystem today, and should shed some light on current feature statuses! The list is not exhaustive, and if you would like to see your client project included, please <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">contact me at the same address</a>, or come chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-clients:lain.haus">the Matrix Client Developers community room</a>.

                <h2 id="the-spec">The Spec</h2>
<p>As many know, we've been aiming for the end of August to cut the first ever stable releases of the remaining APIs in the spec which have up to now been marked unstable - i.e. providing a snapshot of the spec which correctly matches the reference implementations (other than implementation bugs) and which can be used in isolation to develop production grade implementations of clients, servers, etc without need to reference any other implementations. There's been a massive sprint to pull this together, and as of the time of writing there are still <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr">PRs and commits</a> landing every few minutes.  We'll post a full update on our progress on Monday; meanwhile you can see a sneak peek over at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/1">August 2018 r0</a> project board.</p>
<p>Spec work has completely precluded any other backend dev this week.</p>
<h2 id="half-shot-gone-but-not-really-gone">Half-Shot, gone but not really gone</h2>
<p>This week we <a href="/blog/2018/08/31/so-long-half-shot-thanks-for-all-the-bridges/">say farewell</a> to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>, who has been working fulltime on bridges over the summer. He has managed the matrix.org bridges largely single-handedly, with a big focus on the often-volatile IRC bridge(s).</p>
<h2 id="bridges">Bridges</h2>
<h3 id="matrix-appservice-irc-0-11-0">matrix-appservice-irc 0.11.0</h3>

<h3 id="whatsapp">WhatsApp</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been working on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> bridge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>now bridges a lot more stuff, such as formatting, media and replies. I'm also almost done with desegregating users so that Matrix users join the same group chat portals rather than everyone having their own portal to the same chat</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="zulip-chat-bridged-by-zulip">Zulip chat, bridged by Zulip</h3>
<p>Matthew discovered there is a Matrix-Zulip bridge on the Zulip side. So if you're running a Zulip server (for some reason), and want to bridge with Matrix <a href="https://zulipchat.com/integrations/doc/matrix">check out the integration docs here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="irc-connection-tracker">IRC Connection Tracker</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> created a new component to enhance the reliability of IRC-Matrix bridging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/irc-conntrack">IRC Connection Tracker</a> is a thing now. It's a project to separate out the IRC connections from the appservice so the two can be run independently, so that restarting the appservice doesn't affect the IRC connections. It's hopefully going to allow bridge stuff to run faster when it's done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This project is still really early stage. You can take a look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NZRdUYHWltq9rh-nFZeSp3FYwtQQh5vBxa6Lw8YNtCo/">Proposal document here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fractal 3.29.92 got released and we are freezing strings to give GNOME translators a bit of time to complete translations for 3.30 next week. Latest developments include tweaks for the title bar, misc bug fixes, a new presentation for uploaded files (that are not images, those are still displayed inline) with buttons to download or open them.
Development builds are now parallel installable for easier testing and CI has been improved.</p>

<p>Today marks my last day of my 3 month internship at New Vector (the startup which hires many of the core Matrix team). For those of you who haven't been reading Ben's fabulous blog posts, I've been working exclusively on bridges; in particular the IRC bridge.</p>
<p>Tasked with the goal of making it crash less and run faster, I hope that the evidence is visible and people are generally having a better experience on it!</p>
<p>Some stats pulled from the matrix-appservice-irc repo:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>39 PRs closed (4 remain open)</li>
 	<li>27 issues closed, 27 issues opened.</li>
 	<li>334 commits, averaging 7.6 commits a PR.</li>
</ul>
Commits this year:
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3506" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/commits_year.png" alt="Commits this year" width="751" height="179" />
<hr />
<p>But aside from showing off some stats, I wanted to mention all the new features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Replies on Matrix translate well to IRC, or as well as IRC allows.</li>
 	<li>People mentioning your IRC nick now ping your matrix user, finally!</li>
 	<li>So. Many. Metrics. Everything you wanted to know about the internals of the bridge, but were too afraid to <code>--inspect</code>.</li>
 	<li>Not spamming homeservers with join requests on startup (it makes for a happy ops team).</li>
 	<li>No longer are IRC users shackled to a "(IRC)" extension on their displayname, you can be who you want
with group flairs!</li>
 	<li>Support for node 4 has been dropped, and support for 6,8 and 10 has been assured.</li>
</ul>
On the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> side, I optimised some calls to cache locally and avoid hitting the homeserver too often, and disabling presence for homeservers that don't support it.
<p>There are future plans to make bridging more visible to Matrix Clients as a first class citizen. Ideas like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1410">speccing a state event (MSC1410)</a> so that bridges can interact with each other properly and clients can create full bridge management views which are still decentralised from an integration manager.</p>
<p>I'd like to give a shoutout to Travis who has reviewed nearly all my changes that have made their way into the bridge, on top of all the other tasks he has on his plate. And of course a thank you to all of the Matrix team who have been very supportive during my time here.</p>

<h3 id="riot-mobile">Riot Mobile</h3>
<p>New releases are imminent for both Android and iOS:</p>

<h2 id="shared-secret-auth-and-matrix-corporal">Shared Secret Auth and Matrix Corporal</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> has been working on several operations tools for Synapse. Firstly <strong><a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth">Shared Secret Auth</a></strong> password provider module for Matrix Synapse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It allows external systems (which know the shared secret) to easily obtain access tokens for any user hosted on the homeserver. This is incredibly useful for all sorts of automation (no more pre-generated access tokens or plain-text passwords).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this tool, you can pass a mxid, and get back an access_token for that user. With this, you can do whatever actions would normally be done with a token. For example, you for a new starter at a company, you could join a set of rooms known to be needed by new starters.</p>
<p>Support room for Shared Secret Auth: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth:devture.com">#matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth:devture.com</a></p>
<p>Next, he has released <a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal">Matrix Corporal</a>, reconciliator and gateway for a managed Matrix server:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a way to take control of Matrix (Synapse) in a corporate (or other such) environment.<br />Based on a configuration policy (generated by an external system, like your intranet), it can auto-create and auto-disable users, keep their profile and authentication details to date, auto-join/leave users to communities and rooms, etc.<br />It's also meant to sit in front of the Matrix Synapse Client API, inspecting and allowing/denying requests, in accordance with the configuration policy (preventing people from leaving certain rooms/communities, preventing them from messing around with their profile details, etc.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that Slavi also maintains <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>, which can deploy these projects along with Synapse itself.</p>

<h3 id="twimbot">twimbot</h3>
<p>I was extremely young when I first read and understood Larry Wall's explanation about the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris">virtue of laziness</a>, but I did not expect it to lead here. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> has created (I think inspired by an idea from <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>), a &quot;<a href="https://github.com/Cadair/skill-twim">twimbot</a>&quot;. This bot works in conjunction with <a href="https://opsdroid.github.io/">opsdroid</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/connector-matrix">opsdroid connector-matrix</a> - it works by storing selected messages from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> in room state. In this way, it either assists the author by making it easier to produce the blog post you're reading, or it coldly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45240758">replaces the author</a>, leading to his sacking and penury.

<h3 id="hashtag-bot">Hashtag bot</h3>
<p>When he's not working away on the Matrix Spec, <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> continues to work on less [essential|sane] Matrix projects.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> will only be working full time with the Matrix Core team for another week (!!!), but until then he's going full-speed with bridge work. First <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">matrix-appservice-irc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just pushed out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/blob/release-v0.11.0/CHANGELOG.md">matrix-appservice-irc 0.11.0-rc3</a> which contains a lot of nice things.

</blockquote>
<p>Having worked so much on IRC bridging the last few months, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has this week managed to make improvements to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Released matrix-appservice-bridge 1.6.0 which contains mostly things I was writing for the irc bridge and factored out instead. There's a couple of goodies like automatic caching of profiles/events, and getEvent as a way to fetch events from the homeserver without fiddling with context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Full changelog: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/1.6.0/CHANGES.md">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/1.6.0/CHANGES.md</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some <code>Intent</code> operations now cache requests that would otherwise fall through
to the homeserver which can be expensive. This is configurable for <code>Intent</code>s
via the <code>opts.caching.ttl</code> and <code>size</code> options.
AgeCounters now allow you to set your own time period buckets.
Added a new function <code>Intent.getEvent</code> which will fetch events
from the homeserver without any context information, which should
be quick.
<code>MembershipCache</code> is now exposed to let folks read and write to the cache
while also letting the bridge access it.</p>
<p><code>a</code> release: Fix issue where <code>roomState</code> would fail.
<code>b</code> release: Fix issue where we were calling this.intent <em>inside</em> intent like fools!
<code>c</code> release: Fix issue where some stole js-sdk code was not checked thoroughly.</p>

<h3 id="whatsapp">WhatsApp</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> announces that <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> &quot;is now somewhat usable for basic chatting&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It uses the <a href="https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp">go-whatsapp</a> library to talk with the WhatsApp Web API. Using the web API means that you'll still need WhatsApp on your phone connected to the internet, but it also means you won't get banned for using the bridge.<br />The bridge is still very alpha, but basic message bridging and some advanced features already work. There's a <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp/blob/master/ROADMAP.md">features &amp; roadmap</a> document about that.</p>

<p>There were two releases last week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0.4.6 with additional commands (follow, unfollow, mute, unmute, block, unblock users, show followers and followings of the specified user) and a little bugfix.</p>

<p>Jason writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Construct has advanced to fully asynchronous disk IO in a single-threaded environment.<br />RocksDB is a highly configurable and customizable database with a very large callback surface to support many different environments, which is good to connect it with something like AIO.<br />Normally RocksDB gets its performance from concurrent standard POSIX system calls (blocking IO) with multiple threads. The callback surface and its internals are not specifically suited for deviating from the pthread model. However I hacked RocksDB and tricked it into believing that my userspace contexts, which mimic the <code>std::thread/pthread</code> interface, are threads.<br /><a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/blob/ac3b45604a8e7c6e4a8d3b3d84d62bfbc1070c46/ircd/db.cc#L4336">This is an example of a RocksDB callback to read from a file</a>, it expects this callback to return immediately (i.e as soon as the kernel returns from a blocking read(2).) Except, where I call <code>fs::read()</code> that is actually a stack-suspension which makes a request to linux AIO where the stack resumes after AIO has called back with the data (see: <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/blob/master/ircd/aio.cc">https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/blob/master/ircd/aio.cc</a>)<br />No modifications to the internals of RocksDB were necessary.

<h2 id="spec">Spec</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> continues to plow through work in documenting, clarifying and confirming the spec. You can check out his project on Github: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/1">August 2018 r0</a>, which should give an idea of both the scale of the project and the amount of work which has been done. Rather than list out individual items as I have been, please take a look at that project, and come chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> if you'd like to contribute.</p>

<h3 id="seaglass-builds-being-generated">Seaglass builds being generated</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass">Seaglass</a>, the MacOS-native client, now has <a href="https://bintray.com/neilalexander/Seaglass/Seaglass#files">automatically generated builds available on bintray</a>.</p>
<p>Seaglass is now a very usable and stable client on macOS. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">neilalexander</a> has been very active this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seaglass has had various updates, including the groundwork for joining and leaving channels, LOADS of crashes fixed, some more work done on avatars and E2E encryption has been fairly well road-tested now
Still need to complete UI for device verification and setting E2E but it works fine in existing channels</p>

<h3 id="quaternion">Quaternion</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has been working on <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quaternion has gained a new way to highlight mentions - with tinted background instead of colored text. Also, the majority of work on rooms grouping is done, and the current master branch features the roomlist grouped by tag (but rooms under each tag are pretty much out of order so it's not really ready for daily use yet).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quaternion is looking for a macOS packager - if someone has the chance to help out in this area, speak to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!PCzUtxtOjUySxSelof:matrix.org">#QMatrixClient</a>.</p>
<h3 id="palaver">Palaver</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@arne:matrix.localtoast.de">Arne</a> came at us with the v0.2.1 release of <a href="https://gitlab.com/MrCustomizer/palaver">Palaver</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few days back Palaver has been moved to Gitlab. And I have since released v0.2.0 and v0.2.1. A runnable jar-file of the latest release can be downloaded at <a href="https://gitlab.com/MrCustomizer/palaver/tags/v0.2.1">https://gitlab.com/MrCustomizer/palaver/tags/v0.2.1</a>. The biggest changes in v0.2.x are the replacement of all the web views with native JavaFX components (as I don't feel comfortable embedding a whole browser stack in a desktop application) and support for read markers. There is a short YouTube video demonstrating the read marker implementation:</p>

<p><a href="http://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> has been working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/matrique-go">Matrique</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> is continuing to make progress on his Java-focused collection of APIs and SDKs, he's eagerly awaiting the r0 release of the spec (aren't we all!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeon (https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon) (client2server and application api) has released on the Maven Central Repository with version 0.4.1. The next goal: the stable release of all apis 1.0.0 after the Matrix spec will be released (I hope it will be soon :))
Jmsdk (https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk) the client and bot SDK have released on the Maven Central Repository.
Gene (https://github.com/ma1uta/gene) the lightweight api for android has released on Maven Central Repository with 0.2.1 version.
So, everyone can use this libraries without additional settings and additional repositories.
Matrix-Jabber-Bridge (https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-jabber-java-bridge) the double-pupped bridge between the Matrix and Jabber. I am still working on it and I think it will be released in a few weeks.</p>

<h3 id="mautrix-appservice-go">mautrix-appservice-go</h3>
<p><a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has a new, yet-to-be-revealed project, and in support of this he's been working again on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-appservice-go">mautrix-appservice-go</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-appservice-go">mautrix-appservice-go</a> is a bit more active again: it now has an initial intent API similar to the one in <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-appservice-python">mautrix-appservice-python</a> (which in turn is based on the intent API from matrix-appservice-bridge).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>No release this week, but Synapse has been progressing:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Python 3 port continues at pace, we expect to have a beta to test in monolith mode rsn (Hawkowl leads this)</li>
 	<li>Erik has been working on some federation API refactoring to make matrix.org snappier and hopes to have the new state resolution algo ready to go if not deployed late next week</li>
 	<li>Richvdh has been looking at performance, as well as spec PRs/ Next week will be r0 work</li>
</ul>
Many Synapse maintainers are also doing huge lifts on development of the spec.
<h2 id="matrix-support-now-in-ntfy">Matrix support now in ntfy</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> took a rare 30-minute window away from bridge maintenance to add Matrix support to <a href="https://github.com/dschep/ntfy">ntfy</a>. ntfy describes itself as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A utility for sending notifications, on demand and when commands finish</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but in fact, you also send notifications whenever you like by calling <code>ntfy send</code> from anywhere you'd normally execute shell commands. This will make it really easy to integrate Matrix notifications into any other application!</p>
<h2 id="matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> brought updates to matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:</p>

 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd">mxisd</a> Identity Server support (enabled by default)</li>

Non-Matrix-related aside: as a lazy Brit, I was vaguely aware of the cultural weight language carries in the history of Scandinavia, but didn't realise that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language#Bokm%C3%A5l_and_Nynorsk">Norway still has some fundamental differences</a> ongoing.</p>

<p>As part of an overhaul of the documentation surrounding Matrix, I'm planning to launch a &quot;Community Guides Index&quot;. This will be a page or section on Matrix.org with links to useful and informative documentation hosted elsewhere. If you have or know of informative articles, please <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">let me know</a>, or share them in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#TWIM:matrix.org</a>.</p>

<h3 id="quaternion-new-redacted-message-handling-options">Quaternion: new redacted message handling options</h3>
<p>Many of you will have seen the incredible volumes of spam plaguing Freenode over the last few weeks. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">Kitsune</a> has added new features to <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> to help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In response to the recent spam deluge from Freenode Quaternion has got an option to tidy up your timeline after all the spam-cleaning: you can hide all redacted messages or just those that came from recently joined users (along with the join message). So as long as the spammer gets moderated, it can become inexistent for you.
The experimental code doing that will eventually be moved to <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> for the benefit of <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/matrique-go">Matrique</a>, <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a> and other clients based on the library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is especially cool: moving functionality to the lib for the benefit of other projects makes me very happy. :D</p>
<h3 id="fractal-gsoc-write-ups">Fractal GSOC write-ups</h3>
<p>Eisha and Julian finished their <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a> Fractal involvements this week, and Eisha has a blog post recounting her experience: <a href="https://eishagsoc.wordpress.com/2018/08/09/my-final-report-for-gsoc-2018/">My Final Report for GSOC 2018</a>.

<h3 id="riot">Riot</h3>
<p>Big updates are on the horizon for both iOS and Android, with 0.7.0 of iOS headed to TestFlight today with a release due once it's through beta &amp; AppStore review.  More details once the releases are out!</p>
<p>Meanwhile on Riot/Web, Lazy Loading members is pretty much complete - just writing end-to-end tests to ensure that encryption still works well when lazy loading is enabled.  Next up is actually progressing the redesign at last!</p>

 	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1497">MSC1497</a></strong> thorough discussion happening against Matthew's proposal for Capabilities support in the CS API</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">MSC1442</a></strong> though you may have seen it previously, I recommend anyone who is able to take a look at Erik's "State Resolution: Reloaded" proposal. This documents his "thoughts on the next iteration of the state resolution algorithm that aims to mitigate currently known attacks". It very clearly explains the current problem, and the proposed solution. While heavy, I found it really useful for helping to understand State Res and everything it affects.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1485">MSC1485</a></strong> <a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> proposes "Hint buttons in messages", which effectively provide pre-defined responses for users. This is especially valuable for Bots which can only accept a certain range of replies.

<h2 id="apis-and-sdks">APIs and SDKs</h2>
<h3 id="gene-minimalistic-client-server-api-for-matrix">Gene, minimalistic client-server api for Matrix</h3>
<p>Not strictly this week, but we missed it before. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> has been working away on his Java-based Matrix suite. <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/gene">Gene</a> is a more lightweight API implementation than <a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">Jeon</a>, covering all of the current C2S spec. A big motivation is to be able to use Gene on Android, which is not possible for Jeon due to it having more dependencies.</p>
<h3 id="ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby Matrix SDK</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby Matrix SDK</a> now has auto-generated, proper documentation, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ananace/">Ananace</a>. v0.0.2 is the current release, but it's under active development and v0.0.3 is expected presently.</p>
<h2 id="telegram-puppeting-on-t2bot-io-with-mautrix-telegram">Telegram Puppeting on t2bot.io with mautrix-telegram</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> has rolled out <a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> bridge for everyone on <a href="https://t2bot.io">t2bot.io</a>'s bridge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a public trial to see how the bridge copes with multiple people puppeting their accounts. Of course, you don't need to puppet your account unless you want to.
For more information on how to set this up, please visit <a href="https://t2bot.io/telegram">https://t2bot.io/telegram</a></p>

<p>As part of this project, mautrix-telegram 0.3.0 release candidate was released.</p>
<h2 id="informo-project-releases-saltstack-states">Informo project releases SaltStack states</h2>
<p>vabd, from the <a href="https://github.com/Informo/">Informo</a> project, arrived to say they have produced &quot;a set of SaltStack states that includes deploying fully working Synapse homeservers: <a href="https://github.com/Informo/salt-states">https://github.com/Informo/salt-states</a>&quot;</p>
<p>They introduce the Informo project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Informo's a project (still a work in progress, currently) that aims at bypassing censorship of information on the Internet, by basically having news items go through a decentralised and federated network made of Matrix homeservers. Since we need to host nodes to this network (at least for testing purposes), we've worked on a working and automated infrastructure using <a href="https://saltstack.com/salt-open-source/">SaltStack</a>, which involved hand-writing a few SaltStack states, including states handling the installation and configuration of working Synapse homeservers. In the spirit of giving back to the community, we're publishing all of those hand-written states (available at the GH link above) under the GPLv3 license. If you want to discuss with us about what we're doing, or this topic specifically, please join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discuss:weu.informo.network">#discuss:weu.informo.network</a> ?
The project is still pretty much a WIP and the technical specifics (even the ones we already implemented in our projects) are still under discussion and subject to changes (as mentioned in the GH repo's readme). All I can add for sure to what we already say is that we'll be working in partnership with NGOs to promote the project in countries where the press is heavily censored, and we're planning on implementing a cryptographic verification chain of some sort to reduce the risk of intentional disinformation.</p>

<h2 id="synapse-0-33-2">Synapse 0.33.2</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/2018/08/09/synapse-0-33-2-is-here/">Synapse 0.33.2 is out now</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The release focuses on performance, notable highlights include reducing CPU consumption through speeding up state delta calculations and reducing I/O through lazily loading state on the master process
Separately work continues on our python 3 port and we hope to have something concrete to trial very soon – we're really excited about this and expect step change improvements in CPU and memory use.</p>

<p>Latest synapse is now available on Debian thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrew:shadura.me">andrewsh</a>.</p>
<h2 id="room-tagging">Room Tagging</h2>
<p>This is not from this week at all, other than that it was new information to me. Actually it's ancient, matrix-wise, but I think it's interesting for those who don't know! Although Riot doesn't have an interface for adding custom room tags (&quot;Favourites&quot; and &quot;Low Priority&quot; come by default), Matrix supports arbitrary strings as room tags, and will display them if you add them via another CS API call. To facilitate this <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> created <a href="https://gist.github.com/turt2live/697d5b3781fb7ab7e11d704ea90e3dbe">a small script, tag_room.sh</a>, which makes it very simple to set your own room tags.</p>
<h2 id="fin">FIN</h2>
<p>That's all folks! Remember, lots of progress is happening with the Spec, if you want to be involved or follow along the best place to start is by joining <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>No Matrix Live this week due to vacation and general scheduling fun; sorry!</p>
