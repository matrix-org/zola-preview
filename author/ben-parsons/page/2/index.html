<p>We missed it at the time, but wanted to share in TWIM. <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/">Terence Eden</a>, noted UK technologist, shared a <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2021/05/msc-first-assignment-technical-and-digital-leadership/">thorough, compelling argument for the UK Government to use Matrix as a foundation for the digital workplace</a>.</p>
<p>This is a long read, but a detailed argument. Also please note that this is was produced for the purpose of an MSc course of study, it was not commissioned for any other purpose, as the preamble makes clear.</p>

<h3 id="beeper-update">Beeper update</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been a month since our last update. A lot of the work since then has been on making everything more reliable, but we've also added new features to our clients and started making some new bridges.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added thread UI for Slack-bridged rooms. Internally they're just replies like before, but the client will intelligently collapse replies in Slack rooms into threads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merged upstream Element additions like voice messages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also merged some features that aren't in Element yet, like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/5814">Giphy integration</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Released Beeper iOS to Testflight.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added grouping rooms by chat network based on the <code>m.bridge</code> state event. The UI is similar to spaces, but they're not actual Matrix spaces (yet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for Android 11's &quot;conversation&quot; notifications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bridges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Android Messages is turning out difficult to reverse-engineer to a sufficiently reliable level, so we're building a new SMS bridge into our Android app. It'll also be available as a standalone open-source app, which already exists at https://gitlab.com/beeper/android-sms (but doesn't have any setup instructions yet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've funded development of a LinkedIn bridge. sumner will post a more detailed update about that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We're hiring React, iOS, Android and SRE/Devops engineers. If you're interested, check out https://angel.co/company/beeperhq or DM <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@eric:beeper.com">Eric Migicovsky</a>.</p>

<p>Bruno has been working on aggregations as part of his work for Hydrogen. He reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been cleaning up the relations MSCs, finding a balance between documenting the current state and not losing track of community concerns. I've started with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC 2674</a> which is the very basic format of relations, and will move on to annotations/reactions (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2677">MSC 2677</a>) next week.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>An experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms</a> (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9247">#9247</a>) as part of Element's work to fully <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/30/welcoming-gitter-to-matrix">integrate Gitter into Matrix</a>.</p>

<h3 id="linkedin-matrix-bridge">LinkedIn &lt;-&gt; Matrix Bridge</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sumner:sumnerevans.com">sumner</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm excited to announce that I started working on a new bridge for bringing LinkedIn messages to Matrix! It's currently in the early stages of development and not production-ready. The current feature set includes: backfill from LinkedIn, user name and profile picture sync, message sending from Matrix -&gt; LinkedIn, and real-time message puppetting from LinkedIn -&gt; Matrix. There's much more to come, and you can join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#linkedin-matrix:nevarro.space">#linkedin-matrix:nevarro.space</a>  for updates. Development is being funded by Beeper, and is being designed with integration into Beeper as it's primary goal. However, the bridge is open source (Apache 2.0) and will be available to self-host. The source code is here: https://github.com/sumnerevans/linkedin-matrix.</p>

<p>Great work from Sumner! Glad to see people have the <em>option</em> to bridge their LinkedIn messages!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line/">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Better LINE-&gt;Matrix read receipt bridging is now supported in the <code>testing</code> branch! The bridge now checks all LINE chats (not just the most recently-used one) to see if messages you sent have been read (in LINE). This works by cycling through all LINE chats where the final message is posted by you and doesn't have a &quot;Read&quot; marker on it yet (or for multi-user chats, if your last message hasn't been read by everyone in the room).</p>
<p>With that, I'll consider the bridge to be in Early Beta! üéâ I'm now testing the bridge for myself to iron out a few kinks, and am preparing a PR to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/">matrix.org</a> webpage to have this listed on https://matrix.org/bridges/.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello World! I am here to bring you Nheko news!</p>
<p>We merged the Spaces branch, which means Nheko master can now show some spaces. Peeking unjoined rooms, nesting spaces and creating them should be coming soon. We are also looking into how to fit knocking into the UI (we already rendered incoming knocks in the timeline for a while).</p>
<p>You can also now edit still pending messages, which should help if your server is slow and you notice a typo. The edit will then get queued and be sent as soon as the server acknowledges they received the original message. Apart from that there have been some improvements to the readability of the room list and some other UI elements.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we switched out our entire http backend from Boost to Curl. For that I wrote a <a href="https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/coeurl">simple wrapper around Curl</a>. This fixes about 10 issues around connection shutdown, brings proxy support, http/2 and http/3 support and in general makes Nheko crash less and reduces latency a LOT! This will obviously cause some pain for packagers, but I hope it isn't too bad. Some of the issues this fixes only had 2 digits in our bugtracker and one was even filed by benpa!</p>
<p>Have a nice weekend everyone! ‚ô•</p>

The second BoF was more about NeoChat and Quotient and we discussed how to move forwards with some problems (e.g. non-hacky text input auto-completion) but also the roadmap around E2EE, Spaces and Widgets support. Speaking about E2EE, we will have some very good news to announce next week, stay tuned!</p>

They also got rid of a papercut from the login form: before his intervention, users needed to provide the full homeserver URL with the <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> scheme prefix. It will now <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/780">default to HTTPS</a>.</p>
<p>We also did some housekeeping work that should improve the experience for people joining us on the Fractal Next fun. After being away for a while, Christopher Davis came back with a patch to add a couple more build related directories to our <code>.gitignore</code>. Julian cleaned up the pseudo-milestone description that we had in the README, now that we have a proper <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/milestones/18">Gitlab milestone</a>. And finally, I added <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/777">a warning on the login screen</a> to better reflect on the Work In Progress state of the branch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello dear Synapse Admins, <code>synadm</code> v0.30 is out. lt seems I was in &quot;story telling mode&quot; already when I wrote the release notes yesterday. That should perfectly suit a TWIM article as well üôÇ So there you go, copy/pasted from https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/releases/tag/v0.30 with love:</p>
<h4 id="new">New</h4>
<p><code>synadm</code> finally got some nicely rendered documentation pages hosted at https://synadm.readthedocs.io.</p>
<p>&quot;Login as a user&quot; admin API support:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm user login &lt;user id&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.user.html#synadm-user-login">Have a look at the new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>New subcommand <code>matrix</code>supporting execution of regular Matrix commands. As a first shot a command to issue any Matrix API call has been implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix raw endpoint/url -m post -f data.json</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix raw endpoint/url -m put -d '{&quot;key1&quot;: &quot;value1&quot;}' --prompt</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.matrix.html#synadm-matrix-raw">The new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that this is meant to be a convenience function in case a Synapse homeserver admin wants to quickly help users e.g set specific settings available via regular Matrix calls and not the Synapse admin API directly. Also note that it is not meant to replace the awesome Matrix CLI tools that are already out there. matrix-commander, matrixcli to mention just a few.</em></p>
<p>The second command below <code>matrix</code> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix login &lt;user id&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.matrix.html#synadm-matrix-login">The new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It implements a plain login on a Matrix server using username and password. It can even be used to retrieve a token for an admin user, e.g helpful for setting up fresh <code>synadm</code> installations. <a href="https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#getting-an-admin-token">Read about it here</a></p>
<h4 id="improved">Improved</h4>
<p>The README has been updated to point to the nicely rendered docs recently published at https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html</p>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>

<p>Currently working towards 1.0 release so mostly bug hunting and improving existing code and features.</p>
<p><strong>Call for mutual help!</strong> The plumb feature needs more testing on busy IRC channels. If you need to plumb public Matrix rooms and IRC channels on <em>any</em> IRC network that does not have a public bridge available or just want to use a relaybot on IRC side for some reason hit me up on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#heisenbridge:vi.fi">#heisenbridge:vi.fi</a> and we can setup a test plumb, free of charge! Only requirements are that I can lurk around to monitor how it works and there's nothing offensive on-topic.</p>
<p>In other news @warthog9 <a href="https://opensource.com/article/21/6/irc-matrix-bridge-znc">submitted an article to opensource.com</a> how to use ZNC and Heisenbridge together to keep using your existing IRC bouncer with Heisenbridge as a client for it. Pretty cool stuff!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hola everyone! Today we're releasing the latest in bridge greatness, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.27.0">matrix-appservice-irc 0.27.0</a>. This release contains the bulk of our work done for libera.chat. As always, thanks to the community for testing, writing up issues and creating PRs so that we can build better bridges to our friends on other networks.</p>
<p>The highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Username/password SASL authentication support. The bridge now lets you set a !username.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridge operators can now choose to block messages in the I-&gt;M direction while Matrix users are not joined to IRC as a privacy preservation technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now configure the bridge to publish rooms to the public room directory (rather than the appservice directory). The bridge can now also use the whole alias namespace (e.g. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#foo:libera.chat">#foo:libera.chat</a> -&gt; #foo).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numerous bug fixes and quality of life fixes!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is now live on libera.chat, and will be live on the other bridges very soon!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Even more read receipt improvements are here! In summary, with the magic of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a>, the bridge shouldn't ever &quot;view&quot; a LINE chat on your behalf in order to sync a message (which would send a read receipt to your chat contacts, even though you didn't read the chat yourself). For LINE messages that require viewing its chat in order to be bridged, like images/stickers (to get the image) and messages in multi-user chats (to know who sent them), the bridge instead sends a &quot;placeholder&quot; message that gets updated with the real LINE message content when you view the placeholder. That way, the bridge will only view a LINE chat when you view its Matrix portal.</p>
<p>A few stability fixes have been pushed as well. Namely, <code>sync</code> should be less likely to accidentally skip chats.</p>
<p>Only one final read receipt improvement remains, for LINE-&gt;Matrix read receipt bridging (which I mentioned last week): to make the bridge check all LINE chats (not just the most recently-used one) to see if messages you sent have been read (in LINE). This will work by cycling through all LINE chats where the final message is posted by you and doesn't have a &quot;Read&quot; marker on it yet.</p>
<p>Once that is taken care of, I'll consider the bridge to be in beta! üéâ</p>

<p>After some fixes the bot is now back in shape. This means that all Rooms should again have the correct names from now on and accept invites again. Be aware the bot currently doesnt support encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>As a side effect also https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/spaces now found 3x the rooms as before.</p>
<p>Also the webpage got a big overhaul which brings a lot more mobile phone friendliness :) So you can finally properly use it on your phone as well.</p>
<p>Another change is that tombstoned rooms now get filtered from the list to keep it clean.</p>
<p>For developers a API reference is now available at https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/api</p>
<p>Also if you use the apis please note that the content is gzip encoded. The server currently doesnt respect the <code>Accept-Encoding</code> Header.</p>
<p>On the side of internal changes is now that the retries are limited to 5 times instead the previously buggy amount. This should reduce join requests from my server drastically.</p>
<p>For people usings the /servers api endpoint there is also now a include_members option. This means https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/servers?include_members=true</p>

<p>Hi everyone! Did you ever feel lost in the Matrix world? The room directory is big, but it's still hard to find something you like. Or are you a room
moderator, but there is not much activity in your room because it doesn't have enough users?</p>
<p>This is why I want to share rooms (or spaces) I find interesting.</p>
<hr />
<p>This week's room is: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#art:matrix.org">#art:matrix.org</a></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Share your artwork and drawings and chat about it. You don't have to be good!&quot;</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>If you want to suggest a room for this section, send an email to</p>
<p>roomoftheweek@koesters.xyz or a Matrix message in
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#roomoftheweek:fachschaften.org">#roomoftheweek:fachschaften.org</a></p>

<p>I have spent quite a bit of time lately working on Pinecone network convergence for P2P Matrix. There's still quite a bit to do in order to call Pinecone &quot;complete&quot;, but a network of 50 nodes now bootstraps entirely from cold much more quickly and converges on full end-to-end reachability in roughly 6 seconds. This is a significant improvement to before! Keep an eye out for future P2P Matrix demo builds using these new protocol changes.</p>

<p>üö™ Knock, knock... It's Friday!</p>
<p>After over a year of work and over a hundred commits, we're now one <em>major</em> step closer to supporting <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC 2403: Add &quot;Knock&quot; feature</a>, which allows users to request admission to rooms which would otherwise be invite-only. Specifically, last Wednesday we merged (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6739">#6739</a>) which is an experimental implementation of the MSC, under an unstable prefix. Knocking is not available in any current room versions ‚Äî we need to implement room version 7 for that ‚Äî but the remaining work is minimal¬π compared to what it took to get to this point. üôÇ Major kudos to Sorunome, Anoa, and Clokep for their work on both the spec and implementation.</p>
<p>Otherwise we're looking forward to releasing Synapse 1.36 early next week, and we have some great things in store... but I'll not spoil them today! ü§´</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, just a quick update on the Libera.chat bridge situation. We're still rapidly working on the bridge, the milestone highlights for this week are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nearly 6k Matrix users are now connected to IRC and growing by the minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're midway though our #matrix* Freenode to Libera channel/bridge migrations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FOSDEM has been migrated over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're still working through our backlog of migration requests from users, a lot of you phoned in!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We're still continuing to rapidly work on the bridge, with a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases">release expected</a> on Monday ü§û. For any of you who aren't in the know yet, you can start bridging to libera.chat by simply joining a channel like <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libera-matrix:libera.chat">#libera-matrix:libera.chat</a> or by searching the <code>libera.chat</code> room directory.</p>
<p>I'm hoping we'll be nearing the end of our journey on this bridge, and it will settle into a natural stable state over the coming days! Anyway, thanks everyone for your patience and we hope to see you on Matrix or IRC!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi bridge followers, today we've released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.27.0-rc1">0.27.0-rc1</a> of the IRC bridge containing a huge number of changes following all the work we've been doing on libera.chat. Notable things to call out in this release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We've refactored the node-irc library to be typescripty and modern, rather than the quite old JS that it was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SASL support for username/password auth has landed, which hopefully means a smoother login process for many. (We're aware of some issues around setting usernames, watch this space)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing you to spin up the bridge with complete control over the alias namespace of a host (e.g. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libera:libera.chat">#libera:libera.chat</a> links to #libera).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally, a privacy feature to block incoming IRC messages when Matrix users are not all joined which is requested by some IRC networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please report bugs as you see them to https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc, and let's all pray this will be a smooth release :)</p>

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Read receipt improvements are here! They are in temporary branches until they've been tested for stability:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>better-receipts-dm</code> branch contains some smarts to prevent Puppeteer from having to &quot;view&quot; a LINE DM chat in order to sync it, which would make the contact you're DMing think you've read their messages when it was really Puppeteer that &quot;saw&quot; them. However, this doesn't work for non-text messages (like images) or messages in group chats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>better-receipts-msc2409</code> branch (which extends the above branch) uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> to detect when you read a bridged message on Matrix, so it can tell Puppeteer to view it on LINE on your behalf. This will let your LINE contacts know when you've read their messages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After this, only a few read receipt improvements are left to be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make Puppeteer check all LINE chats (not just the most recently-used one) to see if messages you sent have been read (in LINE). This will work by cycling through all LINE chats where the final message is posted by you and doesn't have a &quot;Read&quot; marker on it yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use MSC2409 to avoid having to view a LINE chat when syncing non-text messages (like images). The idea is to send a placeholder message that will get replaced with the real message (which requires Puppeteer to view the LINE chat) only when you actually view the placeholder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've been slowly refactoring the room and communities list to prepare it for spaces. This work is now mostly complete, changing ~4000 lines of code, of which 1500 just got deleted. All of the sidebars are now expandable and collapsible, so you can see the full name of your tags and communities and the lists should also update more dynamically now. Startup also only takes half as long as before on my system and Nheko uses 100MB less memory for my account. Next week I'll probably add spaces to the communities list as well as the room list.</p>
<p>Apart from that LorenDB has been rewriting the member list as well as the invite dialog in Qml and manu has been making progress on the room directory. All of that seems to be coming along nicely and behave much more reasonably than the old versions. There has also been a lot of progress on the Italian and Esperanto translations as well as a few smaller bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>I hope we will make it to space next week!</p>

<p>I just learned that in a poll of 89 universities in Germany, Matrix ranked third place in the chat category already. </p>
<p>The source is in only available in German, unfortunately: https://zenodo.org/record/4817795</p>
<p>However, the conclusion list (first table) may be understandable from context. It lists the top three solutions per category with their respective number of universities using it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@oleg:fiksel.info">Oleg</a> clarified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The evaluation was &quot;which solution are you using&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@florian:dsn.tm.kit.edu">Florian</a> added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Instant Messaging part starts at slide 15, the first chart on that slide is &quot;which solution do you use&quot;, the second is &quot;How content are you with the solution?&quot;, with Matrix having the best average of all solutions, namely ~8.8/10.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>

<p>This week the Spec Core Team has been reviewing various Spaces MSCs, most recently <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3230">MSC3230</a> (Space ordering). We're also hoping to square away the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issuecomment-655153491">aggregations MSCs</a> (message editing, reactions, etc) once and for all, though this will likely take a concerted effort from a few members to pull off.</p>
<p>Finally <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">MSC3231</a> is a (currently draft status) MSC from Callum, one of Matrix.org's <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021">GSoC students</a> this year! His project aims to allow native token-based registration to homeservers (the idea is so that you can generate a few tokens from your registration-disabled homeserver and hand them out to a few trusted friends and family members).</p>
<p>And finally, work still continues on finishing up the technical portions of the new release process for the spec. As mentioned last week, we've attempted to split the work up over multiple people in order to get it done quicker. Slowly but surely...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another round of updates on my smart caching media proxy. After refactoring a lot (as always), I implemented <strong>thumbnailing</strong>! Now the only big feature left to add is url previewing.
I also have a test deployment configured on media.pixie.town now, so you can try fetching a bit of remote media through there, or view <a href="https://media.pixie.town/_matrix/media/r0/download/media.pixie.town/GLhyjFL8MPAzz5Oh1gIzF3lQ">this submissions screenshot</a></p>

<h4 id="comparison-with-matrix-media-repo">comparison with <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/">matrix-media-repo</a></h4>
<p>While they both implement Matrix' media endpoints, they serve rather different niches, where matrix-media-repo fully decouples the media repo aspect, my proxy cooperates with Synapse's filesystem and database, to speed up operation while ultimately making it a seamless drop-in and removal process.</p>

<ul>
<li>Send a bridge notice when getting unexpectedly logged out of LINE, to warn you to log in again.</li>
<li>Improve resiliency of LINE user avatar syncing.</li>
<li>Properly support syncing LINE rooms with participants who aren't in your LINE friends list (This was harder than it sounds...!)</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes (and ones before it) will be merged to <code>master</code> once I reorganize some messy commits.</p>
<p>The next big task is still to fix outbound read receipts (i.e. to make it so that the bridge syncing a message doesn't make your &gt; LINE contacts think you actually read that message). Once that is done, I'll consider the bridge to be in beta.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@freaktechnik:humanoids.be">freaktechnik</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://thunderbird.net">Thunderbird</a> now has Matrix support based on <code>matrix-js-sdk</code> enabled in the Nightly builds.</p>
<p>The star feature is probably that we support multiple Matrix accounts in the same client. Right now all your unencrypted rooms with text messages should work fine. While we think we won't destroy your account's state, it's still recommended to use a testing account with it. During account setup, it will ask you for a password, even if the homeserver supports SSO. If you intend to log in through SSO, just leave the password field blank.</p>
<p>We're not quite at the point where we support all the things you love about chatting with Matrix. Many of the missing features and polish to make communication successful are tracked in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1712710">this meta bug</a>. The goal for that milestone is to enable Matrix in our Beta builds.</p>
<p>You can get a Thunderbird Nightly build at the bottom of <a href="https://thunderbird.net/#channel">thunderbird.net</a> by switching from &quot;Beta Channel&quot; to &quot;Nightly Channel&quot;. If you run into bugs with the Matrix integration, please report them through <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Chat%20Core&amp;component=Matrix">this form</a>. When filing a bug, please include debug logs. You can copy the debug logs for the account by going to the &quot;Show Accounts&quot; dialog, right clicking the account and selecting &quot;Copy Debug Log&quot;.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Callum, our GSoC student, after spending some time on Synapse, had now his first go at Nheko's codebase. He implemented, that you can now just enter the server name on registration instead of the full URL. This means entering conduit.rs or matrix.org works now nicely, since those servers are actually hosted at a different URL. He's now working on the Token Registration MSC, which he will implement in Synapse and Nheko, so exciting times ahead!</p>
<p>We also had a small contribution from pcworld, who fixed that if you only viewed the room list in the narrow layout, you would not get notifications for the last selected room.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with some words, that you may have heard a few times already: &quot;Watch this space for next weeks update!&quot;</p>

<p>On <strong>August 21-22</strong> the annual <strong>Fr</strong>ee and <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>S</strong>ource <strong>Con</strong>ference (short <a href="https://www.froscon.de/">FrOSCon</a>) will take place. Usually the conference takes place in a German University of applied Sciences Bonn Rhine Sieg. This year it will be virtual. On the positive side - we don't need to travel.</p>
<p>As German Matrix community grows this is a great opportunity to meet each other and hack together.</p>
<h4 id="matrix-dev-room">Matrix Dev Room</h4>
<p>We are planing to do a virtual Dev Room this year. The idea is to exchange on the latest Matrix development and projects, get to know each other and drink <code>&lt;your_favorite_beverage&gt;</code> (virtually) together. üòâ</p>

<p>Language: preferably German, but English is also ok</p>
<p>Submission <a href="https://www.froscon.de/news/einreichefrist-fuer-vortraege-verlaengert/">is until 2021-06-11</a>, but <strong>please give us feedback ASAP so we can create a plan</strong> now.</p>
<p>If it's your first talk or workshop some free of charge coaching is included. üòâ</p>
<p>Also help in organizing the Dev Room (moderation, timekeeping) is needed.</p>

<p>As announced in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021#fractal">the general Matrix GSoC post</a>, we are lucky to get two interns this year again. Alejandro (whose previous work includes <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/626">switching to matrix-rust-sdk for syncs</a>) will implement multi-account support, while Kai (also <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;state=merged&amp;author_username=V02460">a regular contributor</a> by now) will help bring our application rewrite to the same functionality level as our current nightly and stable versions. Both projects will build on top of Fractal Next.</p>
<p>Julian came back from his vacation and immediately got quite busy reviewing and merging contributions from others. Kevin (also known as zecakeh) and him made good progress on several fronts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Room handling was improved. We now keep track of whether the user joined them, left them, or has been invited to them, as well as their categories (favourites, low priority‚Ä¶).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sidebar uses these categories and now uses a single list with <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/git/docs/gtk4/struct.FilterListModel.html">GtkFilterListModels</a> instead of one list per category. The greatly simplifies code for things like moving a room from one category to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>History style has been tweaked, state events and timestamps have been added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown can be enabled from the newly implemented popover and the message composer offers syntax highlighting, although a bug currently makes it so that sent messages are still not sent with a <code>formatted_body</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A persistent state store is used to load rooms on startup while sync is in progress.</p>

<h3 id="ruma">Ruma</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ruma.io/">Ruma</a> is a set of Rust library crates around Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org">jplatte</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've been quiet in the past weeks, but certainly not due to lack of activity! So many awesome things have happened, I don't even know where to start. I guess I'll go chronologically:</p>
<p><strong>We published so many new crate releases.</strong> Most of our crates didn't see non-alpha releases for almost a year and now we've finally reset that counter! Now you can depend on <code>ruma 0.1</code> and get bug fixes and new functionality through <code>cargo update</code> without having to worry about breaking changes. Huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a> for automating our release process, without that this would have taken so much longer.</p>
<p><strong>We got initial spaces support!</strong> I'm super excited that we're now enabling client authors to take spaces into account, even if &quot;taking into account&quot; will initially just mean filtering out space rooms from their room lists. Code-wise, this was actually a <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/585">relatively small change</a>, with ruma-client-api receiving support for room types and ruma-events receiving support for the event types <code>m.space.child</code> and <code>m.space.parent</code>.</p>
<p><strong>We're swapping out ruma-signatures' crypto library.</strong> Since <code>ring</code>, which is what we've been using so far, doesn't currently support cross-compilation to WASM, there's long been some interest to exchange it for something else for webbrowser homeserver experiments. A viable alternative library was identified a while ago and now <a href="https://github.com/ShadowJonathan">@ShadowJonathan</a> has taken on the task of <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/589">implementing the switch</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to unblocking the WASM usecase, this work <a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring/issues/1299">revealed a bug in <code>ring</code></a>, which generated invalid PKCS#8 documents. We are pretty confident that once the switch away from <code>ring</code> (including a small compatibility shim to convert the invalid documents), a certain class of signature verification failures that Conduit has been getting will be fixed.</p>
<p><strong>We're taking part in GSoC again.</strong> As you might have seen in the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021">earlier blog post</a>, two students are working on Ruma as part of GSoC this year: <a href="https://github.com/Frinksy">@Frinksy</a> (for the first time) and <a href="https://github.com/DevinR528">@DevinR528</a> (for the second time).</p>

<p><a href="https://t2bot.io/spacebot/">spacebot</a> makes quick work of the conversion by translating as much as possible to the Space structure. Simply DM the bot and say <code>!convert +group:example.org</code> and it'll go off and make your Space.</p>
<p>The bot doesn't invite everyone from your Community to your Space, giving you a chance to configure the Space further before advertising it within your rooms.</p>
<p>The source can be found on <a href="https://github.com/t2bot/groups-to-space-bot">GitHub</a> if you feel like running your own or seeing how simple it is under the hood. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#spacebot:t2bot.io">#spacebot:t2bot.io</a>  is a great place to get help if you're having problems getting it going, and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#help:t2bot.io">#help:t2bot.io</a> would be glad to assist you if the t2bot.io deployment doesn't do the right thing.</p>
<p>P.S.: Spaces are currently considered Beta in Element, so they might not be perfect just yet. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#spaces:riot.ovh">#spaces:riot.ovh</a> is the room to join if you have questions about Spaces.</p>

<p>Due to a bug with my homeserver or synapse it happens for some rooms that synapse generates a lot of join events (Lots of &quot;server_stats bot made no change&quot; messages). If you see this please write a message to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev">MTRNord</a> so I can manually prevent my bot from trying to join the room over and over again as I cannot easily detect this kind of issue before joining. </p>

<h3 id="devin-ragotzy-ruma-s-automated-checks">Devin Ragotzy: <em>Ruma's Automated Checks</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>My name is Devin Ragotzy. I am a student at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan, studying computer science. I was lucky enough to work last summer on Ruma and have continued to contribute to the project. I was accepted to work on Ruma's automated checks project, mentored by Isaiah Inuwa, Jonas Platte, Timo K√∂sters. The goal of the project is to create a linter capable of enforcing Ruma-specific style and practices. I hope to get this tool to a working state by the end of this summers GSoC!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abhinav Krishna C K from NSS College of Engineering in Palakkad, India will be working on Building First-Class email bridge for Matrix this summer mentored by Half-Shot and tulir. This will enable Matrix to be connected with Email by translating incoming SMTP traffic to Matrix messages, and then bridging Matrix messages back into emails.</p>

<h3 id="frinksy-extend-ruma-s-api-coverage">Frinksy: <em>Extend Ruma's API coverage</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>My name is Adam Blanchet, and I am a student from the University of York in the UK.<br />
I am happy to say that I have quite a few mentors: Isaiah Inuwa, Jonas Platte, Timo K√∂sters and Nico from Nheko.<br />
My project is to extend Ruma's API coverage. I'll be doing a few things: finishing coverage of the Identity Service API, adding the &quot;knock&quot; feature to Ruma and finishing the implementation of QR code verification. If time allows it I will also work on implementing other MSCs or features such as &quot;Event notification attributes and actions&quot;. I hope that my work will help enable other Rust-based Matrix projects, such as Conduit and Fractal, to implement more features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Timo added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, I am Timo K√∂sters. I study Computer Science in Germany and spend most of the remaining time developing Conduit, a Matrix homeserver built on top of Ruma. I use Ruma all the time and will be mentoring Adam Blanchet to make it even better.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="vladyslav-hnatiuk-pyquotient">Vladyslav Hnatiuk: <em>PyQuotient</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>My name is Vladyslav Hnatiuk, I'm a student  of Vienna University of Technology and my project is PyQuotient.<br />
The aim is to simplify creating of a Matrix Qt-based clients in Python by providing Qt-based SDK and avoid writing a large part of functionality manually. And to not reinvent the wheel PyQuotient will be bindings for the existing library libQuotient that provides SDK for Matrix for C++ applications. I'll be mentored by kitsune, the author of libQuotient and also libQuotient-based Matrix IM client Quaternion. I hope PyQuotient will facilitate the development of Matrix clients in Python with Qt, and it will be a small contribution to the promotion of Matrix, especially in Python world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>kitsune added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this experience proves to be successful, there‚Äôs a good chance Quaternion will eventually switch to Python.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="callum-brown-token-authenticated-registration">Callum Brown: <em>Token Authenticated Registration</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi there, I'm Callum, a Londoner who'll be starting a physics degree in September. For GSoC I'll be working on adding Token Authenticated Registration to Matrix. This will allow homeserver admins to restrict who can sign-up by requiring a token to be submitted during registration. I run a small homeserver for friends and family, but don't have the resources to make registration public, so I have wanted this feature integrated into Matrix servers and clients for quite a while! I'll be working with Nico, anoa, and red_sky to write an MSC, implement the server side in Synapse, and the client side in Nheko. Thanks to the mentors and Matrix.org for the opportunity to work on this!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can follow along with this project's progress throughout the program at https://calcuode.com/matrix-gsoc/.</p>
<p>Nico, mentor added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nico here, one of the Mentors. Personally I am super excited about this project! I have been using Matrix for a while now and I think Nheko is pretty good by now. But there is still a barrier, if I want my friends and family to use Matrix: They can't easily sign up! I have tried creating them accounts and telling them to change their passwords, having a dedicated registration page or just telling them to just use a different server, but nothing of that made me happy and it added friction to the already hard process of getting someone to try a new messenger! As such I am super excited for this, because it will make signing up your friends and family to your personal instance, without it having to be public, sooooo much simpler!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="jaiwanth-exporting-conversations-from-element">Jaiwanth: <em>Exporting Conversations From Element</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Jaiwanth Vemula from the IIT Kharagpur University in India will be working on Exporting Conversations in Element this summer, mentored by Michael (t3chguy). This work will enable users to easily export their conversations for archival or sharing, this is a feature which has been missed in Element for a very long time!</p>

<h2 id="fractal">Fractal</h2>
<p>There are also <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5276176043474944/">two projects under the GNOME organisation</a> with students working on Fractal, a Matrix client for GNOME.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alejandro Dom√≠nguez: <em>Fractal: Multi account support</em></li>
<li>Kai A. Hiller: <em>Fractal NEXT</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="students-become-mentors">Students become Mentors</h2>
<p>I asked: <em>how many of those who are mentors this year have ever been GSOC students?</em> The answer is that this year four of the mentors were once GSoC students themselves!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some combination of me, Kegan, Bruno and neilalexander have been working on v3 of the CS /sync API. (Today's /sync API in matrix is v2; v1 was the old /events API).  We're not yet at the point of publishing a draft or MSC, but it's coming soon. It's really exciting work which flips Matrix around so that sync scales independently of the number of rooms you're in - and it's at last possible to write rich clients which only ever sync the bare minimum data needed to work: i.e. lazy loading eeeeeeeeverything.  Watch this space :)</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>

<h4 id="merged-spec-prs">Merged Spec PRs</h4>
<p>Here are all the actual MSC-related changes made to the raw Matrix spec this week!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3179">Clarify that implementations can use stable prefixes once an MSC proposal has merged</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>There's been activity from the Spec Core Team on a number of different MSCs, such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3189">MSC3189</a> (per-room/space profile data). Additionally a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3168">spec PR</a> for Matrix URI schemes has been getting feedback and is moving forward at a quick pace! There was also some feedback from the team on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2448">MSC2448</a> (blurhashes) which I'll get around to answering shortly üôÇ.</p>
<p>Otherwise I think this week was a bit implementation-heavy for the team (the Spec Core Team is a task in addition to our full-time jobs). Hopefully next week will grant us more of a breather.</p>

<p>Goooooooood afternoon folks and happy Friday! This week we're announcing the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.26.0">0.26.0</a> release of the matrix-appservice-irc bridge which contains precious goodies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can now <strong>disable</strong> the kick behaviour of the bridge on Matrix users if you are running a personal bridge, so losing your IRC connection no longer results in a kick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now remove bridges from rooms by using the admin room, so no need to use the provisioning API or modify the DB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've added a new feature to allow you to specify bridge options on a per room basis using room state. At the moment you can modify the limits of the automatic pastebin system but more features like reply formats are to come!</p>
</li>

<p>As always please come tell us about it in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#irc:matrix.org">#irc:matrix.org</a> and make sure to check out the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-appservice-irc">new docs</a> if you get a bit stuck.</p>

<p>The first iteration of visually representing the data gathered by Server Stats Discoverer (traveler bot)  is now publicly available at https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/</p>
<p>It for now is only a graph of room relations but in the future is supposed to be extended for a server based graph as well as a Table to search your room within.</p>
<p>Be aware that the page is best viewed and used on desktop. Clicking a Room Node will open a new tab with the matrix.to link. If this fails this might be because of no canonical alias being available.</p>
<p>For the developers the data can be taken from https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/relations  The format currently is only available in the d3js format but in the future that API also will be extended for different usecases.</p>

<p>Otherwise the Spec Core Team has been doing a little bit of house-keeping. For those that have been living under a rock, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">Spaces</a> is an upcoming feature intended to replace the old Groups/Community stuff with a much-improved implementation. And one that will actually make it into the spec! We've closed all old groups-related MSCs as they are now obsolete.</p>
<p>Additionally we've been giving some feedback on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946</a> (Spaces Summary) which is another part of the Spaces puzzle (and is still a blocker for the release of the feature), as well as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3079">MSC3079</a> (Low Bandwidth CS API) which allows Matrix to operate on resource constrained devices and networks. Yours truly has also been making some PRs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3180">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3179">two</a>) to help clarify the Spec process.</p>

<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a release! <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/05/synapse-1-33-0-released">Synapse 1.33 is out</a>, and we plan to release a security patch for it on Tuesday, May 11th. This follows our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/discussions/9914">previous discussion</a> where we committed to trying to decouple routine security updates from our regular feature releases.</p>
<p>Read the release notes for details, but the big news is that we finally have experimental support for moving presence off of the main process. We're still testing it, but we hope it will allow instances that need presence to more easily scale out.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/04/30/this-week-in-matrix-2021-04-30#synapse">last week's TWiM</a> we shared a graph of Synapse's memory use when joining Matrix HQ for the first time. In particular, we saw a spike to 1.4 GB before settling at 800 MB.</p>
<p>In the week since producing that graph, we've managed to nearly eliminate the spike, halving it to 760 MB. After backfilling history, the room settles at around 650 MB:</p>

<p>These changes are still a work in progress, but we hope to get them merged into Synapse in time for the 1.35 release on June 1st.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> has a request:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a patch for synapse, that reduces the size of almost empty incremental syncs by 50% (30% if you include http headers). If you are a client developer, you may want to test your client against a synapse with that patch applied, since it broke quite a few clients, that relied on synapse sending empty fields. While synapse sends empty fields, other server implementations, like conduit, don't, so fixing any issues here will help with portability across different server implementations too. With a bit of hope this patch can actually be applied in a few weeks to the official synapse, but it was backed out from the next RC because of the breakage. So if you can, please test your client, which you are developing, against the following PR and fix any issues you experience from it: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9919</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

Setup instructions are on docs.mau.fi: https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/imessage/ios/setup.html</p>
<p>Brooklyn was developed by ethanrdoesmc. It's an app/tweak that handles communicating with iMessage and runs mautrix-imessage as a subprocess for the Matrix side.

<h3 id="fluffychat">FluffyChat</h3>
<p><a href="https://fluffychat.im">FluffyChat</a> is the cutest cross-platform matrix client. It is available for Android, iOS, Web and Desktop.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">krille</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FluffyChat 0.30.0 has been released</p>
<p>In this release we have mostly focused on bugfixing and stability. We have switched to the new Flutter 2 framework and have done a lot of refactoring under the hood. The annoying freezing bug should now be fixed. Voice messages now have a new backend which should improve the sound quality and stability. There is now a more professional UI for editing aliases of a room. Users can now see a list of all aliases, add new aliases, delete them and mark one alias as the canonical (or main) alias. Some minor design changes and design fixes should improve the overall UX of the app exspecially on tablets.</p>
<p>Version 0.30.0 will be the first version with arm64 support. You can download binaries from the CI and we will try to publish it on Flathub. Together with the new Linux Desktop Notifications feature, this might be interesting for the Librem 5 or the PinePhone. Sadly I don't own one of these very interesting devices. If you have one, I would very like to see some screenshots of it! :-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shiny:shine.horse">Shine</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fluffychat update: Native Fluffychat Linux build now works well on aarch64 devices!</p>
<p>If you want to try the binary from CI, keep in mind that GDK_GL=gles needs to be set to force it to use the OpenGL ES. Flatpak build on Flathub already has it set up and works out of the box.</p>
<p>Some distributions can have issues with input fields and virtual keyboard, making it look like the input is set up as right-to-left. To my understanding, it's an issue of certain older GTK versions with Flutter.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now should stop showing you actions, that you can't do anyway, because that is confusing and useless. This includes the following and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Invite members, if you have no invite permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete messages, if you don't have redaction permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send a message, reply to one, edit one and more, if you can't even send the message!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell us, if we missed something or we removed an action, that you actually have permissions to do!</p>
<p>Apart from that we also started working on some of the features for the next major release. That release will mostly focus on bringing End-to-End-Encryption out of beta. As a first step, Nheko now shows if a message was sent from a verified device or not. This has 3 different trust levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>green</strong>: The message is from a device you verified. Either by device verification or cross signing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>greyish</strong>: The message is from an unverified device, but that user has never rotated their master signing key and has cross-signed that device. As such we can probably assume, that this is a trusted device. For extra safety, you should of course verify that user, but if it is just an internet personality you will never meet, you trust you are speaking to the right party anyway and can't really verify them anyway, since you don't know how they look either! We don't want to prompt users with red warning signs in such cases, which will lead to them not doing verification properly, because they just want the red marks to go away. Many people are also not interested in the MITM aspects of E2EE. We think this is an okay tradeoff, but any feedback is welcome of course! This is basically Trust On First Use (TOFU), if you heard that term before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The device is not verified. This can have a few reasons. Either we verified the user, but they didn't verify that device. Or we didn't verify that user and they have changed their master key at some point. Or the signatures for that device are wrong, etc. If you see such a device, you should probably investigate, why that is the case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some biggish changes, so if you experience issues, tell us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a>!</p>

<p>The German IT platform Heise has conducted an interview with the university of Innsbruck which chose Matrix/Element over Microsoft Teams. Reasons: it's free, decentralized/federated, expandable and secure.</p>

<p>We've opened up a new room for MSC authors to come and ask about the MSC process, as well as for review and feedback on their MSC ideas over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a>. If you're unsure what the next steps for your MSC are, or aren't sure whether an idea would make sense for inclusion in the Matrix Specification, then this room is the perfect place to ask about it. Come on by!</p>
<p>In terms of MSC work, Spaces remains one of the most active topics in the spec this week, with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a> finally reaching Final Comment Period! A lot of work went into writing and reviewing the MSC, as well as crafting the implementation - so congratulations to everyone involved! Of course, any concerns can still be raised over the next 5 days by anyone before the proposal is ultimately merged to the spec.</p>
<p>There are a number of changes being merged to the spec as we move swiftly towards the next major Spec release. Those that have merged this week are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3154">MSC2403: Knocking and MSC2998: Room Version 7</a></p>

<p>We expect to release 1.33 on Tuesday; more on that next week.

For example, we see a graph like this when joining Matrix HQ:</p>

<p>At a first pass, we're aiming to significantly reduce the initial spikiness of that graph, and we <em>think</em> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9910">#9910</a> will help with the subsequent slow ramp up in memory.</p>

<p>Announcing a new bouncer style Matrix IRC bridge to <em>bridge</em> the gap between IRC and Matrix in a way that's easy to configure and manage by homeserver administrators for small scale deployment.</p>
<p>Meet Heisenbridge https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge ü•≥ (it's a Breaking Bad reference ü§¶)</p>
<p>It's written in Python and started off as an experiment if it's possible to create a somewhat well performing stateless IRC bridge that's practically almost zero configuration. It quickly found a use case of being able to join !channels on IRCnet that hasn't been possible in the past.</p>
<p>Intended target audience are people who run their own homeserver and would like to transition from a combination like ssh+irssi to pure Matrix (with weechat-matrix, of course!) but still keep IRC close without losing the &quot;fine details&quot; of the protocol that happens when plumbing a room properly.</p>
<p>As the bridge is written by someone who doesn't really know Python help is much appreciated in the form of filing issues, sending pull requests or just discussing about it on Matrix to tell how you would like to use it!</p>

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line/">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inbound read receipts! But with a view caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Receipts are only fetched for the &quot;most recently active&quot; room.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example: if you send a message in room A, then room B, receipts will only be fetched for room B and not room A, until you (or someone else, from LINE) posts in room A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will be fixed in the next update. I have an idea for some Puppeteer trickery to get it working.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read receipts in group chats are bridged as annotations (reactions) instead of &quot;real&quot; read receipts, until all members of the chat have read a message.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because LINE's read receipts for group chats don't tell show <em>who</em> read a message, but only <em>how many</em> people a message was read by.</li>
<li>To capture this in Matrix, instead of sending read receipts for a group chat message, the bridge puts a reaction of &quot;Read by #&quot; on it, with &quot;#&quot; matching how many people read the message so far. Once everyone in the chat has read a message, the reaction is removed and a &quot;real&quot; receipt is sent for all users.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<li>
<p>Internal changes to message syncing that should hopefully make inbound messages more reliable, or the very least improve code maintenance. </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey there, it is your friendly neighborhood cat client! Pardon, chat client!</p>
<p>Jedi18 implemented forwarding of messages. Just select a message and press Alt-F or use the context menu to send a message to the room you select in the popup! This encrypts and decrypts messages and media appropriately, but be aware that sending an encrypted file to an unencrypted room uploads the file unencrypted. (In all other cases the media is not uploaded again.)</p>
<p>Furthermore matrix.to links are now rewritten to matrix:-URIs internally. This means joining rooms and such should now work the same across both of them. It also makes navigation to events work now and even has a shiny highlight effect now! You can also create links to events now from the context menu. These are generated as matrix.to links, since currently the onboarding experience should still be better. Once the next version of the matrix.to website gets deployed, you can even just click there to open the event in Nheko! (Instead of having to copy a <code>/join</code> command).</p>
<p>Since &quot;Copy link to event&quot; was confusing to people and AppAraat opened his present box, only to realize it did not contain &quot;Copy link location&quot;, we implemented that too as well as a copy action, to copy the event body for good measure. I hope everyone who got confused will forgive me!</p>
<p>Apart from that we also updated our screenshots on <a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io/">https://nheko-reborn.github.io/</a> (and all AppStream based store pages) to be higher resolution and reflect the current design. Furthermore we fixed the login on conduit homeservers and that no rooms were shown, if the server didn't support the groups API.</p>
<p>That's all, and keep on c(h)atting! &lt;3</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I announced this project last week. It's exactly what it sounds like: A puppetting bridge to puppet a telephone number from Matrix. It's currently pre-alpha and not ready for use on public-facing HSes.</p>
<p>Not too much has happened in the last week as I've been a bit busy. The main thing is that there's now a <a href="https://github.com/KB1RD/matrix-pstn-bridge/tree/voip-dev">dev branch where outbound voice calls work</a>. Other than the 2014 <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2014/11/30/bridging-matrix-sip-via-verto">SIP experiment</a>, I think this is the first bridge to make voice calls work?</p>
<p>I hope having a reference VoIP bridge can help pave the way for more VoIP bridging. I'm already looking into how code can be generalized for other bridges. For example, I've opened an <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk/issues/112">issue in matrix-bot-sdk to add helper classes and stuff for VoIP support</a>. I'd be curious to see how other bridge builders think this could be accomplished. üëÄ</p>

Because of that, I did a service where you can order initial setup and configuration of homeserver (yes, with coturn in docker cluster!) <strong>and</strong> with full control of customization and fine-tuning of manual configuration (website even has step-by-step guide how the process works).</p>
<p>It's based on the amazing spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy with additional stuff like system security hardening and maintenance</p>
<p>Announcements: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#announcements:etke.cc">#announcements:etke.cc</a> </p>
<p>Source: https://gitlab.com/rakshazi/matrix-ansible/ 
It contains basic security stuff like ufw and fail2ban, system maintenance like updating packages, cleanup of old logs and docker images, configuration of swap, some additions like absurdly simply healthcheck page and website deployment to base domain. Documentation may be found in readme files for each role</p>

<p>https://gitlab.com/GoMatrixHosting</p>
<p>The FLOSS Matrix hosting system built on AWX, it enables you to manage multiple Matrix servers for many clients in both a commercial or non-commercial context. We are currently doing a free giveaway of on-premises server plans, if you're an experienced user or Matrix admin you can receive a free on-premises subscription and hopefully provide us with some feedback.</p>

<p>GoMatrixHosting was previously Oasis Hosting - looks like they're making great progress improving their product, may be time to have another look.</p>

<p>Some of you might already have seen that bot show up in rooms. To clear up some confusion around it I will briefly explain what it does and what it is supposed to do:</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-do">What does it do?</h4>
<p>The Bot is simply existing to do the same task as Matrix Traveler (bot) already did for years now. It joins rooms, listens for an alias, tries to join it.</p>
<p>The main difference between these 2 bots is that my bot also searches for aliases in old messages.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-save">What does it save?</h4>
<p>It only saves the relations between rooms. This means it knows which room was posted where. It doesn't know who posted it, when it was posted, why it was posted or any other content of messages.</p>
<p>However due to matrix' nature it does need to get the data once onto a synapse to read trough it. This means it has the data on my synapse. (Running in helsinki at hetzner).</p>
<h4 id="what-can-i-do-if-i-do-not-want-it">What can I do if I do not want it?</h4>
<p>The easiest way is to just ban it. It will fully forget that room.</p>
<p>Kicking works too but it might again join if it gets found again.</p>
<h4 id="where-is-the-source">Where is the source?</h4>
<p>The source code is available at https://git.nordgedanken.dev/MTRNord/server_stats/-/blob/main/src/bot/mod.rs</p>
<p>For further questions feel free to join #server_stats:nordgedanken.dev</p>
<p>Also note this bot is still very early in development which is why it does not respond to you yet on any commands. This will be added in the near future as well as a readme in the repository</p>
