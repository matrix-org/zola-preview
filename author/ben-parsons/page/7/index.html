<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@florian:dsn.tm.kit.edu">Florian</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/">We</a> published another scientific paper on Matrix, this time it is called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3381991.3395399">Matrix Decomposition: Analysis of an Access Control Approach on Transaction-based DAGs without Finality</a>!
Its main topic is the question of how access control can work based on a structure that only provides a partial order on events and no consensus on the current state, i.e. the Matrix Event Graph. We found some concrete, non-critical security issues related to both incorrect specification  as well as divergent homeserver behaviour. While the last remaining mitigations found their way into Synapse 1.14.0, we provide ideas on structural solutions to avoid both problem classes in the future using formal verification.</p>
<p>The paper was published at the <a href="http://www.sacmat.org/2020/index.php">ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies(SACMAT)</a> last week.
My talk went well (üéâ), it was recording and is yet to be published by the conference.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has seen a lot of work put into fixing broken tests and refactoring parts of the codebase.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The media API has had quite a bit of attention this week and now media over federation works properly, as well as much better filename handling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new user API component is now responsible for user accounts, devices, access tokens and account data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server key API has been updated with more reliable validity checking and new tests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logging into Dendrite using Riot iOS is now supported thanks to some minor tweaks/fixes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>URL handling for version 3 rooms has been improved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug in the format of <code>/v1/send_join</code> has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/joined_members</code> response has now been fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to that, we've made good progress on embedding the Dendrite-powered Yggdrasil demo into Riot iOS, which we'll hopefully be demoing in a couple of weeks!</p>
<p>Spec compliance has improved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 40%, up from 36% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 38%, up from 35% last week</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Highlights this week</p>
<ul>
<li>We released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/16/synapse-1-15-1-released">1.15.1</a>, this is a bug fix release, sorry if you were bitten.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changelog-in-full">Changelog in full</h4>
<p>Bugfixes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug introduced in v1.15.0 that would crash Synapse on start when using certain password auth providers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug introduced in v1.15.0 which meant that some 3PID management endpoints were not accessible on the correct URL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implemented unread message counts (MSC 2625) - This is part of the a more general notifications improvement project in conjunction with the Riot teams. The aim being to make Notifications easier to configure. We‚Äôve also been working on push rule definitions for the default behaviour. More on that next week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have the ability to shard the media repository worker. This means we can now run an arbitrary number in parallel, thereby improving upload reliability and performance, we are running this on Matrix.org. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-enabled Jaeger on matrix.org - previously we needed to switch it off due to the performance overhead, we needed a few tweaks but now it is working well and helping us to determine the cause of slow requests. It seems like the HTTP requests between the event creator  and event persister workers can sometimes be slow - we are not sure of the cause yet, we are working on it but it will mean further performance improvements to message sending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next up performance wise is working on sharding the federation sender to improve federation lag. We‚Äôll also try replacing simplejson with stdlib json which seems to be much faster at dumps nowadays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we‚Äôve fixed a bug that meant that quarantining media would from time to time include quarantining sticker packs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other interesting bugs</p>
<p>We fixed a spec compliance bug in fetching remote media raised by our pals in Dendrite-land. We fixed a bug causing federation .well-known requests to fail due to not including the user-agent header. We removed references to six (thanks @ilmari) and finally, fixed a bug that caused stream id to go backwards on the replication stream.</p>
<p>Next week we‚Äôll continue to work on notifications and performance. You can track our progress here <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8</a></p>

<p>Wondering how quick this weeks synapse release was adopted by homeserver admins? Head over to <a href="https://graph.settgast.org/">https://graph.settgast.org/</a> and see yourself that it only took a little over 2 days for 1.15.1 to become the most used synapse version. I plot hourly distribution of synapse versions there. (Disclaimer: Only collects stats for homeservers that my homeserver sees in any of its rooms, which are around 2000 at the moment)</p>

<p>This is super cool! I love that this has been created, and also how well it reflects on homeserver admins! /me scurries to update to 1.15.1...</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>As with every release we are currently working through the new bug reports. :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I started working on SSSS and online key backup support. For this I wrote my own base64 and base58 encoders. As a result of this we dropped libsodium as a dependency, which should make Nheko a bit easier to package or build. It's also fun to write base conversions, although 58 is a horrible base!</p>

<p>From the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reactions
<ul>
<li>React to a message with an emoji! üéâ</li>
<li>Reactions are shown below a message in a small bubble with a counter.</li>
<li>By clicking on that, others can add to the reaction count.</li>
<li>It may help you celebrating a new Nheko Release or react with a üëé to a failed build to express your frustration.</li>
<li>This uses a new emoji picker. The picker will be improved in the near future (better scrolling, sections, favorites, recently used or similar) and then probably replace the current picker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support for tagging rooms [tag]
<ul>
<li>Assign custom tags to rooms from the context menu in the room list.</li>
<li>This allows filtering rooms via the group list. This puts you in a focus mode showing only the selected tags.</li>
<li>You can assign multiple tags to group rooms however you like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SSO Login
<ul>
<li>With this you can now login on servers, that only provide SSO.</li>
<li>Just enter any mxid on the server. Nheko will figure out that you need to use SSO and redirect your browser to the login page.</li>
<li>Complete the login in your browser and Nheko should automatically log you in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Presence
<ul>
<li>Shows online status of the people you are talking to.</li>
<li>You can define a custom status message to tell others what you are currently up to.</li>
<li>The status message appears next to the usernames in the timeline.</li>
<li>Your server needs to have presence enabled for this to work.</li>

<p>after a couple of setbacks that didn't let us to make the releases earlier, the Quotient project has finally made two new releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GTAD (the piece of code magically producing readable C++ code from a Swagger API description) has achieved version 0.7 (https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad/releases/tag/v0.7.0) adding a few tricks in order to make...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...libQuotient 0.6 beta2 (https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.6-beta2) rely entirely on the upstream matrix-doc specification, rather than a soft fork closely following the main sources! From now on it's &quot;upstream first&quot;, in a sense that the original matrix-doc will be used to build Quotient codebase. Let's see how often it breaks ;)
In other news from the last few weeks:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some housekeeping and deprecation work in the API has been done in preparation to getting User Interactive Authentication along the next (post-0.6) release cycle of libQuotient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>also thanks to the updated code generator, the CS API code has been optimised, consolidating more code in the header files and making data deserialisation lazy; this helped significantly reduce compilation times, and runtime performance also improved a bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the number of configurations tested by CI has been extended, allowing to chase down a few more bugs that managed to go under the radar before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when used with new enough Qt, CBOR is used to cache data locally - entirely transparently for clients.</p>
</li>

<p>Expect more news in the coming weeks, including continued work on matrix: URI proposal and its implementation in Quotient.</p>

<p>This week in ruma-events' Google Summer of Code project, after trying out the new <code>Any*Event</code> enums <a href="https://github.com/DevinR528/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2"><code>matrix-rust-sdk</code></a>, we found a few big flaws. There was no easy way to go from <code>StateEvent&lt;AnyStateEventContent&gt;</code> to <code>StateEvent&lt;SpecificEventContent&gt;</code>, the other issue was one could create a <code>StateEvent</code> with differing <code>content</code> and <code>prev_content</code> fields using the <code>AnyStateEventContent</code> enum. The <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/68">0.22 ruma-events</a> will be similar to the existing API; each event type has a corresponding event enum variant.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever since <code>m.room.aliases</code> was replaced with <code>alt_aliases</code>, there hasn't really been any way to find aliases on other servers, since most room admins don't bother finding and publishing alternate aliases. To help solve that problem, I made a maubot plugin to let users publish alternate aliases in rooms: <a href="https://github.com/maubot/altalias">https://github.com/maubot/altalias</a></p>
<p>By default it lets users publish aliases with the same localpart as any already published alias. If that behavior is sufficient, you can simply invite it to a room and give it permissions to send <code>m.room.canonical_alias</code> events. Alternatively, it can be configured to allow aliases that match specific regexes.</p>
<p>Once it's set up, users can create a local alias and use <code>!altalias publish &lt;their alias&gt;</code> to publish it. The bot will make sure the alias points to the right room, check that the localpart is allowed and then add it to <code>alt_aliases</code>.</p>
<p>I have it running at @alias:maunium.net and I've added it to all my rooms already. Other rooms are also free to use that instance.</p>

<p>Implementing end-to-end encryption for go-neb turns out to be a lot easier than expected thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix">https://github.com/tulir/mautrix</a> library, which contains out of the box e2ee support!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first week of GSoC was spent switching go-neb's usage of gomatrix for mautrix, which was easy as the latter is a fork of the former. This caused a pretty big PR that touched most of go-neb's files, although the changes were simple and easy to review. The PR was merged shortly after into go-neb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the second week, it was time to add some basic e2ee support to go-neb. This was complicated slightly due to the bot's ability to create multiple clients and its treatment of /sync responses, however in the end e2ee is now working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code is still of course a mess and session keys are often lost in the void. The code will be cleaned up and tested further next week, bugs will be (hopefully) fixed and another PR will be submitted to go-neb then to officially add e2ee support!</p>

<p>Matrix has enormous potential to be used in many different use cases be it embedded chat rooms, comments section, chat boxes, etc. This project aims to fill that niche by providing an easy to use and easy to deploy client for users to embed on their webpages.<br />

<blockquote>
<p>This week in ruma-events' Google Summer of Code project, I was able to finish the macros needed to generate the event content enums and trait implementations required for events. I started by defining the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/107">generic event structs</a> (state, message, etc.) and manually writing the <code>Serialize</code> and <code>Deserialize</code> implementations. Over the next few days, this was moved into a custom derive macro called <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/108"><code>Event</code></a>. The derive now implements all necessary traits with appropriate bounds, so a <code>StateEvent&lt;C&gt;</code> can not contain any ephemeral event content and so forth. I have removed the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/111"><code>raw</code></a> mod and related <code>FromRaw</code> and <code>TryFromRaw</code> traits, moving the validation into the deserialization and constructor for the few types that needed it. On the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/106">event content</a> side of things, a function like procedural macro was used to allow declaring the enum using Matrix event type identifiers.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span>event_content_enum! {

<blockquote>
<p>Much of this week's work has been maintenance-related with refactoring, cleaning up etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Key fetching/expiry behaviour has been fixed, improving the reliability of federation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The monolith and component setup has now been refactored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of unused internal APIs have now been removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other internal roomserver APIs have been streamlined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also started building an <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io">Yggdrasil</a>-powered P2P demo (as opposed to the previous demos built using libp2p) and even includes support for embedding Riot Web in the single binary. It's not very stable/usable yet but there will be more news on that to follow within the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>We have also started building and releasing Docker images for Dendrite on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixdotorg/dendrite">Docker Hub</a> for those who want to use Docker to test Dendrite deployment.</p>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged from last week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 36%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 35%</p>

<p>Conduit is a Matrix homeserver written in Rust <a href="https://conduit.rs">https://conduit.rs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome back! This week I focused my efforts on better error handling. My goal was that every problem would be forwarded to the client (e.g. InternalServerError response) and also be logged. Yesterday I merged the <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit/pulls/116/files">giant PR this resulted in</a>. Hopefully this will make Conduit easier to debug in the future.</p>
<p>Here are some other things I finished this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>User-interactive authentication (e.g. you need to type your password again if you want to delete devices)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Config option to disable registration</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also found the problem with Riot not showing notifications for new messages and created <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/14000">a bug report</a>. With a few tweaks, I managed to solve this on my account and now mentions, DMs and more play the notification sound (it also works on Riot X!). </p>
<p>@gnieto fixed a bug that prevented Riot from loading history when you join a room and @PublicByte implemented the /whoami endpoint.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from that we continue out push towards improving performance both in terms of sharding workers but also improving tools to manage disk space usage. Specifically this week and next we are looking at db tuning and sharding the media repo worker. We are also noticing that the typing handler is chewing more CPU than would be expected. It could be a good candidate for moving away from the master process.</p>
<p>More broadly we are changing the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5745">defaults for notifications</a> and making changes to support a more general overhaul of notifications.</p>
<p>Finally we are looking at how to not only delete messages after a certain time period, but also how to delete the associated media (which becomes difficult when considering e2e content along side long lived content such as avatars and sticker packs).</p>
<p>For more detail on what is coming next, take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">public task board</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2190">MSC2190</a> and the related Synapse PR aren't moving much, all my bridges now generate appservice registration files with the workaround. The workaround is needed to avoid patching synapse or using other hacks, and I decided to enable it by default as many people had problems related to having to apply it manually.</p>
<p>The WhatsApp, Facebook and Hangouts bridges now have an option to use double puppeting to disable notifications when backfilling. It can be useful if you want to copy chat history to Matrix, but don't want to be spammed with hundreds of notifications while it's happening.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@eric:nova.chat">eric</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introducing <a href="https://nova.chat/">NovaChat</a> - a desktop chat client that supports 9+ different chat networks, built on top of Matrix. Think of it as a modern Adium/Trillian.</p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>NovaChat is a system with three parts designed to work together:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a new <a href="https://gitlab.com/nova/nova-web">desktop client</a>, based on Riot-web</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a federating homeserver (nova.chat)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a set of Matrix bridges configured to run on a private server called a <a href="https://gitlab.com/nova/bridgebox">bridgebox</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Matrix bridges are awesome but generally require you to run own homeserver. NovaChat removes that restriction, without sacrificing security and privacy. Your remote chat network credentials never leave your bridgebox, and messages are encrypted* on the bridgebox before being sent to the NovaChat homeserver.</p>
<p>*Encryption is currently enabled on Telegram/FB/Hangouts/Whatsapp bridges, mx-puppet-bridges coming shortly)</p>
<p><em>Very rough system diagram:</em></p>
<p><code>&gt; NovaChat desktop client &lt;&gt; NovaChat homeserver &lt;&gt; bridgebox &lt;&gt; remote chat networks</code></p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fancy new UI, heavily inspired by Telegram. See photo below or <a href="https://app.tella.tv/story/ckar1ock0000007mi7x5t3qdn">see it in action</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy graphical bridge set up (no more fiddling with config files)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliable bridging, with delivery confirmations and bridge disconnect warnings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes 8 pre-configured bridges: Facebook/Whatsapp/Hangouts/Telegram/Slack/Instagram/Twitter/Skype. Planning to add more soon, or submit a PR!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Works on Mac OS, Linux and Windows</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't need to be technical to use NovaChat, it's designed to Just WorkTM. If you need help setting up a bridgebox, we are offering hosting and maintenance for USD $5 per month.</p>
<p>The vast majority of this software has been created by the talented tulir and dm0141. I personally am a terrible coder (you can tell which parts I did), but I do have experience building products and teams, and I'm excited to begin working in the Matrix universe. I wrote recently about how I believe Matrix is the <a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/the-universal-communication-bus-42dfb9a141ad">Universal Communication Bus</a>! Thanks goes to Sorunome for creating the mx-puppet-bridges!</p>
<p>We're developing the whole project in the open (though not all components are open source), check the <a href="https://gitlab.com/nova/issues/-/boards?scope=all&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;state=opened">issue backlog</a> :)</p>
<p><strong>Want to help?</strong> We're hiring Matrix developer to work on the project with us. Send me a message if you're interested! Particularly looking for a React dev to help with frontend on nova-web.</p>

<li>
<p>Reactions</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>React to a message with an emoji! üéâ</p>
</li>

<p>Reactions are shown below a message in a small bubble with a counter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By clicking on that, others can add to the reaction count.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may help you celebrating a new Nheko Release or react with a üëé to a failed build to express your frustration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This uses a new emoji picker. The picker will be improved in the near future (better scrolling, sections, favorites, recently used or similar) and then probably replace the current picker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for tagging rooms <code>[tag]</code></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assign custom tags to rooms from the context menu in the room list.</p>
</li>

<p>Improve the login and register masks a bit with hints and validation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Descriptions for settings (contributed by lkito)</p>

<p>This week, we continued to iterate on the implementation of the new push notification service thanks to user feedbacks. Those feedbacks also show that the app uses less battery.</p>
<p>On login, this is now possible to recover your cross-signing and your key backup from your recovery passphrase or key.</p>

<p>Most of the work this past week was on ruma-events, for more on that see the GSoC section!

<p>Mascarene is written in <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, runs on JVM and relies on <a href="https://akka.io/">Akka</a> actor model. Out of the box it provides features like efficient streaming I/O, clustering and live data distribution. Data are backed in a PostgreSQL database.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome back! This week I went through the whole Client-Server API and wrote down everything that is still missing from Conduit. You can find issues for all of them in the <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit/milestones">milestone for Conduit 1.0</a>. This should make it more easy for contributors to find something to work on and gives a lot more structure to the repo (maybe I also did it, because it's so satisfying to close issues and see the milestone percentage go up üòõ).</p>
<p>Some of the issues I could already close this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implement redaction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement loading the message someone replied to (/context)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix bugs with notifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't send typing events when nothing happened</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bundle typing events into one EDU</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't send notification counts every /sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement heroes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week in Synapse land we have been focusing on bug fixes especially SSO and soft logout. </p>
<p>We also spent some time thinking about how to further improve performance for large scale deployments (like matrix.org). In short this will mean sharding contested workers such as the media repo worker, the federation sender and the federation reader. We also want to remove some more functionality from the master process because it is still sitting at about 80% and we‚Äôd like some more head room. We'd also like to fix up the state compressor so it can easily be run as a background progress to save on disk space, this will benefit all installations big and small. Finally we want to speed up joins over federation. Exciting times.</p>
<p>Next week, more of the same and we should start on some of the perf items. Also look out for changes to notification defaults.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org">benoit</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RiotX v0.21.0 has been released on May 28th. It adds support to identity server configuration and e-mail/phone binding and unbinding. It's also now possible to switch between languages inside the app and to display the list of attachments (media and file) of a room. A new setting has been also added to hide redacted (deleted) events in the timeline. As Riot-Android SAS v2 is also included in this release. Also <code>formatted_body</code> for <code>m.notice</code> and <code>m.emote</code> are now taken into account.</p>
<p>This week we were still working on implementing VoIP (audio and video call). Support for integration manager, widgets and sending stickers has been merged to develop.
Many new features are coming soon, stay tuned!</p>

<p>This week, we finalised our work around the iOS13 SDK. The coming public TestFlight (0.12.2) is the result of this work. It comes with a lot of changes including a full rewrite of the push handling codebase, trying to find solutions to make matrix e2ee compatible with iOS Notification Service Extension. Most of these changes are unfortunately invisible for end users. Please report any issues. Note this is safe to switch between this TF and 0.11.5.</p>
<p>In parallel, we started to implement the cross-signing bootstrap and the recovery management. The UX of this is going to be refined on Riot-Web and RiotX-Android. Riot-iOS will implement the refined UX directly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello again! This week I worked on access control, which means that private rooms are private and invite-only rooms are invite-only. The public room directory only shows rooms marked as such now.</p>
<p>I also made <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit/milestones">a milestone to track progress on Conduit 1.0</a>. This release marks the point where Conduit is fully usable as a non-federating homeserver. All features of the client server specification should be implemented, unless they can be seen as optional extensions (e.g. alternative registrations methods like email). Conduit should also be free of all known bugs with those features.</p>
<p>Adding federation on top of the 1.0 release will very likely require breaking changes. This means that the release which brings federation will be 2.0 or later and will require a partial or full database deletion.</p>
<p>@TravisR wrote a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/1304">fix for Riot Web</a>, so you should be able to create accounts on Conduit from &lt;<a href="https://riot.im/app">https://riot.im/app</a>&gt; soon.</p>

<p>Says Neil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main news this week is that we switched event persistence away from the matrix.org master process which has made a big difference to overall performance. The impact is best demonstrated by graphing message send times.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made a TARDIS (Time Agnostic Room DAG Inspection Service) - a simple time-travelling debugger for Room DAGs which plugs into Dendrite's internal APIs to visualise room DAGs.  The intention is to provide it as a widget which Riot can use to visualise DAGs for debugging, particularly for P2P Matrix.  The time-travel bit is simply that it could let you filter out the newer events to show how the DAG has evolved over time, although that isn't hooked up yet. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/tardis">https://github.com/matrix-org/tardis</a></p>

<h3 id="p2p-dendrite">P2P/Dendrite</h3>
<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite has seen a number of improvements this week, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Backfill will now backfill more messages than before, resulting in a snappier experience when scrolling back in a room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite is now compliant with Synapse on backfill behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inline CS API filters will now honour the timeline <code>limit</code> value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making more Sytests pass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modifications to how Dendrite tracks memberships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Addition of an <code>-api</code> flag to expose internal HTTP APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clearer separation of internal/external HTTP APIs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This has culminated in the following values for Are We Synapse Yet:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>Client-Server APIs: 34% (227/672 tests) - up from 33%
</span><span>Federation APIs: 34% (35/103 tests) - up from 27%
</span></code></pre>
<p>As for P2P....</p>
<h4 id="p2p-riot-im-v0-1-0-released">p2p.riot.im v0.1.0 released!</h4>
<p>This is a significant milestone because we now persist Dendrite databases to IndexedDB, greatly improving UX and giving users a consistent identity on the P2P network. In addition to this, the following changes have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We now bake in the Dendrite commit SHA into the logs on startup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite will now restart itself in case of panics/segfaults.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues with this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Databases are only flushed to IndexedDB every 30 seconds, making it possible to lose the most recent messages. This has a variety of effects on the Dendrite instance, but in testing it has been able to mostly gracefully recover. Messages that you have sent will be backfilled but will be redacted. Rooms you have joined will be forgotten, and you need to be kicked/re-invited/re-join for communication to be re-established. We're looking into a better flushing mechanism going forwards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have previously visited p2p.riot.im, you <strong>MUST</strong> manually clear your service worker via <code>chrome:serviceworker-internals</code> or <code>about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox</code> or else you might get errors such as &quot;LinkError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): memory import 37 has no maximum limit, expected at most 4294967295&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please <strong>do not rely</strong> on p2p.riot.im to have any form of stability. Patch version bumps (0.1.0 -&gt; 0.1.1) will not remove databases but minor version bumps will (0.1.1 -&gt; 0.2.0) so we can continue to progress with Dendrite development at speed.</p>

He's now working through a few other issues to improve his coding skills, like optionally having big emojis in the timeline or showing tooltips to explain the settings Nheko has.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now set a /roomnick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now tag rooms using the room context menu. You can assign multiple tags and create new tags as you like. This helps organizing your rooms, since Nheko supported filtering you room list using tags for a few years already, but until now you couldn't assign them.</p>

<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2526">MSC2526</a> has entered FCP. We'd like to keep the E2E MSCs in flight in focus, but are also conscious that room v6 is coming up. We're sticking the MSCs for the latter alongside the existing E2E ones in the focus queue, for a total of 5. Those MSCs are: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2366">MSC2366</a> (verification flows), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2399">MSC2399</a> (UISI messaging), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2540">MSC2540</a> (canonical JSON validation), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2209">MSC2209</a> (notifications auth rules), and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2240">MSC2240</a> (room version 6).</p>

<p>This week I worked on presence and end to end encryption, but they are not working yet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Valkum got sytest integration working! This means each time a new commit is pushed to a branch, CI automatically picks up on that and lets a lot of tests run on the homeserver - the same tests that synapse uses. Currently we have 8% of all tests positive on Conduit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Link: <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-tv">https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-tv</a></p>
<p>I got really bored in lockdown, as we all have. I stared at my TV, and it stared back at me. While it's definitely a privacy nightmare to start developing apps for these things, I couldn't help myself. I got stuck in, and secured myself a LG Developer Account.</p>
<p>The LG set of smart TVs use WebOS, as like the name suggests, runs apps in it's special variant of Chromium. I was lucky to be running a recent OS and had access to Chromium 53! And NodeJS 0.12!! Sarcasm aside, there are some very troubling versions of WebOS with much older versions of the browser, so I was happy to be developing against something with strong ES6 support. Despite the absolutely <a href="https://twitter.com/Half_Shot/status/1259471146308775943">awful</a> onboarding experience, the WebOS SDK itself was pretty good. <code>matrix-tv</code> was written to be a general large screen matrix client, so it talks to the TV's own libraries through an abstraction layer :)</p>
<p>Anyway, this client is the culmination of a lazy Sunday afternoon's work. It features very basic support for viewing a room, but I hope to expand it at some point. It  supports running in a web browser and the aforementioned OS, but support for more variants is easy to add. I'm looking into how to design for the large screen beyond making fonts bigger, because the unique constraints on memory and UI are fun challenge.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="what-is-jupybot">What is JupyBot</h4>
<p>The purpose of the bot is to provide a link with Jupyter kernels running either on your local computer or somewhere else on a server. You can access your kernels through the bot with the chat interface. The kernels will answer to your commands through the same interface.</p>
<p>Since this is still a proof of concepts, the number of features is limited (command line text, string and pictures are the only output formats supported. No widget, no funny javascript) and they are few safeguards against infinite loops and other entertaining bugs.</p>
<h4 id="todo">TODO</h4>
<p>This is right now just a proof of concept. We want to see if such a bot can be useful for people and how. What features would be interesting, what can be integrated in the present clients,... Therefore, in the short term, we want to focus on the possibility of easy testing for users and easy contributions for people who want to add their ideas. On the mid- and long term, a lot of ideas can be realized; it will depend on the feedback. These are just some examples. Short term:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>proper error catching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fallback for non supported Jupyter formats on riot.im (i.e. a lot)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>testing on termux on a tablet or smartphone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>solve the problem with nio-matrix and upload in chunks of images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dockerized version</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Middle term:</p>
<ul>
<li>use of opsdroid as a framework</li>
</ul>
<p>Longer term:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>local server integrated to locally command the bot service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make full use of jupyter capabilities with a client suited for it (for instance a Jupyterlab plugin)</p>

<p>I made a little bot that scrapes <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us">https://news.blizzard.com/en-us</a> , because they've disabled their RSS feeds for some time now. It regularly scrapes all posts of a configured category and sends messages for new articles to all rooms the bot is a member of. It works like a RSS bot, except the source is a website instead of a RSS feed.</p>
<p>In the readme there are also some public instances, which you can just invite instead of hosting your own bot.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tsearle:hackerspaces.be">Torrey Searle</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've added matrix support into a chat bot, you can see the chat bot in action at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#midori-dev:hackerspaces.be">#midori-dev:hackerspaces.be</a> and it's project page is here <a href="https://github.com/midoricorp/jabbot">https://github.com/midoricorp/jabbot</a>.<br />
it's main highlight is anybody can add new commands to it in chat using its scripting language<br />
any any existing bot command can be used as a function in new scripts you write<br />
The scripting language to add new commands can be found here <a href="https://github.com/midoricorp/script">https://github.com/midoricorp/script</a><br />
you can do things like<br />
<code>!script print &quot;HELLO world&quot;;</code><br />
or make a new command<br />
<code>!script sub hello { print &quot;HELLO World&quot;; }</code><br />
that would result in a new command !hello being made<br />
print also has 2 output stream, one for rich format and one for basic formatting<br />
<code>!script print &quot;Hello World!&quot;; print HTML &quot;Hello &lt;b&gt;World&lt;/b&gt;&quot;</code>;</p>

<p>Hey, I have created a room for designers workin on matrix stuff to join: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-design:disko.media">#matrix-design:disko.media</a></p>
<p>The goal is to improve cohesion and collaboration for all things design (UI, UX, interaction...)
Over time, it should become a place for people to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ask design-specific questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>share cool stuff and be praised for all the good work you're doing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and document a common understanding of the semantics of matrix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make sure the user experience is amazing, even as we all figure out how to federate.
Probably most designers work on single clients right now, but there are important UX questions that can only be answered ecosystem-wide. Maybe we'll end up with a design guide for people to use alongside the spec.</p>

<p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> participants were announced last week. <strong><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696/">This year Matrix was assigned SIX students!</a></strong></p>
<p>This is the most students we've have taken on in a single year, made possible by Matrix now acting as an umbrella organisation for multiple projects - this year that's Ruma, Nheko and OpsDroid. There are also students working on projects from the core team: go-neb, matrix-js-sdk and matrix-ircd.</p>
<p>We received dozens of applications this year, which made narrowing our focus to six students difficult, but we are proud to announce:</p>
<p><strong>Devin Ragotzy</strong>, who has been involved with the Ruma project in the past, will work on <em><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4756651216732160">Ruma procedural macro refactoring and more</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Arnav Tiwari</strong> will work with Travis and myself to create <em><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5751467312414720">HTML Embeddable Matrix Chat Rooms</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Nikolaos Filippakis</strong> will work to support <em><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5910277670830080">E2E encryption for go-neb</a></em>. Kegan, one of the original go-neb authors is particularly excited about this one</p>
<p><strong>Brooks Karlik</strong> will update matrix-ircd: <em><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5911643604647936">Move matrix-ircd to async/await</a></em>. This will be a welcome upgrade for anyone using that project!</p>
<p><strong>Tyagdit</strong> will work with Cadair and the <a href="/blog/2020/05/01/this-week-in-matrix-2020-05-01">OpsDroid team</a> on <em><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6107552447725568">Enabling E2EE in Opsdroid Matrix Connector</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Chethan Reddy</strong>, last but not least, will work with Nico and the Nheko gang on <em><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6274781747347456">Adding Features in End-to-End encryption for Nheko-Reborn</a></em></p>
<p>Congratulations all, and also congratulations and thank you to the projects the students will be working on!</p>
<p>Find out all about <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696/">Matrix @ GSoC on Google's dedicated site</a>, and keep reading the Matrix blog where we'll have updates from the students.</p>
<hr />
<p>PS <strong>Alejandro Dom√≠nguez</strong> has a Matrix related project too: they'll be working under the GNOME organisation to <em><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6726209787920384">add Multi account support to Fractal</a></em>.</p>

<h3 id="dendrite-gomatrixserverlib">Dendrite / gomatrixserverlib</h3>
<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some of the work for <code>/get_missing_events</code> has been done now for filling gaps in the room DAG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation sender performance and parallelisation have been dramatically improved, which helps a lot in big rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retries, backoff and blacklisting have also been implemented in the federation sender to handle cases where remote homeservers are unavailable much more gracefully</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retrieving missing state when receiving incoming events over federation is a bit more robust now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating direct chats now works</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invites are mostly working now overall, both locally and over federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>RespState</code> and <code>RespStateJoin</code> have been fixed in gomatrixserverlib</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room joins and leaves are now handled by new code across the roomserver and federation server perform APIs, which reduces complexity significantly</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Redis live in production for m.org! We did not expect this to translate into a significant improvement in performance directly, but it means that we can add new workers without any extra overhead on the master process which has been <em>very</em> useful in supporting cross signing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing bugs leading to messages getting stuck at the bottom of the timeline as well as messages not making it to sync at all. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of improvements to deal with the extra load generated by cross signing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these changes will be available in v1.13.0 which should have a release candidate ready rsn.</p>
<p>Next week, we continue to work on sharding changes, further SSO support and ensuring that cross signing adoption is as smooth as possible.</p>

<h3 id="architect">architect</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnu_ponut:matrix.org">Gnuxie</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/cal-coop/architect">Architect</a> is a homeserver project written in <a href="https://common-lisp.net">Common Lisp</a>. We intend to create a high performance homeserver using the meta-programming features of Common Lisp to reduce the amount of redundant and timely code that needs to be written and maintained.</p>
<h4 id="architect-events">architect events</h4>
<p>I created a <a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/json-schema2">json-schema</a> library, to generate class definitions directly from the Matrix specification. These classes also have information attached to them to allow for serialisation, using a metaclass from <a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/json-clos">json-clos</a>.</p>
<p>This is done entirely dynamically without writing to source files. <a href="https://gitlab.com/cal-coop/architect/architect.events">The invocation</a> of json-schema that creates classes for the <code>client-server</code>, <code>server-server</code> and <code>application-service</code> protocols is only about 20 lines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I refactored most of the data handling code to make it both more efficient and easier to read. I started by splitting a file called &quot;data.rs&quot; into multiple smaller files that handle just one part of the database, like &quot;users.rs&quot;, &quot;rooms.rs&quot; or &quot;edus.rs&quot;. I continued improving the code by making methods return iterators instead of vectors and propagating errors instead of crashing directly. Lastly, I added a few comments here and there and made sure everything works.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, @Valkum experimented with CI and @MTRNord is working on FluffyChat Flutter support.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank my supporters on <a href="https://liberapay.com/timokoesters">Liberapay</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over 3 million people from Telegram and Discord have now been brought into the Matrix universe through t2bot.io. Of those people, around 230 thousand are active each month and 15 thousand are dedicated users of the bridges daily.</p>
<p>While this is a huge milestone for t2bot.io,it underlines the importance of self-hosting: having a couple giant bridges is great for accessibility, though where possible it‚Äôs heavily encouraged that people self-host. Hosting the bridges yourself on your own homeserver gives you better control of what passes through your server, reduces your dependence on third parties like t2bot.io, and gives you better performance.</p>
<p>During peak periods, t2bot.io sees about 10 messages per second passing through it. Half of those messages are generated by the Telegram bridge alone. The other half is dealing with federation and the various other bridges and bots on t2bot.io. In terms of media, a new image is uploaded every 2 seconds, leading to 5.8 TB of media being stored. The database is 3 TB and holds 236 Million events - roughly 131 Million of which are sent by t2bot.io.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has used t2bot.io in the past 3 years - it‚Äôs been more successful than ever imagined. Here‚Äôs to another year and a bunch of self-hosting. :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôve spent time this week working with the Riot teams to tweak matrix.org performance for cross signing. We‚Äôve also fixed a few performance regressions ahead of next week's 1.13.0 release (which will be a big one, more details when it lands).</p>
<p>With any luck we‚Äôll have Redis in production on matrix.org next week, we don‚Äôt think this will give us a huge performance win, but there is certainly overhead in having so many workers using the previous replication streaming method.</p>
<p>Our sharding project continues, and Erik has been trying to move the event stream entirely away from the master process which in itself could be significant for overall perf once ready for production.</p>
<p>Aside from that we continue to improve SSO support and we have a really great community PR from <a href="https://github.com/sandhose">sandhose</a> that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7256">implements OpenID Connect support</a>.

<p>Hey all, the IRC bridge has reached another milestone, 0.17.0. This is a medium sized release, containing a few nice to have features like predicting nickname conflicts and some work around user deactivation. Importantly, this release <strong>authenticates</strong> the provisioning endpoint so if you run an integration manager or script that makes use of it, ensure that it handles requests appropriately. You can see the changelog in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.17.0">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.17.0</a></p>

</ul>
<p>And a <em>lot</em> of other changes!</p>
<h4 id="how-it-works">How it works</h4>
<p>The user has a stream of <code>Update</code>s, <code>user.updates</code>. An <code>Update</code> contains the latest 'snapshot' of data associated with the user. It also contains a <code>delta</code> <code>MyUser</code>, where all properties are <code>null</code>, except those that are changed. For example, if a user started typing in a certain room, and we're syncing, there will be an <code>Update</code> in <code>user.updates</code>, where <code>delta</code> has 1 <code>Room</code> in <code>delta.rooms</code>, with only the room where the user started typing, reflected in <code>room.typingUserIds</code>. All other properties of the <code>Room</code> will be null. This is all assuming that this is the only change in the sync. If more happened, it will be reflected in <code>delta</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a bot to share Jitsi call URLs. The main objective is to allow people on the other side of bridges to get the URL for a jitsi call. When a jitsi widget is added to a room (v2 widget from riot-web) it will post a message with the plain jitsi URL. It also provides a !jitsi command which allows people to create a jitsi call with a custom URL, and if the bot has permission it will be added as a widget in the matrix room. It has a bunch of other config options you can tweak it with. The main thing you might find it useful for if you are not in a bridged room is you can use it to quickly add a jitsi widget for any conference URL. The bot can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/skill-jitsi/">https://github.com/Cadair/skill-jitsi/</a> and it uses the opsdroid framework. I have also hosted a version @jitsibot:cadair.com</p>

<p>Last week</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shipped <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/23/synapse-1-12-4-released">1.12.4</a> a patch release to fix some cross signing related bugs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redis support to replace our existing cross replication system, merged to develop. This is a precursor to the sharding project. We have a PR to support cache invalidation across workers which, once merged should make it relatively easy to pull off event persistence from the master process. Just removing event persistence could give some decent perf wins, but the prize is then splitting persistence to run across across multiple workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A final PR to support SSO for user interactive auth will merge imminently, thereby freeing up full cross signing support for worker installs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aside from that we‚Äôve been working on fixing a weird bug where rooms can end up with zero forward extremities and generally showing Sygnal some love. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upcoming</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Put Redis into production</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ship 1.13.0 which will contain Redis support as well as a host of SSO bug fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge our new caching config logic to give finer granularity on cache settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge cache invalidation and try to get events persistence running in its own worker.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This week I worked a lot on getting the first bit of federation working. My goal was to query the public room list of another server and forward it to a client.</p>
<p>This involved setting up a keypair to sign the json I send to the server and putting authorization headers into my requests. Most of the work is already done and <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/">https://federationtester.matrix.org/</a> reports it's all good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sadly there seems to be a problem with the signing, because other homeservers reject requests: <code>Unable to verify signature: &lt;class 'nacl.exceptions.BadSignatureError'&gt; Signature was forged or corrupt</code>. I'll continue to work on this in the next week(s).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now supports perspective key fetching as a configurable option, and will automatically attempt to use the perspective key servers for keys that couldn't be fetched directly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now uses a newer version of the Sarama library</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some caching has been added to the roomserver API for room versions, which should help quite a bit with performance over federation and handling transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auth checks for <code>/send_join</code> are now quite a bit more robust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed where the default state filter limited the amount of room state that was visible after a join</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gomatrixserverlib has quite a bit of new support for backfilling now, which will be wired into Dendrite soon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gomatrixserverlib has new primitives for v2 invite responses and <code>/get_missing_events</code> requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite support is being worked on currently, which should also enable support for creating DMs in Riot</p>
