<p>Progress on the spec has been motoring since <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> dived (dove?) into it full time a few weeks ago - the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1464">Federation API r0 megathread bug</a> that tracks progress on filling in the gaps on the S2S API is clearing its checkboxes at an impressive rate.</p>

<p>Some points of note regarding current proposals:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1466">MSC1466</a></strong> Erik proposes a <code>soft_logout</code> field to be added to the body of 401 responses, to better help handling of encryption keys. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/soft_logout/proposals/1466-soft-logout.md">Check the proposal notes</a></li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1452">MSC1452</a></strong> agreement has been reached on Homeserver Warning Messages</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We're going with pinned messages (option 2) and room tags (option 5) as that seems to be where the consensus is: it re-uses existing bits of the spec and room tags also help clients that don't know about this specific room tag to handle the room the right way</p>

<h2 id="updates-on-irc-bridges-from-half-shot">Updates on IRC bridges from Half-Shot</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has been working tirelessly on the IRC bridge lately, so I wanted to update on his recent successes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've recently been working on mitigating the effects of a netsplit on the IRC bridge, and optimising it to start and run faster. This week I trimmed down the heap usage (where the memory usually goes) to just under a gigabyte on my 10,000 matrix user test bridge. Previously it could spike to as much as 3.5GB. This optimisation is still in a testing phase but results are looking positive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For reference here is the memory usage of the Freenode process during startup:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-current.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3445" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-current.png" alt="" width="853" height="268" /></a></p>
<p>And here are the results of my local test bridge before and after the change:</p>
<p>Before:</p>

<p>We also made some internal changes to the appservice-bridge to cache the joined state of all the bridge users and therefore avoiding joining rooms which saves us some time on startup.</p>

<p>In his regular spot, <a href="https://github.com/ananace/">Ananace</a> has made progress on his Matrix sysadmin/ruby suite:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-grafana-matrix">Grafana alerting ingester</a> supports images, plus more per-task configuration options.</li>
 	<li>The <a href="https://github.com/ananace/matrix-synapse/">K8s-optimized docker image for Synapse</a> has been updated to 0.33.1</li>
 	<li>The <a href="https://github.com/ananace/matrix-releasetracker/">release tracker</a> has gotten multiple performance improvements.</li>
 	<li>the <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby SDK</a> continues to be slowly worked on.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/2018/08/02/security-update-synapse-0-33-1/">Synapse 0.33.1</a> is out now as a security update release. Please update if you haven't already - it fixes two issues concerning event visibility where if you knew the event ID of an event you could read it even if you didn't have access to it; we don't believe these have been exploited in the wild, but you will definitely want to upgrade now.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Python 3 port is progressing well (all sytests now pass in Python 3, i think!), and intrepid folks are starting to experiment with running it in production.</p>
<h2 id="decentralised-web-summit-matrix-live">Decentralised Web Summit &amp; Matrix Live</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Matthew &amp; Amandine have been in San Francisco for the 2018 <a href="https://decentralizedweb.net">Decentralised Web Summit</a> - so this week's Matrix Live is live from SFO and gives a quick overview of the sort of things we got up to!  Some of the sessions are already online thanks to the (somewhat unreliable) live stream (e.g. here's Muneeb (Blockstack), Amandine, Danielle (Dat), and Zooko (Zcash) talking about their respective governance models &amp; growing pains over the last 2 years: <a href="https://youtu.be/tsz3ffrJDpw?t=12133">https://youtu.be/tsz3ffrJDpw?t=12133</a>).  The summit was a massive success, with lots of discussions about decentralised reputation, UI/UX for decentralised apps, metadata-resistance, the balance of P2P versus decentralised-servers, etc.  Hopefully some of the conversations we had will result in some major improvements to Matrix in the future!</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-01-DWeb-1.pdf">Here are the slides</a> for our &quot;<a href="https://decentralizedwebsummit2018.sched.com/event/Fhlb/workshop-diving-into-decentralized-communication">Diving into Decentralised Communication</a>&quot; workshop, for those interested in a comparison between Matrix/SSB/Mastodon/Status/Vuvuzela/Briar.  They're pretty minimal, as they just formed a framework for discussion, but might still be of interest.</p>

                <p>Following on from the previous post, we have an update from zil0 on his <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6091058287476736/#5468043765874688">GSoC project</a>, which entailed implementing E2E support in the Matrix Python SDK.</p>
<hr />
<p>The goal of my project is to implement Matrix's end-to-end encryption protocol in Python, as part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a>. My mentors are Richard van der Hoff (richvdh) and Hubert Chathi (uhoreg).</p>
<p>It was easy to get started on the project, since the simple parts came first (adding API calls), and then the whole process to follow is documented in an <a href="/docs/guides/e2e_implementation.html">implementation guide</a>, while there is also the reference implementation in JavaScript. And most importantly, the community is nice. :)</p>
<p>Some parts of the work consist in wrapping around the cryptographic primitives implemented in <a href="https://git.matrix.org/git/olm/">libolm</a> (via <a href="https://github.com/poljar/python-olm">Python bindings</a>), in order to handle encrypted events. Others are less straightforward, such as tracking device lists of users, or finding the right way to persist keys and related data between startups.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of this project is that I am working on a new part of the Python SDK, while also having to integrate with existing code, which is a cool balance between freedom and guidelines.</p>
<p>As the encryption documentation is a bit outdated and incomplete, one (fun) difficulty is to look for information across old issues, Gdocs and source code (and asking my mentor when in doubt). For anyone trying to implement E2E, it should be better by the end of the project, as I am currently working on documenting the missing bits.</p>
<p>I have had a great experience so far. Working on an open source project differs from my previous coding experiences, as people are actually going to use what I write! I have learnt to think about the best design from a usability point of view, discuss different approaches, and I had to write tests and document my code, which sadly is not something I do on personal projects. I enjoyed reviews, and the discussions they led to. And of course I have learnt quite an interesting lot about the E2E voodoo, along with some new Python tricks.</p>
<p>Currently, the implementation is in a working state. Some of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3AZil0">code</a> is merged, and some is awaiting review. It is possible to try it <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk/issues/100#issuecomment-402508438">here</a> before everything is merged.
The project will be finished in about one week, after some tidying up and when I release device verification and key sharing, which should be the last missing features compared to Riot.</p>

                <p>As you may know, for the last few months anoa (Andrew) and APWhiteHat have been working on Dendrite, the next generation Matrix homeserver, written in Go. We asked for an update on their progress, and Andrew provided the blog post below. Serious progress has been made on Dendrite this summer!</p>
<hr />
<p>Hey everyone, my name is Andrew Morgan and I've been working full-time over the summer on Dendrite, our next-generation Matrix homeserver. Over the last two months, I've seen the project transform from a somewhat functioning toy server to a near-production-ready homeserver that is working towards complete feature support. I've appreciated the thought put into the project since day one, and enjoy the elegance of the multi-component design. Documentation is fairly decent at the moment, but comments are plentiful throughout the codebase, while the code itself tends towards simple and maintainable rather than complex and unmanageable.</p>
<h2 id="application-service-integration">Application Service Integration</h2>
<p>The main focus of my time here has been on the implementation of application service support for Dendrite. Application services are external programs that act as privileged extensions to a homeserver, allowing such functionality as bots in rooms and bridges to third-party networks. Supporting application services requires a few different bits and pieces to be set up. Currently all planned features have a PR for them, with the bold items already merged:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Sending events to application services</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Support user masquerading for events</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Support editing event timestamps</strong></li>
 	<li>Support room alias querying</li>
 	<li>Support user ID querying
</li>
 	<li>Support third party lookup proxying
</li>
</ul>
As you can see a decent portion of the functionality is already in master! The rest will hopefully follow after some further back and forth.
<h2 id="google-summer-of-code">Google Summer of Code</h2>
<p>I certainly haven't been going at this all on my own. Alongside extensive help from Erik, who's been mentoring me, our resident Google Summer of Code student, APWhiteHat, has been tackling feature after feature in Dendrite wherever he can find them. Application services received a good deal of help on client-server endpoint authentication side, however, APWhiteHat has mostly been focusing on federation and some other very useful pieces. While his GSoC period still has a week or so before its conclusion, he has so far implemented:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Idempotency to roomserver event processing to prevent duplication
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Username auto generation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Tokens library based on macaroons
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Lots of left-over federation stuff: state API & get missing events being the major ones
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">AS support to clientapi auth
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Typing server: handling of PUT /typing by clientapi
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">More typing server stuff on its way
</li>
</ul>
From my perspective, APWhiteHat was an excellent developer to work with. He asked good questions and was quick to answer any myself or the community had as well. His code reviews were also very comprehensive. I learned a lot from working with him and everyone else :)
<h2 id="opentracing-and-prometheus-monitoring">OpenTracing and Prometheus Monitoring</h2>
<p>Placing any large server into a production environment requires extensive monitoring capabilities in order to ensure operations are running smoothly. To that effect, Dendrite has been both the addition of OpenTracing and Prometheus support. Prometheus, also used heavily in Synapse, allows a homeserver operator to track a wide range of data including endpoint usage, resource management as well as user statistics over any given range of time.</p>
<p>In Dendrite, we are taking this one step further by introducing <a href="https://opentracing.io/">OpenTracing</a>, a language and platform-agnostic framework for tracking the journey of an endpoint call from incoming request to outgoing response, with every method, hierarchy change and database call in between. It will be immensely useful in tracking down performance issues, as well as providing insight into the most critical paths throughout the codebase and where we should focus most of our optimization efforts on. It also comes with a lovely dashboard courtesy of <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/">Jaeger</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image1.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3432" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image1-1024x527.png" alt="" width="1024" height="527" /></a></p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>We've also seen some encouraging interest and development work from the community in the past couple months. While PR review from our own side is admittedly slow due to our focus on getting the foundational work in place, that hasn't stopped both old and new developers from sending in PRs and performing code reviews. A huge thank you to everyone involved! From this we've gotten API implementations and application service fixes from @turt2live, <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1022887733931520001">an end-to-end encryption implementation from @fadeAce</a>, filtering support from @CromFr, and some PRs and numerous helpful review comments from @krombel.</p>
<p>We've also started to see some people running Dendrite in live environments, which is incredibly exciting for us to see! While Dendrite is not considered production-ready yet (though it moves closer every day), if you are interested in giving it a go please consult the quickstart <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/INSTALL.md">installation guide</a>. We look forward to any feedback you may have!</p>

<p><a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been working away on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>, and has a major breakthrough:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It means you can log in to the bridge with your Matrix account to make messages you send from other Telegram clients appear from your Matrix account.</p>
<p>It can also be used to enable bridging of ephemeral events, which synapse doesn't send to appservices (read receipts, typing notifications, presence).</p>
<p>Also, the bridge has a new HTML parser which should be much better than the old one. It might have caused some new bugs though (like m.emote bridging breaking)</p>

<h2 id="coffee-and-the-faqbot">Coffee and the FAQBot</h2>
<p>I've been slowly working on matrix.org the last couple of months, updating the FAQ, updating content and UI/appearance of <a href="/blog/try-matrix-now">try-matrix-now</a>. As you may know, the <a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee/FAQBot">FAQBot</a>, created and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee">Coffee</a>, uses try-matrix-now for it's data, so Coffee updated the bot to start to use some of the new fields.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The final puzzle piece needed for FAQBot has been put into place: https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/extract-web-to-org<br />This is the bit that grabs &quot;Try Matrix Now!&quot; and turns it into questions that FAQBot can use.<br />While I was working on that bit of code anyway, I also added support for the new 'home', 'repo', 'room' and 'language' fields. FAQBot will now give more and better information accordingly. For example, it is now possible to ask, &quot;where is the Riot Android source code?&quot; although it is generally better to just ask &quot;where can I find Riot Android?&quot; which combines several fields into a single answer.<br />4 of 7 items are now completed: https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/FAQBot/issues/2<br />and the remaining 3 items before FAQBot's release are just the final review and integration tests.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We've got a new member of the maintainer crew in discord bridge land (bringing the total count to 2.) I'd like to welcome Sorunome :). They are going to be helping review the influx of PRs, chew some issues and be a point of contact in the community. They've already filled my PR queue up and it's going to help us move even faster!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> had a surprising week while working on his QMatrix projects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/me accidentally found a year-old feature branch in his Git and thought of rebasing it in order to <em>eventually</em> continue working on it. As a result, libQMatrixClient and Quaternion master branches support local echo from today. Too bad the same trick doesn't work for E2EE.</p>

                <h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates!</h2>
<p>First of all: we've just released the first draft of the proposal for our next generation State Resolution algorithm as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">MSC1442</a> (State Resolution: Reloaded).  This is the result of a massive amount of work from Erik - if you are at all interested in the problems that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1953">state resets</a> have plagued us with, then you will want to <strong>read the proposal and please comment on it</strong>!</p>
<p>The next step on State Resolution: Reloaded (once approved) is to be able to actually roll it out - and to this end, richvdh has proposed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1425">MSC1425 (Room Versioning proposal)</a>. This was published at the beginning of the week but we haven't had any feedback yet - again, please read &amp; give feedback as the intention is to start working on this as soon as possible!  Matthew's also been updating the Lazy Loading proposal (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1227">MSC1227</a>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Matrix Spec is now awash with activity, lots of work from <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> and others to accelerate progress. Take a look at the <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">proposals list</a> to stay up to date, or straight to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc">matrix-doc</a> repo and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> room to get the raw activity.</p>
<p>Finally, discussions relating to the spec proposal process itself have attracted attention: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1426">MSC1426</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1421">MSC1421</a>, and we're already trialling the new process (using Github PRs rather than Google Docs) in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">MSC1442</a> (State Resolution: Reloaded) already.</p>
<h2 id="nheko-0-5-x">nheko 0.5.x</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> 0.5.1 is out, and it's great! Get a version for your platform from <a href="https://bintray.com/mujx/matrix/nheko/">bintray.com</a>. I've been using it for the last week or so (on macOS) and found it very stable and usable. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mujx:matrix.org">mujx</a> commented that &quot;highlights were encryption support &amp; desktop notifications on all platforms&quot;, but you can get much more thorough notes from the <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko/releases">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="plasma">Plasma</h2>
<p>It's been several weeks since we mentioned <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/">Plasma</a>, but work on the C2S parts of the spec implementation have been happening quietly behind the scenes. Project lead <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/">Nico</a> said recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've updated the CI test server with the latest snapshot version of plasma. <code>createRoom</code> and <code>invite</code> C2S endpoints are fully implemented and should work as expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find the full list of implemented endpoints <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/blob/master/README.md">in the readme</a>, and also read the <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/blob/master/docs/architecture.md">architecture overview</a>.</p>

In the future we will also allow you to create DMs from Matrix so that you can contact users without even logging into Discord. With thanks to the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discord:half-shot.uk">#discord:half-shot.uk</a> community for helping shape this feature!</p>
<p>Currently this is in PR form but is very likely to make it into the 0.3 release of <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</a>.</p>

<p>For those who (want to) use Foonetic IRC channels, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> is here for you! Previously this bridge had been down due to invalid certificates, but this is now resolved.</p>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Synapse 0.33 landed on Thursday, boasting 2x speed-ups for /sync and (briefly) meaning that the matrix.org homeserver felt impressively snappy and fast!  Ironically traffic levels promptly grew again such that the synapse master process is now the bottleneck once more, but between incremental state res, python 3 and upcoming room-sharding work we should see the performance fixes continuing to come!  Meanwhile, lots of PRs in the queue for Synapse 0.34 - including Lazy Loading support as per (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1227">MSC1227</a>), and a whole new set of stats functionality for tracking per-room and per-user stats.</p>
<h2 id="riot">Riot</h2>
<p>Lots of activity in the build up to Riot/Web 0.16 - merging the new Slate rich text editor to /develop (try it now!), upgrading Jitsi and turning it on by default (at last!! - again, try it on /develop, although you'll have to enable it in Labs).  We'd be particularly interested in how Jitsi is behaving, as so far for us it's been unrecognisably improved over the previous deployment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, lots of work on Lazy Loading members on Riot/Web and Riot/iOS, and lots of stability perf work in general across mobile.</p>

<h2 id="apwhitehat-is-working-on-dendrite"><a href="@apwhitehat:matrix.org">apwhitehat</a> is working on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite updates for TWIM (before GSoC 2nd eval):
This month we've got most of the federation APIs working on Dendrite. These are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>State APIs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/486">#486</a></li>
 	<li>Get missing events API <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/516">#516</a></li>
 	<li>Query user devices <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/498">#498</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We still need to figure out pagination for backfill API.</p>
<p>On applications services, we've got a lot of APIs working, thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>. Authentication now acknowledges App services, though lot of other stuff is under review. I am eagerly waiting for it to land.</p>

<p>On the same topic, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've had a PR from fadeAce/dirichlet_zby for the server-side implementation of end-to-end encryption support in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>. Will be looking forward to seeing that land as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Encryption in matrix-python-sdk should now work fairly well.<br />The biggest parts to write were device tracking and key persistence.

<p>Welcome to This Week in Matrix, let's see what updates the community has to offer this week!</p>
<h2 id="koma">koma</h2>
<p>Announcing his update nearly a week ago, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@radicus:matrix.org">radicus</a> released <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/releases/tag/0.7.3">v0.7.3</a> of <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">koma</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There have been quite some changes since updates of the project were last posted, but the major ones are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Upgrade to JavaFx 9</li>
 	<li>Experimental support for infinite scroll on message list</li>
 	<li>Rewrite ListView to improve performance and reduce jar file size</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="dialogflow-connector">dialogflow connector</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@vurpo:vurpo.fi">vurpo</a> has released <a href="https://gitlab.com/vurpo/matrix-dialogflow">matrix-dialogflow</a>, which allow the use of DialogFlow agents as chatbots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've written a little bot for connecting a DialogFlow agent to Matrix as a chatbot. I did this for my own personal purposes but I know someone else might find this handy as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</h2>
<p><a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New stuff in mautrix-telegram:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>A basic telematrix database import script</li>
 	<li>Improved config for relaybot message formatting, including the option to use Matrix displaynames (instead of just mxid localparts)
I've also been planning an improved Matrix-&gt;Telegram formatting converter and a provisioning API for integration managers like Dimension.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="jmsdk">jmsdk</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> has been working on a matrix client this week. To that end, he has implemented <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk">jmsdk</a>, a &quot;very early version of the matrix sdk and common classes (client, bot, …)&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently implemented the matrix client on the java with full support of the C2S API. It still under development and contains bugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has also been working on a &quot;bot sdk with core classes to write custom bots and appservices.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have successful VoIP bridging between Matrix and regular phones using Freeswitch, for 1:1, both directions! a v0.1 is scheduled in a few days once configuration is possible and a getting started doc is written.</p>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>more voice backends (think Jitsi, etc.)</li>
 	<li>SMS support with Twilio and/or OVH initially</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd">mxisd</a> integration to automatically invite bridge users if needed and suggest bridge users</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxgwd</a> integration to auto-join HS regular users if a VoIP bridge user invites them, so &gt; calls are directly seen</li>
 	<li>And much more in later releases</li>

<h2 id="transform">transform</h2>
<p>A wild <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bettiah:matrix.org">bettiah</a> appeared, announced a completely new homeserver implementation in TypeScript:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been working on a homeserver implementation over at <a href="https://github.com/bettiah/transform">https://github.com/bettiah/transform</a> . It is fairly basic at the moment, but the development experience is straight-forward and even fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm interested to see a TypeScript backend running, and of course it's great to have more homeserver implementations! Some highlights from the <a href="https://github.com/bettiah/transform">readme</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Transform is a matrix homeserver built using Typescript and Redis. It is not fully functional yet.
<strong>Status:</strong> Register, Login, CreateRoom, Invite &amp; Join seem to be functional with riot web client. But quite a lot of functionality is missing and the software is definitely not ready for deployment in a public facing role.
<strong>Design:</strong> A lot of the code is auto-generated from the excellent swagger specs for the client-server api.
<strong>Contributing</strong>: It is early days yet. However, Typescript has enabled safe &amp; rapid progress. Redis streams too seem to have a very well thought out api and the whole thing has been a fun experience so far. Contributions are very welcome.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am working on implementing end-to-end encryption in the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">Python SDK</a>. As of now, I have done a good part of the encryption and decryption work with Olm and Megolm, enough to allow communicating with Riot in an encrypted room. My next goals include device list tracking and key persistence, which are the main steps left before the implementation starts being usable in a real environment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My aim is to achieve feature completion on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>. Have got lots of help from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>, for which I'm very grateful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Features worked on this month:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>we made a transactions cache/table for idempotency. So now dendrite will not reprocess events as far as client-server api is concerned.</li>
 	<li>added request authentication function which recognises an application service user (partially landed.)</li>
 	<li>username auto generation, which let's you register without username (will be used for guest access later.)</li>
 	<li>We also added a tokens library based on macaroons, however we might not be using it anytime soon. Since it's been known to be very problematic (on synapse).</li>
 	<li>Other small bug fixes not big enough to mention.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="kitsune-gtad-and-libqmatrixclient"><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>: <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad">GTAD</a> and <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has announced <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad">GTAD</a> v0.6 and <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> v0.3. We've covered <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad">GTAD</a> before, but I think it's worth including this note from the readme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GTAD (Generate Things from an API Description) is a generator of code from a Swagger/OpenAPI specification. Initially made to generate marshalling/unmarshalling C++ code for Matrix CS API, it can be extended to support other API descriptions and other programming languages with static type checking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> regarding the GTAD 0.6 release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version of API code generator, GTAD, 0.6, has been released today, adding support of variant types, proper dealing with definitions referencing other files ($ref) and more options to override schema names - even defined inline. Most importantly, GTAD has got extensive README.md that describes (most of) the things needed to start writing your own templates! As usual, kitsune will be happy to help those who would like to try it (both with C/C++ projects and other languages).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>libQMatrixClient has been benefiting from GTAD over the last 4 months or so - but this is the first release where GTAD is stable and feature-complete enough to be shared with other projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://matrix.to/#/#gtad:matrix.org">#gtad:matrix.org</a> is the new room for GTAD chat and support.</p>
<p>and <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> 0.3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version of libQMatrixClient, 0.3, comes out this weekend. This is the first libQMatrixClient release to include (almost) all CS API requests and supplementary (non-event) definitions, thanks to GTAD 0.6. Notably, it now includes jobs to register users, manage devices and keys on the server (no local key management yet - E2E work has just begun). This version also gains centralised request error handling so that clients could deal with problems in a unified way, and support &quot;Consent not given&quot; errors of GDPR fame, so that client authors could automatically open consent pages. You can also trigger logging out of all devices through libQMatrixClient thanks to a very recent addition to CS API spec from <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We've got a shiny new application service component which runs as a separate process (if you're doing multiprocess dendrite) that handles all outbound communication to application services. Last week I got event sending working. This week I'm hooking up an internal API for other components (roomserver, c-s api) to talk to the app service component, as we occasionally need to ping AS's to ask about existence of rooms or users. Getting those two endpoints covered is the goal of this week.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> appeared with an extremely ambitious piece of work. His goal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to create a full spec's implementation on java (all 5 specification). After that I want try to write a homeserver (2 variants: distributed on java+kafka and simple which can run on a light vps). But it's a long-term goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far work has begun on an implementation of the Matrix API in Java:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon</a> - another java implementation of the matrix api (client-server, server-server, application server, push server, identity server) using jax-ws. It corresponds the specification on <a href="/docs/spec">https://matrix.org/docs/spec</a>. On the next step I want dive deep into synapse to parse it's api and fill the gaps of the spec with sending pull request. May be I will write something like a TCK (test compatibility kit).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And an SDK for which there is a sample bot for mastodon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also this project has a very early sdk (client, bot). I will fix it after finishing works with the spec.
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/mxtoot">https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/mxtoot</a> - matrix-mastodon bridge.
With this bridge you can invite a bot and read your home mastodon's timeline, post messages, reply and boost messages.</p>

<p><b>HAPPY GDPR DAY EVERYONE!!!!1!</b></p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Our long-awaited new <a href="/docs/guides/privacy_notice.html">privacy policy</a> & <a href="/docs/guides/terms_and_conditions.html">term & conditions</a> for the matrix.org server are here - Phase 1 is complete!
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Folks are already accepting the new policies - thanks.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">We're going to start requiring acceptance to access the matrix.org server on Tuesday (May 29th).
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">We're already receiving our first GDPR requests… :|
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Erasure and Right-to-be-forgotten work (Phase 2) is next up so we can action the requests in a timely manner.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like we will go ahead on removing MXIDs on events as a Phase 3 (although for now we do warn people that this is effectively a technical limitation of Matrix, albeit one that we're working on).
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="client-updates">Client Updates</h2>
<h3 id="mtxclient-e2e-progress">mtxclient E2E progress</h3>
<p>Big E2E progress from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mujx:matrix.org">mujx</a>, developer of the <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> client on his project <a href="https://github.com/mujx/mtxclient">mtxclient</a>. <a href="https://github.com/mujx/mtxclient/commit/7e522df71c804cbc04f38007c3958ebbb56815d3">As of this week</a>, mxtclient is able to decrypt group events. When writing (that is, sending encrypted messages) is complete, the idea is to migrate this work back to nheko, though mujx points out this library could be used in any client.</p>

<h3 id="jontheniceguy-bridging-video">JonTheNiceGuy bridging video</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@JonTheNiceGuy:matrix.org">JonTheNiceGuy</a> produced a helpful video describing how to use bridges for IRC, Slack and Telegram, showing the difference between the different bridges. I found this to be really clear and well-paced for following the many practical details of bridging.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;finished edit passing between Discord and Matrix, as well as support for discord's custom emojis (though UX is a bit manual until <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1256">TravisR's proposal</a> goes through ?)&quot;</p>

This project fixes a UI issue Brendan had with the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-facebook">Facebook Messenger Bridge</a>, namely that activity in 1:1 rooms was not clear enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This small tool will take the local part of the room ID created by the Matrix&lt;&gt;Facebook Messenger bot once the friend has joined it, identify th friend, and grab their avatar and display name to set the room's.</p>

<p>this makes it more resilient to synapse hiccups, as well as general failures</p>

<h3 id="matrixboard-from-betz">matrixboard, from betz</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@betz:hackerspaces.be">betz</a> runs the <a href="https://hackerspaces.be/">https://hackerspaces.be/</a> matrix server and has this week, inbetween repairing his Synapse install, been working on a project called <a href="https://github.com/betz/matrixboard">matrixboard</a>. This tool is used to output the last five messages from a given room to displayed as HTML, the idea being to display output from a specific room as a website widget. You can see an example using <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev</a> <a href="http://matrix.hackerspaces.be:1337/!XqBunHwQIXUiqCaoxq:matrix.org?color=green">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="opsdroid-room-state-connector">opsdroid room state connector</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@SolarDrew:matrix.org">SolarDrew</a> implemented a <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/database-matrix">database module</a>for <a href="https://opsdroid.github.io/">opsdroid</a> to allow Matrix room state to be used to persist chat bot memory. (Suggestion apparently came from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a>, the human not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadair_Idris">the place</a>.)</p>
<p>The idea of using the room state to encapsulate bot data per-room was well received, discussion in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#TWIM:matrix.org</a> suggests this is an estabilished practice for some developers.</p>
<h3 id="matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</h3>
<p>No general GSOC round-up this week, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@adam:thebeckmeyers.xyz">&amp;Adam</a> shared the news that GSOC-student <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Zil0:matrix.org">Zil0</a>'s first PR towards E2E in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a> landed on master.

<blockquote>
<p>As part of my master's thesis, I wrote the DSN Traveller bot, which is crawling the matrix federation to measure the shape and size of the matrix network, and how distributed it currently is. The bot is already in a smaller number of rooms for testing, and will join the remaining rooms over the next days.
