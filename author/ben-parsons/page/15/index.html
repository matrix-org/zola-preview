<p>Longer than usual episode of Matrix Live this week. Amber talks to Neil about the works she's been doing over the last few months to port Synapse from Python 2 to Python 3. Recommended for anyone who's been following along the progress of Synapse, or who wants a good intro on the benefits of Python 3 over Python 2.</p>

<h2 id="zerophone">ZeroPhone</h2>
<p>This week we learned about ZeroPhone, a fairly mature project aiming to <a href="https://wiki.zerophone.org/index.php/Main_Page">build a working cellphone on top of a Raspberry Pi Zero</a>.</p>
<blockquote>an open-source smartphone that can be assembled for 50$ in parts. It is Linux-powered, with UI software written in Python.
Currently, ZeroPhone is based on Raspberry Pi Zero, SIM800L GSM modem and 1.3" OLED screen and button interface.</blockquote>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@adam:thebeckmeyers.xyz">&amp;Adam</a> was the first to bring it to our attention:
<blockquote>I stumbled across this blog post which mentions a matrix app in a project to create an open, hackable phone out of a raspberry pi. It's old news at this point I guess, but I don't think I've seen it mentioned here, so I thought it might be a neat thing worth featuring: <a href="https://zerophone.github.io/newsletter/ZeroPhone-Weekly-No.-16/">https://zerophone.github.io/newsletter/ZeroPhone-Weekly-No.-16/</a></blockquote>
The creator of the Matrix app, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@derivmug:matrix.org">derivmug</a> also arrived to tell us about his work:
<blockquote>Hey everyone, I have been suggested to post about the <a href="https://wiki.zerophone.org/index.php/Main_Page">Zerophone project here</a>. I have written a basic matrix client for it. It's basically a simple phone based on a raspberry pi zero, focused on privacy, security and hackability.</blockquote>
The client app is built using the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a>, I'm also hoping to chat to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@derivmug:matrix.org">derivmug</a> as part of a future Matrix Live. <a href="https://github.com/ZeroPhone/ZPUI/tree/devel/apps/matrix">Take a look at the code here</a>.
<p>Just to prove it's running on real hardware!</p>

<h2 id="the-federation-the-federation-info">The Federation (the-federation.info)</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:feneas.org">Jason Robinson</a> is passionate about Federated technology, and has been working on his site at <a href="https://the-federation.info/">https://the-federation.info/</a> for some time. He recently added Matrix to the list of protocols he scrapes and lists:</p>
<blockquote>Matrix (or more specifically, Synapse) servers are now visible on the The Federation info website at <a href="https://the-federation.info/matrix%7Csynapse">https://the-federation.info/matrix%7Csynapse</a>. The website collects lists of servers for various federation protocols (like Matrix, ActivityPub, Diaspora, etc). If a server outputs usage information, it also shows some historical information for servers and projects. Currently the information available from Synapse on the site is just version, availability of registrations and (obviously) domain name. If you want to register your server, check https://the-federation.info/info for more details. Tips also welcome on how to register other Matrix server projects and how to get more data out of servers.</blockquote>

 	<li><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> 0.4.0 was released, though it has no changes since the release candidate.

Hopefully it's now generic enough so that when mautrix-telegram switches to mautrix-python, it can drop most of the built-in HTML parser.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a>:</p>
<blockquote>matrix-appservice-discord received a lot of work these past days.
Not only the usual small bugfixes, but also some rather big changes:
The parsers for both Discord-&gt;Matrix sending and Matrix-&gt;Discord sending were re-written completely to properly handle things (and thus, at the same time, crunch a bunch of edge-case bugs!).
In addition, the long-awaited highlighting issues with @ everyone and @ here (on discord) and @ room (on matrix) were addressed.
Some of these things are still in PR stage, but expected to be merged soon!</blockquote>

<h2 id="spec-foundation">Spec &amp; Foundation</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Two workshops happened with the Foundation lawyers to work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318">MSC1318</a> - basically fleshing out a proposal for the details of the foundation governance in terms of how the Guardians (i.e. directors of the foundation board) should interact with the Core Spec Team to act as a back-stop - and working out how to port the MSC (once finished) into formal Articles of Association &amp; adjunct documents. We'll get the workshop notes written up as a rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318">MSC1318</a> very shortly.</li>
 	<li>New MSCs from vdH on:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1721">MSC1721</a> Rename m.login.cas to m.login.sso</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1730">MSC1730</a> Mechanism for redirecting to an alternative server during login</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>…and an alternate to MSC1730: MSC1731 Mechanism for redirecting to an alternative server during SSO login.</li>
 	<li>These three SSO-related MSCs are derived from work being done for a large-scale Matrix deployment for a New Vector customer which we should be able to talk about in future. Improving SSO and other auth/identity work in Matrix is vital, and needless to say we're trying to ensure all the resulting work ends up in the spec to the benefit of the whole ecosystem :)</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a> has received a lot of updates in the last few weeks. Although mostly bug fixes and improvements, there's added support for streaming downloads from remote servers. This is mostly useful when someone posts a 100mb video in a room: previously the media repo would download the entire thing then send it over to you. Now it'll send you the video while it also caches it.</blockquote>
<h2 id="matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</h2>
<p>Big update from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> this week:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> has received some updates in the past few weeks - fixing minor bugs, improving documentation, adding support for additional <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a>/<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web">Riot</a> features, etc.
<p>Most notably (in oldest to most-recent order):</p>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> heard you like playbooks, so he made it possible to <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/commit/67e2bf285d44c0cb392ba1e28e615053b748c03c">run the playbook from another playbook</a>. Thanks Cadair!</li>
 	<li>some <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#bc-break-renaming-playbook-variables">configuration renaming</a> to make things more consistent. Most people would likely be unaffected.</li>
 	<li>support has been added for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#postgres-11-support">Postgres 11</a>. Upgrading is possible and easy (as a related success story, Aaron Raimist shared that he recently upgraded his ~40GB database)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#ssl-protocols-used-to-serve-riot-and-synapse">more flexible and more secure-by-default TLS configuration</a>. Thanks Aaron Raimist!</li>
 	<li>the ability to <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#customize-parts-of-riots-config">customize more parts of riot-web</a>. Thanks Aaron Raimist!</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#ability-to-set-synapse-log-levels">better control over Synapse logging</a>. Thanks Aaron Raimist!</li>
 	<li>the ability to <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#support-for-controlling-public-registration-and-room-auto-join">set up a public server</a> and the ability to make use of Synapse's \\"auto-join\\" feature. Until now, the playbook was only suited for setting up a private server, but with this, setting up public servers is now a possibility. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/anadahz">@anadahz</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm quite happy that the playbook is getting more contributions from others now and is improving in such diverse ways!</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com">#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com</a> support room in Matrix is now bridged to the <code>#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</code> IRC Freenode channel, making it easier for people to get support when they don't have a working homeserver.</p>

<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/tijder/SmsMatrix">SMSMatrix</a> now has a room (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#smsmatrix:matrix.org">#smsmatrix:matrix.org</a>). SMSMatrix is a simple bridge between Matrix and SMS, developed by tijder. You install an android app and register a bot account which will invite you to direct chats under the name of anyone who sends you an SMS, which will then act as a normal SMS conversation.</blockquote>
I had a very quick play with this tool and it works great - a good way to quickly bridge SMS to Matrix.

<p>News from the <a href="https://riot.im/">Riot</a> teams:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-android-redesign-PoC/tree/develop">Android rewrite is continuing in Kotlin</a> - lots of infrastructure work over the last few weeks</li>
 	<li>E2E key backups landed in Riot/iOS develop (but no UI yet, as we finalise the implementation first on Riot/Web)</li>
 	<li>E2E key backups also landed in Riot/Web develop (but with placeholder UI)</li>
 	<li>E2E key backups in dev on Riot/Android too (using Realm for storage!)</li>
 	<li>Lots of work from uhoreg on E2E cross-signing
</li>
 	<li>Work on the Riot/Web redesign paused for a week due to other commitments but as of Nov 26th we're back on the case again, making up for lost time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Most of the focus from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">Synapse</a> team this week has been on the new version using Python 3:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Py3 is finished, other than Debian packages - ongoing debate on whether they should use a virtualenv or depend on debian dependencies, and who should maintain them in a Py3 world…</li>
 	<li>Lots of running around on final Py3 bugs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has continued work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.modular.im/">Modular.im</a> provides Hosted Homeservers for Matrix.</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Modular now has full support for Custom DNS (letting you point your own SRV records at it)</li>
 	<li>Lots of work on a migration tool to allow folks to easily shift Matrix accounts between servers, as well as (in future) migrations from HipChat, Slack &amp; others.</li>
</ul>

The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-bridge/">matrix-puppet-bridge</a> projects have gotten relatively quiet over the past year or so, but there's still plenty of bridges with plenty of features to implement and plenty of bugs to fix (and, even more importantly, bugs to <em>report</em>!) for any would-be-contributors who'd like to use a trusted Matrix homeserver as their double-puppetting Slack/iMessage/Facebook/GroupMe/iChat/Skype/Hangouts/Signal/Tox client from which to brag to their friends on the other platforms about how great Matrix is.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The maubot management UI has progressed well, but isn't quite ready yet. I think it should be usable by Next Week in Matrix.
It can be used to set up and configure a maubot instance and plugins. Once it's ready, it should be possible to do everything except installing maubot itself through the UI: installing and updating plugins, adding matrix clients, configuring plugin instances, viewing logs, etc.</blockquote>

<h2 id="hk-bot-is-an-anti-abuse-bot">HK Bot is an anti-abuse bot</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee">Coffee</a> continues his streak of TWIM mentions by bringing a new bot to combat abuse:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/HKBot">HK Bot</a> is an anti-abuse bot for public <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a> chatrooms.
This is a bot that really shouldn't exist, but since some people just like to make others' lives more difficult, here we are.
The purpose of this bot is twofold. It can automatically oversee rooms and respond to abuse, based on programmable pattern rules, providing a stop-gap measure in case no human moderators are nearby. It can also automate some tedious tasks via its command interface, the primary one being the complete redaction of all of an abuser's messages.
HK Bot is still under construction and contains dangerous features. Use with caution.</blockquote>
<h2 id="x-sampa-to-ipa-bot">X-SAMPA to IPA bot</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dandellion:dodsorf.as">Dandellion</a> &quot;made an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA">X-SAMPA</a> to IPA bot based on matrix-bot-sdk and discord's conniebot&quot;. This bot essentially lets you use ASCII characters to get an output in IPA. The advantage of this is that you can much more easily type and transmit pronunciation (because you don't need to find the characters).</p>
<blockquote>I'll just have to make it a bit more configurable, but then I'll throw the source up
When making constructed languages and talking about linguistics, it's nice to get an easily readable IPA representation of a word, but it's really hard to write IPA, which is why x-sampa exists as a way to input IPA with a normal keyboard!</blockquote>
<h2 id="informo">Informo</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@vabd:weu.informo.network">vabd</a>, the unknown organiser of Informo provided an update about the spec:</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> also continued work on bridging via libpurple: &quot;I've nearly got group chats working, with invites (and hopefully people joining and leaving them showing up properly) as well as user's having profiles.&quot;</p>
<p>Work continues on <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">Koma</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Since the last TWIM update, koma is updated to kotlin 1.3, experimental coroutines are replaced with stable ones. The changes are being tested and should be merged soon. A new contributor has joined, so expect development to speed up a bit.</blockquote>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a>, a Matrix client built using <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libqmatrixclient</a>, runs great on macOS. I'm excited because I get to play with another client! <a href="https://bintray.com/encombhat/Spectral/Spectral#files">Find .dmgs on bintray</a>.

<p>This week, the first steps were taken in the creation of the Matrix Foundation! Read our <a href="/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2/">blog post from earlier this week</a> for more:</p>
<blockquote>in preparation for the upcoming Matrix 1.0 release, we've been moving ahead with the rest of the open governance plan – and we're happy to announce that as of a few hours ago, the <strong>initial incarnation of The Matrix.org Foundation exists!</strong><br />Watch this space over the coming weeks as we announce the Guardians and finish bootstrapping the Foundation into its final long-term form!

<h2 id="hello-matrix">Hello Matrix</h2>
<p>Alex has managed the invaluable <a href="https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php">https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php</a> for some years, but in two weeks time will be making some changes to the page:<br /><blockquote>Just wanted to let everyone know that changes are coming to the server list: I've put up a notice on the site that starting Nov 16th I will only show a curated list of servers I would recommend to join.<br />This reduces the workload for me quite a bit and avoids me becoming some kind of arbiter on what encompasses the Matrix universe… I think it is also more useful for users who are looking for a server to join.<br />And there is always <a href="https://matrixstats.org">matrixstats.org</a> for those who are looking for a more complete-ish list of known homeservers.</blockquote><br />However, if you have ideas on how to continue the project, or would like to step up and get involved in maintaining a list using data and tools from Hello Matrix, please <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">contact me</a>.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has continued work on the revamped, now-Pythonic <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a>, and has added a management API:</p>
<blockquote>The <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a> management API I mentioned last week is now mostly ready. It should be possible to use it to set up a maubot instance and plugins without filling the database manually. There's no UI yet though, so it still means <code>curl</code>ing manually.<br />The management API also supports the fancy plugin reloading stuff which was the &gt; reason I rewrote maubot in python: You can <code>POST</code> an updated plugin to the API and it'll install it without having to restart.<br />I also made a bunch of plugins while working on the API that I used to test the API: a <a href="https://github.com/maubot/dice">dice rolling/calculator bot</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/maubot/media">bot that replies with the MXC URI of images you send it</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/maubot/echo">simple echo/ping bot</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/maubot/xkcd">xkcd bot</a><br /><br />Next steps are making the management UI, a few more plugins and making setup and development instructions so that other people could run it and make plugins</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> is often found working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a> (previously 'Matrique'.) This week, he has been building <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nsfw:encom.eu.org">@nsfw:encom.eu.org</a>, which is a bot designed to give scores for how likely an image should be classified as NSFW. It's a simple mechanism, you give it an image, it gives you a JSON object with the result. For example:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nsfw-bot.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3734" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nsfw-bot.png" alt="" width="936" height="1004" /></a></p>
<p>My avatar returned less than 1% probability of being NSFW, which I was actually a little offended by.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-live-season-3-episode-2">Matrix Live, season 3 episode 2</h2>
<p>We continue the new season of Matrix Live. This re-booted season has a slightly different format to previous: in each outing, there will be a single deep-dive topic. This week, Matthew and recent-Matrix-arrival Nad discuss UX for E2E encryption key handling. This is an unsurprisingly complex design question, both in terms of how it should behave and how it should look. Nad shared his <a href="/blog/2018/11/02/user-experience-preview-end-to-end-encryption-by-default/">latest thinking in a blog post earlier today</a>, and you can watch the video below.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</h2>
<p>We've covered the growth of this project several times in TWIM, but I wanted to give a little more attention to the work <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> has been doing with <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>. Synapse is a large Python project with many configurable options, and many optional components, so installing it has sometimes been a challenge. I have seen many reports that using Ansible and Docker, and in particular using these playbooks from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a>, is a more sane way to install Synapse. The tools get a lot of attention and updates. This week, Slavi reports:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> now has a <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/maintenance-checking-services.md">self-check command</a> that can help diagnose various configuration problems with the setup (DNS records being misconfigured, firewall ports not being open, etc).</blockquote><br />For support and more info, come join the associated room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com">#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com</a><br /><br /><em>Late breaking news</em> from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a>:<br /><blockquote>One more <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> update: the playbook can now <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-whatsapp.md">set up Whatsapp-bridging</a> via <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a>.

<h2 id="dimension">Dimension</h2>
<p>Dimension is an integration manager for Matrix. It's written and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>, and allows you to an a pre-defined selection of widgets, bots and bridges to improve your self-hosted Matrix experience. Check out: <a href="https://dimension.t2bot.io/">https://dimension.t2bot.io/</a>. This week, TravisR reports:</p>
<blockquote>Dimension has received quite a lot of updates over the last week. Here's what's hot off the press:
<ul>
 	<li>4 new bridges can be self-hosted and managed in Dimension: Telegram, Webhooks, Slack, and Gitter.</li>
 	<li>3 new widgets are available: Grafana, TradingView, and Spotify.</li>
 	<li>Add your own custom bots for people to add to their rooms.</li>
 	<li>A dark theme has been added and is automatically applied if you use the dark theme in Riot.</li>
 	<li>The overall UI has been updated to be slightly more modern and less bright orange.</li>
 	<li>Various bug fixes and improvements (is it even possible to have a changelog without this?)</li>
</ul>
As per usual, if you find any bugs or have ideas for things to add to Dimension feel free to come by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dimension:t2bot.io">#dimension:t2bot.io</a></blockquote>
<h2 id="mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been working on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>, and has made some massive performance improvements:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> now uses the non-ORM part of SQLAlchemy for database tables that are used often. That change made the CPU usage on the t2bot.io instance drop from ~100% to ~7%</blockquote>
We have graphs to illustrate the improvements:
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mautrix-telegram1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3683" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mautrix-telegram1.png" alt="" width="471" height="174" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>, who hosts the bridge on <a href="https://t2bot.io/telegram">t2bot.io</a>, reports that the bridge is now effectively instantaneous!</p>

<h2 id="discord-bridge-0-3-0-rc1">Discord Bridge 0.3.0-rc1</h2>
<p>A tonne of work has happened on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">Discord Bridge</a>, and it has all been brought together in <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/releases/tag/0.3.0-rc1">0.3.0-rc1</a>.</p>

<p>We just missed out on this update from <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a> last week. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>Spectral now provides an AppImage along with Flatpak build.

<h2 id="new-communities">New communities</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@swedneck:swedneck.xyz">swedneck</a> has created a new gaming community on Matrix:</p>

<p>Last week we had an update from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> to say that there was a new <a href="https://lokalise.co/public/730769035bbc328c31e863.62506391/">Lokalise project</a> to allow <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> translations. This week, we learn that the first translations are now available:</p>
<blockquote>First couple of translations - German and Polish - have made it to the released <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> 0.0.9.3 - thanks to krombel and krkk for their contributions! Swedish and Russian translations are in the works.</blockquote>

<h2 id="informo-new-bot-for-spec-changes">Informo: new bot for spec changes</h2>
<p><strong>Informo</strong> is an ambitious project hoping to be a &quot;decentralised news network, making information accessible&quot;. The project lives at <a href="https://github.com/Informo">https://github.com/Informo</a>, but for now you can join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discuss:weu.informo.network">#discuss:weu.informo.network</a> to get their latest news.</p>
<p>This week, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@vabd:weu.informo.network">vabd</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote>We made a Matrix bot that shouts about updates to change submissions to Informo's specifications. It basically processes all changes made to the list of labels for each issue and PR of a GitHub repository's, and generates a notice message that it sends to the configured room(s). We made it because we wanted the people that are interested in Informo to know in real time about any change made to the state of proposals, along with the calls for public reviews. We just set it up in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discuss:weu.informo.network">#discuss:weu.informo.network</a>, and published its source code along with a built binary here: <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs-bot">https://github.com/Informo/specs-bot</a><br />It might also be worth noticing that, although we designed it to shout about updates to Informo's specifications proposals, we also made it compatible with other projects, e.g. the Matrix specs</blockquote>

<h2 id="greetings-from-mozfest">Greetings from Mozfest</h2>
<p><a href="https://mozillafestival.org">Mozfest</a> is a tech-focused event happening this weekend in London. Neil and I have been along tonight and we've been chatting to a lot of people about Matrix, decentralisation and all those things we love! Check out our very short and sweet video below!</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZqfTYwDz9HM" width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>This is the start of Season Three of Matrix Live. Matrix Live seasons are variable in length, based on the data available so far. From this season, Matrix Live with change the format slightly, based on feedback. The videos will try to be a bit more interesting, varied, and deep. With this video being the start of a new season, it was meant to be more substantive with us talking to Mozfest-ites, but I lost track of time, so this shorter but still energetic video will hopefully convey the idea.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>, master of the bridge, has been working with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> to produce a new RC for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack">bridging Matrix and Slack</a>.</p>
<blockquote>We've got a Slack RC out at long last! Rejoice! It's absolutely massive and full of features.</blockquote>
Half-Shot even provided this explanation of how it works:
<blockquote>Integrations manager &gt; sign into slack &gt; click your channel &gt; ??? &gt; channel bridged :)</blockquote>
See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/0.2.0-rc1">release notes</a>:
<blockquote>This is the first release of the Slack bridge. 0.1.0 has been the version number for previous efforts but was never an official release.</blockquote>
To test this integration, use Riot on <a href="https://riot.im/develop">https://riot.im/develop</a> and select the "Event Bridging" when adding the integration.

The plugin system seems to work well and I'm pretty sure I'll be able to implement proper plugin reloading now.
Next I'll implement plugin config storage and some way to manage maubot and plugins (maybe a plugin to manage plugins?)</blockquote>

<h3 id="riot-web-0-17-riot-android-0-8-18-lazy-loading">Riot Web 0.17, Riot Android 0.8.18: Lazy Loading</h3>
<p>This week saw the launch of Riot Web 0.17, and two bug-release updates (0.17.1 and 0.17.2) to fix issues on the Windows desktop app. This version is substantially faster due to its use of Lazy Loading room members. <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/riot-im-web-0-17-and-ios-0-7-6-smaller-footprint-faster-launch-5ddd18a65abb">Read more here</a>.   Meanwhile, Travis continues his foray into 'first impressions' bugs - including an initial implementation of .well-known URI support!</p>
<p>Riot Android 0.8.18 is also available from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app">Play Store</a> and <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.alpha/">F-Droid</a>, with Lazy Loading option available in the Labs menu (but still has a few bugs left).</p>
<p>Riot iOS meanwhile is busy implementing incremental server-side E2E key backups, and there's generally been a huge amount of work on E2E encryption UX across the board in preparation for all-new E2E on Web and iOS.  More details will be coming soon!</p>
<p>With this done, Riot is now getting a lot more attention on the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/a-sneak-peek-at-a-whole-new-riot-im-1114df653782">impending redesign</a>, with Bruno <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+redesign+author%3Abwindels">starting to merge</a> code to the experimental branch.</p>

<h3 id="coffee-on-matrix-console-for-android">Coffee on Matrix Console for Android</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee">Coffee</a> rolled a natural twenty for bravery this week.</p>
<blockquote>I have decided to take up maintainership of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-console">Matrix Console for Android</a> client. This is still the only multi-account capable Android client, but it is unmaintained and growing long in tooth. In particular, the API endpoints it uses may be removed from Synapse soon.
I will not be developing new features for it, but I will integrate reasonable patches if others want to take that on.
My own goals are to remove GCM and analytics, and get it added to F-Droid. And of course to switch to the latest API.
As part of this work, I have been fighting Gradle and its bugs to get <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">matrix-android-sdk</a> to build together with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-console">matrix-android-console</a> as a git submodule, so it's no longer necessary to inject the precompiled sdk into the source code. I did not win yet.</blockquote>

                <p>We have a brand new, exciting guide page offering an introduction to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">matrix-js-sdk</a>. This guide will live with the documentation at <a href="/docs/guides/usage-of-the-matrix-js-sdk">https://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-the-matrix-js-sdk</a>,  but you can find the text below.</p>
<hr />
<p>Matrix allows open real-time communications over the Internet using HTTP and JSON. This makes developing clients to connect to Matrix servers really easy! Because it's open, and uses simple syntax for messages, you can connect Matrix to anything that communicates over a standard HTTP interface - later projects in this series will explore ideas such as building bots, performing machine learning on message content, and connecting IoT devices such as Philips Hue lights.</p>
<h2 id="making-a-matrix-client">Making a Matrix Client</h2>
<p>Let's explore how we would make a very simple Matrix client, with only the ability to perform an initial sync, and to get member lists and the timeline for rooms of our choice.</p>
<p>This article will explore the <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/latest.html">Matrix Client-Server API</a>, making use of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/">matrix-js-sdk</a>. Later articles may discuss making the underlying calls. Specifically we will cover:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>login</li>
 	<li>simple syncing</li>
 	<li>listening for timeline events</li>
 	<li>access the <code class="highlighter-rouge">MatrixInMemoryStore</code></li>
 	<li>sending messages to rooms</li>
 	<li>how to respond to specific messages, as a bot would</li>
</ul>
We'll use Node.js as our environment, though the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/">matrix-js-sdk</a> can also be used directly in the browser.
<p>Before we start, make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed: follow instructions at <a href="https://nodejs.org/">nodejs.org</a> for your platform. Then create a new directory to work in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-unix">mkdir my-first-matrix-client
cd my-first-matrix-client
</code></pre>
<h2 id="let-s-write-javascript">Let's write JavaScript</h2>
<p>Once you're ready, the first thing to do is install the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/">matrix-js-sdk</a> from NPM:</p>
<pre><code class="language-unix">npm install matrix-js-sdk
</code></pre>
<p>We include the SDK in our source exactly as expected:</p>

<p></code></pre></p>
</div>
</div>
<strong>Note:</strong> it is essential to keep this access token safe, as it allows complete access to your Matrix account!
<h2 id="sync-and-listen">Sync and Listen</h2>
<p>Next we start the client, this sets up the connection to the server and allows us to begin syncing:</p>
<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fff;">
<pre class="highlight" style="background: #fff;"><code><span class="nx">client</span>
<span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nx">startClient</span>
<span class="p">();</span>
<p></code></pre></p>
</div>
</div>
Perform a first sync, and listen for the response, to get the latest state from the homeserver:
<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fff;">
<pre class="highlight" style="background: #fff;"><code><span class="nx">client</span>
<span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nx">once</span>
<span class="p">(</span>
<span class="s1" style="color: #d14;">'sync'</span>
<span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="kd" style="font-weight: bold;">function</span>
<span class="p">(</span>
<span class="nx">state</span>
<span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="nx">prevState</span>
<span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="nx">res</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
 <span class="p">{'{'}</span>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nx">log</span>
<span class="p">(</span>
<span class="nx">state</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1" style="color: #998; font-style: italic;">// state will be 'PREPARED' when the client is ready to use</span></p>
<p><span class="p">{'}'});</span></p>
<p></code></pre></p>
</div>
</div>
Once the sync is complete, we can add listeners for events. We could listen to ALL incoming events, but that would be a lot of traffic, and too much for our simple example. If you want to listen to all events, you can add a listen as follows:
<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fff;">
<pre class="highlight" style="background: #fff;"><code><span class="nx">client</span>
<span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nx">on</span>
<span class="p">(</span>
<span class="s2" style="color: #d14;">"event"</span>
<span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="kd" style="font-weight: bold;">function</span>
<span class="p">(</span>
<span class="nx">event</span>
<span class="p">){'{'}</span>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nx">log</span>
<span class="p">(</span>
<span class="nx">event</span>
<span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nx">getType</span>
<span class="p">());</span></p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nx">log</span>
<span class="p">(</span>
<span class="nx">event</span>
<span class="p">);</span></p>
<p><span class="p">{'}'})</span></p>
<p></code></pre></p>
</div>
</div>
Instead, let's just listen to events happening on the timeline of rooms for which our user is a member:
<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fff;">
<pre class="highlight" style="background: #fff;"><code><span class="nx">client</span>

<span class="p">(</span>

 <span class="p">{'{'}</span>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;

<p><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nx">log</span>
<span class="p">(</span>
<span class="nx">event</span>

<span class="nx">event</span>
<span class="p">);</span></p>
<p><span class="p">{'}'});</span></p>
<p></code></pre></p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="access-the-store">Access the Store</h2>
<p>When we created a new client with <code class="highlighter-rouge">sdk.createClient()</code>, an instance of the default store, <code class="highlighter-rouge">MatrixInMemoryStore</code> was created and enabled. When we sync, or instruct otherwise our client to fetch data, the data is automatically added to the store.</p>
<p>To access the store, we use accessor methods. For example, to get a list of rooms in which our user is joined:</p>
<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight" style="background: #fff;">
<pre class="highlight" style="background: #fff;"><code><span class="c1" style="color: #998; font-style: italic;">// client.client.getRooms() returns an array of room objects</span>

For each room, we can inspect the timeline in the store:

Take a look at the <code class="highlighter-rouge">msgtype</code> in the object above. In the previous example, we used "m.text" for this field, but now we're using "m.notice". Bots will often use "m.notice" to differentiate their messages. This allows the client to render notices differently, for example Riot, the most popular client, renders notices with a more pale text colour.

<p>There is much, much more to Matrix, the Client-Server API and the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/">matrix-js-sdk</a>, but this guide should give some understanding of simple usage. In subsequent guides we'll cover more detail and also explore projects you can build on top, such as IoT controls and chatbot interfaces. For now you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/tree/master/examples">other examples in the matrix-js-sdk itself</a>, and also the <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/latest.html">Matrix Client-Server API</a> which it implements.</p>

 	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1695">MSC1695</a></strong> <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has a newly released proposal relating to Message Edits:
<em>"The key difference to this proposal is that it's only the event schema which is based off the relates stuff. It does NOT do any kind of aggregations but simply is a format to allow bridges/clients to specify edits in the metadata."</em></li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1693">MSC1693</a></strong> Erik has been thinking about state res v2 in the case of rejected events</li>

<h2 id="libqmatrixclient-0-4-0">libQMatrixClient 0.4.0</h2>
<p>We mentioned libQMatrixClient progress last week, but this week <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> 0.4.0 has just been released: CS API 0.4.0, local echo, caching avatars to disk and more - check the release notes at <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient/releases/v0.4.0">https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient/releases/v0.4.0</a>!</blockquote>

<h2 id="informo">Informo</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@vabd:weu.informo.network">vadb</a>, back again with news about <a href="https://github.com/Informo">Informo</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The Informo specifications documentation is out! ? It now lives right here: <a href="https://specs.informo.network">https://specs.informo.network</a><br />As a reminder, we were working on "phase 1" of this documentation, which goal was to outline how Informo was going to work. This is basically the foundation for a more complete technical documentation, which shall come later.<br />The idea is to enable people to give it a look as soon as possible, and to enable them to contribute to Informo as early in the design process as possible. The spec is entirely open, with a <a href="https://specs.informo.network/introduction/scsp/">process for contributions</a> documented and all its source files available on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs">https://github.com/Informo/specs</a><br />The online version I initially linked is a live version from the repo's <code>master</code> branch, which is updated each time commits are pushed to it (including on merging a PR).<br />If people have any question or remark regarding the specs, or Informo in a general manner, we'll gladly answer them in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discuss:weu.informo.network">#discuss:weu.informo.network</a> (or on the #informo IRC channel on Freenode, which is bridged to the Matrix room)! ?</blockquote>
<h2 id="mxisd-v1-2-0-beta-1-beta-release">mxisd v1.2.0-beta.1 (beta release)</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> has continued work on <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd">mxisd</a>, an Identity Server:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a> got a new beta release <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.2.0-beta.1">v1.2.0-beta.1</a>.<br />It adds the ability to send email notification about room invites to existing accounts in Identity store that might not have been provisioned in the homeserver yet as users never logged in, or for users' profile that are not auto-populated with 3PIDs. This is especially targeted for onboarding/enrolling times when adopoting Matrix in groups/corporations or for custom setups.<br />We would love to hear about your experience with it!</blockquote>
<h2 id="matrix-trello-bot">matrix-trello-bot</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> has been working on <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-trello-bot">matrix-trello-bot</a>:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-trello-bot">matrix-trello-bot</a> has received quite the overhaul. It's gone from a small bot that had pre-determined notifications for board activity to a much more capable bot. The bot now supports managing boards (yes, you can create a board from within Matrix!), lists, and cards including creating, moving, archiving, assigning, and querying.<br /><br />On top of all that, the bot respects that not every room will want to receive every possible notification and offers commands to pick and choose which events it should notify about on a per-board basis. Feel free to <a href="https://t2bot.io/trellobot/">give it a spin</a> and check out the massive help menu with <code>!trello help</code>. Please send bugs and suggestions to GitHub :)</blockquote>
The help menu really is massive! Travis provided an image to highlight the scope of functionality provided (click for larger version):

<h3 id="riot-0-16-6-released">Riot 0.16.6 Released</h3>
<blockquote>Fixes only these two issues:
<ul>
 	<li>Firefox private mode being broken &gt; (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/2195)</li>
 	<li>Breakage when mixing /app and /develop use (issue #7432)</li>
</ul>
As both fixes are not relevant for electron, we didn't release 0.16.6 as the electron app, but rest assured 0.17 will of course be released as electron.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hey there, here's a quick update to let you know that we're making great progress towards the completion of phase 1 of Informo's specifications' documentation (i.e. general outline without going to much in depth into the technical specifications)! I've also updated the board to cut the big "Basic spec" task down into smaller tasks to give a more precise insight of our current progress<br />Once that phase 1 is done we'll publish the whole thing and migrate our work to a public GitHub repository so people can get to know Informo a bit better and contribute towards making the doc better if they want</blockquote>

<h2 id="sdks">SDKs</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> on mautrix-go and mautrix-python:</strong><br /><blockquote>My gomatrix fork is now <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-go">mautrix-go</a> and the basic client API stuff in <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python/tree/matrix-restructure">mautrix-python</a> is starting to be usable enough for me to start the rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a> in Python.<br />For a bit of background, maubot is a dynamic plugin-based bot system. It's currently written in Go, but due to many limitations in the Go plugin system, I decided to rewrite it in Python. matrix-python-sdk doesn't have asyncio or a maintainer, so I decided to make a new framework that combines my existing mautrix-appservice-python framework with a more generic client API layer.

They're mostly about the ability to tweak things affecting performance: Synapse cache factor configuration, the ability to enable/disable user presence tracking. The logging situation has also been improved for all Docker containers, so that their output would not get logged twice (once by systemd's journal, once by Docker) - something which was previously causing unpredictably-high disk usage for long-running containers.</blockquote><br /><strong><a href="https://github.com/ananace/">ananace</a>, Synapse for kubernetes:</strong><br /><blockquote>Updated the K8s tweaked packaging for Synapse 0.33.6 (And added a preliminary Python 3 version there as well)</blockquote>
