<h3 id="fosdem-2021">FOSDEM 2021</h3>
<p>FOSDEM is happening this year, regardless of pandemics or anything else! Actually FOSDEM in my experience is a huge super-spreader event even in normal years, so it may be refreshing to know that this year it will be <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/04/taking-fosdem-online-via-matrix">fully virtual, and hosted using Matrix and Jitsi</a>!</p>
<p>Matrix have several relevant talks happening:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/matrix_gitter/">Adding Matrix for interoperability to existing chat apps</a> <em>Saturday @ 10:25</em> (this is about Gitter bridging/integration)</li>
<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/matrix_pinecones/">Pinecones and Dendrites - P2P Matrix Progress</a> <em>Saturday @ 11:30</em> (this is about P2P)</li>
<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/matrix_communities/">Building massive virtual communities in Matrix</a> <em>Sunday @ 12:00</em> (this is about Spaces)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, there is a bonus talk from Brendan:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/community_devroom_mental_health_free_software/">Mental health and free software</a> <em>Sunday @ 13:50</em> (in which Brendan talks about mental health issues in the context of working on free software, which may or may not relate to people, though certainly not me, pinging him at all hours to ask about customer integrations and features)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, perhaps the most important part of FOSDEM: <strong><a href="https://shop.matrix.org/product/fosdem-2021-matrix-t-shirt-limited-edition">FOSDEM 2021 Matrix T-Shirt (Limited Edition)</a> is now available</strong></p>

<p>Appservice compatibility, I'm currently trying to get the mautrix-hangouts bridge to work</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/">FOSDEM</a> is tomorrow! We're all very excited to be powering the fosdem.org homeserver, and we hope you'll join in over the weekend.</p>
<p>Earlier this week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.27.0rc1">Synapse 1.27.0rc1</a>, though the final release is currently blocked on resolving a regression in Synapse 1.26 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9264">#9264</a>) which could cause logins to fail if your <code>public_baseurl</code> was unset in your Synapse configuration. The workaround is to ensure that value is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/docs/sample_config.yaml#L70-L81">correctly set</a> for your deployment.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we're quite excited to get 1.27 out the door, as it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solves an issue (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9172">#9172</a>) where federation senders could take many minutes to catch up after restarts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contains countless improvements to our support for social login methods, many of which will be live for FOSDEM users this weekend.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also included the usual host of bug fixes and Admin API additions, but more on those when the actual release happens. You can preview the release notes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.27.0rc1">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>See you at FOSDEM!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My iMessage bridge is starting to be usable now. Text and files work in both directions and tapbacks and replies work iMessage-&gt;Matrix. Currently it only supports running on a Mac, the iOS option will come later. The bridge doesn't require opening ports to the Mac, it uses a simple proxy that turns the usual HTTP appservice transactions into a websocket instead.</p>
<p>The bridge itself can be found at https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-imessage and the websocket proxy is at https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-wsproxy. The Matrix room is <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#imessage:maunium.net">#imessage:maunium.net</a></p>

Come see <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/matrix_gitter/">our FOSDEM talk</a> in the Real Time Communications track on Saturday around how we made Gitter speak Matrix and how you can add Matrix support to your own app: https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/matrix_gitter/</p>
<p>*--</p>
<p>We're also working on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> to support backfilling the massive archive of historical messages on Gitter over on Matrix. We're prototyping the MSC on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9247">Synapse</a> and have a suite of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/pull/68">Complement tests</a> to verify that the homeserver implementation is working according to the specification.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another release! Wow. We're also testing 0.24.0-rc1 which has quite a few big ticket items this week. Off the top of the list is a new command to <code>!plumb</code> rooms dynamically in admin rooms, provided you have permissions in the bridge (happy days self hosters!). We've also added the feature to warn if your messages don't get through in your admin room. Finally, there are a bunch of small bug fixes and one large one that should make the bridge <strong>much</strong> more resistant to netsplits, so that it should recover in a much safer way should it get hit by a ton of traffic. Please test, and if all goes well the formal release will be out next week!</p>

<p>It's been a little over 6 months since I've posted an update for Syphon in TWIM, but a lot has changed since then! There</p>

people start to contribute in various ways, including with PRs, and I can't thank people enough for all their hard work and support.</p>
<p>Big thanks to TR_SLimey whose contributions went out in this release! All that said, I'll try to give

<p>Cheers, some update probably mentioned it already, but FOSDEM is near. Make sure to check out the Matrix stand! RedSky and I (Nico) will probably be there at some random times as well as other cool people from the Matrix-verse! We even made a small promo video about Nheko!</p>
<p>In other news, lorendb extended the drop zone for media to the full timeline, the privacy screen got merged, some more emojis should now display properly, you can now change your avatar and displayname globally or per room and clicking a matrix link in your browser should now actually open the link in Nheko (we were missing the %u in the .desktop file).</p>

<p>NeoChat is continuing to make progress. First of all Tobias, Nicolas and Hannah have been working on packaging NeoChat for many platforms. We now have nightly builds for Android, Windows, macOS, AppImages and Flatpak. There is still work to be done to improve the quality of the builds and fixing some platform incompatibility bugs. Nicolas has also been working on optimizing the performance and the RAM usage, fixing a few bottlenecks. Tobias finally landed his big revamp of the login flow and we now support login using single sign-on. Myself (Carl) worked on E2EE support in NeoChat and Quotient. This week we finished our Qt bindings for libOlm and started adding device key tracking and more!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Then, later...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apart from the current releases, we have a few things cooking right now:</p>
<h4 id="edits">Edits</h4>
<p>Yes, I have tried to avoid them for long, but <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/pull/420">I am finally working on it</a>. It's a bit different to how Element and others do it, but it also generates a fallback to be compatible with the current MSCs where possible. I've grown a bit tired of having to explain myself everytime, why I did not want to support edits (yet), so I'm experimenting with a few solutions now. Expect a blog post summarizing those experiments in the future and maybe an MSC.</p>
<h4 id="polish">Polish</h4>
<p>Jedi18 and LorenDB are both busy polishing up the rough corners in Nheko, like finally being able to set your username and avatar in the UI as well as being able to copy text via right click, jdenticons and other fancy stuff. We also had a few contributions in the last release, which should improve the UX a lot.</p>
<h4 id="gsoc">GSoC</h4>
<p>Furthermore we will be participating in GSoC (if matrix.org gets accepted) and will probably mentor a student, that implements a few of the smaller features, which users may be missing after using Element for long.</p>
<p>I think that is all I wanted to share. I hope you enjoy the release and if you have any issues or feature requests, tell us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> or open an issue on Github!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the project is already fairly rich in features, I decided that it's timely (some would say - way overdue) to bump up the version a bit. In that light, the next Quaternion beta is numbered 0.0.95 beta 3 (no four-number version any more) and it's out now! <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.95-beta3">Release notes</a> list notable changes since (0.0.9.5) beta 2, with two most significant being ability to enter messages in Markdown and the overhauled timeline that allows you to easily discern between already read and yet unread messages and also quickly scroll to the read marker.</p>

<li>
<p>New website! <a href="https://beeperhq.com">beeperhq.com</a>. Beeper is a Matrix server+client combo preconfigured with 12+ bridges. Our mission is to bring a lot of new users into the Matrix ecosystem and give them a fast and powerful client to message people on all networks. Beeper is a paid subscription service, but since all the bridges are open source, you can set the whole system up yourself for free if you choose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're doing a lot of work to boost bridge reliability. Beeper now comes with bridges to Signal, Whatsapp, FB, Slack, Skype, Telegram, Instagram, Hangouts, Twitter, Discord. iMessage coming within a week or two.</p>

<p>We are offering bounties of $500-2,000 USD to build new open source bridges based on tulir's mautrix-python or mautrix-go libraries. In particular, we would love to commission Linkedin, MS Teams, Google Chat, GroupMe, WeChat, Snapchat (maybe run it in Anbox?), Line and Email (gmail specifically) bridges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are also looking for contract iOS and Android developers familiar with the Element codebase to reskin the app with our new UI. Part-time roles with potential for full time.</p>

<h3 id="gsoc-2021">GSOC 2021</h3>
<p>Google Summer of Code has come around again! Last year was really successful for Matrix: six projects, with members of the community coming forward to mentor students for their project. This year there is a slight tweak to the formula: <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/10/google-summer-of-code-2021-is-bringing.html">the projects will now be 175 hours, rather than the traditional 350, over the summer</a>.</p>
<p>Since we need to <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline">submit an application to Google within the next few weeks</a>, I have a request: if you admin a Matrix-related Open Source project and would like to have a student work with you over the summer, get involved!</p>
<p>How to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources">Google's own documentation</a> on the setup. This is fairly thorough, and should get you most of the way there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about a task, that you consider a student should be able to contribute to your project over a 10-week/175-hour period. Try to come up with 2-3 of these.</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be a well-defined feature that genuinely contributes to the progress of your project, but maybe doesn't block other work on the critical path.</li>
<li>This is a very important step, and one that may need some time and discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>DM me (@benpa:bpulse.org) and we'll talk about next steps.</p>

<p>We've decided to ditch the focus as it was clear that it wasn't a great indicator of progress. Once one team member has reviewed all of the focus items, they will move on to other MSCs.

<p>As such, we'd instead like to direct people to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/31">Spec Core Team Backlog board</a>, which is a better representation of the current state of things. And of course the weekly list of MSCs state changes above.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of this week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.6">Dendrite 0.3.6</a>, which included a number of refactors in the sync API and a selection of fixes. It is also the first version to be released with multi-arch Docker images with ARMv7/ARM64 targets.</p>
<p>Since then, the following changes have been merged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sync filtering support for event types, senders as well as better-supported limits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation support for MSC2946 (Spaces Summary)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug where large well-known files could consume a lot of memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for in-process DNS caching for federation traffic (although it is disabled by default)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some preparatory work for tracking the most recent membership states in the sync API for future history visibility work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 60%, up from 58% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>

<p>‚ò†Ô∏è But don't install it yet; wait for rc2.</p>
<p>A few issues were reported with rc1 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9187">#9187</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9193">#9193</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9208">#9208</a>), and we'll issue an rc2 early next week once we're confident they've been resolved.</p>
<p>Otherwise, once 1.26.0 is released you can look forward to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/docs/auth_chain_difference_algorithm.md">a new algorithm</a> for calculating auth chain difference in v2 State Resolution which should significantly speed up some of the most expensive state resolution calculations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622">#8622</a>).</p>
<p>We've also dramatically improved the performance of redactions in large rooms, helping Synapse's moderation tools scale to communities of any size (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9022">#9022</a>). And speaking of scaling, Synapse 1.26 makes it possible to offload many different APIs to worker processes, including read receipts and account data persistence.</p>
<p>Lastly, Synapse 1.26 will include support for multiple Single Sign-On Identity providers, though we expect further fit-and-finish for that feature to land in 1.27.</p>
<p>You can preview the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/CHANGES.md">changelog</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1260">upgrade notes</a> now, but remember: wait for rc2! üòâ</p>

<h4 id="opsdroid-1">opsdroid</h4>
<p><a href="https://opsdroid.dev/">opsdroid</a> is an easy to use chat-ops framework with excellent Matrix support.</p>
<h4 id="0-20-release">0.20 Release</h4>
<p>This week opsdroid released version 0.20. This is a <em>massive</em> release that's been a long time coming because of a <strong>complete rewrite of the internals of the matrix connector to use <a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a></strong>---thanks to <a href="https://github.com/awesome-michael">@awesome-michael</a> for the initial work on this.</p>
<p>Having ported the connector to nio, our GSOC student <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tyagdit:matrix.org">@Tyagdit</a> got to work polishing the nio port and reimplementing the <strong>matrix database</strong> module in the core opsdroid library. Opsdroid has a concept of memory which is a key-value store which can be backed my many different kinds of <a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/">databases</a>. The <a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/matrix.html">matrix database</a> stores the opsdroid memory in room state, meaning your bot's database and messages are all stored in the same place.</p>
<p>Finally, the other big feature added to the matrix support in this release is <strong>End to End Encryption</strong> support. Thanks to using matrix-nio as our matrix library it was possible to implement support for encrypted matrix rooms. This also includes support in the matrix database for encrypted memory which works by referencing event ids in room state (<a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/matrix.html#encryption">see here</a> for more info). As this is the first release to support E2EE I would still consider it &quot;beta&quot;; please open issues if you have any trouble using it.</p>
<h4 id="highlights-1">Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>End to End Encryption support in the Matrix connector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matrix database now included in core, with e2ee support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of Python's install &quot;extras&quot; to allow for installations with fewer packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved documentation of the matrix connector and database (at least a little).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for Python 3.9 (and dropped support for 3.6).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Version 2.0 of <a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal">matrix-corporal</a> has been released.</p>
<p>It's a huge release bringing many improvements (read all of it in the <a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal/releases/tag/2.0.0">release notes</a>).</p>
<p>Here's a short summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an <strong>Event Hooks system</strong> has been introduced, so matrix-corporal can now also act like a &quot;generic firewall&quot; (similar to what <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxgwd">mxgwd</a> was doing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>device-free login</strong> is now used when impersonating users (thanks to a new API introduced by Synapse v1.24.0) - this is both faster and more resilient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for <strong>Interactive Authentication</strong> (and thus, <strong>End-to-End-Encryption</strong>) has been added. Users can now set up E2EE keys, manage devices, etc. (actions that require Interactive Authentication and were previously broken). Requires cooperation between <code>matrix-corporal</code> and the <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-synapse-rest-password-provider">REST auth password provider module</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>End-to-End-Encryption control</strong>. matrix-corporal can enforce whether rooms that users create are encrypted or unencrypted. You can force-disable or force-enable encryption for locally-created rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fixes user-creation regression</strong> that happened with Synapse v1.24.0. matrix-corporal v1.12.0 is also out, with a backport of this fix (for users who don't want to jump to 2.0 yet).</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>I'm working on porting the Notepad to the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api">widget API</a>. Ongoing work is on the <a href="https://github.com/KB1RD/matrix-notepad/tree/nextgen">nextgen branch</a> and is tracked by <a href="https://github.com/KB1RD/matrix-notepad/projects/3">this</a> project. The widget is currently blocked on some stuff in the widget API, so I probably won't be releasing soon. The code in there needs a <em>ton</em> refactoring, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that the old notepad client will disappear on the next release and you'll need to add a widget for the Notepad for any documents that you want to edit. Currently, this means you would have to use Element, but I heard Ditto just might be doing some widget work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The widget API is planned to do everything and more that my &quot;mxapps&quot; project was supposed to do, so that project will be deprecated in favor of using the widget API</p>

<p>There's also a little demo/teaser video showing the old notepad talking to the new one. You can see the rate limiting issues that the Notepad hits there, which is on my todo list.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week we released Dendrite 0.3.5, our first release of 2021, which includes a fairly significant refactor of parts of the sync API, along with other fixes. More work has since been merged into <code>master</code> too.</p>
<p>Changes in the last two weeks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sync streams are now logically separate, with a lot of behaviour fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities are now deep-checked properly, which should significantly reduce the peaks of CPU and RAM when handling the current room state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pagination tokens in <code>/messages</code> have been fixed, which should improve the reliability of scrolling back in the timeline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of fixes have been made to the <code>/sync</code> response, largely avoiding <code>null</code>s, which should make some clients happier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send-to-device messaging has been refactored, which should improve E2EE stability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well-known/DNS records for federated servers are now cached rather than performing lots of lookups, speeding up outbound federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Device list requests to remote servers now time out quicker, so as to not block <code>/send</code> transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental support for MSC2946 has been merged (gated behind the <code>mscs</code> configuration)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request context is no longer reused for <code>/send</code>, which should help in cases where the remote sending server gives up waiting or the connection breaks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for general Dendrite chat or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite-dev:matrix.org">#dendrite-dev:matrix.org</a> for development discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you explain something: Dendrite federation is basically working fine, AIUI, what does it mean that <code>Server-server APIs</code> is &lt;100%?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil</a> helpfully replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are still some edge-case tests that we haven't got passing yet, but I think that's only ~20 tests or so.<br />
There are also a few tests which are quite sensitive to exactly what Synapse does/returns, even though Dendrite is probably doing the right thing but maybe taking a different amount of time to do it or returning something slightly different, so there'll be some tests we need to fix too</p>

<p>We're on track for 1.26.0rc1 next week, which includes a massive speedup for message redaction in large rooms, as well as finally landing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622#issuecomment-729620021">fundamental algorithmic improvements</a> to state resolution.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we remain hard at work preparing for FOSDEM-on-Matrix, with special emphasis on improving our stability and moderation capabilities at scale. See y'all next week!</p>

<p>Just pushed version 1.25.0 of Synapse for my Kubernetes <a href="https://github.com/ananace/matrix-synapse">image</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts">chart</a>. Haven't quite had the time to finish up the redo of the scripts, but expect that 1.25.0 will be the last version with a specific image, I'm hoping to have generalized the chart enough that it should work with any reasonable image at that point.</p>

<h3 id="gitter">Gitter</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org">Eric Eastwood</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few improvements to the Gitter bridge this week so that when a room updates and the avatar or topic changes, it now propagates across to Matrix automatically. We also handle updating the name whenever we have to rename a room or a group.</p>
<p>We're also thinking about how best to tackle self-service plumbing so you can pipe a Gitter room into your existing Matrix room. And the bigger idea of connecting various bridged portal rooms together. So you can connect your community on Gitter &lt;-&gt; Matrix &lt;-&gt; IRC seamlessly for example. The current thinking is introducing this as a native Matrix concept so you can easily connect any Matrix room to another Matrix room. We'd love to hear your thoughts in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2923">MSC2923</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@robintown:townsendandsmith.ml">Robin</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Version 2 of mx-puppet-groupme is here! This week I did some reverse engineering of the GroupMe Android app with mitmproxy so that I could work out the remaining undocumented features of GroupMe's API. As a result, typing notifications, read receipts, and videos are now working! Though note that due to limitations of the platform, read receipts are a DMs-only feature.</p>
<p>We also now have a Dockerfile (thanks, Trey B.!), double puppeting support was added, the code was ported to Typescript, and it should now work with older versions of Node. So at this point the bridge is basically feature-complete! As usual, send any questions, bugs, or feature requests to <a href="https://gitlab.com/robintown/mx-puppet-groupme">GitLab</a> or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#mx-puppet-groupme:townsendandsmith.ml">Matrix</a>. üíú</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on moving mautrix-facebook to act as a Messenger mobile app instead of the web app in order to hopefully make it more reliable. The initial version is starting to work now.</p>
<p>It's currently in the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook/tree/mobile">mobile</a> branch. I'm not actually sure if it helps with facebook forcing password resets (for some reason they've never done that to my account), but if it does, I'll merge it into master in the near future.</p>
<p>The new version only supports Postgres like my newer bridges, but I'll invent a SQLite migration tool before merging to master.</p>

<h3 id="neochat-1-0-1-released">NeoChat 1.0.1 released</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@carl:kde.org">Carl Schwan</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NeoChat 1.0.1 was released with a few important bugfixes. https://carlschwan.eu/2021/01/13/neochat-1.0.1-first-bugfix-release/. On the unstable branch, we continued to improve the integration with Plasma. We now display the unread count in the taskbar and we are getting inline replies too thanks to the work of <a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/knotifications/-/merge_requests/28">Kai Uwe Broulik</a> in Knotifications. Another important change is that rooms can now be opened in a new separate window.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bugfixing for the next release is in progress, fixing various issues and instabilities introduced with the new features, but some smaller features also still made it in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is now a call invite screen more fitting for mobile devices, when you enable the &quot;Touchscreen mode&quot; in the settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various clickable elements now have a ripple effect again to give feedback, when a click was registered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko now handles the Matrix URI scheme. This means opening a link starting with <code>matrix:</code> should open Nheko (at least on Linux) and redirect to the appropriate room and matrix URIs inside of Nheko are also handled. This currently does not support navigating to a specific event, but opening user profiles, starting chats with specific users and opening or joining rooms should work. Nheko also does not automatically linkify links starting with <code>matrix:</code>, so you need to do that manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verification dialogs were cleaned up a bit and hopefully are easier to understand now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flatpak nightlies now support VOIP calls, but as a result are now a few MB more to download.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we are nearing the next release, it would be appreciated, if you could check the <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/">translations for your platform are up to date</a> and try the <a href="https://matrix-static.neko.dev/room/!TshDrgpBNBDmfDeEGN:neko.dev/">current nightlies</a> and check them for bugs your experience and want to have fixed before release.

<p>I'd like to have announced the next beta release for Quaternion 0.0.9.5 - unfortunately, <a href="https://travis-ci.community/t/org-com-migration-unexpectedly-comes-with-a-plan-change-for-oss-what-exactly-is-the-new-deal/10567">migrating from Travis CI</a> took more than I wanted; but adventurous souls are welcome to test the master branch that's basically ready for beta 3.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it surfaced that Quaternion 0.0.9.4e Windows binaries have been expecting (very old and no more supported) OpenSSL 1.0. This is now fixed in <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.9.4f">Quaternion 0.0.9.4f</a> (hopefully this will be the last 0.0.9.4 rebuild and I won't chase the above-mentioned OpenSSL project in trying to expire Latin letters).</p>

<p>PingPong measures transport latencies on Matrix networks. It connects to two Matrix accounts simultaneously, and bounces messages back and forth between them.

<p>I have been working on this for a while now and I believe it is ready for others to use at this point. No binary releases yet, the program must be built from source.

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome back, TWiM readers! It's a new year, and the Synapse team is excited to get back to our regularly scheduled releases! Three main things this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>We published <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.25.0rc1">1.25.0rc1</a>! We'll have full release notes next week, but highlights include:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Deprecated Python 3.5 and Postgres 9.5</strong> per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8782">#8782</a>; more details to come with the formal release announcement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People can pick their own username when using Single Sign-On, right from within Synapse itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spam-checker modules can now use <code>async</code> Python methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New ways to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.25.0rc1/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1250">restrict allowed IP address ranges</a> for outgoing requests from Synapse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/04/taking-fosdem-online-via-matrix">Matrix is hosting FOSDEM</a>! Which means that most of the Synapse team is going to be focused on security, stability, and performance until February to ensure that our virtual Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles is as reliable and welcoming the real thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of security, we have some big (but good!) news to announce next week. Watch this space... üïµÔ∏èüá™üá∫üí∂</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, one of our goals for this year is to maintain a biweekly cadence of release candidates, so we should have a more consistent pace. At the same time, we realize that keeping up with biweekly releases of server-side software can be a bit of a chore, so we're also discussing ways that we could provide longer support for some of our releases. That's a project for much later this year, but consider it a preview of things to come.</p>

<p>NeoChat gained a few new features this week. The timeline displays stickers now, and edited messages don't get duplicated anymore. NeoChat also now lets you edit your messages. Additionally, Noah improved the support for attachments in the UI, more image formats are detected (and can then be edited in the built-in image editor), and mime type icons get added to non-image attachments. Tobias continues to work on the registration flow and SSO support.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@spiritcroc:spiritcroc.de">SpiritCroc</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://schildi.chat/">SchildiChat</a> is a fork of Element, which focuses on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list for both direct messages and groups, which is a more familiar approach to users of other popular instant messengers.</p>
<p>During the last couple of weeks, SchildiChat-Android development focused mainly on staying up-to-date with the upstream Element codebase (URL previews took some time to make them fit nicely into the bubble layouts), and doing some smaller design improvements (like wider message bubbles for some scenarios, and an intelligent message timestamp placement at the bottom of the bubble, depending on the available space).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we now also have experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2867">MSC2867</a>, which allows you to mark rooms as unread. Note that for now, this feature needs to be enabled in the labs settings, since the MSC is still unstable and not supported by many clients, which means other clients might ignore whether the user has manually marked a chat as unread and thus display it as read anyway.</p>

<h3 id="element-clients">Element Clients</h3>
<p>Some updates below from the team. Not all teams are back from their Christmas breaks yet, and those who are may be a little busy with FOSDEM-specific projects, but we have some updates:</p>
<h4 id="spaces">Spaces</h4>
<p>We‚Äôre making more progress on the client implementations for Spaces on the web on Android. <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/15930">On Web</a>, recent progress includes implementing notification badges, and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/issues/2495">on Android</a> we‚Äôre progressing from SDK work to initial UI implementations.</p>
<h4 id="social-login">Social Login</h4>
<p>Support for <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3846">Social Login on iOS</a> is in review after resolving some issues around VoiceOver, which is the last Element client to implement support ahead of Synapse landing support for social login in the near future.</p>
<h4 id="voip">VoIP</h4>
<p>Lots of things merged to web: dial pad, call forward, dtmf pad, although most won‚Äôt show up in normal use (yet). Other progress on web on hold for fosdem work. Dial pad &amp; phone number lookup support incoming on iOS, and phone number lookup on its way on Android.</p>
<h4 id="ios">iOS</h4>
<p>We progressed on several things this week. They are not yet merged but almost. They will be part of the next release we will ship next week: social login, app deadlock fix, encrypted message sending speed improvement, xcodegen usage, sending bug reports in background.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@select:matrix.org">select</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recently started a new freelance project and got them to use Matrix as our main communication channel. Since they chose GitHub as our source code platform I got into writing continuous integrations and delivery scripts. But one thing was missing: notifications in our Matrix room. I looked into the GitHub Action Marketplace and found 2 actions that could do that, so that was nice ... but they could not send e2e encrypted messages. Therefore I took up my old issue on how to make e2e encryption work with the js-sdk (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/issues/731) with some new found energy and finally solved it. The result is this GitHub action: </p>
<p>https://github.com/select/matrix-message-e2e</p>
<p>While it's almost a full success story there is still one issue to solve: While the action successfully sends e2e encrypted messages the job is marked as failed. My guess it that while sending the messages the matrix client outputs on stderr due to some encryption errors (unknown device keys, ...)</p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">Ansible playbook</a> is meant to easily let you run your own Matrix homeserver.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> now defaults to using the Postgres database engine for all bridges, bots and related services (ma1sd, Dimension, etc).</p>
<p>Previously we were only using Postgres for Synapse and couldn't reuse the same database server for other services.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/pull/740">this huge pull request</a>, we've added Postgres support to 17 other services.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jdreichmann">Johanna Dorothea Reichmann</a> for starting the work on it and for providing great input!</p>
<p>Existing installations will get automatically migrated from SQLite/nedb to Postgres the next time you run the playbook.</p>
<p>Not only does this bring better performance and compatibility, but also, being able to reuse the same Postgres database for services other than Synapse paves the way for us to introduce other Postgres-only services such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-signal">mautrix-signal</a> bridge (existing <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/pull/686">pull request</a>), etc.</p>

<h3 id="middleman">Middleman</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:elokapina.fi">kapina-jaywink</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Common accounts for support are tricky to handle due to needing the people using those accounts to keep separate clients open to use the common account. For this at Elokapina we created <em>Middleman</em>, which acts as a proxy between an account and a room.</p>
<p>It's a bit basic but works pretty well for pure text messages. Any messages in rooms where the bot is are relayed to the management room and any replies to those messages (prefixed with <code>!reply</code>) in the management room are relayed back. Optionally senders can be anonymised to enable a feedback bot.</p>
<p>Coming up is more configuration on for example ignoring non-mentions in rooms with lots of members and hopefully support for images and reactions in the not too long future.</p>
<p>Find it here: https://github.com/elokapina/middleman (built with nio-template).</p>

<p>If you haven't already seen it, we wrote a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/15/dendrite-2020-progress-update">Dendrite 2020 Progress Update blog post</a> detailing our year in Dendrite. It also includes an announcement for our new public <code>dendrite.matrix.org</code> homeserver, which is open for registration!</p>
<p>Today we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.4">Dendrite 0.3.4</a>, which is a performance and bug-fix release, including the following changes from the last two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The stream tokens for <code>/sync</code> have been refactored, giving PDUs, typing notifications, read receipts, invites and send-to-device messages their own respective stream positions, greatly improving the correctness of sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new roominfo cache has been added, which results in less database hits in the roomserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prometheus metrics have been added for sync requests, destination queues and client API event send perceived latency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event IDs are no longer recalculated so often in <code>/sync</code>, which reduces CPU usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync requests are now woken up correctly for our own device list updates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device list stream position is no longer lost, so unnecessary device updates no longer appear in every other sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A crash on concurrent map read/writes has been fixed in the stream token code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver input API no longer starts more worker goroutines than needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver no longer uses the request context for queued tasks which could lead to send requests failing to be processed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new index has been added to the sync API current state table, which improves lookup performance significantly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client API <code>/joined_rooms</code> endpoint no longer incorrectly returns <code>null</code> if there are 0 rooms joined</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver will now query appservices when looking up a local room alias that isn't known</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The check on registration for appservice-exclusive namespaces has been fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone! It's been ages since I've talked about a personal project on here. I've been working on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-github">matrix-github</a> bridge, which is an all singing all dancing service to connect you to Github AND Gitlab. (Yes, it's now poorly named).</p>
<p>I've landed the initial bits to make GitLab work, so that you can join issues and MRs as rooms in the UI but there is more work to do to make that solid and more interactive. The thing I am most looking forward to is notifications for GitLab so I can get away from emails.</p>
<p>ALSO, off the back of TravisR's fantastic widget work, I've landed initial support for widgets in admin rooms and soon issue/PR rooms. The idea here being that widgets give you a nicer UI to control the bridge or render details like commits going past or diffs. All the groundwork for authenticating widgets against the bridge and rendering them is done, now it just needs features.</p>
<p>That's the highlights this week. I'm hoping to really tighten the documentation to get more people spun up on it as the notifications features have turned out to be a killer feature for me :)</p>

<p>I've been using this (the bridge, rather than the upcoming widgets) for a couple of months now and find it really really powerful. I'm not in GitHub most of the day, so getting notifs piped direct into Matrix is great!</p>

<p>A few updates to the Gitter bridge itself this week handling Matrix edits outside of the 5 minute edit window on Gitter and fixing up @mentions being mangled by <code>:</code> colons on the Gitter side when someone mentions you from Element.

<p>We're also getting started on some of the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Element feature parity with Gitter issues</a>. First directly tackling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">backfilling existing message history</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In celebration of the cross-signing MSC being finally merged, Nheko master now supports cross signing other users and your own devices. üéâ The UX is currently not final, you have to manually fetch the cross signing keys in the settings, if you don't have them after a verification. You are also not yet prompted to verify new logins and can't bootstrap cross-signing from Nheko, but the functional bits and bobs are there now. We are also still investigating, if prompting for your recovery key/passphrase is less confusing by using just one input field or if we should prompt for them separately. Currently Nheko just asks you to unlook and will accept whatever you input (if it can decrypt the secrets with it). FluffyChat does that and I think it is really nice!</p>
<p>There are also a few smaller features added recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now uses the icon from your theme on the login page</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">krille</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FluffyChat 0.24.0 is released with new features and fixes.</p>
<p>What is new:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new public room discovery page, where you can find and join public rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental bootstrap support for cross-signing and keybackup and something really weird that is named SSSS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced power level managing for rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minor design changes like a new icon set</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beside of that we have of course a lot of bug fixes and stability improvements. All languages should now also work on iOS.</p>
<p>Also we are looking forward to publish the app in the AppStore for iOS but we will do this under the hood of Famedly. Btw. FluffyChat will soon move to the Famedly GitLab project and we will move the app in the PlayStore to the Famedly account too. This doesn't mean that anything will change there. It is just that Famedly will now handle the legal stuff for us and may offer paid customer support for businesses, which have interest in FluffyChat. But the app will still be available under the same AGPL3 license. This will just make it easier for us to publish the app in the official stores as we don't need to pay so much for the developer accounts.</p>

<p>Just updated my Synapse K8s-optimized image and Chart to 1.24.0, planning on deprecating the image at some point soon though, instead pointing people to upstream - or platform-optimized - images as I should be able to move all the Kubernetes-specific things into the chart itself to make it more compatible.</p>
<p>The image in question started off as a plain docker image, before there were official ones. I've since rebased it onto the official Matrix image with just the modified scripts and volume points.</p>
<p>My plan is to move all the Kubernetes-specific scripts into configmaps (which are a K8s way of storing text files/environment variables/etc), and then build my own launch arguments through the chart to get it to run on any image that has a Python interpreter and the Synapse modules available in the Python search path.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you didn't catch it already, we did a full announcement this week for Gitter now speaking Matrix üéâ! If you're curious about how we made it and some more technical details, the blog post is a great read: https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix</p>
<p>In terms of bridge progress, we added support for <code>m.emote</code> status messages which means your <code>/me says hi</code> messages will bridge back and forth properly. On the Gitter side, we fixed the browser notifications so they show properly from the <code>virtualUser</code> instead of the generic <code>matrixbot</code>.</p>

<p>I made an Instagram DM bridge: https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-instagram / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#instagram:maunium.net">#instagram:maunium.net</a> </p>
<p>It's a bit barebones still, but text bridging and backfilling works. The main advantage over mx-puppet-instagram is that it uses the realtime MQTT API instead of polling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a second update from tulir, he added more features as of today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the initial announcement on Monday, I added bridging of reactions, redactions and photos in both directions and also typing notifications, read receipts and all types of messages from Instagram to Matrix.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kaiyou:tedomum.net">kaiyou</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a first update regarding a very small project named &quot;axon&quot;, aimed at operating the synapse admin API from Python, either as a library or a CLI tool. It is currently in use everyday on our synapse instance for managing users and looking for suspicious rooms, and is being integrated into a prototype Web interface for managing synapse.</p>
<p>Admin API coverage is currently about 50%, mostly focusing on users and rooms management (get, list, update, delete). It is still enough to delete a user, edit an offensive avatar, or run as a cron to periodically purge remote media.</p>
<p>Our main repository: https://forge.tedomum.net/tedomum/axon</p>
<p>Github project mirror for contributing: https://github.com/kaiyou/axon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked if there was a GUI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not currently, but we are integrating it with another of our tools named &quot;hiboo&quot;, which is a general indie hoster user manager (provides SAML &amp; OIDC authentication with config templates for many projects including synapse, and integrates the account workflows and moderation features). Currently it provides room navigation and purging, plus deleting accounts either on moderator decision or when the user deletes her SSO account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds promising! Synapse Admin would benefit from this kind of tooling...</p>
<p>... so it was a surprise to find another project designed to help in this area!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, maybe it's about time for &quot;synadm - a CLI frontend to Matrix-Synapse admin APIs&quot; to be announced more officially. As the name implies it's a CLI tool that eases the usage of admin API commands for Synapse admins. It currently covers everything the room and user API's can do: https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#implementation-status--commands-list</p>
<p>It can be configured interactively and/or using a config file in yaml format: https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#configuration</p>
<p>It's configurable whether the responds of the API are shown in pretty printed JSON or in a table format (using Python tabulate).</p>
<p>It's well documented via it's online help and supposed to be quite self-explanatory to the admin.</p>
<p>Any thoughts, ideas, feature-requests are very welcome in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at">#synadm:peek-a-boo.at</a> or as usual by filing PR's or issues in the project repo https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm.</p>

<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.2">version 0.3.2</a>, which contains some bug fixes. Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Checking if a server is allowed to see an event has been optimised somewhat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to disable federation has been added</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application services are now sent correctly formatted client events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>create-account</code> has been simplified so that you can just point it to your Dendrite config</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/unpeek</code> support has been added (for MSC2753)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event IDs are now calculated far less often in the roomserver, since this is an expensive operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federation sender now caches events in memory to reduce load on the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;since&quot; parameter is now checked more thoroughly in the sync API, which led to a bug that could cause forgotten rooms to reappear (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kaniini">kaniini</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The polylith now proxies signing key requests through the federation sender correctly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%, same as last week</p>

Later on, we will use it to handle storage, and then enable E2EE as well, but that will take quite some time.</p>

<p>Big progress from Fractal here! Will be good to hear more from the Fractal club to see what the ETA is for storage and E2EE.</p>
<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I've actually not had much time to work on Nheko, I did at least fix most of the UTD (Unable to decrypt) issues, when sending encrypted messages. This has been a long standing annoyance, but it should now finally not be an issue anymore (well... at least it should not be caused by Nheko as often anymore)! With this there are only a few tickets left to finally bring E2EE out of beta in Nheko (SSSS and bootstrapping cross-signing, as well as a general review for potential issues).</p>
<p>And while I have actually not been doing much work, we actually had more Pull Requests (and merged them too) this week than I have ever seen before in Nheko! Thank you very much to everyone who contributed. A short summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now uses the Nheko icon from your system theme, if available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can finally look at avatars in their full resolution!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Megolm sessions are now lazily loaded from disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The registration page now also has nice inline error messages, hinting at why a specific input is unacceptable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updates to the russian translation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The README now lists all required GStreamer plugins for voice and video calls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It feels super great, when you have so many people contributing, I love it! &lt;3</p>

<p>Nheko really seems to be doing something right when it comes to attracting PRs!</p>

<p>On behalf of the Americans on the Synapse team: Happy Thanksgiving! This past week saw us land some improvements to the OpenID Connect SSO provider, bringing it closer to parity with the SAML provider. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8801">#8801</a> made it possible to gracefully handle username collisions when creating a new account over SSO.</p>
<p>We've also merged a pull request (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8785/">#8785</a>) from @dklimpel which removes deprecated paths for the Synapse Admin APIs. As of the next Synapse release, all Admin APIs will be accessibly only under the <code>/_synapse/admin/v1</code> path prefix.</p>
<p>Otherwise, much of our time has been spent on getting pull requests like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6739">#6739</a>, implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</a>, ready to merge.

Some spacing here and there, saturation changes, the login page should now be less confusing, when you don't enter a valid mxid and toggles should now not get stuck in confusing intermediate states.

<p>In addition to boring stuff like being able to persist events (hopefully) right, so we don't have to initial-sync every launch, I've been making a start towards multi-account support!</p>
<p>You can sign in as multiple users and switch between the &quot;active&quot; user you want to send messages as - iit's a bit flaky for now, esp. when scrolling up to read past messages, but hey it's a start I guess</p>

<p>Asked if they were using an SDK:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Preeetty much doing it from scratch, though I am loosely basing the matrix-api side of it on Ruma</p>

<h3 id="ruma">Ruma</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ruma.io/">Ruma</a> is a set of Rust library crates around Matrix.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:privacytools.io">jplatte</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We gained a new contributor, kiwidu38, who <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/353">added</a> the server-default push rules, paving the way to Conduit supporting push notifications.</p>
<p>I improved compatibility with some commonly-broken DAG events and added rudimentary support for message edits to help Fractal finish their move onto matrix-rust-sdk.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I published the second part of the Matrix introduction series on my blog (in German). It deals with end-to-end encryption, contact verification and cross signing. <a href="https://blog.sp-codes.de/sichere-chats-mit-matrix-matrix-teil-2/">https://blog.sp-codes.de/sichere-chats-mit-matrix-matrix-teil-2/</a>.</p>

<p>I have not read this series so I must trust that Samuel is saying nice things! Anyway it seems like a useful resource for telling kameraden about getting started with Matrix.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@larodar:famedly.de">Niklas Zender</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today there is a German article about Famedly on Gr√ºnderszene -&gt; <a href="https://www.gruenderszene.de/health/famedly-kommunikation-app-gesundheitswesen">https://www.gruenderszene.de/health/famedly-kommunikation-app-gesundheitswesen</a>. Famedly is developing a solution based on Matrix to enable healthcare providers to communicate securely with each other and to facilitate intersectoral processes such as patient transfers or the integration of IomT devices. We have also almost completed a successful financing round and hope to support the Matrix ecosystem more and more. It would be so cool to use FluffyChat, Element, or a Matrix Messenger of your choice to start a video consultation with the doctor of your choice, or to be integrated into existing clinical communication flows concerning you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congratulations to Famedly on the progress they're making! If you're ready to graduate from TLAs (Three-Letter-Abbreviations) to the next stage, you'll be please to learn &quot;IomT&quot;, which means &quot;Internet of medical Things&quot;.</p>
