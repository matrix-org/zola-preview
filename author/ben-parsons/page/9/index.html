<h3 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h3>
<p>We have a whole lot of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a> news this week! First, from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>, on the Matrix team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Progress has been picking up this week with some of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cnly:matrix.org">Cnly</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pulls/Cnly">many</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib/pulls/Cnly">PRs</a> finally getting merged! <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cnly:matrix.org">Cnly</a> is our resident <a href="https://www.matrix.org/blog/2019/05/07/welcome-to-the-2019-g-so-c-participants">Google Summer of Code</a> student this Summer and has been making strides ever since. We also finally fully migrated to BuildKite for Continuous Integration (which is much quicker than TravisCI) and have implemented golangci-lint as the project‚Äôs opinionated linter (catching some bugs in the process).</p>
<p>As part of CI, we‚Äôve set up <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/">Sytest</a> for Dendrite, which grants us a loose method of keeping track of progress as we go along. Currently the only way to do so is to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/testfile">testfile</a> which holds all the tests we know Dendrite to be passing, and cross-referencing that with the list of all sytests (which isn‚Äôt actually available anywhere). We‚Äôre hoping to make some nice way of visualizing progress over time with this data (and possibly break it down into Federation/Client/Application Service categories), but this will take some time.</p>
<p>We‚Äôd also like to thank some new contributors that have shown up since Matrix 1.0‚Äôs release. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jump_spider:matrix.spider.ink">serra-allgood</a> contributed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/702">a fix</a> for querying aliases when using at least one application service, while <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@drglitch:matrix.org">DrGlitchMX</a> sent a PR in for some database fixes. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@peekay_46:matrix.org">SUMUKHA-PK</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/694">PR</a> to add room tags is still around and should see some love very shortly.</p>
<p>As far as the current goals of the project, we‚Äôre looking to primarily make Dendrite federate with Synapse, which will allow it to actually be usable for testing/basic day-to-day usage. We intend to have it done so in the next few months, so stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cnly:matrix.org">Cnly</a>, who is doing GSOCüéì on Dendrite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Dendrite, the first phase of GSoC has primarily seen improvements for the existing code including bug fixes, refinements for testing, and some refactoring that prepares Dendrite for later feature implementation. Among the changes, two important ones will be the initial support for EDUs in /sync responses as well as a federation destination cache that allows for more effective federation.</p>
<p>In the next phase, more focus will be put into feature completion, mainly for the Client/Server API component. Since this part of work covers various still-under-construction areas in Dendrite, it is foreseeable that more progress will actually be made than proposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ruma">Ruma</h3>
<p>This Week in Ruma: <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/this-week-in-ruma-2019-06-16/">https://www.ruma.io/news/this-week-in-ruma-2019-06-16/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Work is underway to bring Ruma up to date with version r0.5.0 of the Matrix specification. Starting with the most foundational libraries and working up towards the higher-level ruma-client, this work should be done in the next week or two. The bulk of the work since the last update has been on ruma-events, adding all of the events that were previously missing, and doing a full pass through existing events to make sure our definitions match the specification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can't wait to see more updates out of Ruma!</p>

<h3 id="matrix-appservice-discord-0-5-1">matrix-appservice-discord 0.5.1</h3>
<p>This announcement is nearly a week old from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>, coming in right after the previous TWIM was published:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've released v0.5.1 of the discord bridge today. It's mostly comprised of small bugfixes and features, but contains metrics support for tracking performance on the bridge. <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/releases/tag/0.5.1">https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/releases/tag/0.5.1</a></p>

<h3 id="mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mautrix-telegram got some bugs fixed and minor features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated to <a href="https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/compare/v1.8.0...master">Telethon 1.8</a></li>
<li>Option to limit maximum document size when bridging so it wouldn't download 1.5gb files and run out of ram</li>
<li>Made the state cache get updated when sending state events. Not doing this was causing some problems on t2bot.io, which has disabled echoing state events (probably for performance reasons)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="reliable-bridges-gsoc-mortar-board"><em>Reliable Bridges</em> GSOC üéì</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kai:nasnotfound.de">Kai</a> is working on bridging in Matrix, mentored by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first phase of GSoC is nearing its end and progress has been made on the <em>Reliable Bridges</em> project.<br />
The main focus of the work was on delivering a running implementation for the signaling of permanent errors. Work has been done on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> together with <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</a>. An internal version of the Discord bridge with the new feature is already running and the related <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/pull/111">PR for the bridge SDK</a> is in the state of being completed.<br />
The next phase of GSOC comes with new goals. First, the preparation of a MSC for the signaling of bridge errors, so that the feature can be discussed in the community and can become a part of The Spec. The second goal will be the modification of Riot Web, so that the user is notified when an error condition occurred.<br />
There also has been a slight change of plan: The work on notifying clients when parts of the system are temporarily unavailable needs reconsideration as not even the core Matrix network itself has this capability. The way forward here should probably be a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2094">unified solution</a>.</p>

<h3 id="new-typescript-puppeting-lib-mx-puppet-bridge">New TypeScript puppeting lib: mx-puppet-bridge</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Soru</a>, who you probably know from her work on <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/">matrix-appservice-discord</a>, has started a new library:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soru started working on a new puppeting library, for a lack of a better name it is currently called <a href="https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-bridge">mx-puppet-bridge</a>.<br />
Unlike the existing puppet bridge, the focus of this one is to handle multiple users at once, all dynamically without needing to edit the configuration file over and over. Additionally the new codebase results in quite a few things smoothened out for easier protocol implementations.<br />
Furthermore mx-puppet-bridge is written in typescript and based on travis' <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a>.<br />
As protocol implementation for testing, soru also wrote <a href="https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-slack">mx-puppet-slack</a> (again, for the lack of a better name). Basic message sending in both directions is already fully functional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exciting stuff! And all the more so for the third-person announcement style!</p>

<h3 id="gomuks">gomuks</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gomuks had a bunch of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for rendering redactions and edits (rendering reactions coming up next)</li>
<li>Added commands to create rooms, start private chats and edit room tags</li>
<li>Rendered images now don't take up the whole width</li>
<li>Improved memory usage slightly</li>
<li>Broke everyones existing caches (<code>rm -rf ~/.cache/gomuks</code> should help if it panics at startup)</li>
</ul>
<p>The command for creating rooms and the image resolution limit were added by a new contributor, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jrswab:matrix.org">J. R.</a>, who is currently working on adding .well-known discovery support.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uforia:matrix.org">yuforia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Improved support for more types of events in
<a href="https://github.com/koma-im/continuum-desktop">continuum</a> this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>invitation events are supported</li>
<li>support for events that typically appear when a room is being set up is in progress</li>
<li>events that are not yet supported are displayed with a fallback view. Blank rows in previous versions are now fixed. You could always right-click on any event to view the source, of course</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pattle-dart-client">Pattle, Dart client</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:pattle.im">Wilko</a> came in with this thorough update, <a href="https://pattle.im/">Pattle</a> development is MOTORING:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version of Pattle has been pushed to F-droid!</p>
<p>This release is mostly focused on bug fixing and bug reporting! This is why I urge <strong>all users who have been having problems before to try Pattle again!</strong> Chances are that your problem has been fixed, and if not, it will be reported with more information so I can fix it!</p>
<p>When an error is reported, this data is sent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating system version</li>
<li>Device model, brand, manufacturer and whether it's a simulator</li>
<li>A unique ID based on your device</li>
</ul>
<p>In some errors the homeserver domain is logged, I will try to prevent this in the future.</p>
<p>This release also includes preparation for an iOS release next week!</p>
<p>Fixes and other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle rooms that the user has left (a notice is shown that you can't send any messages)</li>
<li>Show a date header above the chat creation event (not the first known event in the list as before)</li>
<li>When an error occurs during sync, show a message, including the Exception name</li>
<li>Fix replies causing an error if the <code>formattedBody</code> does not adhere to the spec (thanks to Mathieu!)</li>
<li>Fix errors not showing when logging in</li>
<li>Fix loading spinner showing when checking username or logging in even if loading took less than 3 seconds</li>
<li>Fix direct chats not detected when adder after the initial sync</li>
<li>Some general syncing issues have been fixed (causing the dreaded infinite loading spinner).</li>
</ul>
<p>To install this release, add the following repo in F-droid:</p>
<p><a href="https://fdroid.pattle.im/?fingerprint=E91F63CA6AE04F8E7EA53E52242EAF8779559209B8A342F152F9E7265E3EA729">https://fdroid.pattle.im/?fingerprint=E91F63CA6AE04F8E7EA53E52242EAF8779559209B8A342F152F9E7265E3EA729</a></p>
<p>And install 'Pattle'.</p>
<p>Or <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app/releases">download the APK</a>.</p>
<p>If you stumble upon any issues, <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app/issues">please report them</a>!<br />
You can <a href="https://git.pattle.im/users/sign_in">login via GitHub and Gitlab.com</a>, so it's really easy to do! (Logging in via GitHub did not seem to work previously, but it will now!)</p>
<p>Follow development here: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#app:pattle.im">#app:pattle.im</a>!</p>
<p>If you would like to support me, you can now do so via <a href="https://liberapay.com/wilko/">Liberapay</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/pattle_app">Patreon</a>. I actually need money for the Apple Developer program, which costs 100 euros per year to release Pattle on the App Store and Testflight.</p>

<p>Are you in the know about Matrix? If not, prepare to learn about <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/">RiotX</a>, a <em>completely re-written</em> Matrix client for Android. This new version has a Kotlin SDK.</p>
<p>Benoit, from the team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many things to announce this week on RiotX:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto is starting to work! We can now decrypt message and send encrypted messages. The whole feature is not implemented yet, but we will merge the PR at the beginning next week before going further. Thanks Fran√ßois for the great work!</li>
<li>On the timeline, message composed by only emoji are now displayed bigger (as in other Riot clients)</li>
<li>We can now see details and actions of each message, including state event.</li>
<li>We can also see the detailed list of reactions for a particular message, and reaction display rendering has been improved. More details of what has been improved by Valere can be found in this PR description: <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/pull/168">https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/pull/168</a>.</li>
<li>Local echo on message edition has been improved</li>
<li>The 3 main themes has been implemented (Light, Dark Black). Status theme is still there but has not been tested yet. There are still some little issues which will be fixed in the next coming days.</li>
<li>The new Home is on develop, composed by a catchup tab, a direct message tab and a group room tab. The drawer is now used to display the groups hierarchy.</li>
<li>A debug signature has been added to the git repository, so the APK built by buildkite can now be installed and replace a previously installed APK.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is still lots of work to do, but we are quite confident to deliver a first alpha version of RiotX to a larger audience at the end of June.</p>

<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/">Construct</a> is a homeserver implementation in C++:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Construct has added support for Server Access Control Lists (m.room.server_acl). The exact behavior of the implementation is configurable by the server administrator, and is even more comprehensive than Synapse. In Construct, ACLs can be configured to cover incoming EDUs, outgoing events, and indirectly fetched events.</li>
<li>The GraphicsMagick library has been utilized to implement the media thumbnailing feature called for by the specification. This is an optional dependency written in C and offers a rich API which as been extremely fun to work with. In the future, expect your Construct to be capable of things like annotating images with the Server Command Line which can be used to generate memes in your chatroom or write custom text on top of stickers!</li>
<li>On the backend we have devoted significant effort to getting the most out of dynamic-linking to simplify the architecture of a large and modular free-software project. This effort makes adding features and contributions to Construct extremely straightforward. I will enumerate the basics for those familiar with developing C software: We are now loading all modules at runtime with the flags <code>RTLD_GLOBAL|RTLD_DEEPBIND|RTLD_LAZY</code> and we build with the flag <code>--weak-unresolved-symbols</code>; during execution we hook the error handling in <code>ld.so</code> to throw our own C++ exception directly from the PLT slot of a missing symbol. In summary this allows features to be added to Construct by simply creating an interface in a header and definitions in a loadable module, while still enjoying optional loading and unloading of the module at runtime. This is a significant feat that remains unrealized in most existing projects around the free software ecosystem!</li>

<p>Can you believe it, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> had a busy week working on his various bridges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> now has native Matrix edit support in both directions and basic Prometheus metrics. I'll probably start making 0.6.0 RCs after improving the metrics a bit.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts">mautrix-hangouts</a> got some bugfixes and options to configure the displaynames of the ghost users on Matrix (like adding <code>(FB)</code> or <code>(Hangouts)</code> suffixes).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a>'s Matrix puppeting was finished (meaning typing notifs, read receipts and presence updates can now be bridged to WhatsApp) and unexpected disconnection handling was fixed (automatic reconnections should now usually work again).
Backfilling needed some hacks to work with Matrix puppeting. The problem is that the real Matrix users have rate limits and can't send timestamp-massaged messages. I decided to just invite the default ghost user to the room while backfilling and make it leave afterwards so that private chat room names and such would stay intact. Some clients like Riot Android/iOS sometimes do weird things, such as moving the room out of &quot;People&quot;, but that shouldn't be too bad.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> has seen some work in becoming more flexible.</p>
<p>Synapse is not a requirement anymore. People can now use the playbook to install any of the other services, wiring them to a Synapse instance installed in another way.
This is mostly useful for installing bridges or other auxiliary services without going &quot;all in&quot; on the playbook.
Not having Synapse as a fixed requirement also opens the door for installing alternative homeservers, when such become available in the future.</p>
<p>On a similar note, to ease maintanability, all bridges have been moved to separate Ansible roles (outside of the <code>matrix-synapse</code> role).
There have been lots of improvements related to bridge configuration with even more likely to come soon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neo now supports sending multiple images, videos and files at once. You'll get a bar with previews, and the option to remove them from the queue/add more.<br />
There's also been a bunch of changes to how events are handled. Images and videos should be much more robust against missing keys (no thumbnail, no information, etc), and there's basic displaying of the most common state events.<br />
I also added an experimental media repository fallback option, which is disabled by default, and only implemented for room avatars. This allows you to provide a list of alternative homeservers Neo is allowed to try when your own homeserver can't load a piece of media.<br />
Due to the loss of lain.haus, I lost admin access in the Neo room, so keep your eyes out for a new one when my infra is back.<br />
I'm currently not really versioning anything, but I do push significant commits to <a href="https://neo.lain.haus/neo">https://neo.lain.haus/neo</a> for people to try. Once it gets to a more useable state, I'll start adopting semantic versioning.</p>

<h3 id="major-whatsapp-bridging-update">Major WhatsApp bridging update</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> made great strides on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on mautrix-whatsapp to add history bridging and Matrix puppeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>New portals are populated with some history when creating them (exact count is configurable)</li>
<li>All messages missed during bridge downtime are backfilled</li>
<li>Creating portals is smarter now:</li>
<li>When logging in initially, it'll create portals for a few recent chats (count configurable).</li>
<li>It'll create portals when there are incoming messages as before, but it should no longer create portals for chats that only have old messages.</li>
<li>The missed message backfilling creates portals when necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Matrix puppeting isn't quite finished yet. It can already use your Matrix account to bridge messages sent from whatsapp mobile, but it doesn't use the account to bridge EDUs (typing notifs, presence, read receipts) yet.</p>
<p>To make the history bridging a bit nicer, I made a PR to fix timestamp massaging in synapse: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/5233. Timestamp massaging was removed from the spec in 1.0, but it wasn't intentionally removed from synapse, it just broke due to other changes. It was probably supposed to stay there as an easter egg until there's a proper solution for bridging history.</p>

<h3 id="gsoc-2019-reliable-bridges">GSoC 2019 ‚Äì Reliable Bridges</h3>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kai:nasnotfound.de">Kai</a> for this introduction to his project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>Reliable Bridges</em> GSoC project is about implementing a feedback mechanism for the Matrix network in cases where bridges are not able to properly handle messages. Currently clients are unable to know if a message was successfully sent over a bridge. With the new mechanism in place they get the information about errors happening at bridges and can behave accordingly by e.g. notify the user of the failed delivery.</p>
<p>The implementation is foremost focused on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-dicord</a> bridge which uses the underlying <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>. A JS bridge was chosen so that as much code as possible is brought into the SDK and other bridges can profit sooner from the work done.</p>
<p>The first step for implementing the new feature will be the signaling of permanent errors occurring at the bridge (in contrast to temporary failures). They might occur e.g. when the sending account was banned on the bridged foreign network. These permanent errors will be implemented as a new type of PDU originating from the bridge.</p>
<p>After permanent errors are done, the subsequent weeks will see work on temporary failures which might include work on Synapse as well as work on Riot Web to have a client which actually uses the new events. As these events are new features being introduced there will also be a MSC draft. There everyone can check out the proposed solution and tear it apart with their criticism (if applicable üòâ).</p>
<p>For discussions related to the GSoC project or when you have some opinions on how the MSC should look like, you are invited to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#reliablebridges:nasnotfound.de">Reliable Bridges Matrix room</a>.</p>

<p>Reactions continues at full speed, we have a draft PR and will be implementing over the coming week. The ability to blacklist IPs over federation will land imminently, as well as a nasty device management bug that led to a spate of E2E errors. Next week is all about Reactions, resuming work on the small homeserver project and finally getting back to Synapse 1.0 blockers following all the remediation drama of the past few weeks. With any luck we‚Äôll have a new Synapse release for you next week.</p>

<p>Although the development pace has been reduced lately, the Fractal team managed to make significant progress towards the 4.2 release. More specifically since our previous news, Chris has landed much of his adaptive view work to get Fractal in a mobile friendly state so it‚Äôs ready to run on the Librem 5 once Purism starts shipping them. But he didn‚Äôt stop there: eager to see his awesome work in the hands of many people (figuratively, the literal application will have to wait for the phone to be out üòõ) as soon as possible, he tackled a few bugs that we really wanted to get sorted out before we got a new version out.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been using his <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python">mautrix-python</a> lib, which was recently used to enable his <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> bridge, to bring a new method for Matrix-Hangouts bridging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New bridge again, this time it's Hangouts: https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#hangouts:maunium.net">#hangouts:maunium.net</a>. As with the Messenger bridge, currently the main difference to matrix-puppet-hangouts is multi-user support (also no hacky JS/Python mixing).</p>
<p>Before making mautrix-hangouts, I put a bunch of the generic bridging parts of mautrix-facebook into mautrix-python's bridge module and used that in both bridges. After Debian 10 is released, I'll drop Python 3.5 compatibility in mautrix-telegram and move it to use mautrix-python and the bridge module too.</p>
<p>Next week I'm planning on adding a bunch of features to both my new bridges, such as bridging formatting and remaining media types (so no new bridges planned for now :D).</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vote on a new name for the QMatrixClient project has been going on over the past week.<br />
<strong>We have a winner now, and the new name is &quot;Quotient&quot;!</strong> In the nearest weeks, expect changes in the library code (it's going to be libQuotient from the next release), room aliases (already ongoing), links to the repos etc. etc. Where possible, we're going to smoothen the migration path by providing legacy fallbacks (e.g., the new C++ namespace, Quotient, will be introduced but the old one, QMatrixClient, will stay its synonym, although deprecated).<br />
Just in case you missed all the previous mentions of the topic - it's only related to the overall project and the library, but not the client - its name remains Quaternion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why rename?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the previous name has been a bit clumsy and, most importantly, the project is no more focusing just on client-side but on a wider set of applications of Matrix (no homeserver in plans though). See also the recent backlog of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#qmatrixclient:matrix.org">#qmatrixclient:matrix.org</a> (now also <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#quotient:matrix.org">#quotient:matrix.org</a>) earlier this week for the whole discussion</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:feneas.org">jaywink</a>, maintainer of <a href="https://the-federation.info">https://the-federation.info</a>, told us what we all know to be true: Matrix is great and is getting more popular:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrix (Synapse) jumps to second place in <a href="https://the-federation.info">https://the-federation.info</a> site, which lists servers of the federated social web. Help us map the true size of the Matrixverse by adding your server by going a <code>https://the-federation.info/register/yourdomain.tld</code>. Note, SRV and well-known lookups not yet working, so registration needs to happen with the Matrix server real domain (and port if any).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Changelog:</p>

You wouldn't have to be super active, however a few minutes per day would be greatly appreciated. You'd be responsible of reviewing PRs! Because of this not being afraid of Typescript and not being afraid of Discord is required - no need to be at pro-level!</p>
<p>So we are basically looking for someone who can help us look over PRs and maybe do some themself. If you think you are interested, please message us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discord:half-shot.uk">our matrix room</a>!</p>

<h3 id="bridging-facebook-messenger">Bridging Facebook Messenger</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made a new Facebook Messenger bridge: https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#facebook:maunium.net">#facebook:maunium.net</a>. Currently the main difference to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-facebook">matrix-puppet-facebook</a> is multi-user support like my WhatsApp and Telegram bridges. The bridge is Python and the code structure is similar to <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>, so I'll probably eventually create a generic bridge library out of the common parts.</p>

<h2 id="synapsetheroadto10">Synapse, the road to 1.0</h2>
Neil, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">Synapse</a> overlord:
<blockquote>Last week we carried on with Synapse 1.0 work, in particular <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4364">server key signing validity</a>, a config option to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4967">verify federation certificates</a> to support MSC1711 and support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4982">3PID unbinding APIs</a> (MSC1915). Outside of that we've been thinking about how to improve room upgrades for private rooms and landed the preparatory work for a refactor of the room directory.<br /><br />Coming up next, we'll continue to bash out 1.0 blockers, Hawkowl has started work on optimising for small hosted homeservers, and anoa will be working on the new super fast room directory. Finally Erik has started work on aggregations support so clients will be able to offer things like edits and reactions ?<br /><br /><a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com/">https://www.arewereadyyet.com/</a> is now just shy of 64%, keep going.</blockquote>
<h2 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h2>
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/pull/541">Dockerfile for sytest</a> running against Dendrite approved. Close to being able to run Dendrite against sytest. Also using sytest's new test white/blacklist functionality to include a list of tests that Dendrite is known to pass in the repo. When people make new PRs that allow Dendrite to pass new tests, they can also append the names of the tests to the testfile to help automatically track Dendrite's improving progress. Look forward to seeing further progress post Synapse 1.0.</blockquote>

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>:
<blockquote>This weekend I took a brief pause from doing matrix work, and then went back into it by finishing the feature set for the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/synapse-netcore-workers/pull/48">.NET Core Synchrotron</a>. It's "feature complete" meaning all specced features of sync are in this branch, excluding legacy endpoints. There are a few bugs logged against it and it's really only useful as a super early test, while I fix some of the p1 bugs.<br /><br />The federation sender continues to be reliable and stable, and we are prepping for the release of synapse 0.99.3 which made a few changes to the replication stream. For more info, please see <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/synapse-netcore-workers">https://github.com/turt2live/synapse-netcore-workers</a></blockquote>
<h2 id="pattlehasnowmovedtoflutter">Pattle has now moved to Flutter</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a> has officially discontinued the previous version of Pattle, and is focused on their Flutter SDK and new version of Pattle based on it:
<blockquote>After some silence here but a lot of development, Pattle has now moved to Flutter. The new app is available in the same F-droid repository, you can just update. Note that you will have to log in again. If there are issues with updating, try removing the old app and installing the new one.<br /><br />Also note that this version is still very basic and does not have all features of the old Pattle unfortunately. The reason that I chose to already replace it on the repo is that the old app will not receive updates anymore.<br /><br />The current features are logging in and an overview of all chats. What <em>is</em> new is that data is now stored locally, so you won't have to do an initial sync everytime you open the app (which was the case with old app). What's also new is that I've decided to use more red, because.. I like red.<br /><br />There is still a lot to do! Please notify me of anything that you think is missing, even though some things may be obvious (sorting chats based on date, chat avatars), some may not be as obvious to me!<br /><br />If you'd like to contribute, the new repo is <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app">here</a>. Note that many contributions will probably start at the SDK level. Pattle uses my own Dart SDK, which you can find <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/library/matrix-dart-sdk">here</a>.<br /><br />There is at the moment a very specific bug in Flutter, where on Android 7.1 with release builds, the app crashes when building a list widget. If you use Android 7.1 (like me) and you crash after logging in, that's the reason. It seems I can't do anything about it, sorry.</blockquote>

<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
Neil, Synapse overseer, reports on the acceleration towards <em>1.0</em>:
<blockquote>
<p>We have much improved sytest support for Synapse worker mode, Hawkowl landed a brand new super fast super shiny user directory implementation, Brendan fixed a bunch of niggles in <a href="/federationtester">the federation tester</a> and we <em>finally</em> got to the bottom of our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4956">sync caching bug that obscured accepting invites</a> (thanks richvdh for sticking with it). Erik solved our presence spamming bug and anoa fixed some LDAP auth bugs and submitted a PR for certificate checking - one of our final blockers for Synapse 1.0. For all the latest checkout out our latest release candidate <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.3rc1">0.99.3rc1</a>.<br />
Next week, we'll ship 0.99.3, we'll be looking at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4364">server key validity periods</a>, adding a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1915">3PID unbind API</a> and starting work on tuning low powered Synapse installations.<br />
<a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com/">https://www.arewereadyyet.com/</a> is still rising so keep banging to everyone you know that they ensure their federation certificates are valid.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/poljar">poljar</a> gave this update on his new project <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a>:
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a> is a new project that acts as a reverse proxy for clients to connect to. Once a client is connected Pantalaimon handles end to end encryption for the client transparently.<br />
The project is only a week old but already at a working prototype phase. A demo can be found here: <a href="http://webmshare.com/play/Qn4wg">http://webmshare.com/play/Qn4wg</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a huge gain! Use of this project, as you will see in the video, permits any Matrix client to support End-to-End encryption of messages, by handling encryption/decryption in a daemon rather than in the client.</p>
<p><a href="http://webmshare.com/play/Qn4wg">Watch the video</a>, and you'll see <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a>, which does not support encryption, chatting in an encrypted room.

<h2 id="construct">Construct</h2>
Report from the Construct team:
<blockquote>The matrix Construct server has made significant progress this week implementing the 1.0 specification and is very close to a 1.0 release! Special thanks to our star tester Yan Minari and expert Matrix consultants Tulir and Max and C++ developers Jason of Zemos and Mujx of nheko for all their hard work to make this happen. The Construct now fully supports IPv6 and is ready to participate in fully end-to-to-end encrypted ipv6 networks like <code>#yggdrasil:matrix.org</code> and <code>#cjdns:matrix.org</code>.<br />This week also saw additions for .well-known support, <code>m.fully_read</code> and even DNS caching inside a matrix room shared between servers (which is really cool if you ask me).<br /><br />I'd like to recognize our testers for their invaluable contributions this week, only a fraction of which are documented here: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/issues">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/issues</a> leading to the 1.0 release.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The Construct is written in C++ for maximum performance and scalability. It is the first fully federating server after the Synapse reference implementation.

From the team:
<blockquote>We've been upgrading and optimising our Jitsi instance so people should see more reliable video conference calls, especially if they avoid connecting from Firefox over poor connections.<br />We've been squashing scroll jumps (where the timeline pops out of position unexpectedly due to images loading, etc.). We've come up with a radical reimplementation of the timeline (which should be imperceptible, except it doesn't jump) - try it out on <a href="https://riot.im/develop">https://riot.im/develop</a> now.</blockquote>

Neil, Synapse-dev wrangler #1:
<blockquote>Huge thanks to everyone who has helped increase the number of ‚Äò1.0 ready' synapse installs. If you don't know what this means, <a href="/blog/2019/03/15/matrix-1-0-https-arewereadyyet-com/">see our blog</a>. <a href="https://arewereadyyet.com">https://arewereadyyet.com</a> reports &gt; 60% adoption on a per server basis, and high 90s on a per user basis. We are now really close to being able to ship a 1.0 release candidate and start the 2 week countdown before releasing 1.0 proper.<br /><br />This week we have focussed on performance, richvdh has been working on batching of outgoing read receipts and hawkowl shipped a much more performant implementation of user search. Erik has been putting the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/rust-synapse-compress-state">state compressor</a> through its paces, he saw one room compress down to 1% of its original size.

<blockquote>Pattle for Android now has an F-droid repository: <a class="linkified" href="https://fdroid.pattle.im/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=E91F63CA6AE04F8E7EA53E52242EAF8779559209B8A342F152F9E7265E3EA729" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://fdroid.pattle.im/</a><br /><br />It's the most up to date version straight from the pipeline, so not necessarily stable.</blockquote>

<p>As part of the project, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a> also announced the intention to create a Dart SDK:</p>
<blockquote>I'm currently working on a <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/library/matrix-dart-sdk">Matrix SDK for Dart</a>, which will be used for the <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app">Pattle rewrite in Flutter</a>.
The reason for this is outlined <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/android#future">here</a>. To summarize: My goal for Pattle is to release for not only Android but also iOS and web, with a single code base. Other reasons include that Android native development is just bad, and the fact that I'm not too happy with the official Matrix Android SDK design and documentation.
I will maintain and also add some features to the current version of Pattle, to try things out. The Flutter version will replace the native one once the features are in sync.</blockquote>

<h2 id="dimensionstickerpacks">Dimension sticker packs</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> has introduced sticker packs for <a href="https://dimension.t2bot.io/">Dimension</a>:
<blockquote>Dimension now has beta support for custom sticker packs. To create a sticker pack:</blockquote>
<ol>
 	<li>Start a conversation with @stickers:t2bot.io</li>
 	<li>Say <code>!stickers newpack</code> and follow the prompts.</li>
 	<li>Share the URL with your friends.</li>
</ol>
To add the sticker pack to your sticker picker:
<ol>
 	<li>Make sure you're using Dimension as your integration manager.
<ul>
 	<li>Not sure if you are? Click the 4 squares in the top right of the room in Riot - if the dialog is titled "Dimension", you're all set :)</li>
 	<li>If you aren't, check out <a href="https://dimension.t2bot.io">https://dimension.t2bot.io</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Click on the smiley face to the right of where you type messages then the Edit button in the top right.</li>
 	<li>Paste the URL of the sticker pack into the box and click "Add Stickerpack".</li>
 	<li>Start using your new stickers.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
These instructions are also available at <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension/blob/master/docs/custom_stickerpacks.md">https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension/blob/master/docs/custom_stickerpacks.md</a> as is the admin/operator guide for running your own sticker bot (you're not stuck with using t2bot.io unless you want to be).<br />Custom sticker packs are still beta while the proposals to share this with the wider Matrix ecosystem are still works in progress. This serves as a proof of concept to see how crazy of an idea it is to have stickerpacks-as-rooms (yes, they're just plain Matrix rooms under the hood) and what needs ironing out before moving ahead with the MSC.</blockquote>
<h2 id="matrixnotificationprofilemanager">matrix-notification-profile-manager</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a> has created a notification profile manager:
<blockquote>Over the past few weeks, I grew a bit fed up of always having to turn on and off every notification rule each time I'm having a slight change in what I'm working on or depending on what mood I was in (e.g. want to focus only on work-related stuff and nothing else, don't want to hear about work at all, somewhere in the middle, etc.), so I built a <a href="https://github.com/babolivier/matrix-notification-profile-manager">notification profile manager for Matrix</a>. It's available both as a command line interface or a Go package in case people want to build on top of it.<br /><br />It allows one to take a snapshot of their current notifications settings and save that as a profile, so that this profile can be applied later. It also allows one to delete a profile or list the existing profiles (more features to be added as time goes by). In order to make the whole thing interoperable with other projects building on top of the Go package, it also uses the user's account data on the user's Matrix homeserver to store profiles.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After discussion following <a href="https://cyberia.social/@foks/101785513826000032">https://cyberia.social/@foks/101785513826000032</a> I've resumed development on Neo. Suggestions are very much welcomed on the pad and mastodon thread<br />I'm implementing components one by one now, with just mocked events. Actual Matrix integration will come when the gui components are ready.<br /><br />Neo is now partly integrated with <code>matrix-js-sdk</code> because I grew tired of having to write my own mock events. There's a basic authentication flow, with 0 error handling, and parsing of <code>m.text</code> and <code>m.image</code> events</blockquote>

<p>f0x also said:</p>
<blockquote>it would be much appreciated to get some feedback on how I implemented matrix-js-sdk, had to do some weird stuff to make React update</blockquote>
I'll take a look but would love anyone with more experience of the SDK to get in touch with the f-man.

<h2 id="mautrixtelegram050released">mautrix-telegram 0.5.0 released</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> is up again with his Telegram bridge:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> 0.5.0 was released after I finally fixed the bug that was causing the bridge database to lock up. It turned out to be a single line of ORM usage that I had missed while converting everything to use SQLAlchemy Core.
The full release notes are at <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram/releases/tag/v0.5.0.">https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram/releases/tag/v0.5.0.</a>
I also released <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram/releases/tag/v0.5.1">v0.5.1</a> to fix a bug that made the DBMS migration script not work and Python 3.5 compatibility. I wouldn't recommend using Python 3.5 though, I'm going to drop support for it some time after Debian 10 is released</blockquote>
<h2 id="shevskimentionsmatrixonbbcradio4">Shevski mentions Matrix on BBC Radio 4</h2>
Shevski from the <a href="https://redecentralize.org/">#redecentralize</a> organisation was interviewed on Radio 4, and mentioned Matrix:

<a href="https://github.com/DanilaFe/Scylla">Scylla</a> has been receiving regular updates, no release to report but the project keeps going. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#scylla:riot.danilafe.com">#scylla:riot.danilafe.com</a>
<p>This React Native client is not announced so <a href="https://github.com/limvot/bubbles">don't look at it</a></p>
<p>My pal Doug shared his frustration with the broader state of the chat ecosystem after <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/hottest-chat-app-teens-google-docs/584857/">reading that teens now use Google Docs for their chat needs</a> (and not the chat feature, the document itself!)</p>
<blockquote><span class="mx_MTextBody mx_EventTile_content"><span class="mx_EventTile_body markdown-body" dir="auto">I love that you've got Amazon with their Alexa messaging, Apple in their own bubble with iMessage, Facebook doing chat 3-ways and Google trying 50 ways to do chat. And that's before you even get into things like Slack, Discord, Telegram, Riot, Line, WeChat etc etc. And then the current hot way to chat is in a document...</span>
</span>
<br />I mean, <strong>how much money is being invested in trying to create the perfect chat solution?</strong></blockquote>
For the record, we were chatting over Matrix‚Ä¶
<h2 id="thatsalliknow">That's all I know</h2>
That's the news, if you have something to say, or something to add, then you should go to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> and share it. If you have other projects to discuss, come share them. If you'd prefer to come quietly, my door is always open: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">@benpa:matrix.org</a>.
<p>See you here next week, and on Matrix!</p>
