<h3 id="enter-the-matrix">Enter the Matrix</h3>
<p><a href="https://brendan.abolivier.bzh/">Brendan</a> produced a <a href="https://brendan.abolivier.bzh/enter-the-matrix/">really, really informative article introducing Matrix</a>. As someone who is still very new to the project I found this writng to be very clear and informative, so thank you! The article made it to the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17063761">top of Hacker News</a>, where you can find a discussion of both the article and Matrix itself.</p>
<h3 id="presentation-about-matrix">Presentation about Matrix</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/martinkrafft">martinkrafft</a> presented about Matrix at <a href="https://wossat.nz/">wossat</a> a New Zealand Open Source show and tell meetup. His talk <a href="https://twitter.com/wossat/status/997230578385612801">can be seen here</a>, and focuses on the benefits of Matrix for users.</p>
<h2 id="spec-proposals">Spec Proposals</h2>
<p>As you may have seen from the <a href="/blog/2018/05/17/introducing-matrix-specification-changes/">previous blog post</a>, we have a new drive to advance the Matrix Specification itself. Part of this is <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a>, which lists all the spec change proposals we've accumulated so far, and describes the flow for getting new proposals merged. There is a new room, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> for discussion, please join if you want to get involved in this process. Check out the page and the blog post for more detail.</p>
<p>Next up: try to turn some of the many WIP proposals into Spec PRs...</p>
<h2 id="fractal-hackfest-2018">Fractal Hackfest 2018</h2>
<p><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Fractal2018">Fractal Hackfest 2018</a>: was super successful and productive by all accounts, and there were many! Check out reports from Daniel García Moreno (<a href="http://danigm.net/fractal-hackfest1.html">Day 1</a>, <a href="http://danigm.net/fractal-hackfest2.html">Day 2</a>), <a href="https://eishagsoc.wordpress.com/2018/05/13/fractal-hackfest.html">Eisha Chen-yen-su</a>, <a href="http://bytesgnomeschozo.blogspot.com/2018/05/fracturing-fractal.html">Adrien Plazas</a>, <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2018/05/15/fractal-hackfest-2018/">Julian Sparber</a>, <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2018/05/16/fractal-hackfest-in-strasbourg/">Tobias Bernard</a> and <a href="https://www.alexandrefranke.com/blog/20180518-Fractal-hackfest/">Alexandre Franke</a>.</p>
<p>A major topic at the Hackfest was a discussion of splitting the Fractal client into two UIs for the different behaviours of messaging apps. For anyone interested in product design thinking this is a genuinely fascinating topic. I encourage you to read <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2018/05/16/banquets-and-barbecues/">&quot;Banquets and Barbecues&quot;, Tobias' excellent coverage</a> of the latest thinking. The different chat personas are very well explained and the post brings up some of the immediate technical challenges too.</p>

Lots of excitement at the variety of independent clients and servers able to interact over the matrix protocol. The images above show <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">The Construct</a> (server) and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a> (client), and then <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a> and <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a>. A fundamental part of matrix is to be an open protocol, so it's great to see entirely independent implementations liaising together! While implementing <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> has been documenting spec omissions <a href="https://kamax.io/matrix/api/client_server/unstable.html">in a branch of the spec</a> - we're hoping he will contribute these back!</p>
<p>Honourable mention for <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mujx:matrix.org">mujx</a>, who was sending messages with <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">Ruma</a> a year ago!</p>
<h2 id="matrix-core-team-expansion">Matrix Core team expansion</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Stève - 17th May (yesterday)</li>
 	<li>Amber - 21st (Monday)</li>
 	<li>Anoa - 21st (Monday)</li>
 	<li>Hubert - 28th May</li>
 	<li>Half-Shot - 4th June
...and one more community member, hopefully (just sorting paperwork currently!)</li>
</ul>
Heads up that we're consciously trying to hire a mix of folks from the Matrix community as well as those outside it - and avoid hiring the whole community, both to ensure diversity of viewpoint & experience in the core team, and also to avoid cannibalising folks who working on their own commercial projects on top of Matrix. We'd prefer Matrix to be as decentralised and heterogenous as possible, needless to say - and instead try to support folks in building on Matrix without hiring them into the core team (where we'd expect them to focus on the core project for everyone's benefit). This may change once we have Matrix set up as a separate foundation, once we've got out of beta, of course.
<h2 id="new-rooms">New Rooms</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> is a new room dedicated to discussions on specific matrix spec proposals, as part of the process we're building around contributing to the matrix spec.</li>

<p>The talk of the town in Strasbourg this week was the arrival of Fractal Hackfest 2018! Event is still ongoing, and I'm sure they will provide a report of the progress on <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Fractal2018">https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Fractal2018</a>, though <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre</a> kindly sent us a photo of the group in action</p>

<h2 id="home-assistants">Home Assistants</h2>
<p>Wonderful things are happening and being discovered regarding IoT and Home Automation. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg:matrix.org">uhoreg</a> was the first to point us to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tinloaf:matrix.org">tinloaf's</a> project to build a Matrix Chatbot component for <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This component allows you to send messages to matrix rooms, as well as to react to messages in matrix rooms. Reacting to commands is accomplished by firing an event when one of the configured commands is triggered.</p>

<p>(this is not the same as notify.matrix <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/notify.matrix/">https://www.home-assistant.io/components/notify.matrix/</a>, which is used to deliver messages from Home Assistant to a room.)</p>
<p>Enthusiasm for this work led to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jon:terracrypt.net">jfred</a> discussing his past adventures in Matrix, including a component for <a href="https://github.com/theschwa/sibyl">sibyl</a>, 'a python chatbot with a focus on XBMC' allowing Matrix communication.</p>
<p>All this excitement led to Cadair creating <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#homeautomation:cadair.com">#homeautomation:cadair.com</a>, which has started a more thorough discussion. I'm eager to see more non-chat applications of Matrix, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> came up with others with projects in progress.</p>
<h2 id="on-gdpr">On GDPR</h2>
<p>GDPR has been a <del>favourite</del> topic for a while now. If you didn't already, take a look at the latest thinking from the Matrix Core team here: <a href="/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/">https://matrix.org/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting that we feel that GDPR is an excellent piece of legislation from the perspective of forcing us to think more seriously about our privacy – it has forced us to re-prioritise all sorts of long-term deficiencies in Matrix (e.g. dependence on DNS; improving User Interactive authentication; improving logout semantics etc).  There's obviously a lot of work to be done here, but hopefully it should all be worth it!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="travisr-on-gdpr">TravisR on GDPR</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/">TravisR</a> has also been thinking about GDPR, and how it relates to his <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-voyager-bot">Voyager bot</a>. In his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TWIM: I've mostly been working on figuring out how GDPR affects t2bot.io for the last couple weeks. One of the things running on t2bot.io is Voyager - a bot that tries to join rooms it sees mentioned in people's messages, graphing them on <a href="https://voyager.t2bot.io">https://voyager.t2bot.io</a>. With the increase in talk about GDPR and more bots starting to wander the federation, the recurring topic of whether Voyager should change its approach to finding and listing rooms.</p>
<p>With the current approach, Voyager reads messages and tries to find room aliases to try and join. Individual people can opt-out of this tracking to stop Voyager from reading/parsing their messages (opting back in at a later time, if desired). The room moderators can kick or ban the bot to completely remove their room from the graph, and can invoke a 'soft kick' if they'd like to have their room remain listed, but don't want the bot in the room. Voyager will make sure to only show information for public rooms and will update the graph if the room flips between public and private.</p>
<p>If anyone has feedback on how this approach could be improved (or if it should be left as-is), please come by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#voyager:t2bot.io">#voyager:t2bot.io</a> on matrix to start the conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="translations">Translations</h2>
<p>I was surprised and excited to learn that a Russian translation of the Matrix FAQ has been produced by a group of Russian-language users. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a several Russian-speaking users spontaneously decided to unite and help Matrix. We created a room where translated FAQ using the embedded etherpad widget. Some of us are here: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@commagray:matrix.org">Magnolia</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@commagray:matrix.org">Fenneko is a Good Girl</a> for example. Anybody can join to us <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#perevodators:matrix.org">#perevodators:matrix.org</a> and helps.

<p>They've provided a PR which I will presently merge (though of course, as I don't speak Russian I will need to trust that it's really a translation of the FAQ!)</p>

<p>This week <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has been focused on 'GTAD (Generate Things from API Description)', which is a code generator for C++, taking API description in Swagger/OpenAPI as it's source. Now at version 0.5, apparently GTAD</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can generate correct buildable (and runnable) code to convert data structures used in CS API between JSON and C++ - for the entirety of CS API calls. That basically means that libqmatrixclient gains (so far low-level) C++ CS API for all calls in <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/unstable.html">The Spec</a> and will follow updates to it.</p>

<h4 id="riot-web">Riot/Web</h4>
<ul>
<li>We're committing to 2-weekly releases come what may, to avoid another massive gap like the one between 0.13 and 0.14.</li>
<li>RCs will get cut starting from Wednesday; actual release then happens on the Monday having given folks a chance to test the RC on /staging (and to iterate on the RCs).</li>
<li>Obviously this is flexible if we need to rush out fixes sooner.</li>
<li>On that note, 0.14.2-rc1 was cut on Wednesday!  Please test it at riot.im/staging. It's mainly bugfixes but also the full relayering between riot-web and matrix-react-sdk.</li>
<li>Dave's working on finally hooking in Jitsi as the default conferencing system</li>
<li>t3chguy's been working on Replies, which continue to look awesome</li>
<li>Next up: E2E cross-signing (at last!!!!)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="riot-mobile">Riot/Mobile</h4>
<ul>
<li>New releases are out! Mainly preparing for sticker viewing and trying to fix the Android push notification situation.  PLEASE TELL US IF YOU ARE STILL HAVING ANDROID PUSH NOTIFICATION PROBLEMS!</li>
<li>Lots of review of Android by Benoit - adding in Kotlin support as of today and establishing a formal roadmap for Android work (we'll show the blog post when we have it)</li>
<li>Lots of Matrix-for-French-Government stuff.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="synapse">Synapse</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/2018/04/27/synapse-0-28-0-released/">Synapse 28.0 was released!</a> A major bump mainly thanks to lots and lots of contributions from the wider community.</li>
<li>Massive experimental work on GDPR in progress - doing the thought experiment of pseudonymising MXIDs throughout Matrix on a per-room basis so that it's possible to redact MXIDs in the event of a “right-to-erasure” GDPR event.  Rich vdH is leading the work.</li>
<li>The good news is that introducing an MXID abstraction layer like this could help us enormously with some of Matrix's longest-term architectural issues - i.e. account migration and portability; improving on PERSPECTIVEs for managing server identity; future support for P2P Matrix; solving the domain name reuse problem; etc.</li>
<li>The bad news is that it would obviously be a very significant change to the Matrix spec, although we'd be doing it in such a way which minimises impact to client implementers and keep the CS API looking as similar as possible.</li>
<li>We're not sure whether we need to rush this through or not yet; still waiting for final GDPR clarification from lawyers, but it feels like this might be a good opportunity to force us to finally tackle some of these harder problems.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Erik's Delta State Resolution algorithm work is continuing well; we're hoping to finish & merge it asap in order to get back headroom on the server.</li>
<li>Thankfully the matrix.org synapse itself has been relatively stable this week, other than being completely overloaded causing Freenode to be almost unusable.</li>
<li>We've started using Ansible in production, although the playbooks need some iteration before we're fully happy to announce them & recommend folks use them as an official way of running Synapse in production.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg">uhoreg</a> pointed to some charming coverage over on <a href="itsfoss.com">https://itsfoss.com</a>: <a href="https://itsfoss.com/riot-desktop/">Riot: A Distributed Way of Having IRC and VOIP Client and Home Server</a>, by <a href="https://itsfoss.com/author/shirish/">Shirish</a>. The article covers some details about riot-web and the open source ethos of Matrix, but my favourite quote by far:</p>

<li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix_dsl:matrix.ffslfl.net">#matrix_dsl:matrix.ffslfl.net</a> As mentioned above, MTRNord is looking at creating a DSL for matrix. In his words: "A room to discuss about making a Matrix DSL to allow non coders to write simple as and bots. I would love to see some people discussing about syntax with me as this is my very first DSL and very first time trying JetBrains MSP. Anyone with Ideas what it should allow to do and how to have the syntax a welcome to join (and people who want to follow of course too)"</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#trellobot:t2bot.io">#trellobot:t2bot.io</a> (from above) TravisR: "a discussion/developer room for Matrix Trello Bot (https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-trello-bot). This is a bot that notifies rooms of changes to tracked Trello boards, similar to how the Github bot works. Future enhancements include being able to create, update, and delete cards from within Matrix."</li>

<h4 id="libqmatrixclient">libqmatrixclient</h4>
<p>kitsune released 0.2 of libqmatrixclient a couple of weeks ago, which he says is &quot;the first one more or less functional and stable&quot;!</p>
<p>Highlights include redactions support, files transfer (both ways), rooms creation, account data (tags, direct chat flags). Also there are a few things making libqmatrixclient clients stand out compared to, e.g., Riot: one can set per-room names/avatars, and also the best estimate for the number of unread messages can be taken from the library and shown in the client application.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="picard">picard</h4>
<p>Cadair reported that he and SolarDrew have written a bot to bridge a whole slack team into a matrix community. It basically handles all the room admin for you including:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Invite the slack bot to the channel</li>
 	<li>Creating matrix rooms</li>
 	<li>Setting users as admins</li>
 	<li>Setting room name and room avatar and as publicly joinable</li>
 	<li>Setting up the link with the slack AS</li>
 	<li>Creating and adding rooms to the community</li>
 	<li>Inviting all members of the communtiy to the rooms</li>
</ul>
It does these things on a 1 min cron, to pick up new channels as they are created on the slack side.

 	<li>Folks with open PRs against the riot-web repository will need to reopen them against matrix-react-sdk (or more likely, merge them into their existing equivalents on matrix-react-sdk)</li>
 	<li>Michael (t3chguy's) Replies work has almost landed and is looking fantastic!</li>

 	<li>Meanwhile, Erik has been working hard on the problem of Incremental State Resolution (the big algorithmic win which could massively improve HS performance, especially for Synapse); this is looking promising and has ended up taking the form of a formal mathematical proof that the proposed algorithm works: <a href="/_matrix/media/v1/download/jki.re/hSmkLkFGVUnrXjtYcjsCUsyS">https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/jki.re/hSmkLkFGVUnrXjtYcjsCUsyS</a> (aka <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3122">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3122</a>) is where that's happening!

 	<li>Dave has been doing an interesting experiment in syncing user profile data from HSes into ISes (useful for folks running a private federation with its own IS who want to use the IS as a global user directory); almost complete - we'll see how this goes.</li>
 	<li>GDPR work is in progress. We're seeing how far we can push the envelope on improving privacy, including a very interesting thought experiment on pseudonyimsing MXIDs to provide 'perfect' right-to-erasure. vdH is on the case. Warning: this may well require a major federation protocol bump if we go through with it.</li>
 	<li>More Python3 port PRs are landing from NotAFile - thanks! They're getting slightly lost behind everything above.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Still stuck behind Synapse work.</li>
 	<li>Barring disasters we have at least 2 new folks starting fulltime in the core team (both synapse & dendrite) to help backend progress at the end of May however!</li>
 	<li>Lots of PRs coming in from APWhitehat though - thanks!!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec">Spec</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>uhoreg has been looking at the .well-known URI proposal again</li>
 	<li>Spec work on the core team is currently stuck behind Riot/Web and Synapse work, sadly, on the basis that burning implementation problems are more visible and harming to the project than burning spec problems.</li>
</ul>
