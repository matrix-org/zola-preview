<blockquote>
<p>Happy November from the Synapse team! As mentioned last week, we pushed a small <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.1">v1.22.1 release</a> last Friday which fixed two regressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug where an appservice may not be forwarded events for a room it was recently invited to. Broke in v1.22.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8676">#8676</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <code>Object of type frozendict is not JSON serializable</code> exceptions when using third-party event rules. Broke in v1.22.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8678">#8678</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't upgraded your Synapse in a while, <em>please do.</em></p>
<p>A major focus of Synapse is being able to meet the performance and reliability needs of massive homeservers like <code>matrix.org</code>. If you're curious about how Synapse's architecture has evolved over the years to meet these scaling challenges, check our our blog post from Tuesday: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/03/how-we-fixed-synapses-scalability">How we fixed Synapse's scalability!</a></p>
<p>Lastly, we anticipate releasing 1.23.0 in the next fortnight; keep your eyes peeled for release candidates and let us know if you have any feedback. For a preview of what's coming, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/compare/v1.22.1...develop">check out GitHub</a> for the new commits that have landed on the <code>develop</code> branch since our last release.</p>

<p>PLUS <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synapse now horizontally scales across multiple python processes, as of 1.22: you can configure it so that events are no longer sent through the main proc, eliminating the single biggest bottleneck for large scale Synapse deployments.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things have been quiet for Dendrite over the last week as I have been working on Pinecone/P2P and Kegan has been working on threading.</p>
<p>That said, a couple of minor changes have been merged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Forgetting rooms is now supported (thanks <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gjson dependency has been updated for correct integer safe ranges</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is the same as last week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 57%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 81%</p>
</li>

<p>As mentioned in the sync on Monday, I was mostly distracted from Hydrogen this week. (<em>sorry Bruno -BP</em>) I did release the picture lightbox on Monday, and yesterday managed to close 4 bugs. There's also a community PR for better usability and accessibility in the login screen (keep those coming!) and after some work to make encryption more robust, I hope to do a release with all those goodies tonight.</p>

<p>Since <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/23/this-week-in-matrix-2020-10-23#fractal">a couple of weeks ago</a>, we have merged a couple of branches that do a couple of things:</p>

<p>Clean up use of deprecated gtk-rs API</p>

<p>We are working through some low hanging fruit around post registration, blank screen interaction prompts and toast tweaks. We are also  experimenting with SSO for matrix.org.

<blockquote>
<p>Hi all! I <em>think</em> this is the right place to share this ü§û. I've been working on a Matrix SDK for Elixir over the last few months as a side project, it's very early days and it's currently just a bare-bones wrapper for the Client-Server API. I've also written the Elixir/Erlang bindings for Olm (currently missing group sessions) which should be added to the SDK soon. The repo can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/niklaslong/matrix-elixir-sdk">https://github.com/niklaslong/matrix-elixir-sdk</a> and the Elixir bindings for Olm are linked in the readme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the right place! Thanks cognitive_tea :D</p>
<p>Asked if there were big plans for use of the project</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not as yet, though a few people have reached out to me already and are building on top of it. I started it as a way to get going with Matrix dev and as a fun side project. That being said, I think providing the tools to Matrix-enable Elixir apps might lead to some interesting things.
If anyone has any precise ideas on how they would want to integrate their Elixir apps with Matrix, I'd be super happy to have a chat üëçÔ∏è
Less precise ideas are also welcome, of course üôÇ</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.0">Synapse 1.22.0</a> is out! We announced its first release candidate <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/23/this-week-in-matrix-2020-10-23#synapse">last week</a>, and after a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.0rc2">small rc2</a> the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.0">final release</a> was published last Tuesday. We anticipate a small 1.22.1 release later today with fixes for messages not always being sent to app services (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8673">#8673</a>) and serialization errors with third-party event rules (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8678">#8678</a>).</p>
<p>We continue to see improved client join <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">Apdex</a> scores for matrix.org, indicating that our work in 1.22.0 to split background tasks into separate workers and allow for sharded event persisters successfully improved the user-visible performance of large homeservers.</p>
<p>In other news, we pushed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8675">a temporary hotfix</a> to the matrix.org homeserver earlier this week, instructing it to drop all cross-user <code>m.key_share_request</code> messages. This was necessary to mitigate <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/famedlysdk/-/issues/126">a bug</a> in a third-party library which caused some clients to flood the server with requests. We'll re-enable these messages once we resolve <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8677">issue #8677</a>. In the meantime, we strongly encourage <a href="https://fluffychat.im/">FluffyChat</a> users to upgrade to version 0.21.1.</p>
<p>We're hard at work on the next release of Synapse, and the development branch <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/compare/v1.22.0...develop">already includes</a> many bugfixes, several new admin APIs, and support for structured logging‚Äîstay tuned!</p>

<p>This was an exciting week again. Trilene did the usual and just opened a PR, that implements the video part of call support. In my testing so far this seems to work amazingly well (ignore, that my webcam is crappy in the video, I only have so many devices...)! It's hard to overstate my satisfaction, if I am allowed to quote songs without getting a DMCA! If you want to try it out, you will need the qmlgl plugin at runtime (I had to patch some ebuilds on Gentoo to do so) and build Nheko from source. Support in our AppImage and Flatpak and for our Windows and MacOS builds will come at a later date. A big shoutout to trilene, who just works on VOIP in Nheko, without saying a word, and then drops a ready PR.</p>
<p>Another exciting new feature by lorendb, you can now specify <code>--profile &lt;profilename&gt;</code>, when you start Nheko, to create a separate profile. This allows you to open multiple instances and use multiple accounts at the same time (but it still uses separate instances of Nheko). This is pretty useful, if you have multiple accounts on different homeservers or are testing stuff for example. He also added a shortcut to delete the current content of the message area (Ctrl-U).</p>
<p>We also fixed a long standing bug, that crashed Nheko when pasting an image on mac OS, prevented copying text in some cases and build times should be about halfed again.</p>
<p>That's all I got today. I guess we should do a new release at some point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked about trilene, who is a reliable Nheko contributor, Nico replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>trilene seems to be a bit camera shy and prefer to work on code than take credit and talk about upcoming features. I'm surprised everytime, when a new PR is opened or trilene asks a weird question, that can only end up in an amazing contribution :3</p>

<p>To enable it you'll need Synapse 1.22.0 (released this week) and v0.5.8 of the bot-sdk.

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting November 28th and 29th of this year, many bots on t2bot.io will be supporting end-to-end encryption. Though not all bots will be supporting it, this is an important milestone towards getting end-to-bridge encryption enabled on t2bot.io as a proof of being able to scale to the higher demand of encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>The eventual goal is to support encryption on all of t2bot.io‚Äôs bots and bridges, however we need to take small steps to get there üôÇ. Note that in order to function, bots will decrypt <em>all</em> messages they see, but only respond to the ones they care about - this can still be uncomfortable for some rooms though, so feel free to kick them out.</p>
<p>For more detail on which bots are getting support and what all this entails/means, please see the <a href="https://t2bot.io/blog/2020/10/30/enabling-encryption-for-bots/">dedicated blog post</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Keymaker is a new WIP Project of some people (over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#serverlist:nordgedanken.dev">#serverlist:nordgedanken.dev</a>  ) that aim to provide a <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/communities/">mastodon</a> alike Server List and we would love to get some more input from the Community for this project on whats wanted, whats needed and whats maybe not that good to base on the mastodon counterpart.</p>
<p>This means we are building:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A list of Servers where Owners can add their servers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We try to do Quality controls (No fully self add. Servers get reviewed.) using a Code of Conduct Ruleset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verified Listings using well-known files on serverside (Also allowing Admins to modify server data themself)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server Details like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ping and Avalibility Stats (thanks to tulir for providing a API)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public Room Lists fetched from the Server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NSFW Ratings (A NSFW tag was too generic for us)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Section to list Rules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Admin addresses for easy ways of reaching the Server admins</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing to select registration state (&quot;Open&quot;, &quot;Invite Only&quot;, &quot;Closed&quot;)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Code is fully written in Rust and using Postgres as a backend. Have a look at: <a href="https://github.com/daydream-mx/keymaker">https://github.com/daydream-mx/keymaker</a></p>
<p>Join us at: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#serverlist:nordgedanken.dev">#serverlist:nordgedanken.dev</a> </p>
<p>In a further post we plan to announce the launch of this Project as a Website. Server owners might get a ping before that to allow for setting up servers for this. This Project is not yet deployed to be used.</p>

<p>This is really cool. I suggested it might start to kickstart people hosting their own small, publicly open servers.</p>

<p>As we also allow non public servers (registration -&gt; closed) it may also be a nice way to find communities that federate and have a look if they have a interesting room to join in the public rooms list. :)</p>

<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we're still focusing on the same MSCs from previous weeks to get widgets over the line. This includes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2774">MSC2774</a> to have widgets aware of their widget ID, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2765">MSC2765</a> so widgets can be pretty in clients like Element, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2790">MSC2790</a> to support a form of user input with widgets.</p>
<p>Normally there would be a graph here of our MSC progress, however my machine refuses to accept that line graphs are a real thing today.

<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> on Tuesday, a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/20/dendrite-0-2-0-released">reasonably big update</a> containing various improvements over the initial beta release, and then followed it up with a bug-fix <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.2.1">v0.2.1</a> release on Thursday. </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has been running Dendrite and reporting their findings, and also to contributors who have been submitting pull requests!</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer builds separate binaries for each polylith component, but instead has one multi-personality binary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Docker images have been simplified into two images: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-monolith">dendrite-monolith</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-polylith">dendrite-polylith</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal HTTP API calls are now made using H2C (HTTP/2) in polylith mode, which resolves some head-of-line issues with the connection pool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities have been refactored, which should fix some cases where room state can end up corrupted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A couple of bugs when handling state rewrites have been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sync API no longer sends old state events to clients as if they were new</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQLite locking bugs around the latest events updater have been resolved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notification levels are now parsed correctly in power level events (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pestdoktor">Pestdoktor</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invalid UTF-8 is now correctly rejected when making federation requests (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pestdoktor">Pestdoktor</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance for v0.2.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 57%, up from 56% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 81%, up from 80% last week</p>

<p>Element Android v1.0.9 is now available on the PlayStore. For the next release (1.0.10), we will optimize the performance (again!). We already have made some progress when sending a message to a room. We are now working on the crypto module and also we will probably upgrade the Realm database library, which seems more stable now. Besides that, we are still implementing the remaining features with the objective of getting a good feature parity with the other Element Matrix clients.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now shows the filename of an image on hover. (Contributed by kamath_manu)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko now shows the fontname in the font selection rendered using that font. This makes it easier to know, how the font will look, once you select it. (Contributed by lorendb)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a crash when closing Nheko. While this didn't really cause issues, since you were closing it anyway, it's just bad form to crash instead of exit properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed the membercache. Nheko used to load all members on startup and store them in memory. This made startup slower. Removing it sped up the start by a nice chunk and freed about 30MB of RAM on my system. One step closer to using reasonable amounts of RAM!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed excessive clipping when rendering the timeline. This prevented all batching of text messages. Now it only clips the replied to message, which makes scrolling much smoother again!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, some controversial change, which is currently in master but may be reverted at some point: Nheko now automatically forwards keys to verified devices, when they request the keys, without prompting you. While that can be toggled off in the settings, it currently defaults to on. This weakens backward secrecy of e2ee a bit, but it makes it possible to recover from e2ee issues much more easily. Currently I'd argue, that it is an acceptable tradeoff. It is very hard to verify room membership of users at any point in time but the current one and room membership is not verified end to end in any way, so you need to trust the server to provide you with the correct memberlist or you just send keys to verified users. While Nheko still sends keys to all members of a room, when creating the session, it only forwards your own keys to trusted users without prompting you. Currently I think this is an acceptable tradeoff, as opening a popup with &quot;user x wants to have session y shared in room z&quot; is unlikely to be understood by anyone properly either. I'd be glad to hear your opinions though!</p>
<p>That's it for this week, but next week will be interesting too. Lorendb has been hacking on profile support, allowing you to run multiple login sessions of Nheko in separate windows and some other UI features.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.6.2">Quotient 0.6.2</a> has been released, with a couple of minor bugfixes. This release is used as a foundation of <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.9.5-beta1">Quaternion 0.0.9.5 beta</a> that's also getting out today - with support of (proper Matrix subset of) HTML, rich text user links (like pills, only lighter), initial Markdown support (if you build with fresh enough Qt), reactions (thanks to Karel Kosek @krkk), navigation to earlier events (thanks to Roland Pallai @rpallai) and quite a few other improvements. To make this release Quaternion had to gain its own basic HTML parser and Matrix-to-Qt-to-Matrix converter, which is likely to end up being a separate micro-library, in the hope that it will be useful for other Matrix projects building on Qt (even non-Quotient ones). A separate call to translators - quite a few strings got updated, so please head to <a href="https://app.lokalise.com/project/730769035bbc328c31e863.62506391/">Quaternion project at Lokalise</a> and push the numbers at least to 80%!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In recent weeks the XR Finland community has been moving over from Wire to our own Matrix homeserver for encrypted secure chat. This was something that had been planned for a while but kicked off in recent weeks due to Wire suffering from serious encryption key delivery issues, causing messages for many to be unreadable in large groups. Currently we've migrated almost 300 rebels with more to come. Feedback has mostly been very positive, people generally like the Element clients ü§© One of the interesting changes has been a huge uptick in the amount of discussion, which can be taken as a good sign. The plan is to next start bridging to some of the international XR chapters, for example those on Mattermost, Telegram and Slack. And maybe get them over to Matrix too eventually ;)</p>
<p>To aid in community management, we've started creating <a href="https://github.com/elokapina/bubo">a bot called Bubo</a>. Right now it mostly helps with maintaining rooms and allowing mass invites, but more features to help the community cooperate are coming. We were planning to utilize (actual) communities so it has some functionality for those, but decided then to wait for the communities rewrite. It doesn't yet have any releases, will update in coming weeks as features are added and releases made.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">released our first beta last week</a> and we've been busy taking feedback from the community and fixing problems as they have been reported to us. We will be cutting a v0.2.0 release candidate later today, which contains a significant number of important fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>We didn't publish a full changelog last week due to the beta announcement, therefore the following list includes changes from the last two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Database migrations are now ran automatically at startup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State resolution v2 performance has been improved dramatically on large state sets, seen to be running up to 20x faster in some rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer runs state resolution over single trusted state snapshots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monolith deployments with Kafka now work again (each component sets up connections independently to avoid duplicate consumers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now correctly rejects invalid UTF-8 - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully read markers are now handled - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The devices table now tracks last seen timestamps, IPs and user agents - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed in the reverse topological ordering algorithm which resulted in us giving up on inbound references after the first prev/auth event</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug with concurrent map writes in the rate limiting in the client API has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities and their previous events are now checked fully against the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typing events are now ignored if the sender domain doesn't match the origin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duplicate redaction entries no longer result in database errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some bugs in <code>/send</code> have been fixed where the full room state wasn't requested properly before sending a new snapshot to the roomserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The membership updaters now use database writers properly, which fixes some SQLite locking issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sync API no longer burns CPU processing unnecessary device key change notifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>QueryStateAfterEvents</code> now resolves state from multiple snapshots properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cumulative room state is now sent to the roomserver when creating rooms locally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missing auth events will now be retrieved from multiple servers in the room if necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation requests now have variable timeouts, allowing us to wait much longer for a remote server to process certain tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/send</code> endpoint now returns 500 errors far less often, reducing the frequency that other servers back off from sending to Dendrite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backfill no longer uses the request context for persisting events, which was resulting in us failing to store those events sometimes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite stripped state from the sync API now includes the stripped invite itself, so that Element Web can display who sent the invite properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The signing key fetch mechanism no longer gives up if it is unable to fetch specific keys</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Hello everyone, this week we merged the federation branch into master. It's not ready to be used properly yet, but we're merging it as it seems stable enough for now. We also improved performance of the federation branch a lot by turning off debug logs.</p>
<p>Other news:</p>
<ul>
<li>I opened two issues on element-ios which currently break register and login support on Conduit, making it completely unusable. Hopefully they can be resolved soon (https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3736, https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3737)</li>
<li>I'm working on an MSC for threading. It's still WIP, but you can take a look here: https://demo.codimd.org/s/SykbuAUwP</li>

<p><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/stonking">Stonking</a> week for Synapse as we landed sharded event persisters and deployed to matrix.org. This is the last significant component other than the main process to go through the sharding process and a major hurdle in horizontal scalability of Synapse.</p>
<p>Initial results look good with event persistence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">apdex</a> improving, however we think there are still some significant performance improvements available through configuration and will continue to experiment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We also moved off background processes from the main process. This is significant because it means that while the main process is not shardable it really doesn‚Äôt do anything anymore other than orchestration.</p>
<p>Again the initial impact looks very promising and we will continue to tune. Having moved the background processes away it also makes profiling the main process that much easier.</p>

<p>Small bit of news I wanted to talk about from Bridge Island. My <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8437">implementation</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> has been merged which means appservices / bridges can now listen in for incoming presence, typing and read receipt events! This means that the Slack bridge can now reliably send your typing status to Slack, and Bifrost can reliably bridge your everything to XMPP. The MSC is still in flux and could change, but for now this could really improve the native feeling of bridges :)</p>
<p>(Oh and I should mention anyone using matrix-appservice-bridge v2.2.0+ can use this behaviour for free)</p>

<p>Hot on his heels, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been adding support for the MSCs Half-Shot implemented in Synapse to my bridges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enabling end-to-bridge encryption now uses appservice login (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2778">MSC2778</a>), which means setting up the shared secret login module is no longer required for e2be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mautrix-python has support for receiving ephemeral events via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> in a branch, which will be merged once Synapse v1.22 is released. After it's merged, <code>/sync</code>ing with double puppets will no longer be necessary to bridge ephemeral events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these will also be implemented in mautrix-go/whatsapp soon.</p>
<p>Now I just need Half-Shot to make synapse send to-device events to appservices, after which bridges won't need any hacky <code>/sync</code>ing at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several releases this week (0.1.11 to 0.1.15) with lots of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>url-based navigation has landed! All navigation in the app is now done through urls, meaning you can also bookmark any UI state (e.g. grid configurations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed 2 memory leaks (exposed now because you can unload your session without refreshing the page)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed an issue with libolm running out of memory if you send a message to more than 44 devices (see issue #150).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some logical additions now we have url navigation: restoring the last url when opening the app with the default route, and a button to close your session and go back to the picker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the app now blocks concurrent access to the same session from different tabs (it just closes the session in the non-active tab). This will prevent multiple syncs tripping over each other writing to indexeddb (e.g. ConstraintErrors and friends).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>updates are announced in the app (for now through a confirm dialog, but will use an in app notification once we have it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixes updates not installing on iOS, by having an update prompt. To get this update on iOS though, you'll need to unpin the app, and pinning it again. You'll need to login again after this. All future updates should be installable through the update prompt once you have 0.1.15 though, you won't have to do this again normally.</p>

<p>uses the hydrogen icon when pinning on iOS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I published the first preview of my Sailfish client called Konheko. While you can run Android applications on Sailfish, they usually are a subpar experience, since they really don't fit the platforms design and style and also usually don't properly send notifications.</p>
<p>So about a year ago I started working on a Matrix client for SailfishOS, but I never really made much progress. Well, last weekend I did, and so it can now send plain text messages as well as various forms of media messages, I made a basic application icon and I've been using it this week already (for unencrypted rooms).</p>
<p>It is still missing a lot of features, but if you want you can install it from <a href="https://openrepos.net/content/deepbluev7/konheko">OpenRepos</a>. Sources are available <a href="https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/konheko">here</a>. Just be aware, that it currently stores all messages in RAM, so every restart will take forever to load your rooms and it may run out of RAM at some point. Storing messages in some database will come at some point. Also, a lot of menus may lead nowhere, since those are just placeholders for me atm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently, I tweaked Element-web to feature a few changes similar to SchildiChat for Android.</p>
<p>For now, it's probably best seen rather as a proof-of-concept than a finished product, as there are still some layout bugs, and no settings available for the added features (I know some people prefer separate lists for direct and group chats).
I consider it usable though.</p>
<p>Particular changes compared to upstream Element-web include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A common section for groups and direct chats in the overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message bubbles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bigger items in the room overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A different dark theme, similar to SchildiChat for Android</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know how much I will work on this in the future, but I figured it might be interesting to share either way. Maybe even someone with more web-development skills than me might want to help improving it :)</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">has officially entered beta</a>!</p>
<p>It aims to be an efficient, reliable and scalable alternative to Synapse.</p>
<p>We encourage early adopters to try it out starting with v0.1.0 in Monolith/Postgres mode.</p>
<p>Dendrite supports a large amount of the Matrix spec including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All room versions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E2E encryption (but not cross-signing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and many others!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll be hard at work in the coming weeks ironing out any issues that crop up as Dendrite enters the global</p>
<p>federation of Matrix servers. At present, Dendrite has not been optimised for memory/CPU usage, nor does it
fully support sharding, so there is still much scope to improve the already impressive resource usage whilst</p>
<p>heading towards 100% spec compliance.</p>
<p>Spec compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 77%, same as last week</p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I worked on a new feature: the Admin Room. This is a room that is automatically created for the first user of a new homeserver. This room will be used to send warnings to server admins in the future and can be used to control Conduit (like querying information, running cleanup, banning servers, hiding public rooms or restarting Conduit). Power levels can be used to control who in the room has access to which commands. The admin room will work over federation, so it's easy to help someone fix his server.</p>
<p>Other news:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Federation is now disabled by default and can be enabled in the config</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bug with typing notifications is fixed</p>

<p>After a long and sometimes painful journey we plan to run sharded event persisters on matrix.org from Monday. All being well we will start running background processes on their own worker to free up the main process.
These two projects combined should noticeably improve performance of matrix.org and any large scale deployments.</p>
<p>Aside from that we are continuing to work on room knocking as a feature and have been considering ways to reduce load attributable to state resolution.</p>
<p>We will also dust off the notifications project.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we finally cleaned up the remaining parts of Chethans GSoC work and merged it. This means Nheko now has partial support for cross-signing. You can either start the verification from another client or when viewing the profile of a user. There are a few things still missing though:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko does not use the verification status at all at the moment. So while you can verify your master key and let others verify your master key, from Nhekos perspective there is not much benefit yet. You will however show up with a green checkmark in other clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While nheko supports verifying your own master key and after that will also let others verify your master key, it does not yet download the self and user signing keys. This means you won't be able to upload cross-signing signatures for your own devices and other users master keys yet. I'll see if I can implement in the next weeks or so (since literally only the private key download or sharing is missing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko can't bootstrap cross-signing yet. This means you need to bootstrap it from Element or another client once. That will probably take a bit until this is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UX is still WIP. Currently it shows a lot of unnecessary buttons, that are a bit confusing as well as not enough green checkmarks, so that needs some work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things that happened in the mean time or are work in progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decryption errors should be reduced by a bit now. This is still work in progress though. With device trust landed now, we should be able to do automatic key requests, sharing and key backup soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lurkki is currently cleaning up the design of the built in video player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manu_kamath is improving the design when showing images at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LorenDB has been updating our screenshots and working on an Esperanto translation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trilene has been ever busy improving edge cases around the Voip support in Nheko.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So far Hacktoberfest seems to be going well with quite a few people trying to clean up some of the rougher edges in Nheko. If you are using Nheko and think some things could be better, why not try to fix it yourself? October is the perfect time for that!</p>
<p>Featurework of this cycle is also slowly nearing its end. Once cross-signing, voip and the new event store are stable, we plan to improve the UX a bit more as well as some other annoyances and maybe we can do a new release then! A nice and spooky Hacktober everyone!</p>

<p>I have also added more hints on what the verdicts mean.</p>
<p>Finally, I have added workarounds to support Chromium browsers that decided to break their WebRTC API so that they could pedantically rename <code>ip</code> to <code>address</code>. In any case, it now seems to be on par with Firefox.</p>
<p>The VoIP tester is now roughly 'usable' but please note that IPv6 support is totally untested (I don't have IPv6) ‚Äî it is also suspected that some browsers won't try IPv6 anyway.</p>

<p><a href="https://fossil.nil.im/objmatrix">ObjMatrix</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ObjFW/ObjMatrix">GitHub</a>) is a new Matrix client library written in modern Objective-C for <a href="https://objfw.nil.im/">ObjFW</a>. Because it uses ObjFW, it is not limited to Apple platforms, and instead is <a href="https://objfw.nil.im/doc/trunk/PLATFORMS.md">extremely portable</a> and should run on basically everything.</p>
<p>This is currently in its very early stages and is intended to be suitable to develop bots and clients with very soon. Being suitable to develop bridges with it is another goal for later.</p>
<p>Since ObjFW also works on platforms that are usually hard to support or port software to (e.g. <a href="https://www.morphos-team.net/">MorphOS</a>), this will hopefully also bring clients for these less mainstream operating systems. I'm especially hopeful about MorphOS here, since ObjFW already runs quite well there (parts of it are included with the OS even!), and hardware on which MorphOS runs on is usually not powerful enough to run Element Web. And eventually, I will want to have a Matrix client on my Amiga, too üòâ (which this should enable).</p>

<p>The review is very positive, awarding 4.5/5, and concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Element messenger platform scores highly for its approach to security and its commitment to decentralization, and it's definitely going to be of interest to businesses wanting control over their own chats ‚Äì as well as plenty of individual users as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome back! This week we made some groundbreaking progress - this is not a joke, we found a bug in Synapse while breaking multiple Matrix rooms, causing the Matrix team a lot of unnecessary stress. Let me explain:
The good news is that Conduit is starting to federate now. This means that you should be able to join all public rooms of the Matrix network and exchange messages. Note that Conduit does not do all the checks it should be doing yet making it stop sending messages from time to time as well as that advanced features like loading the history, syncing temporary data like read receipts or accepting invites are not implemented yet.</p>
<p>The bad news is that, while Synapse is happy to accept Conduit's messages when it is already part of the room, joining into one of the rooms Conduit servers are part of didn't work because of an event validation bug. The Matrix team did an excellent job at fixing this bug and releasing a Synapse patch the same day, but the damage has been done making a few rooms inaccessible to old Synapse servers.
Thanks to everyone who supports me on &quot;Liberapay&quot; (https://liberapay.com/timokoesters) or Bitcoin!</p>

<p>Hi encryption fans. This week the bridge team has been churning away at adding support for encrypted rooms in the <code>matrix-appservice-bridge</code> library, to enable support in <code>matrix-appservice-irc</code>, <code>matrix-appservice-slack</code>, and anyone else using the library. This is probably the most exciting feature the library has seen in a long time! </p>
<p>The feature will be a simple config toggle, so existing bridges will have to do very little work to support it.</p>
<p>The first phase plans to use <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a> with bridge users syncing like real users, but eventually the hope is that this will be all built into the library.

<p>0.6.3 and 0.6.4 were released this week, and I'm now working on desktop notifications support and push rules control.</p>
<h4 id="added">Added</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add a <strong>system tray icon</strong>.</p>
<p>A left click will bring up the Mirage window, 
middle will quit the application and right will show a menu with these </p>
<p>options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>closeMimizesToTray</code> setting to the config file, defaults to <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Controls whether closing the Mirage window will leave it running in the 
system tray, or fully quit the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a discrete <strong>read marker indicator</strong> to messages, shows how many people </p>
<p>have this event as their last seen one in the room.<br />
A way to see who read the message and when will be added in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: add <code>chat.message.localEcho</code> and <code>chat.message.readCounter</code> color properties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>zoom</code> setting, defaults to <code>1.0</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>lexicalRoomSorting</code> setting, to sort rooms by their name instead of</p>
<p>recent activity.<br />
A restart is needed to apply changes to this setting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restrict Mirage to a single instance per config folder, trying to launch a</p>
<p>new window will instead focus the existing one.<br />
The <code>MIRAGE_CONFIG_DIR</code> and <code>MIRAGE_DATA_DIR</code> environment variables can be</p>
<p>set to run different &quot;profiles&quot; in parallel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the visible lag when opening a chat page, switching rooms should be </p>
<p>a lot smoother</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When using the <code>focusPreviousMessage</code> and <code>focusNextMessage</code> keybinds, if no</p>
<p>message is focused and the timeline has been scrolled up, 
focus the message in the center of the view instead of returning to the </p>
<p>bottom of the timeline and focusing the last one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't re-center the room list on clicks by default.</p>
<p>This prevents the list from jumping around every time a room is selected.<br />
The previous behavior can be restored with the new <code>centerRoomListOnClick</code></p>
<p>setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show a better terminal error message than &quot;Component is not ready&quot; when the </p>
<p>window creation fails, giving details on what went wrong in the code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an account's access token is invalid (e.g. our session was signed out </p>
<p>externally), say so with a popup and cleanly remove it from the UI, 
instead of spamming the user with errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename message context menu option &quot;Debug this event&quot; to just &quot;Debug&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unify up/down and (shift+)Tab navigation for the account Sessions page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to the UI scale/zoom via keybinds are now persisted across restarts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: <code>uiScale</code> is now bound to <code>window.settings.zoom</code>.</p>
<p>This change is necessary to keep the zoom keybinds working.</p>

<p>Hemppa gained a small but big feature for making fediverse better: per-room Mastodon tooting support. This means that you can set up a Mastodon account in your room and anyone with moderator rights can toot to that account. This way you and your roommates can super easily send toots to the world directly from Matrix. Mastodon (unlike the big alternative) supports RSS feeds out of the box so it's very easy to subscribe to users and hashtags with stock RSS bot.  Toot #hemppathebot if you like it!

<blockquote>
<p>Normally the ping shows how long other servers take to receive the sending-server's message. Some servers receive it quickly, some take hours. All this flows into the statistic of the sending server. I wrote a small program that's the other way around. Instead of measuring the sending-server's ping, it associates each measurement with an echo-bot (instead of the sending server), so this plot shows which maubots are the fastest to respond (it's probably not accurate at all, because most of the pings were started on conduit servers this week, but it's interesting nevertheless):</p>

<p>This week we put out a new release candidate for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.0rc3">Synapse 1.20.0</a>, highlights include shadow ban support, more async/awaiting and unread message counts being added to sync responses to support upcoming notifications work. </p>
<p>Aside from that Erik has been continuing to get event persistence sharding ready for shipping. He already has a working version, but currently all workers will run at the speed for the slowest instance. Once that is fixed we will put it on matrix.org to see how it performs.</p>
<p>Patrick has finished up on asyncing all the things, and is now studying flame graphs to figure out where all the cycles on the main process are going.</p>
<p>Andrew has been taking a look at the knocking <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC</a>, expecting concrete progress in the next few weeks. </p>
<p>Brendan has been working notifications support and is currently in VoIP land helping Dave on trying to level up our VoIP support.</p>
<p>Finally Oliver has dusted off his TURN tester from last Summer to get it working before he returns to university. The idea is that it will act a bit like the federation tester for but for TURN configuration.</p>

<p>Released 0.0.36 with end-to-end encryption enabled! üéâ<br />
Most of this week was spent on performance improvements for IE11, where asm.js runs quite slow. Decryption is run in parallel on 4 workers in that browser, giving a massive speed-up and added responsiveness (the UI would freeze for 7 seconds when opening a room prior to this). There is still some polishing to do on sharing room keys, which I will get to next week, but all in all, it should work well. Next week I also want to get started on supporting key backup, so you can also read your encrypted history from before you logged in.</p>

<h3 id="maunium-sticker-picker">Maunium sticker picker</h3>
<p>This isn't strictly a client, but it's in the clients section.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting stuff into the spec or even implemented in Elements is very slow, so while we wait for proper native sticker packs and pickers (i.e. not in an iframe/webview), I decided to make a better sticker picker widget: <a href="https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker">https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker</a></p>
<p>The goal is to be as fast and simple as possible. The picker and sticker packs are just some static files that can be served anywhere (no compilation required). It doesn't require self-hosting anything except said static files, and it has been confirmed to work on all three Elements.</p>
<p>There's a Telegram import script that's used to reupload stickers to Matrix and generate the static sticker pack files that the picker widget uses. It's technically also possible to make the sticker pack files yourself, but there's no easy way to do that yet.</p>
<p>Due to the simplicity of the picker there's no authentication, which also means everyone sees the same sticker packs. One way to get around that limitation is to have a unique URL for each user. I'll probably write a bot to manage copies of the picker for multiple users in the future.</p>
<p>Other future improvements include remembering frequently used stickers (surprisingly, all three Elements keep localStorage for widgets), importing Telegram animated stickers and searching for stickers by emoji/name</p>
</blockquote>
<p>later more words appeared from Tulir:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the initial announcement, my sticker picker has received some more features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a slider to configure the number of stickers shown per row</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequently used stickers now show up at the top</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imported all the packs from Scalar (the default integration manager)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Erik has made an initial, naive implementation of a sharded Event Persister worker - the non-sharded version currently being one of the biggest bottlenecks on matrix.org right now. It still needs a bit of polish to be production ready, and Sytest will need some updating to support testing it, but otherwise progress is looking good!</p>
<p>Brendan is polishing his unread counts implementations, while Rich is writing up the push rules replacement tech in an MSC. Rich has also been optimizing the device code in Synapse to both simplify the code, as well as cut down on unnecessary device data being sent over federation.</p>
<p>Patrick has finished converting Synapse's database code to be fully async! This has the benefit of making profiling the matrix.org Synapse process much more sane, and we're already starting to find a few little places where Synapse is burning CPU unnecessarily! Now, Synapse won't be fully async'd until Twisted itself is, and we drop support for older Twisted versions that aren't, which is not <em>soon</em>. However the majority of the code that developers touch and that is executed being async has massive benefits either way üôÇ</p>
<p>Andrew has been working on having a confirmation pop up after users click the link in their email, to help prevent phishing scams. He's also trying to finally make Synapse spec-compliant in accepting identifier dictionaries during user-interactive authentication.</p>
<p>Olivier has been continuing to help Synapse recover missed messages better after it has been offline for an extended period of time, as well as various fixes to push. </p>
<p>Expect a fresh release with all these changes soon!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we have been continuing on our bug-hunt mission and have been working on refactoring some significant parts of the codebase to simplify the API surfaces and avoid race conditions.</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The current state server is in the process of being deprecated, with this functionality being folded into the roomserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for rate limiting on certain CS API endpoints has been added </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for password changes has been added, allowing users to change their own password</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/sync</code> no longer incorrectly lists some rooms in the leave section, which caused problems with Element Web and other clients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roomserver input events are now handled in FIFO order with per-room workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roomserver input, query and perform packages are now split up nicely</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federation sender and keyserver now delay some startup tasks to allow the HTTP listeners to start more quickly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federation sender is now used for backfilling and getting missing events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some more SQLite writer bugs have been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room information in the roomserver is now handled in a common structure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public rooms API now correctly searches remote servers (thanks <a href="https://github.com/rohitmohan96">rohitmohan96</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initial support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2753">Peeking (MSC2753)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2444">Peeking over Federation (MSC2444)</a> is in progress</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is improving:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, up from 55% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 71%, same as last week</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Last week, we updated some of our documentation and created a whole new set of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">easy first issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted">medium to hard issues</a> for contributors.</p>

<p>Introducing a new bridge to the family, tomsg-matrix!</p>
<p>A friend of mine preferred using <a href="https://git.tomsmeding.com/tomsg/">his own chat protocol</a>, but having a chat protocol is useless without having people to talk to. Since I prefer using Matrix I thought it would be a fun exercise to try and create a bridge using Rust.</p>
<p>The bridge uses the newly created (still very WIP) <a href="https://github.com/lieuwex/matrix-appservice-rs">matrix-appservice-rs</a>. A Rust library that builds on top of the Ruma suite, the goal is for it to be comparable to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-node">matrix-appservice-node</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>.</p>
<p>The code for tomsg-matrix is <a href="https://github.com/lieuwex/tomsg-matrix">open source</a>, but be prepared, I hastily pushed it to GitHub without cleaning it up.</p>
<p>Come chat to us over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#tomsg:lieuwe.xyz">#tomsg:lieuwe.xyz</a>, hoping that it doesn't break. :P</p>

<p>I've been mostly reviewing PRs this week (and trying to get some other work in line, like MSCs, synapse stuff, etc). With this hopefully Chethans work on cross-signing will be merged soon, which will give us most of the building blocks to have cross-signing in Nheko (his work is basically only missing Secure Secret Storage and Sharing). We hope to fix the few remaining build issues in the next week or so.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of weeks, jplatte has been hard at work making sure we can introduce new fields to request and response types as non-breaking updates. Thanks to @nicholaswyoung, consumers can opt-in to breaking changes to ensure compliance with the spec on each update.</p>
<p>Besides that, we implemented another endpoint for the Federation API, bringing us up to 20/31 endpoints implemented.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has mostly been focused on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/milestone/8">beta milestone tasks</a> and bug fixes. Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Joining rooms which the server already belongs to when invited by a user from another homeserver is now significantly faster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client API no longer refers to the device DB directly, instead using the new user API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of locking issues have been fixed in the federation sender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/join</code> endpoint now accepts <code>?server_name=...</code> query parameters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device list updater now obeys the backoff period and blacklisted status from the federation sender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uploaded media will no longer be truncated to 0 bytes when <code>max_file_size_bytes</code> option is set to 0 (for unlimited)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media API now correctly cleans up temporary directories when errors occur</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media API now returns unique media IDs and metadata when multiple users upload the same file, whilst maintaining deduplication on disk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rejecting invites over federation multiple times should now work properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redactions are now permanent and are committed to the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some caches have been added to the roomserver for room IDs, state key IDs and event type IDs to reduce pressure on the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The redaction endpoint is now spec-compliant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some places where global errors were overwritten have been fixed (thanks oliverpool!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some state key checks in the roomserver membership updaters have now been tidied up (thanks oliverpool!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 55%, up from 54% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 70%, down from 71% last week due to a single flakey test</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also updated some of our documentation and created a whole new set of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">easy first issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted">medium to hard issues</a> for contributors.</p>

<p>Patrick has been continuing on the async/await train and has just submitted the final PR which async's our <code>runInteraction</code> method - the one that most database calls go through. Synapse is nearly 100% async! He's also been submitting a flurry of shadow ban PRs, which will be another powerful tool for moderation.</p>
<p>Brendan and Rich are continuing to work on the Notifications rewrite, with Brendan finishing up unread counts, and Rich polishing up designs for the new replacement for push rules.</p>
<p>Andrew (<em>who dat? - ed.</em>) is continuing to work on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">knocking MSC</a> and has fleshed out the CS and SS details. There are still some open questions though, so please give feedback if you notice anything off!</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A multi-account Matrix client that allows you to authorize webapps to access parts of your account, designed with collaboration in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the webapp I've been talking about for a while that allows webpages limited access to your account. Currently, apps can view the name, avatar, alias, and type of a room that's been opened with the app, and that's just about it.</p>
<p>The big interesting thing about mxapps right now is the architecture. Just about all of the logic is running in a shared worker. This means that you can duplicate as many tabs as you want and it will all act as the same client. It also has multi-account support.</p>
<p>Features coming ~soon~ at some point will be full state event support and easy-to-follow docs on how to make an app, plus Vue plugins to make development really easy.</p>
<p>You can checkout the live version on <a href="https://mxapps.kb1rd.net/">mxapps.kb1rd.net</a>, but it is a bit useless...</p>
<p>There are some work-in-progress docs on the structure on <a href="https://docs.mxapps.kb1rd.net/">docs.mxapps.kb1rd.net</a></p>
<p>I'll post an example app in a bit ;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Small 0.6.2 release this week, mostly bug fixes:</p>
<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When replying to a message, you can now press enter without entering any</p>
<p>text to send it directly (useful to &quot;forward&quot; a message).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending a file while replying to a message will create a pseudo-reply,</p>
<p>consisting of an &quot;In reply to&quot; text message with no body, followed by the
actual file event.</p>
<p>This is a workaround to the reply restrictions imposed by the Matrix spec.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Composer aliases cannot contain whitespace anymore.</strong></p>
<p>This includes spaces, hard tabs or newline characters.
If an alias from your config still has whitespace, only the first word</p>
<p>will be taken into account (ignoring any leading or trailing space).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faster server browser loading, now gathers all needed data with a</p>
<p>single request instead of one for each server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-focus the &quot;Join&quot; button on invited room pages</p>
<p>((Shift+)Tab can be used to navigate between buttons)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-focus the &quot;Forget&quot; button on left room pages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: modify <code>chat.message.styleSheet</code> to add some spacing between HTML </p>
<p>list items, see

</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fixed">Fixed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix @username autocompletion closing if there's more than one character</p>
<p>after the @</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the partial text from IME (input method editors) and touch screen </p>
<p>autocompleting keyboards and for username autocompletion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reset IME state upon autocompleting a username</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix clicking on autocompletion list user not making the username a mention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix UI freezing when mentioning user lacking a display name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix mentioning users with blank display name (e.g. only spaces), mention</p>
<p>them by their user ID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix text fields/areas unable to be focused on touch screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix random chance of profile retrieval requests failing if one of the logged</p>
<p>in account doesn't federate with other servers (e.g. localhost synapse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix composer text saved to disk for the wrong account if that text begins</p>
<p>by an account alias</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Servers can potentially return an outdated member list for rooms on initial </p>
<p>sync, which is one of the possible cause of &quot;Members not synced&quot; error for 
encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>When loading the full room list, discard members from the initial sync list
that are absent from the full list.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Released 0.0.34 this week with some fixes to the room list sorting and fixing several crashes. If you clear your session, it will also sort low priority rooms at the bottom of the room list, even if unread, making it a bit more usable until we add more UX refinements to the room list. </p>
<p>Most of the effort this week however has gone into working on end-to-end encryption, having investigated using the rust-sdk for a couple of days, and now looking into a custom implementation based on libolm. This is well on its way with key upload working and device tracking nearing completion.</p>

<p>I just merged the new event store a few days ago. This means Nheko now doesn't keep messages in RAM! Everything is stored on disk and mapped into memory from disk. This may reduce memory usage a tiny bit, but may increase latency while scrolling a bit. Try it out and give your feedback!</p>
<p>For the developers reading this, I collected some ramblings on my blog here: <a href="https://blog.neko.dev/posts/nhekos-event-store-v2.html">https://blog.neko.dev/posts/nhekos-event-store-v2.html</a> . Yes, I designed that site when I was like 15, I know the dark theme is a bit too much... Just use Firefox and the alternate stylesheet for light mode! Anyway, I'm very interested to hear how other clients implement their event stores!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we have largely been working on bug fixes and performance issues.</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The room server now handles input events for multiple rooms in parallel when running with PostgreSQL, which helps a lot with perceived latency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Device key queries now obey federation backoffs, so that we don't spend a lot of time making unnecessary requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key server now only emits changes for <code>/users/devices</code> which reduces database hits significantly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client API now tries to guarantee message ordering on a per-user basis (thanks Anand!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federated invites are now more reliable and are performed synchronously</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite room metadata is now sent correctly in all cases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting and rejecting invites is also now much more reliable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed that caused excessive memory usage in the sync API (bringing the memory usage of my own instance down to less than 100mb)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A massive amount of work has been done to reduce database locks in SQLite mode across the entire codebase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some unnecessary code has been removed from the roomserver updaters</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 54%, same as last week</p>

<p>Server-Server APIs: 71%, up from 70% last week</p>

<p>On the sharding side the last big milestone is to get the event persister to shard. I know this comes up every week, but we now have a rough working implementation for non-backfilled events. Next steps are to get backfill working, get the tests passing, go through review and then ship. I asked Erik if it would be live on matrix.org within 2 weeks. He didn‚Äôt say, at least I didn‚Äôt hear him say no‚Ä¶&gt;
Aside from that Rich is working on the push rules redesign, the next steps are to design the APIs in more detail and then make a formal spec proposal. Brendan is also in notifications land and his work on room unread counts is going through final review. </p>

<p>Hello! Just recently I made public an SELinux policy module I developed for Synapse. This policy is one I developed early on during my trip down the SELinux rabbit hole, and I have been using it in production for some time. At the moment, this policy module is built for the Gentoo SELinux policy (not RHEL/CentOS/Fedora) and does not currently have systemd support, nor has it been tested in all environments, i.e. with workers. I am publishing this policy in the hopes that it will be useful and I am open to any contributions, even those to help tighten the policy if possible. Finally, I have also made public a policy module for coturn, which I am also using in my own personal environment under the same conditions. Both the <a href="https://github.com/0xC0ncord/synapse-selinux">Synapse</a> policy and the <a href="https://github.com/0xC0ncord/turnserver-selinux">coturn</a> policy can be found on Github.

<blockquote>
<p>As channels are really popular in Telegram, I wrote a quick and dirty program/bot which can mirror (text and image) public Telegram channels to Matrix rooms. This should make it easier for Telegram users to consider a switch.</p>
<p>Making the rooms read-only via permissions prevents messages from users.
It provides a good basis for someone trying to make a real 1to1 mirror. Please fork this project and host some channels publicly ;)</p>

<p>I've been working on trying to finish the event store (when I wasn't distracted by video calls with some people). This should allow limited offline use and reduce memory use as well as allow some other features in the future. If you want to try it out, you can build <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/pull/251">this PR</a> or try out the nightlies with <code>new-event-store</code> in their name.</p>
<p>If you decide to try it out, backup your cache or at least BACKUP YOUR ENCRYPTION KEYS! I won't be responding to feedback immediately, since I am currently hiking, but I should get to it this weekend or next week. Come discuss it in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:ocean.joedonofry.com">#nheko:ocean.joedonofry.com</a>, if you have some feedback or issues.</p>

<p>Hydrogen is a web-based client designed to be very lightweight, and with few dependencies.
Anyone who wants to discuss Hydrogen can join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#hydrogen:matrix.org">#hydrogen:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Added several features this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>avatars and display names in the timeline and for rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implemented the logic for the member list, but no UI for this yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>room list sorting by last message timestamp, unread state and badge count</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clear unread state when reading a room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some visual tweaks in the timeline and room list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bug fixes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have checked out hydrogen before, <strong>you'll need to clear your session</strong> (the little clear button in the session picker) to get correct avatars and display names everywhere.</p>
<p>Next week I'll get started on E2EE, which should make the project a lot more useful. I'll look into leveraging the nice rust matrix-crypto-sdk for this.</p>

<h3 id="mirage-0-6-1">Mirage 0.6.1</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@miruka:privacytools.io">miruka</a> hit us with a late breaking update about Mirage!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mirage 0.6.1 was released today:</p>
<h4 id="added">Added</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>SSO authentication</strong> support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Homeserver browser</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To add a new account, you will be asked first to pick one of the 
listed public server (list data from <a href="https://publiclist.anchel.nl/">anchel.nl</a>) or to manually enter a server address </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Typing in the server address field will also filter the public server list, 
Up/Down or (Shift+)Tab and Enter can be used to navigate it by keyboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the address doesn't have a <code>scheme://</code>, auto-detect whether the server
supports HTTPS or only HTTP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the .well-known API if possible to resolve domains to the actual 
homeserver's URL, e.g. <code>matrix.org</code> resolves to 
<code>https://matrix-client.matrix.org</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server address field will remember the last homeserver that was
connected to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Room members autocompletion</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Type <code>@</code> followed by one or more characters in the composer, 
or one or more characters and hit (Shift+)Tab to trigger username/user ID
autocompletion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only autocompleted names will be turned into mentions, unlike before
where any word in a sent message that happened to be someone's name would 
mention them</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full image viewer</strong> for matrix image messages and URL previews:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click on a thumbnail in the timeline to open the image viewer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middle click on a thumbnail (or use the option in the context menu)
to open the image externally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Left click on the image (mouse only): expand to window size if the 
image's origin size is smaller than the window, 
else expand to original size</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap on the image (touch screen/pen only): reveal the info and button bars
when auto-hidden (bars will auto-hide only when they overlap with a big 
enough displayed image)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any mouse movement: reveal auto-hidden bars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double click on the image: toggle full screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middle click anywhere: open externally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right click anywhere: close the viewer, back to chat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag when displayed image is bigger than window to pan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wheel to pan up/down, hold shift or alt to pan left/right</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ctrl+wheel to control zoom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buttons to control rotation, scale mode, full screen, GIF play/pause 
and GIF speed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New keyboard shortcuts are available for all these actions, 
see <code>keys.imageViewer</code> in the config file (will be automatically updated 
when you start Mirage 0.6.1)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <code>media.openExternallyOnClick</code> setting to swap the new
click and middle click on thumbnails behavior </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room and member filter fields now support (Shift+)Tab navigation, in addition
to Up/Down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a colored left border to the currently highlighted item in list views 
(e.g. room list, members list, etc) to improve visibility </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>controls.listView.highlightBorder</code> and
<code>controls.listView.highlightBorderThickness</code> properties (can be set to <code>0</code>)</li>
<li>Add the <code>chat.userAutoCompletion</code> section</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Messages context menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use a cleaner icon for the &quot;Copy text&quot; entry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace the confusing broken &quot;Copy media address&quot; entry with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Copy media address: visible for non-encrypted media, always
copies the HTTP URL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy local path: always visible for already downloaded media, even if
they were downloaded before mirage was started</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>openMessagesLinks</code> keybind (default Ctrl+O) is renamed to
<code>openMessagesLinksOrFiles</code> and can now also open media message files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the <code>openMessagesLinksOrFiles</code> keybind on a reply will now ignore the
matrix.to links contained in the &quot;In reply to XYZ&quot; header</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pressing Ctrl+C to copy selected/highlighted non-encrypted media messages 
will copy their HTTP URL instead of the filename</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retry downloading image thumbnails if they fail with a 404 or 500+ server 
error (uploads sometimes take a few seconds to become available on the 
server)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-encrypted media messages are now always downloaded on click and opened
with a desktop application (or the image viewer), instead of
being opened in a browser</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compress thumbnails and clipboard images in a separate process, to avoid
blocking every other backend operation while the compression is running</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the level of optimization applied to clipboard images, 
the previous setting was too slow for large PNG (10MB+)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase applied scrolling velocity when using the 
<code>scrollPageUp</code>/<code>scrollPageDown</code> keybinds, now similar to how it was before
Mirage 0.6.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't catch SIGQUIT (Ctrl+\ in terminal) and SIGTERM signals, exit immediately</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slightly increase the top/bottom padding to the multi-account bar in the 
left pane</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependencies: minimum nio version bumped to 0.15.0</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="removed">Removed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Themes: remove unused <code>controls.listView.smallPaneHighlight</code> property</li>
</ul>
<p>And lots of fixes, see <a href="https://github.com/mirukana/mirage/releases/tag/v0.6.1">full changelog</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We wanted to take a little bit of time to show off a state resolution library for Ruma, courtesy of @DevinR528 and @Timo. Ruma has a new crate to make resolving state easier, <a href="https://github.com/ruma/state-res">state-res</a>! The goal of this crate is to be the base for federation, it provides the necessary utilities to resolve state, sort power events (reverse topological ordering), sort events (based on mainline depth), and a lot of event authentication functions. It is still in the early stages of development, but will be hopefully proved out in <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit">Conduit</a>.</p>
<p>Other things that happened this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added the invite endpoints from the Federation API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Started requiring strong types for event-sending endpoints</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Augmented error types with error-specific fields (see the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/713341462?t=00h35m42s">livestream here</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking of livestreams, @jplatte streams coding sessions from time to time on <a href="https://twitch.tv/jplatte">Twitch</a>.
