<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We started out this week by releasing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.0">Dendrite 0.3.0</a> and then ended the week with a bug-fix <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.1">Dendrite 0.3.1</a> release.</p>
<p>I'd like to say thank you especially to our community contributors who have been adding new features and filling gaps!</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Memory optimisation by reference passing, significantly reducing the number of allocations and duplications in memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A concurrency bug has been fixed in the federation API that could cause Dendrite to crash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hook API has been added for experimental MSCs, with an early implementation of MSC2836</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forgetting rooms is now supported (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last seen timestamp and IP address are now updated automatically when calling <code>/sync</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last seen timestamp and IP address are now reported in <code>/_matrix/client/r0/devices</code> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/alexkursell">alexkursell</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An optional configuration option <code>sync_api.real_ip_header</code> has been added for specifying which HTTP header contains the real client IP address (for if Dendrite is running behind a reverse HTTP proxy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partial implementation of <code>/_matrix/client/r0/admin/whois</code> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/DavidSpenler">DavidSpenler</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The error when registering a username with invalid characters has been corrected (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/bodqhrohro">bodqhrohro</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>-version</code> command line flag has been added (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backfilling should now work properly on rooms with world-readable history visibility (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MayeulC">MayeulC</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some more client event fields have been marked as omit-when-empty (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>build.sh</code> script has been updated to work properly on all POSIX platforms (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/felix">felix</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged, although some Synapse-specific tests have been removed and some new tests have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>We released Synapse 1.23.0 on Wednesday! Read all about it on the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/18/synapse-1-23-0-released">Matrix Blog</a>. Otherwise, we'd like to highlight a few developments over the past week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We're discussing a policy for ending support for old versions of Python and PostgreSQL. If you have opinions, please <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8782">let us know on GitHub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our initial implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</a> is undergoing review, and will likely land soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've been looking at ways to improve the efficiency of state resolution, and Erik has managed to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622#issuecomment-729620021">devise some algorithmic improvements</a> that yield an order of magnitude speedup for a handful of pathologic cases. We hope to have a better idea of how this might work for real world workloads soon.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, we'd like to take this opportunity to remind you to <strong>please regularly upgrade your Synapse.</strong> Especially if you're not yet on 1.20.0, as we'll be disclosing a denial of service issue which affects older versions on Monday.</p>

<p>mewmew wanted to use my fork of Synapse, so I made the changes there configurable (instead of hardcoding to my user ID) and even added a readme to list the features. It might also be useful for other people who want custom room IDs and other fun stuff.</p>

<p>I've been slowly rewriting the message are to be qml, to make it easier to do fancy styling. As a result emojis in the emoji-completer are now colorful and the avatars in the username completer now match the avatars used in the timeline. It also open up a few other improvements, like finally sending mentions as links instead of plain text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have now CI running on our <a href="https://nheko.im">self hosted gitlab instance</a>. We will probably switch of the travis CI, once this is more battle tested. Repositories are now also automatically mirrored between gitlab and github.</p>

<p>Fresh off the arXiv presses comes our</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06488">‚ÄúAnalysis of the Matrix Event Graph Replicated Data Type‚Äù</a> preprint!
This time, it is a deep dive into the data structure properties of the event graph:</p>
<p>What type of consistency guarantees does it provide,
how many of the other homeservers you share a room with can be faulty or malicious without violating those guarantees (short answer: all of them!),</p>
<p>and how is it possible that a frayed-out event graph ever laces back to just a few current events,
while there is a probability larger than zero for growth to arbitrarily high limits?</p>
<p>To shed light on those questions, we had a great cooperation between my <a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/">Decentralized Systems and Network Services
Research Group</a> and <a href="https://www.math.kit.edu/stoch/~henze/">Prof. Dr. Norbert Henze from the Institute of Stochastics</a>.</p>
<p>While we are still in search of the right venue for peer-reviewed publication,
we went for a preprint this time to share our results with the scientific and the Matrix community in a timely manner.</p>

<p>In this figure, k is the number of participating servers, U_n is the current width of the event graph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, with a current width of U_n = 1000 events and k = 200 servers,
we can expect that the width goes below E(U_{n+1}) &lt; 600 events in just one step.*</p>

<p>Thus this week's focus is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1544">MSC1544</a> (QR Code verification), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2790">MSC2790</a> (modal widgets) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2844">MSC2844</a> (global versioning).</p>
<p>We've also started making use of a Github board to track the state of an MSC through the currently somewhat ambiguous process of putting up an MSC that is ready for review to starting FCP. You can find the board here: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/31">SCT Backlog</a>.</p>
<p>Some explanation of the columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Awaiting SCT Input - These are MSCs that are deemed reviewable by the MSC author, and require review by a subsection of the Spec Core Team (usually one or two people) that are most familiar with the scope of Matrix that the MSC is relevant to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ready for FCP ticks - At least one individual from the Spec Core Team has signed off on the MSC. It is not time for others to give a cursory review - mainly sanity checking from the perspective of the part of Matrix that they work on. Note that fundamental flaws may still be found in this stage, requiring the MSC to be reworked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In FCP - The MSC is in Final Comment Period, where everyone has a last chance to get their ideas in. This happens after most of the Spec Core Team have given their ticks from the previous column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Done - These MSCs no longer need immediate attention by some portion of the Spec Core Team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These definitions are all flexible as we continue to see what works for the limited resources we have available for review.</p>
<p>Do not be alarmed if a particular MSC is not on this board, we're placing things on here as deemed necessary, and more will certainly be added in time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We are aware of a trivially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in versions of Synapse prior to 1.20.0. Complete details will be disclosed on Monday, November 23rd. If you have not upgraded recently, please do so.</p>
<p>Happy RC day! The first release candidate of Synapse 1.23 is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0rc1">now available</a>. For Synapse admins, we've added numerous new APIs thanks to contributions by <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">@dklimpel</a>, and we now support generating <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.23.0rc1/docs/structured_logging.md">structured logs</a> in a standard manner. The <code>structured</code> and <code>drains</code> logging options are now deprecated in Synapse's configuration.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0rc1">Synapse 1.23.0rc1</a> also includes several significant bugfixes, especially around regressions in the SQLite-to-PostgreSQL database porting script, as well a fix to an issue that would prevent Synapse from recovering after losing its connection to the database. Synapse will also now reject modifications to access control lists which would otherwise result in a server blocking itself from a room. This is a particularly interesting case of unintended consequences in protocol design, and we hope to write more about it soon.</p>
<p>Next week should see the full release of 1.23, followed by a first implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403"><em>MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</em></a> landing in the development branch for 1.24.

<p>Hello TWIM! From this week on we're changing how we're reporting updates on the Element clients. Each week, we'll include a section for cross-platform feature work the Element team is working on, and some sections for platform specific work too.</p>
<p><strong>Spaces (previously known as Communities)</strong></p>
<p>Communities are back! They've been renamed to Spaces, and on the Element team we've been busy exploring user experience and critical thinking for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a>, to allow users to organise rooms into useful groups.</p>
<p><strong>Social Login</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to reduce friction in authentication, we've been R&amp;Ding how to allow homeservers &amp; Matrix clients to support multiple SSO providers.. Most of the work so far is captured in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2858">MSC2858</a> and we're starting initial implementations in Element web next week.</p>
<p><strong>VoIP: Voice &amp; Video Calls</strong></p>
<p>We've started foundational research, design and engineering to improve both the usability and stability of native matrix VoIP in Element. We've also started to look at how we can improve the continuity of the user experience between native Matrix calls and our current implementation of Jitsi.</p>
<p><strong>Usability</strong></p>
<p>We've been focusing on improving post-registration actions all round to make Element provide better prompts for first actions, and empty states for views on all platforms, with a multitude of fixes having landed on Element Web, iOS &amp; Android in the last week. We've also started paid user testing to better understand specific pain points in the first time user experience, which we're looking to improve significantly in the coming weeks. </p>
<p><strong>Web platform</strong></p>
<p>v1.7.13 is now live! Which includes a bunch of fixes &amp; improvements on VoIP.</p>
<p><strong>Android platform</strong></p>
<p>v1.0.10 is now available on the Play Store. We're also doing ongoing work to catch up with feature parity to Element Web, and <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">Dominaezzz</a> is migrating SDK APIs to suspend functions: no more MatrixCallback!</p>
<p><strong>iOS platform</strong></p>
<p>v1.1.0 is soon to be live on TestFlight for beta testers, and we'll soon be turning our attention to fixing end-to-end encryption regressions.</p>

<p>A new release integrates an embedded h2 database into <a href="https://github.com/benkuly/matrix-spring-boot-sdk">matrix-spring-boot-bot</a>, which makes it a lot easier to write bots with persistency. You only need a few lines of code to write simple bots (<a href="https://github.com/benkuly/matrix-spring-boot-sdk/blob/master/matrix-spring-boot-bot-examples/ping-bot/src/main/kotlin/net/folivo/matrix/bot/examples/pingappservice/PingHandler.kt">e. g. a ping bot</a>).

<h4 id="matrix-sms-bridge">matrix-sms-bridge</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/benkuly/matrix-sms-bridge">matrix-sms-bridge</a> now uses the h2 database from <a href="https://github.com/benkuly/matrix-spring-boot-sdk">matrix-spring-boot-bot</a> instead of neo4j, which makes it a lot more stable and fixes some bugs. We are using it in production with hundreds of target telephone numbers without problems. I also added an optional feature to use room aliases (e. g. #sms_4901234567:homeserver) to prevent multiple rooms with one target telephone number (which is still possible).</p>
<p>In a few weeks you can use this bridge with an old Android-Smartphone, which acts as an sms gateway with rest api.</p>

<p>Hello Matrix friends. I've been asked to share this here. I'm currently building a platform for building communities. I'm focused on deeper matrix integration with communities, private messaging built on top of matrix, and custom domain support.

The matrix community is at <a href="https://gurlic.com/matrix">https://gurlic.com/matrix</a>, but I haven't had the time to post much. </p>

<p>We have user pages (https://gurlic.com/bob -&gt; https://bob.monster)</p>

<p>I pretty much want all resources to have custom domain support, and matrix rooms for all communities, and nested communities. In the near future, I hope to have matrix servers for custom domains too. And of course, the source will also be open if folks want to host.</p>
<p>Right now, users on gurlic get a matrix account, and communities/galleries/publications get a room too, but i'm hoping to take some time to look at much deeper integration. Dendrite and hydrogen are great to build on top off...</p>

<p>Happy November from the Synapse team! As mentioned last week, we pushed a small <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.1">v1.22.1 release</a> last Friday which fixed two regressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug where an appservice may not be forwarded events for a room it was recently invited to. Broke in v1.22.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8676">#8676</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <code>Object of type frozendict is not JSON serializable</code> exceptions when using third-party event rules. Broke in v1.22.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8678">#8678</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't upgraded your Synapse in a while, <em>please do.</em></p>
<p>A major focus of Synapse is being able to meet the performance and reliability needs of massive homeservers like <code>matrix.org</code>. If you're curious about how Synapse's architecture has evolved over the years to meet these scaling challenges, check our our blog post from Tuesday: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/03/how-we-fixed-synapses-scalability">How we fixed Synapse's scalability!</a></p>
<p>Lastly, we anticipate releasing 1.23.0 in the next fortnight; keep your eyes peeled for release candidates and let us know if you have any feedback. For a preview of what's coming, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/compare/v1.22.1...develop">check out GitHub</a> for the new commits that have landed on the <code>develop</code> branch since our last release.</p>

<p>PLUS <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synapse now horizontally scales across multiple python processes, as of 1.22: you can configure it so that events are no longer sent through the main proc, eliminating the single biggest bottleneck for large scale Synapse deployments.

<p>Things have been quiet for Dendrite over the last week as I have been working on Pinecone/P2P and Kegan has been working on threading.</p>
<p>That said, a couple of minor changes have been merged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Forgetting rooms is now supported (thanks <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gjson dependency has been updated for correct integer safe ranges</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is the same as last week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 57%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 81%</p>

<p>Hi all! I <em>think</em> this is the right place to share this ü§û. I've been working on a Matrix SDK for Elixir over the last few months as a side project, it's very early days and it's currently just a bare-bones wrapper for the Client-Server API. I've also written the Elixir/Erlang bindings for Olm (currently missing group sessions) which should be added to the SDK soon. The repo can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/niklaslong/matrix-elixir-sdk">https://github.com/niklaslong/matrix-elixir-sdk</a> and the Elixir bindings for Olm are linked in the readme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the right place! Thanks cognitive_tea :D</p>
<p>Asked if there were big plans for use of the project</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not as yet, though a few people have reached out to me already and are building on top of it. I started it as a way to get going with Matrix dev and as a fun side project. That being said, I think providing the tools to Matrix-enable Elixir apps might lead to some interesting things.
If anyone has any precise ideas on how they would want to integrate their Elixir apps with Matrix, I'd be super happy to have a chat üëçÔ∏è
Less precise ideas are also welcome, of course üôÇ</p>

We anticipate a small 1.22.1 release later today with fixes for messages not always being sent to app services (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8673">#8673</a>) and serialization errors with third-party event rules (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8678">#8678</a>).</p>
<p>We continue to see improved client join <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">Apdex</a> scores for matrix.org, indicating that our work in 1.22.0 to split background tasks into separate workers and allow for sharded event persisters successfully improved the user-visible performance of large homeservers.</p>

This was necessary to mitigate <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/famedlysdk/-/issues/126">a bug</a> in a third-party library which caused some clients to flood the server with requests.

<p>This was an exciting week again. Trilene did the usual and just opened a PR, that implements the video part of call support. In my testing so far this seems to work amazingly well (ignore, that my webcam is crappy in the video, I only have so many devices...)! It's hard to overstate my satisfaction, if I am allowed to quote songs without getting a DMCA! If you want to try it out, you will need the qmlgl plugin at runtime (I had to patch some ebuilds on Gentoo to do so) and build Nheko from source. Support in our AppImage and Flatpak and for our Windows and MacOS builds will come at a later date. A big shoutout to trilene, who just works on VOIP in Nheko, without saying a word, and then drops a ready PR.</p>
<p>Another exciting new feature by lorendb, you can now specify <code>--profile &lt;profilename&gt;</code>, when you start Nheko, to create a separate profile. This allows you to open multiple instances and use multiple accounts at the same time (but it still uses separate instances of Nheko). This is pretty useful, if you have multiple accounts on different homeservers or are testing stuff for example. He also added a shortcut to delete the current content of the message area (Ctrl-U).</p>
<p>We also fixed a long standing bug, that crashed Nheko when pasting an image on mac OS, prevented copying text in some cases and build times should be about halfed again.</p>
<p>That's all I got today. I guess we should do a new release at some point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked about trilene, who is a reliable Nheko contributor, Nico replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>trilene seems to be a bit camera shy and prefer to work on code than take credit and talk about upcoming features. I'm surprised everytime, when a new PR is opened or trilene asks a weird question, that can only end up in an amazing contribution :3</p>

<p>To enable it you'll need Synapse 1.22.0 (released this week) and v0.5.8 of the bot-sdk. Then, add <code>&quot;de.sorunome.msc2409.ephemeral&quot;: true</code> to your appservice registration file (at the root level) and turn on the <code>de.sorunome.msc2409.ephemeral</code> flag in your <code>IAppserviceRegistration</code> supplied to the bot-sdk. If all goes according to plan, you'll be able to use <code>appservice.on(&quot;ephemeral.event&quot;, (ev) =&gt; {})</code> to start processing EDUs.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting November 28th and 29th of this year, many bots on t2bot.io will be supporting end-to-end encryption. Though not all bots will be supporting it, this is an important milestone towards getting end-to-bridge encryption enabled on t2bot.io as a proof of being able to scale to the higher demand of encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>The eventual goal is to support encryption on all of t2bot.io‚Äôs bots and bridges, however we need to take small steps to get there üôÇ. Note that in order to function, bots will decrypt <em>all</em> messages they see, but only respond to the ones they care about - this can still be uncomfortable for some rooms though, so feel free to kick them out.</p>
<p>For more detail on which bots are getting support and what all this entails/means, please see the <a href="https://t2bot.io/blog/2020/10/30/enabling-encryption-for-bots/">dedicated blog post</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A list of Servers where Owners can add their servers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We try to do Quality controls (No fully self add. Servers get reviewed.) using a Code of Conduct Ruleset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verified Listings using well-known files on serverside (Also allowing Admins to modify server data themself)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server Details like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ping and Avalibility Stats (thanks to tulir for providing a API)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public Room Lists fetched from the Server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NSFW Ratings (A NSFW tag was too generic for us)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Section to list Rules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Admin addresses for easy ways of reaching the Server admins</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing to select registration state (&quot;Open&quot;, &quot;Invite Only&quot;, &quot;Closed&quot;)</p>

<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> on Tuesday, a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/20/dendrite-0-2-0-released">reasonably big update</a> containing various improvements over the initial beta release, and then followed it up with a bug-fix <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.2.1">v0.2.1</a> release on Thursday. </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has been running Dendrite and reporting their findings, and also to contributors who have been submitting pull requests!</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer builds separate binaries for each polylith component, but instead has one multi-personality binary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Docker images have been simplified into two images: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-monolith">dendrite-monolith</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-polylith">dendrite-polylith</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal HTTP API calls are now made using H2C (HTTP/2) in polylith mode, which resolves some head-of-line issues with the connection pool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities have been refactored, which should fix some cases where room state can end up corrupted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A couple of bugs when handling state rewrites have been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sync API no longer sends old state events to clients as if they were new</p>

<p>Invalid UTF-8 is now correctly rejected when making federation requests (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pestdoktor">Pestdoktor</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance for v0.2.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 57%, up from 56% last week</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now shows the filename of an image on hover. (Contributed by kamath_manu)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko now shows the fontname in the font selection rendered using that font. This makes it easier to know, how the font will look, once you select it. (Contributed by lorendb)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a crash when closing Nheko. While this didn't really cause issues, since you were closing it anyway, it's just bad form to crash instead of exit properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed the membercache. Nheko used to load all members on startup and store them in memory. This made startup slower. Removing it sped up the start by a nice chunk and freed about 30MB of RAM on my system. One step closer to using reasonable amounts of RAM!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed excessive clipping when rendering the timeline. This prevented all batching of text messages. Now it only clips the replied to message, which makes scrolling much smoother again!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, some controversial change, which is currently in master but may be reverted at some point: Nheko now automatically forwards keys to verified devices, when they request the keys, without prompting you. While that can be toggled off in the settings, it currently defaults to on. This weakens backward secrecy of e2ee a bit, but it makes it possible to recover from e2ee issues much more easily. Currently I'd argue, that it is an acceptable tradeoff. It is very hard to verify room membership of users at any point in time but the current one and room membership is not verified end to end in any way, so you need to trust the server to provide you with the correct memberlist or you just send keys to verified users. While Nheko still sends keys to all members of a room, when creating the session, it only forwards your own keys to trusted users without prompting you. Currently I think this is an acceptable tradeoff, as opening a popup with &quot;user x wants to have session y shared in room z&quot; is unlikely to be understood by anyone properly either. I'd be glad to hear your opinions though!</p>
<p>That's it for this week, but next week will be interesting too. Lorendb has been hacking on profile support, allowing you to run multiple login sessions of Nheko in separate windows and some other UI features.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:elokapina.fi">kapina-jaywink</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent weeks the XR Finland community has been moving over from Wire to our own Matrix homeserver for encrypted secure chat. This was something that had been planned for a while but kicked off in recent weeks due to Wire suffering from serious encryption key delivery issues, causing messages for many to be unreadable in large groups. Currently we've migrated almost 300 rebels with more to come. Feedback has mostly been very positive, people generally like the Element clients ü§© One of the interesting changes has been a huge uptick in the amount of discussion, which can be taken as a good sign. The plan is to next start bridging to some of the international XR chapters, for example those on Mattermost, Telegram and Slack. And maybe get them over to Matrix too eventually ;)</p>
<p>To aid in community management, we've started creating <a href="https://github.com/elokapina/bubo">a bot called Bubo</a>. Right now it mostly helps with maintaining rooms and allowing mass invites, but more features to help the community cooperate are coming. We were planning to utilize (actual) communities so it has some functionality for those, but decided then to wait for the communities rewrite. It doesn't yet have any releases, will update in coming weeks as features are added and releases made.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">released our first beta last week</a> and we've been busy taking feedback from the community and fixing problems as they have been reported to us. We will be cutting a v0.2.0 release candidate later today, which contains a significant number of important fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>We didn't publish a full changelog last week due to the beta announcement, therefore the following list includes changes from the last two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Database migrations are now ran automatically at startup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State resolution v2 performance has been improved dramatically on large state sets, seen to be running up to 20x faster in some rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer runs state resolution over single trusted state snapshots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monolith deployments with Kafka now work again (each component sets up connections independently to avoid duplicate consumers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now correctly rejects invalid UTF-8 - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully read markers are now handled - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>completed</code> field is now returned properly for user-interactive auth - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The devices table now tracks last seen timestamps, IPs and user agents - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed in the reverse topological ordering algorithm which resulted in us giving up on inbound references after the first prev/auth event</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug with concurrent map writes in the rate limiting in the client API has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities and their previous events are now checked fully against the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typing events are now ignored if the sender domain doesn't match the origin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duplicate redaction entries no longer result in database errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some bugs in <code>/send</code> have been fixed where the full room state wasn't requested properly before sending a new snapshot to the roomserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The membership updaters now use database writers properly, which fixes some SQLite locking issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sync API no longer burns CPU processing unnecessary device key change notifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>QueryStateAfterEvents</code> now resolves state from multiple snapshots properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cumulative room state is now sent to the roomserver when creating rooms locally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missing auth events will now be retrieved from multiple servers in the room if necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation requests now have variable timeouts, allowing us to wait much longer for a remote server to process certain tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/send</code> endpoint now returns 500 errors far less often, reducing the frequency that other servers back off from sending to Dendrite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backfill no longer uses the request context for persisting events, which was resulting in us failing to store those events sometimes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite stripped state from the sync API now includes the stripped invite itself, so that Element Web can display who sent the invite properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The signing key fetch mechanism no longer gives up if it is unable to fetch specific keys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling of invalid display name or avatar URLs in membership events has been improved</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved a little:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 80%, up from 79% last week</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Hello everyone, this week we merged the federation branch into master. It's not ready to be used properly yet, but we're merging it as it seems stable enough for now. We also improved performance of the federation branch a lot by turning off debug logs.</p>
<p>Other news:</p>
<ul>
<li>I opened two issues on element-ios which currently break register and login support on Conduit, making it completely unusable. Hopefully they can be resolved soon (https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3736, https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3737)</li>

<p><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/stonking">Stonking</a> week for Synapse as we landed sharded event persisters and deployed to matrix.org. This is the last significant component other than the main process to go through the sharding process and a major hurdle in horizontal scalability of Synapse.</p>
<p>Initial results look good with event persistence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">apdex</a> improving, however we think there are still some significant performance improvements available through configuration and will continue to experiment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We also moved off background processes from the main process. This is significant because it means that while the main process is not shardable it really doesn‚Äôt do anything anymore other than orchestration.</p>
<p>Again the initial impact looks very promising and we will continue to tune. Having moved the background processes away it also makes profiling the main process that much easier.</p>

<p>Small bit of news I wanted to talk about from Bridge Island. My <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8437">implementation</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> has been merged which means appservices / bridges can now listen in for incoming presence, typing and read receipt events! This means that the Slack bridge can now reliably send your typing status to Slack, and Bifrost can reliably bridge your everything to XMPP. The MSC is still in flux and could change, but for now this could really improve the native feeling of bridges :)</p>
<p>(Oh and I should mention anyone using matrix-appservice-bridge v2.2.0+ can use this behaviour for free)</p>

<p>Hot on his heels, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been adding support for the MSCs Half-Shot implemented in Synapse to my bridges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enabling end-to-bridge encryption now uses appservice login (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2778">MSC2778</a>), which means setting up the shared secret login module is no longer required for e2be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mautrix-python has support for receiving ephemeral events via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> in a branch, which will be merged once Synapse v1.22 is released. After it's merged, <code>/sync</code>ing with double puppets will no longer be necessary to bridge ephemeral events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these will also be implemented in mautrix-go/whatsapp soon.</p>
<p>Now I just need Half-Shot to make synapse send to-device events to appservices, after which bridges won't need any hacky <code>/sync</code>ing at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several releases this week (0.1.11 to 0.1.15) with lots of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>url-based navigation has landed! All navigation in the app is now done through urls, meaning you can also bookmark any UI state (e.g. grid configurations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed 2 memory leaks (exposed now because you can unload your session without refreshing the page)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed an issue with libolm running out of memory if you send a message to more than 44 devices (see issue #150).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some logical additions now we have url navigation: restoring the last url when opening the app with the default route, and a button to close your session and go back to the picker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the app now blocks concurrent access to the same session from different tabs (it just closes the session in the non-active tab). This will prevent multiple syncs tripping over each other writing to indexeddb (e.g. ConstraintErrors and friends).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>updates are announced in the app (for now through a confirm dialog, but will use an in app notification once we have it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixes updates not installing on iOS, by having an update prompt. To get this update on iOS though, you'll need to unpin the app, and pinning it again. You'll need to login again after this. All future updates should be installable through the update prompt once you have 0.1.15 though, you won't have to do this again normally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>uses the hydrogen icon when pinning on iOS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I published the first preview of my Sailfish client called Konheko. While you can run Android applications on Sailfish, they usually are a subpar experience, since they really don't fit the platforms design and style and also usually don't properly send notifications.</p>
<p>So about a year ago I started working on a Matrix client for SailfishOS, but I never really made much progress. Well, last weekend I did, and so it can now send plain text messages as well as various forms of media messages, I made a basic application icon and I've been using it this week already (for unencrypted rooms).</p>
<p>It is still missing a lot of features, but if you want you can install it from <a href="https://openrepos.net/content/deepbluev7/konheko">OpenRepos</a>. Sources are available <a href="https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/konheko">here</a>. Just be aware, that it currently stores all messages in RAM, so every restart will take forever to load your rooms and it may run out of RAM at some point.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@spiritcroc:matrix.org">SpiritCroc</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently, I tweaked Element-web to feature a few changes similar to SchildiChat for Android.</p>
<p>For now, it's probably best seen rather as a proof-of-concept than a finished product, as there are still some layout bugs, and no settings available for the added features (I know some people prefer separate lists for direct and group chats).
I consider it usable though.</p>
<p>Particular changes compared to upstream Element-web include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A common section for groups and direct chats in the overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message bubbles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bigger items in the room overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A different dark theme, similar to SchildiChat for Android</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know how much I will work on this in the future, but I figured it might be interesting to share either way. Maybe even someone with more web-development skills than me might want to help improving it :)</p>
<p>For further discussion, I have created <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#schildichat-web:matrix.org">#schildichat-web:matrix.org</a> .</p>
<p>The current version of SchildiChat-Desktop is available for Desktop <a href="https://github.com/SpiritCroc/schildichat-desktop/releases">here</a>, and I host the web variant <a href="https://schildiweb.spiritcroc.de/">here</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">has officially entered beta</a>!</p>
<p>It aims to be an efficient, reliable and scalable alternative to Synapse.</p>
<p>We encourage early adopters to try it out starting with v0.1.0 in Monolith/Postgres mode.</p>
<p>Dendrite supports a large amount of the Matrix spec including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All room versions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E2E encryption (but not cross-signing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and many others!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll be hard at work in the coming weeks ironing out any issues that crop up as Dendrite enters the global</p>
<p>federation of Matrix servers. At present, Dendrite has not been optimised for memory/CPU usage, nor does it
fully support sharding, so there is still much scope to improve the already impressive resource usage whilst</p>
<p>heading towards 100% spec compliance.</p>
<p>Spec compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 77%, same as last week</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week I worked on a new feature: the Admin Room. This is a room that is automatically created for the first user of a new homeserver. This room will be used to send warnings to server admins in the future and can be used to control Conduit (like querying information, running cleanup, banning servers, hiding public rooms or restarting Conduit). Power levels can be used to control who in the room has access to which commands. The admin room will work over federation, so it's easy to help someone fix his server.</p>
<p>Other news:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Federation is now disabled by default and can be enabled in the config</p>

<p>After a long and sometimes painful journey we plan to run sharded event persisters on matrix.org from Monday. All being well we will start running background processes on their own worker to free up the main process.
These two projects combined should noticeably improve performance of matrix.org and any large scale deployments.</p>
<p>Aside from that we are continuing to work on room knocking as a feature and have been considering ways to reduce load attributable to state resolution.</p>
<p>We will also dust off the notifications project.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we finally cleaned up the remaining parts of Chethans GSoC work and merged it. This means Nheko now has partial support for cross-signing. You can either start the verification from another client or when viewing the profile of a user. There are a few things still missing though:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko does not use the verification status at all at the moment. So while you can verify your master key and let others verify your master key, from Nhekos perspective there is not much benefit yet. You will however show up with a green checkmark in other clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While nheko supports verifying your own master key and after that will also let others verify your master key, it does not yet download the self and user signing keys. This means you won't be able to upload cross-signing signatures for your own devices and other users master keys yet. I'll see if I can implement in the next weeks or so (since literally only the private key download or sharing is missing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko can't bootstrap cross-signing yet. This means you need to bootstrap it from Element or another client once. That will probably take a bit until this is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UX is still WIP. Currently it shows a lot of unnecessary buttons, that are a bit confusing as well as not enough green checkmarks, so that needs some work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things that happened in the mean time or are work in progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decryption errors should be reduced by a bit now. This is still work in progress though. With device trust landed now, we should be able to do automatic key requests, sharing and key backup soon.</p>

<p>So far Hacktoberfest seems to be going well with quite a few people trying to clean up some of the rougher edges in Nheko. If you are using Nheko and think some things could be better, why not try to fix it yourself? October is the perfect time for that!</p>
<p>Featurework of this cycle is also slowly nearing its end. Once cross-signing, voip and the new event store are stable, we plan to improve the UX a bit more as well as some other annoyances and maybe we can do a new release then! A nice and spooky Hacktober everyone!</p>

<p><a href="https://fossil.nil.im/objmatrix">ObjMatrix</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ObjFW/ObjMatrix">GitHub</a>) is a new Matrix client library written in modern Objective-C for <a href="https://objfw.nil.im/">ObjFW</a>. Because it uses ObjFW, it is not limited to Apple platforms, and instead is <a href="https://objfw.nil.im/doc/trunk/PLATFORMS.md">extremely portable</a> and should run on basically everything.</p>
<p>This is currently in its very early stages and is intended to be suitable to develop bots and clients with very soon. Being suitable to develop bridges with it is another goal for later.</p>
<p>Since ObjFW also works on platforms that are usually hard to support or port software to (e.g. <a href="https://www.morphos-team.net/">MorphOS</a>), this will hopefully also bring clients for these less mainstream operating systems. I'm especially hopeful about MorphOS here, since ObjFW already runs quite well there (parts of it are included with the OS even!), and hardware on which MorphOS runs on is usually not powerful enough to run Element Web. And eventually, I will want to have a Matrix client on my Amiga, too üòâ (which this should enable).</p>
<p>This currently does not have a decicated Matrix room yet, so all discussions about it currently happen in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#objfw:nil.im">#objfw:nil.im</a>. So please feel free to join there and follow along development. And contributions are of course <em>very</em> welcome!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome back! This week we made some groundbreaking progress - this is not a joke, we found a bug in Synapse while breaking multiple Matrix rooms, causing the Matrix team a lot of unnecessary stress. Let me explain:
The good news is that Conduit is starting to federate now. This means that you should be able to join all public rooms of the Matrix network and exchange messages. Note that Conduit does not do all the checks it should be doing yet making it stop sending messages from time to time as well as that advanced features like loading the history, syncing temporary data like read receipts or accepting invites are not implemented yet.</p>
<p>The bad news is that, while Synapse is happy to accept Conduit's messages when it is already part of the room, joining into one of the rooms Conduit servers are part of didn't work because of an event validation bug. The Matrix team did an excellent job at fixing this bug and releasing a Synapse patch the same day, but the damage has been done making a few rooms inaccessible to old Synapse servers.

<p>Hi encryption fans. This week the bridge team has been churning away at adding support for encrypted rooms in the <code>matrix-appservice-bridge</code> library, to enable support in <code>matrix-appservice-irc</code>, <code>matrix-appservice-slack</code>, and anyone else using the library. This is probably the most exciting feature the library has seen in a long time! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>0.6.3 and 0.6.4 were released this week, and I'm now working on desktop notifications support and push rules control.</p>
<h4 id="added">Added</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add a <strong>system tray icon</strong>.</p>
<p>A left click will bring up the Mirage window, 
middle will quit the application and right will show a menu with these </p>
<p>options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>closeMimizesToTray</code> setting to the config file, defaults to <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Controls whether closing the Mirage window will leave it running in the 
system tray, or fully quit the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a discrete <strong>read marker indicator</strong> to messages, shows how many people </p>
<p>have this event as their last seen one in the room.<br />
A way to see who read the message and when will be added in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: add <code>chat.message.localEcho</code> and <code>chat.message.readCounter</code> color properties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>zoom</code> setting, defaults to <code>1.0</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>lexicalRoomSorting</code> setting, to sort rooms by their name instead of</p>
<p>recent activity.<br />
A restart is needed to apply changes to this setting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restrict Mirage to a single instance per config folder, trying to launch a</p>
<p>new window will instead focus the existing one.<br />
The <code>MIRAGE_CONFIG_DIR</code> and <code>MIRAGE_DATA_DIR</code> environment variables can be</p>
<p>set to run different &quot;profiles&quot; in parallel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the visible lag when opening a chat page, switching rooms should be </p>
<p>a lot smoother</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When using the <code>focusPreviousMessage</code> and <code>focusNextMessage</code> keybinds, if no</p>
<p>message is focused and the timeline has been scrolled up, 
focus the message in the center of the view instead of returning to the </p>
<p>bottom of the timeline and focusing the last one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't re-center the room list on clicks by default.</p>
<p>This prevents the list from jumping around every time a room is selected.<br />
The previous behavior can be restored with the new <code>centerRoomListOnClick</code></p>
<p>setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show a better terminal error message than &quot;Component is not ready&quot; when the </p>
<p>window creation fails, giving details on what went wrong in the code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an account's access token is invalid (e.g. our session was signed out </p>
<p>externally), say so with a popup and cleanly remove it from the UI, 
instead of spamming the user with errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename message context menu option &quot;Debug this event&quot; to just &quot;Debug&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unify up/down and (shift+)Tab navigation for the account Sessions page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to the UI scale/zoom via keybinds are now persisted across restarts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: <code>uiScale</code> is now bound to <code>window.settings.zoom</code>.</p>
<p>This change is necessary to keep the zoom keybinds working.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fixed">Fixed</h4>
<ul>
<li>A bunch of stuff, see the full changelog for <a href="https://github.com/mirukana/mirage/releases/tag/v0.6.3">0.6.3</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mirukana/mirage/releases/tag/v0.6.4">0.6.4</a></li>

<p>Hemppa the bot is a multi-purpose Matrix bot for writing new functionality easily with Python. </p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cos:hacklab.fi">Cos</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hemppa gained a small but big feature for making fediverse better: per-room Mastodon tooting support. This means that you can set up a Mastodon account in your room and anyone with moderator rights can toot to that account. This way you and your roommates can super easily send toots to the world directly from Matrix. Mastodon (unlike the big alternative) supports RSS feeds out of the box so it's very easy to subscribe to users and hashtags with stock RSS bot.  Toot #hemppathebot if you like it! Another new contribution worth mentioning is welcome which can send welcome messages to users registering on the server or joining a room. <a href="https://github.com/vranki/hemppa">https://github.com/vranki/hemppa</a></p>

<p>Another week, another <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby SDK</a> release. This time adding a little fix to avoid duplicate state events being passed twice to the application if identical ones arrive in both state and timeline, also adds a global state event handler and moves room event handling to not depend on room instances themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asked how much the SDK is used in production, Ananace said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a little, we've hooked Matrix into our server orchestration / configuration management system TheForeman - which is a Rails application. Also got a colleague who's doing a bot to linkify internal ticket IDs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to @q-b and @jtescher we have implemented more of the federation endpoints (bringing us up to about 85% completion) and every (one) endpoint of the Push Gateway API!</p>
<p>We fixed a bug where federation endpoints expected access tokens instead of server signatures for authentication. In the future, we may add an API that requires signatures on requests.</p>
<p>Finally, we've also continued progress on the non-exhaustive type updates for backwards compatibility; we expect to finish this within the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Normally the ping shows how long other servers take to receive the sending-server's message. Some servers receive it quickly, some take hours. All this flows into the statistic of the sending server. I wrote a small program that's the other way around. Instead of measuring the sending-server's ping, it associates each measurement with an echo-bot (instead of the sending server), so this plot shows which maubots are the fastest to respond (it's probably not accurate at all, because most of the pings were started on conduit servers this week, but it's interesting nevertheless):</p>

<p>Aside from that Erik has been continuing to get event persistence sharding ready for shipping. He already has a working version, but currently all workers will run at the speed for the slowest instance. Once that is fixed we will put it on matrix.org to see how it performs.</p>
<p>Patrick has finished up on asyncing all the things, and is now studying flame graphs to figure out where all the cycles on the main process are going.</p>

<p>It's been a big week for <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Released 0.0.36 with end-to-end encryption enabled! üéâ<br />
Most of this week was spent on performance improvements for IE11, where asm.js runs quite slow. Decryption is run in parallel on 4 workers in that browser, giving a massive speed-up and added responsiveness (the UI would freeze for 7 seconds when opening a room prior to this). There is still some polishing to do on sharing room keys, which I will get to next week, but all in all, it should work well. Next week I also want to get started on supporting key backup, so you can also read your encrypted history from before you logged in.</p>

<h3 id="maunium-sticker-picker">Maunium sticker picker</h3>
<p>This isn't strictly a client, but it's in the clients section.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting stuff into the spec or even implemented in Elements is very slow, so while we wait for proper native sticker packs and pickers (i.e. not in an iframe/webview), I decided to make a better sticker picker widget: <a href="https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker">https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker</a></p>
<p>The goal is to be as fast and simple as possible. The picker and sticker packs are just some static files that can be served anywhere (no compilation required). It doesn't require self-hosting anything except said static files, and it has been confirmed to work on all three Elements.</p>
<p>There's a Telegram import script that's used to reupload stickers to Matrix and generate the static sticker pack files that the picker widget uses. It's technically also possible to make the sticker pack files yourself, but there's no easy way to do that yet.</p>
<p>Due to the simplicity of the picker there's no authentication, which also means everyone sees the same sticker packs. One way to get around that limitation is to have a unique URL for each user. I'll probably write a bot to manage copies of the picker for multiple users in the future.</p>
<p>Other future improvements include remembering frequently used stickers (surprisingly, all three Elements keep localStorage for widgets), importing Telegram animated stickers and searching for stickers by emoji/name</p>
</blockquote>
<p>later more words appeared from Tulir:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the initial announcement, my sticker picker has received some more features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a slider to configure the number of stickers shown per row</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequently used stickers now show up at the top</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imported all the packs from Scalar (the default integration manager)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Erik has made an initial, naive implementation of a sharded Event Persister worker - the non-sharded version currently being one of the biggest bottlenecks on matrix.org right now. It still needs a bit of polish to be production ready, and Sytest will need some updating to support testing it, but otherwise progress is looking good!</p>
<p>Brendan is polishing his unread counts implementations, while Rich is writing up the push rules replacement tech in an MSC. Rich has also been optimizing the device code in Synapse to both simplify the code, as well as cut down on unnecessary device data being sent over federation.</p>
<p>Patrick has finished converting Synapse's database code to be fully async! This has the benefit of making profiling the matrix.org Synapse process much more sane, and we're already starting to find a few little places where Synapse is burning CPU unnecessarily! Now, Synapse won't be fully async'd until Twisted itself is, and we drop support for older Twisted versions that aren't, which is not <em>soon</em>. However the majority of the code that developers touch and that is executed being async has massive benefits either way üôÇ</p>
<p>Andrew has been working on having a confirmation pop up after users click the link in their email, to help prevent phishing scams. He's also trying to finally make Synapse spec-compliant in accepting identifier dictionaries during user-interactive authentication.</p>
<p>Olivier has been continuing to help Synapse recover missed messages better after it has been offline for an extended period of time, as well as various fixes to push. </p>

<p>Introducing a new bridge to the family, tomsg-matrix!</p>
<p>A friend of mine preferred using <a href="https://git.tomsmeding.com/tomsg/">his own chat protocol</a>, but having a chat protocol is useless without having people to talk to. Since I prefer using Matrix I thought it would be a fun exercise to try and create a bridge using Rust.</p>
<p>The bridge uses the newly created (still very WIP) <a href="https://github.com/lieuwex/matrix-appservice-rs">matrix-appservice-rs</a>. A Rust library that builds on top of the Ruma suite, the goal is for it to be comparable to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-node">matrix-appservice-node</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>.</p>
<p>The code for tomsg-matrix is <a href="https://github.com/lieuwex/tomsg-matrix">open source</a>, but be prepared, I hastily pushed it to GitHub without cleaning it up.</p>
<p>Come chat to us over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#tomsg:lieuwe.xyz">#tomsg:lieuwe.xyz</a>, hoping that it doesn't break. :P</p>

<p>I create  service for sending corporate information: some service (for example zabbix) can send message to this service (over http-api) and service will create room (if needed), invite user and send message to this room. Service will change status of message in his database to <code>readed</code> when user will read this message. Also service can send any changes statuses of this message by callback url. Editing old messages also supported: for example zabbix can send UID problem to this service and it is will edit old &quot;problem message&quot; to &quot;problem resolved&quot;.</p>

<p>Lurkki added an emoji completer to the message area! This was a super requested feature and it is pretty awesome, that someone picked this up and implemented it! This means you can finally write <code>:fire:</code> and have it expand to üî•! Seems like this will also lead to a few more improvements to our other completers down the line (user, room, etc completions), so thank you very much Lurkki!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've been mostly reviewing PRs this week (and trying to get some other work in line, like MSCs, synapse stuff, etc). With this hopefully Chethans work on cross-signing will be merged soon, which will give us most of the building blocks to have cross-signing in Nheko (his work is basically only missing Secure Secret Storage and Sharing). We hope to fix the few remaining build issues in the next week or so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the side I have been cleaning some UI stuff to simplify our room settings dialog and allow advanced users to hide/show certain event types in the timeline. This will probably take a bit more time to be finished though.</p>
