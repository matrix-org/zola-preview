This week you're stuck with me, but I'm chatting to Ryan, who works on Riot web. Having previously worked at Mozilla, Ryan has a LOT of interesting things to say about Firefox, the browser market, the importance of decentralisation, Matrix being GREAT, and more.

<h2 id="construct">Construct</h2>
<blockquote>Lots of progress this week. I'd like to give a special thanks to Yan Minari for another great week of testing, bugfixes and feature requests.
<ul>
 	<li>We implemented features related to room directory lists, reporting content, ignoring users, VoIP turnServer, prev_content in state events.</li>
 	<li>Improving SSL: allowing configurable lists of ciphers, and sending/receiving SNI.</li>
 	<li>At the lower level: adding support for Linux AIO features that are present in newer kernels, giving a nice performance boost.</li>

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a> announced <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/android">Pattle</a>, a Matrix client for Android:
<blockquote>Hey all, I've been working on my Matrix Android app, Pattle! The goal of Pattle is to be an easy to use app for Matrix, with it's design inspired by popular apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram. <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/android">Development happens here</a>, and contributions are encouraged! The app is not currently suited for daily use, but some functionality is there, such as registering, logging in and viewing chats.
Currently it's an Android only app using the official Matrix Android SDK, but the plan is to support iOS and web too, in the future.
There's also a sort of <a href="https://docs.pattle.im/design/philosophy/">design document</a> available, stating how Pattle differs from standard Matrix apps and what it's goals are. The intent of the design document is to make development easier later on for other platforms</blockquote>

Translators are still strongly encouraged to push forward - due to all the features and fixes, there are many untranslated strings across the board! Also, some bugfixes are <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion/projects/2#column-4040192">still in order</a> before we can call the release RC, and some of them are really easy - so if you'd like to contribute, it's a great time to start!</blockquote>

<a href="https://github.com/ananace/">Ananace</a> is returning his attention to the <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Matrix Ruby SDK</a>:
<blockquote>I just realized that I haven't had lazy loading activated by default in the Ruby SDK, despite having had lazy loading code in place since ages back, so now that's going to be the default value going forward.</blockquote>
Further:
<blockquote>I started hacking - just a couple of hours or so ago - on a notification sender for The Foreman, a server orchestration system. So it can forward notifications to Matrix. <a href="https://github.com/ananace/foreman_notification_send">https://github.com/ananace/foreman_notification_send</a></blockquote>
If you're using, or considering using, The Foreman for orchestration this may be very useful.

From Neil of the Synapse-team
<blockquote>Folks, in the run up to Synapse 1.0, if you are running your own homeserver now would be an excellent time to check that your TLS certificates are up to date. Point your server name at <a href="/federationtester/">https://matrix.org/federationtester/</a> and if there are errors check our handy FAQ on how to fix it. If you do not have valid TLS certificates Synapse 1.0 will refuse to federate with you.<br /><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">benpa</a> has put together a federation checker to quantify how many homeservers are 1.0 ready - <a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com">https://www.arewereadyyet.com/</a> - It currently stands at 50.5% let's try and get that to 60% over the weekend.<br /><br />Aside from all that, the team have been working on preparing for Synapse 1.0, you can <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">track our progress here</a>.

<h2 id="jeonserverandrelatedprojectupdates">JeonServer and related project updates</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> has been working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">Jeon</a> - Java interfaces to the various <a href="/docs/spec">Matrix APIs</a> - and is now getting ready to start work on a homeserver. He was previously asking for a name for this project, but might now have settled on "<strong>JeonServer</strong>".
<blockquote>First Release Candidate of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">Jeon</a> Project with upcoming Client-Server API 0.5, Server-Server API 0.1.1, Application API 0.1, Identity API 0.2 and Push API 0.1.
Also the RC of the <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk">jmsdk</a> has been prepared with Java Matrix Client for Client-Server API 0.5.
Changes in the C2S: Added the <code>m.push_rules</code> event, removed presence list methods and other minor fixes.
Added S2S API of the 0.1.1 version.
I prepared a very simple page <a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/">https://ma1uta.github.io/</a> with links to the swagger schemas (json and yaml) for all Matrix API which generated from the Jeon code.</blockquote>

<h2 id="constructupdates">Construct updates</h2>
<blockquote>There's a lot of progress, a few endpoints and features have been implemented this week such as Room Tags and all of the spec features for /createRoom. Most of the progress has been with testing and bugfixes thanks to Yan Minari, and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> and mujx.
We've fixed several interactions with synapse such as invite accept/deny and synapse's ability to join and leave construct created rooms without any issues.
Lastly and most important, we've generated an official issues list thanks again to our star tester Yan Minari available here <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/issues">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/issues</a></blockquote>

<h2 id="opensapsopenslackapiserver">OpenSAPS: Open Slack API Server</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@pztrn:pztrn.name">pztrn</a> has created a new mechanism for relaying apps that use Slack webhooks into Matrix:
<blockquote>
<p>To everyone who wonders how to connect his application to Matrix (at least for notifications of some kind) - use <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">OpenSAPS</a>! It just reached v0.1.0. <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">OpenSAPS</a> stands for Open Slack API Server and able to retransmit messages from applications (like Gitlab or everything that can send data to Slack) to somewhere else. Right now these &quot;somewhere else&quot; is a Telegram (with HTTP proxy support) and Matrix! Written in Golang to ensure minimal memory footprint. Take a look at <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps</a> Tested with Gitlab and Gitea but should work with almost any service. Join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opensaps:pztrn.name">#opensaps:pztrn.name</a> to talk with developers or get help. BTW, there is OpenSAPS instance in our room that transmits everything from gitlab.com into room! (almost) immediately after 0.1.0 comes <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps/tags/v0.1.1">0.1.1</a>, with fixed URLs parsing and fixed inability to login into servers which use .well-known for delegation. It should work [with other webhooks]. If something strange happens there is also a possibility to write own parser to make everything work :)‚ Tested with Gitlab and Gitea ATM. Share application names that work, I'll start to make a list of them. :D</p>

<hr />
<p>Matrix is:</p>
<blockquote>an open standard for <em>interoperable</em>, <em>decentralised</em>, <em>real-time communication</em>.</blockquote>
In this article we'll benefit from all three of these attributes:
<ul>
 	<li><em>interoperable:</em> we'll see how Matrix can be made to interact with WhatsApp</li>
 	<li><em>decentralised</em>: you can perform this on your own server while still enjoying the benefits of being connected to the rest of the Matrix federation</li>
 	<li><em>real-time communication</em>: we'll see how to send and receive messages in real-time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installyourhomeserverandinstallmautrixwhatsappthewhatsappbridge">Install your homeserver and install mautrix-whatsapp, the WhatsApp bridge</h2>
Firstly, you need to have a Matrix homeserver installed. If you don't currently have one, take a look at the instructions at <a href="/docs/guides/installing-synapse">Installing Synapse</a>, and also in the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse README</a>.
<p>Next, install <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> by following the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp/wiki">mautrix-whatsapp/wiki</a>.</p>
<p>If you are starting from scratch, I suggest you take a look at <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>, as this project will enable you to deploy Synapse, <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> and other components easily.</p>
<p>For example, if you have an existing deployment using <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>, you can add <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> simply by adding the following line to your configuration file:</p>
<pre><code class="yaml language-yaml">matrix_mautrix_whatsapp_enabled: true
</code></pre>
<p>... and re-running the setup:</p>
<pre><code class="unix language-unix">ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all
</code></pre>
<p>Either way, you will soon have a functioning Matrix Synapse homeserver and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> installed with it. Next, we will set up an Android VM.</p>
<h2 id="setupanandroidvm">Set up an Android VM</h2>
The best way to run an Android Virtual Machine is to use the Android Studio tools from Google. First, <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/install">install Android Studio</a>, making sure to follow the post-install steps, as they will install additional tools we need, including AVD Manager.
<p>Once installed, run AVD manager by choosing <code>Tools -&gt; AVD Manager</code> from the menu.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to create a new virtual machine, in this example I have a Nexus 5X running Android 9, but almost any configuration is fine here. Make sure that you give the device access to the Play Store.</p>
<img src="/docs/img/avd.png" alt="" />
<h2 id="installwhatsappandsignin">Install WhatsApp and sign-in</h2>
Launch the Virtual Device, the open the Play Store and sign in. Now use the Play Store to install WhatsApp on the Virtual Device.
<p>You will be asked to verify your phone number, use your number on another device to complete this step.</p>
<center>
<img src="/docs/img/nexus5.png" /></center>
<h2 id="setupmautrixwhatsappbridge">Setup mautrix-whatsapp bridge</h2>
Now that you have WhatsApp working in a VM, and Matrix working on your server, it's time to bridge them together!
<p>Per the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp/wiki">mautrix-whatsapp/wiki</a>, you must start a new chat with <strong>@whatsappbot:<em>&lt;yourdomain</em>&gt;</strong>. Type <code>login</code> to begin the authentication process.</p>
<p>mautrix-whatsapp operates by using the WhatsApp Web feature of WhatsApp - which means it uses a QR code that you must now scan on the device running WhatsApp - which in your case is the AVD. In order to scan the presented QR code, set your AVD camera to passthrough the camera device on your host machine - see the images below.</p>
<img src="/docs/img/camera1.png" alt="" />
<img src="/docs/img/camera2.png" alt="" />
<p>Once this is complete, you can type <code>sync</code>, to start bridging contacts, and <code>sync --create</code> to automatically create room invites.</p>
<p>And that's it! You may need to take a little time to watch the sync happen, particularly if you have a very large number of chats on the WhatsApp side, but there is no further configuration needed.</p>

<blockquote>Master branch of <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> can now store access token in your secure storage/keychain, better integrating into frameworks of GNOME and KDE, as well as macOS and Windows.<br />Also, you can see the room version and upgrade rooms in Quaternion (just like Matthew said on FOSDEM ;) ) - this feature is enabled by <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a>, so other clients are welcome to support room versions/upgrades too!<br /><br />All this is within the work on the upcoming release of libQMatrixClient 0.5 and Quaternion 0.0.9.4 - stay tuned!</blockquote><br />Oh we will. <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a> support for these new features when?<br /><h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2><br />Neil:<br /><blockquote>With all the interest generated through Riot 1.0 we've seen a surge of new and returning users on matrix.org. So we've spent much of the week investing in stability and performance. We'll ship a new point release (0.99.2) next week.<br />Once again a <strong>big flashing advert</strong> that Synapse admins should no longer be using self-signed certificates for their federation API. <strong>Synapse 1.0 is scheduled in early March and will not accept self signed certs</strong> - so servers that do not update will lose the ability to federate with 1.0 servers. Updating your certs is straight forward, see our guide <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">and FAQ</a> for more info.</blockquote><br /><h2 id="matrixrubysdk">Matrix Ruby SDK</h2><br />Ananace has continued his work on <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby Matrix SDK</a>:<br /><blockquote>Just tagged and pushed a new version (0.0.4) of the Ruby SDK, since I've completely forgotten to do that for a while now.</blockquote><br />What's new?<br /><blockquote>A whole bunch of small stuff I did, mostly just additional exposed methods and parameters, and some fixed issues as well. I did add support for HS URL discovery using both SRV and .well-known though, which I think is probably the largest new feature.</blockquote><br />As if all this wasn't enough, a room on Matrix!<br /><blockquote>Created a discussion room for the Ruby SDK - since it seems like there are now people who have actually used it apart from me; <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruby-matrix-sdk:kittenface.studio">#ruby-matrix-sdk:kittenface.studio</a></blockquote>

A project rarely seen has received a lot of attention this week!
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has been working on federation workers:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>Clean up c++ code</li>
 	<li>Make the c++ code less heavy, we should focus on speed</li>
 	<li>Offload js code to direct qml binding, with this i mean instead of having ablock if-else code that modifies qml object that runs on component load, we do this directly in qml: see 0a800fc and https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriksblob/0a800fcdc0af4fa2e08526dbff88e06bcb591779/uMatriks/componentsChatItem.qml as an example for a cleaner code</li>
 	<li>Make all ui depended calls async, we should NEVER block ui</li>
 	<li>Offload heavy js logic to c++</li>
 	<li>Cleaner UI, with less crust</li>
 	<li>Async everything</li>
 	<li>Merge our WIP call support</li>
 	<li>Finish impl of call support (maybe move to a standalone webrtc module)</li>
 	<li>Slowly start moving to QQC2</li>

We <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/the-big-1-0-68fa7c6050be">linked to the announcement last week</a>, and have been using it for even longer, but somehow I missed a great labs feature that shipped with Riot 1.0: "room breadcrumbs", which you can enable from the Labs page of Riot settings. This gives you a series of quick links with the history of rooms you were most recently in. So if you're like me, clicking between rooms all day, you can get where you're going a little faster.
<h2 id="mautrixwhatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</h2>
There is no big news about mautrix-whatsapp this week, other than that I installed it on my own server and found that it works really <em>really</em> well. I'd love to switch to this as a main interface for my less-decentralised friends, but like others, I've been stung by <a href="https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp/issues/98">this issue in an upstream project</a>. If there are go-fans reading (and I know there are), I wonder if it's an issue which can be fixed?

All good things must come to an end - and here we are!
<p>Matrix is getting a lot of attention recently (has it been on the front page of HN every day this week? I remember that I used to be excited seeing that happen), and seeing a lot of growth as well.</p>

As you may have seen, Matrix Live this week features Neil and Matthew <a href="/blog/2019/02/15/publishing-the-backend-roadmap/">discussing the newly announced backend roadmap</a>.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LfyQ6cNGbLk" width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p>We also have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.1.1">Synapse v0.99.1.1</a> available, as the race to Synapse v1.0 gets closer and closer and closer!</p>
<p>Brendan also said, regarding low-bandwidth:</p>
<blockquote>Some of the week has been spent finalising the components used in <a href="https://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/matrix.webm">the low-bandwidth demo we did at FOSDEM</a>. This required polishing some internal developments, which are now almost ready to be published to the wide world! This should happen in the next few days so stay tuned :)</blockquote>
<h2 id="riot100andhotfix101">Riot 1.0.0, and hotfix 1.0.1</h2>

<h2 id="matrixarchivekeyring">matrix-archive-keyring</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been working on new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>:
<blockquote>I've paused porting Synapse to OpenBSD this week, while I attempt to both fix and <em>revert</em> some security issues caused by <code>sudo apt-key add</code> for Matrix.org and Riot.im packages for Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution users.<br /><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4609">matrix-org/synapse PR #4609</a> was my first attempt to fix the problem, however I fell short this time in ease-of-use and my implementation had other issues. (Read: The <code>repo-key.asc</code> downloaded from Matrix.org Debian repository should go to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>, and must not be added by <code>apt-key add</code> or added to <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d</code> directly. I attempted the latter with my first PR; but that would've allowed the Matrix.org signing key to also be used to verify packages from Debian's main repositories. Yikes!)<br />As my second attempt, I'm now creating a new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>. There's multiple things this package intends to do:
</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>A post-install script to remove any previously added Matrix.org package signing keys from <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg</code>. (This is the file <code>apt-key add</code> most commonly uses, and the most commonly found bad advice on the Internet.)</li>
 	<li>Convert <code>repo-key.asc</code> to a de-armorized <code>.gpg</code> format, understood better by apt(8). (Essentially, <code>gpg --dearmor</code>.)</li>
 	<li>Install the converted <code>.gpg</code> key to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>.</li>
 	<li>Make sure <code>apt(8)</code> uses the newly added key for Matrix.org repository only?</li>
 	<li>Deliver any updates to <code>repo-key.asc</code> directly to you via <code>apt upgrade</code>. Your operating system might then also do it automatically for you if <code>unattended-upgrades(8)</code> is installed on your system. ?</li>
 	<li>Make sure everything goes away when this keyring package is uninstalled. No more <code>sudo sh -c 'apt-key del C35EB17E1EAE708E6603A9B3AD0592FE47F0DF61; rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> to get rid of the repository.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
I have one more interesting enhancement to disclose.<br />We can ask you with <code>debconf</code> if you want to install <code>deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian $(lsb_release -cs) main</code> to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> while you're installing the new keyring with <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code>.<br />You'll most likely notice the difference in install instructions, as a result of this package. Before and after:</blockquote>
<pre><code># Before
sudo apt install -y lsb-release curl apt-transport-https
echo "deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian `lsb_release -cs` main" |
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list
curl "https://matrix.org/packages/debian/repo-key.asc" |
    sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
<pre><code># After
sudo apt install matrix-archive-keyring
sudo sh -c 'apt update &amp;&amp; apt install matrix-synapse-py3

<blockquote>If you are a Debian or Ubuntu user and Synapse homeserver operator using Matrix.org repositories, I'll be towncrying when this package becomes available as much as I can. All you should need to do then is <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code> and it should patch the security holes in your operating system if you've formerly installed packages from Matrix.org or Riot.im! (The command may change a bit, because next Debian operating system release "Buster" has entered soft-freeze just today (2019-02-12) and not accepting new packages into that release.)<br />PS: I'm at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#debian-matrix:matrix.org">#debian-matrix:matrix.org</a>, please come talk to us if Debian packaging interests you!</blockquote>
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For the eager early testers not afraid of building from source, <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code> version <code>2015.12.09+debian0.10</code> is available for early testing (attached).
<pre><code># Something like this!
sudo apt install devscripts
tar -xfvJ matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10.tar.xz
cd matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10

</code></pre>
Please follow <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=922155">Debian Bug#922155</a> for updates. Debian binary packages will be available later sometime this/next week from Debian's <code>unstable</code> distribution (<code>contrib</code>), if all goes well and there are no remaining Debian policy violations or serious bugs.

With the release of <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.0.html">Server to Server Spec r0.1</a>, Synapse 0.99.0 is shipping now.
<blockquote>Synapse 1.0.0 will be compliant with r0.1 and the goal of Synapse 0.99.0 is to act as a stepping stone to Synapse 1.0. Synapse 0.99.0 supports the r0.1 release of the server to server specification, but is compatible with both the legacy Matrix federation behaviour (pre-r0.1) as well as post-r0.1 behaviour, in order to allow for a smooth upgrade across the federation.<br />It is critical that all admins upgrade to 0.99.0 and configure a valid TLS certificate. Admins will have 1 month to do so, after which 1.0.0 will be released and those servers without a valid certificate will no longer be able to federate with &gt;= 1.0.0 servers.</blockquote><br /><em>Please</em> <a href="/blog/2019/02/05/synapse-0-99-0/">read the announcement post</a> and be sure to come and chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a> if you need help!<br /><h2 id="gsoc2019">GSOC 2019</h2><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> has been helping admin this year's GSOC application:<br /><blockquote>Matrix.org has applied to be a GSOC (Google Summer of Code) mentoring organisation.

<blockquote>After seeing a demo at FOSDEM of <a href="https://github.com/dinsic-pim/tchap-android">Tchap</a>, the app the French government uses to access their Matrix network, I decided to try to get it to work as a general-purpose Matrix client. The app uses email and password to log in, and infers the homeserver address from the homeserver name. So to get it to work, I had to patch the app and write a little proxy so it gets the proper homeserver (and optionally identity server) from an email address.<br />A patched version of Tchap can be found at <a href="https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android">https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android</a>, code for the proxy at <a href="https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-proxy">https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-proxy</a>.

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been making progress on a project to get Synapse running on OpenBSD, and to that end has been preparing and improving the dependencies that we take for granted on Linux. To summarise the current status:
<blockquote>This week I've been porting Synapse's dependencies to OpenBSD <code>-current</code> distribution. There is no port yet for Synapse in OpenBSD.
Ports missing from OpenBSD <code>6.4</code> for Synapse's dependencies were:</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li><code>py-frozendict</code>: ok'd, waiting…</li>
 	<li><code>py-unpaddedbase64</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-canonicaljson</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-signedjson</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-treq</code>: WIP (this will take a while, lots of dependencies)</li>
 	<li><code>py-daemonize</code>: ok'd, waiting…</li>
 	<li><code>py-pymacaroons</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-phonenumbers</code>: <code>8.10.4</code> done, waiting to be imported…</li>
 	<li><code>py-prometheus_client</code> done, needs to be tested/imported…</li>
 	<li><code>coturn</code>: TBD, maybe?</li>
</ul>
waiting = usually waiting for an OpenBSD developer to "ok" and import
<blockquote>Of those, <code>py-phonenumbers</code> was added to OpenBSD<br /><code>-snapshots</code> (<code>-current</code>) distribution. <code>py-phonenumbers</code> (?) and <code>py-service_identity</code> received updates to ports. <code>py-prometheus_client</code>, <code>py-daemonize</code> and <code>py-frozendict</code> are ported ready and waiting to be given "ok" at OpenBSD's <code>ports@</code> mailing list.<br />There is <a href="https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip/tree/master/net/synapse">an unofficial up-to-date Synapse port exists at GitHub</a> maintained by someone else, which I've not yet tested. (At glance, I can take a guess the <code>devel/tz</code> port may not be required.)<br />(<code>coturn</code> doesn't have a port yet, may have to look at it later.)</blockquote>

<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
Neil and the team have been working frantically on getting a new Synapse release out this week:
<blockquote>This week has been all about gearing up for v0.99.0 and if you would like to help us test it, our latest release candidate lives <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.0rc4">here</a><br />We've taken the decision to bump up to v0.99.0 because it is very much a precursor to v1.0. When v1.0 lands it will contain a breaking change that means all homeservers will need a valid certificate for their server to server endpoint, self signing will no longer be possible.<br />v0.99.0 contains support to help you do this, but once it lands all admins will need to upgrade, failure to do so will mean losing the ability to federate with &gt; v1.0 servers.<br />We'll have detailed docs ready to go alongside the full v0.99.0 release, and we plan to leave at least 1 month between v0.99.0 and v1.0, but for now please be aware that the change is coming.<br />Huge thanks to Rich, Erik, Hawkowl and Anoa for all their work in getting us to rc stage.</blockquote>

 	<li>Since <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1711">MSC1711</a> is a breaking change, we will initially ship our next release (v0.35.0) with ACME support to make it easy to provision and renew certificates. The give everyone a month to upgrade and install a cert before we ship Synapse v1.0 which will require that servers have certificates in order to federate. Don't worry, there will be plenty of details on the steps necessary for admins when v0.35.0 lands - watch this space.</li>

<ul>
 	<li>The bridge could not create new Matrix rooms on versions of Synapse after a certain change, because it did not reserve the room alias prefix it used. That's been fixed, but anyone currently running matrix-puppet-slack will need to edit their slack_registration.yaml and restart Synapse. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack/releases/tag/1.10.1">the Release</a> for instructions on doing so.</li>
 	<li>The bridge will no longer send "Edit: " events when Slack sends it a "message_changed" message, if the message text has not actually changed (Slack sends these events for URL previews, for example, but this just causes duplicate bridged messages). This fix has been a long time coming.</li>

<a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/cl-matrix">cl-matrix</a> is a WIP client library written in common lisp, most of the API endpoints have been covered using macros that allow you to copy straight from the spec, here is an example using the send event endpoint:
<pre><code class="lisp language-lisp">(define-matrix-endpoint room-send-event (:put)
  ("rooms" room-id "send" event-type txn-id))
</code></pre>
this will expand into a function with the signature:
<pre><code class="lisp language-lisp">(PUT-ROOM-SEND-EVENT AUTHENTICATION ROOM-ID EVENT-TYPE TXN-ID CONTENT &amp;KEY PARAMETERS)
</code></pre>
it also has some basic events defined using <a href="http://shinmera.github.io/deeds/">deeds</a> that can be issued using the sync endpoint.</blockquote>

This week I chatted with Jason Robinson about all things decentralisation, especially his projects <a href="https://github.com/jaywink/socialhome">socialhome</a>, <a href="https://the-federation.info/">the-federation.info</a>, and <a href="https://feneas.org">feneas.org</a>. Jason has been interested in decentralisation for many years, and had a lot to say about how we can look forward to a more decentralised Internet.

<blockquote>It's a New Year and there have been a lot of improvements to the <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> playbook:
<ul>
 	<li>there's now support for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/docs/importing-postgres.md">importing an existing Postgres database</a>, which should make it easier for people with another setup to migrate over.</li>

 	<li>the playbook now uses a much better (20x smaller, faster) riot-web Docker image (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/avhost/docker-matrix-riot/">avhost/docker-matrix-riot</a> -&gt; <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bubuntux/riot-web/">bubuntux/riot-web</a>). At least until <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/7771">vector-im/riot-web#7771</a> gets merged and official images become available.</li>

 	<li>we now utilize <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/blob/4185b644b7b69af36bb1fdc81976a36590b1b97f/docs/features/directory.md">mxisd's User Directory Search feature</a> to augment the results coming from Synapse</li>

<blockquote>libQMatrixClient 0.4.2 has been released, fixing a security issue (the library could be tricked into altering the local room state by fake state events - those without state_key). The master branch of the library is updated as well - it is strongly recommended to update to either 0.4.2 or master, depending on which branch you live on.</blockquote><br /><blockquote>For those who want to help testing Quaternion or just can't wait to the next release, we now have CI builds collected at bintray: <a href="https://bintray.com/qmatrixclient/ci/Quaternion">https://bintray.com/qmatrixclient/ci/Quaternion</a>.

</h3><br /><blockquote>We are still working on the key backup screens. The last bit on the SDK side, the passphrase support, has been implemented this week.
<br /><br />Reskin is almost done. It just needs some small adjustments. We will release a beta soon so that we can gather users feedback.
<br /><br />This week, we have also fixed small but boring UX issues in Riot and we will continue to do so up to the end of the month and FOSDEM!
</blockquote><br /><h3>Riot Android
</h3><br /><blockquote>Reskin is almost done too and available on develop builds.
<br /><br />Benoit has started to implement the key backup passphrase management in the SDK. Valere is still improving push notifications at the code level but also at the display level.

Migration is performed by uploading an exported copy of an existing HipChat workspace so that the tool can automatically re-create all of the users and rooms (including messages and attachments) on your new Matrix homeserver. Once the migration is complete all of the migrated users will be emailed with login instructions, so that they can seamlessly continue chatting where they left off in HipChat. If your organisation (or if you know of an organisation that) has not yet decided what to do when Stride &amp; HipChat is discontinued next month, come and try Modular!

                <p>Hi all, Ben here.</p>
<p>Since joining the core team as Developer Advocate last year it's been quite a ride. One of the best things about the job is getting the chance to talk to so many people about their projects and what they would like to see happen in the matrix ecosystem. With so much going on, I just want to say thanks to everyone who has been so welcoming to me and share some of my personal highlights, as I recall them, from 2018!</p>
<h2 id="clients">Clients</h2>
<strong><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a></strong> was featured in the very first TWIM, announcing v1.26. Since then, the team have hosted two IRL hackfest events (Strasbourg and Seville - where to next, Stockholm? Salisbury?), engaged two GSOC students and continued to push out releases. At this point, Fractal is a full-featured Matrix client for GNOME.
<p>Matrique became <strong><a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a></strong>, and is generally awesome. Apparently the name &quot;Matrique&quot; was chosen because it sounds French, but those who speak the language well revealed that this name was not ideal! The project was re-named &quot;Spectral&quot;, and is going strong. I really appreciate the multi-user facility! It's a great looking client, and runs great on macOS too (protip: get more attention from <code>/me</code> by providing a macOS build…)</p>
<p>On which subject, <strong><a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass">Seaglass</a></strong> is a native macOS client. First announced in June, this client supports E2EE rooms (via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">matrix-ios-sdk</a>), and is also available on homebrew.</p>
<p>Ubuntu Touch has the most Matrix clients per-user of any platform. UT epitomises the resilience and collaborative spirit of Open Source. It's a true community maintenance effort, and is as friendly a community as you might meet. <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a> came first, but it's <strong><a href="https://github.com/ChristianPauly/fluffychat">FluffyChat</a></strong> that prompted me to install it on my battered old OnePlus One. FluffyChat is now extremely full-featured, with E2EE support being actively discussed.</p>
<p>In the command line, <strong><a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a></strong> appeared and quickly became a competent client, but in terms of sheer enthusiasm and momentum, I must give commendation to <strong><a href="https://github.com/jgkamat/matrix-client-el">matrix-client.el</a></strong>, a newly revived mode for Emacs which turns your editor/OS into a great Matrix Client. I enjoyed using it enough that it began to change my mind about using emacs. Laptops have more than 8mb memory these days anyway.</p>
<h2 id="acultureofbots">A culture of bots</h2>
There is a tendency in the community to build a bot for everything and anything. This has reached the point where there are multiple flairs available depending on what bots you like to make (silly vs serious.)
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> was perhaps the first person I saw to get the obsession, creating</p>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-monitor-bot">matrix-monitor-bot</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-trello-bot">matrix-trello-bot</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-alias-bot">matrix-alias-bot</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-hashtag-bot">hashtag bot</a> (perhaps the most absurd!)</li>
</ul>
and more…
<p>Cadair even made <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/skill-twim">twimbot</a>, designed to make it easier to consume and produce <a href="/twim">This Week in Matrix</a> itself.</p>
<p>In June <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> started <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a>, a plugin-based bot system built in Python, which now also has a management UI.</p>
<h2 id="allbridgesleadtomatrix">All bridges lead to Matrix</h2>
Or from Matrix, depending on which way you want to send the message.
<p>Around May, I started to notice another obsession brewing in the community. Bridging is a core part of the Matrix mission, but it was around this time I started seeing it in the wild.</p>
<p>Summer 2018 <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> began working in the Matrix core team, and was <em>hugely</em> productive in maintaining and developing the bridge infrastructure for matrix.org. IRC bridging is far more stable and reliable now than it was a year ago. And yet there are still more bridges - too many to list, so I'm picking the ones I've used and enjoyed.</p>
<p>Discord is bridged by <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</a>, handled by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>, aided and abetted by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> but with a new maintainer this year, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a>. This bridge is now feature-rich and sits at v0.3.1.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>'s suite of bridges including <strong><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a></strong> are extremely stable and useful - big thank you to <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> for maintaining <a href="https://t2bot.io/">t2bot.io</a> and hosting the Telegram bridge too.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/tijder/SmsMatrix">SMSMatrix</a></strong>, a phone-hosted bridge is simple and works great for SMS bridging.</p>
<h2 id="librariessdksframeworks">Libraries, SDKs, Frameworks</h2>
I enjoyed using <strong><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a></strong> for building <a href="https://github.com/benparsons/elizabot">elizabot</a> (more coverage needed for that!), and the SDK recently received support for application services.
<p>In April, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> announced v0.2 of <strong><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libqmatrixclient</a></strong> describing it as “the first one more or less functional and stable&quot; - confidence! This library now powers both Quaternion and Spectral. QMatrixClient has continued to get updates, plus features including lazy loading and VoIP signalling.</p>
<p>There are a few libs I want to pay more attention to this year, starting with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>'s <strong><a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a></strong> now that it has been rewritten in Python. I'm also excited to see <strong><a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk">jmsdk</a></strong>, part of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a>'s broader ecosystem of Matrix tooling - a Java-based SDK.</p>
<h2 id="rumaresurrection">Ruma Resurrection</h2>
Until around June, <strong>Ruma</strong> was receiving regular updates. There was a pause as the team waited for Rust async/await to land, and also to get some stability in the Matrix Spec. Still waiting on Rust, but now that the Matrix Spec is stabilising, Ruma is showing signs of life too. I have also been watching other homeserver projects begin to restart, which makes for a great start to 2019.
<h2 id="dsntravellerbyflorian">DSN Traveller by Florian</h2>
Matrix was featured as part of a Master's thesis by Florian Jacob.
<blockquote><a href="https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/">DSN Traveller</a> tries to get a rough overview of how the Matrix network is structured today. It records how many rooms it finds, how many users and servers take part in those rooms, and how they relate to each other, meaning how many users a server has and of how many rooms it is part of.</blockquote>
Florian's thesis was handed in last August. <a href="https://github.com/florianjacob/dsn-traveller">Source code is available</a>.
<blockquote>All details at <a href="https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/">https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/</a>, room at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dsn-traveller:dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu">#dsn-traveller:dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu</a>.</blockquote>
<h2 id="stillmore">Still more</h2>
Synapse dominates the homeserver space right now, so if you want to host your own homeserver today it's the obvious choice. Too great a variety of installation guides was doing more harm than good, so <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@natrius:matrix.org">Stefan</a> took the initiative to create a <strong>definitive community-driven Synapse installation guide</strong>, including a room to discuss and improve the text. Find the <a href="/docs/guides/installing-synapse">guide linked from here</a>, and chat about the guide in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/synapseguide:matrix.org">#synapseguide:matrix.org</a>.
<p>I want to use Matrix, and I want to host my own homeserver. As such, <strong><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a></strong> is a project I absolutely love. It uses Synapse docker images from the Matrix core team, and combines them with Ansible playbooks written and organised by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a>. It lets you quickly deploy everything needed for a Synapse homeserver, and it's simple enough that even I can use it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">Construct</a></strong>, a homeserver implementation in C++ began successfully federating with Matrix, work progressed <a href="/blog/2018/05/18/this-week-in-matrix-2018-05-18/">from around April/May</a>.</p>
<p>Having a <strong><a href="https://shields.io/#/examples/chat">Matrix-native mode for shields.io</a></strong> (those counter/indicator images you often see at the top of repos) seems like something petty at first, but it's actually a great indicator of the importance of Matrix from the outside. Plus, I love seeing the images at the top of different repos. Thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a> for helping this along.</p>
<p>Two students worked on Matrix-related projects during <strong><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a></strong>.</p>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Zil0:matrix.org">Zil0</a> created E2EE bindings for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a></li>
 	<li><a href="@apwhitehat:matrix.org">APwhitehat</a> worked on the federation APIs in Dendrite</li>
</ul>
Something which came in super-helpful for me when testing homeserver installations was <strong><a href="https://neo.lain.haus/fed-tester/">f0x's fed-tester</a></strong>. <a href="https://github.com/f0x52/fed-tester/">Source code available</a> (obv.)
<h2 id="thanksforalltheprojects">Thanks for all the projects</h2>
Thanks for a great 2018. There was so much to learn about, so much to write about, and so many great community members to meet and chat to! If I didn't mention your project, I'm sorry to have been either forgetful or to not be able to include everything.
<p>If you think I've missed something, or if there's a project I should have included rather than another, or even if you just disagree with my choices, let's discuss it in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a>. See you there, and let's all parade ahead to a productive, open, interoperable 2019!</p>
