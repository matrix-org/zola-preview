<h2 id="fosdem-2019">FOSDEM 2019</h2>
<p>FOSDEM happened.</p>
<ul>
 	<li>two Matrix-themed packed-room talks</li>
 	<li>lots of people coming to chat at the stall to say things like "hi" or "I like Matrix" or "what is Matrix? … wow that sounds amazing, how can I get involved?"</li>
 	<li>1000s of stickers decentralised out of my bag onto people's laptops</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="synapse-0-99-0">Synapse 0.99.0</h2>
<p>With the release of <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.0.html">Server to Server Spec r0.1</a>, Synapse 0.99.0 is shipping now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synapse 1.0.0 will be compliant with r0.1 and the goal of Synapse 0.99.0 is to act as a stepping stone to Synapse 1.0. Synapse 0.99.0 supports the r0.1 release of the server to server specification, but is compatible with both the legacy Matrix federation behaviour (pre-r0.1) as well as post-r0.1 behaviour, in order to allow for a smooth upgrade across the federation.<br />It is critical that all admins upgrade to 0.99.0 and configure a valid TLS certificate. Admins will have 1 month to do so, after which 1.0.0 will be released and those servers without a valid certificate will no longer be able to federate with &gt;= 1.0.0 servers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Please</em> <a href="/blog/2019/02/05/synapse-0-99-0/">read the announcement post</a> and be sure to come and chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a> if you need help!</p>

Older versions of python3 won't work. PRs getting python3 &lt; 3.5 working again are welcome.</p>

<h2 id="tchap-android-client">Tchap Android client</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@willem:canarymod.net">Willem</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After seeing a demo at FOSDEM of <a href="https://github.com/dinsic-pim/tchap-android">Tchap</a>, the app the French government uses to access their Matrix network, I decided to try to get it to work as a general-purpose Matrix client. The app uses email and password to log in, and infers the homeserver address from the homeserver name. So to get it to work, I had to patch the app and write a little proxy so it gets the proper homeserver (and optionally identity server) from an email address.<br />A patched version of Tchap can be found at <a href="https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android">https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android</a>, code for the proxy at <a href="https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-proxy">https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-proxy</a>. At the moment it's very crude, and images/files don't work since the virus scan API is unimplemented, but at least it can be used outside the French government. ?</p>

<h2 id="preparing-for-synapse-on-openbsd">Preparing for Synapse on OpenBSD</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been making progress on a project to get Synapse running on OpenBSD, and to that end has been preparing and improving the dependencies that we take for granted on Linux. To summarise the current status:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I've been porting Synapse's dependencies to OpenBSD <code>-current</code> distribution. There is no port yet for Synapse in OpenBSD.
Ports missing from OpenBSD <code>6.4</code> for Synapse's dependencies were:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li><code>py-frozendict</code>: ok'd, waiting…</li>
 	<li><code>py-unpaddedbase64</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-canonicaljson</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-signedjson</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-treq</code>: WIP (this will take a while, lots of dependencies)</li>
 	<li><code>py-daemonize</code>: ok'd, waiting…</li>
 	<li><code>py-pymacaroons</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-phonenumbers</code>: <code>8.10.4</code> done, waiting to be imported…</li>
 	<li><code>py-prometheus_client</code> done, needs to be tested/imported…</li>
 	<li><code>coturn</code>: TBD, maybe?</li>
</ul>
waiting = usually waiting for an OpenBSD developer to "ok" and import
<blockquote>
<p>Of those, <code>py-phonenumbers</code> was added to OpenBSD<br /><code>-snapshots</code> (<code>-current</code>) distribution. <code>py-phonenumbers</code> (?) and <code>py-service_identity</code> received updates to ports. <code>py-prometheus_client</code>, <code>py-daemonize</code> and <code>py-frozendict</code> are ported ready and waiting to be given &quot;ok&quot; at OpenBSD's <code>ports@</code> mailing list.<br />There is <a href="https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip/tree/master/net/synapse">an unofficial up-to-date Synapse port exists at GitHub</a> maintained by someone else, which I've not yet tested. (At glance, I can take a guess the <code>devel/tz</code> port may not be required.)<br />(<code>coturn</code> doesn't have a port yet, may have to look at it later.)</p>

<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Neil and the team have been working frantically on getting a new Synapse release out this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has been all about gearing up for v0.99.0 and if you would like to help us test it, our latest release candidate lives <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.0rc4">here</a><br />We've taken the decision to bump up to v0.99.0 because it is very much a precursor to v1.0. When v1.0 lands it will contain a breaking change that means all homeservers will need a valid certificate for their server to server endpoint, self signing will no longer be possible.<br />v0.99.0 contains support to help you do this, but once it lands all admins will need to upgrade, failure to do so will mean losing the ability to federate with &gt; v1.0 servers.<br />We'll have detailed docs ready to go alongside the full v0.99.0 release, and we plan to leave at least 1 month between v0.99.0 and v1.0, but for now please be aware that the change is coming.<br />Huge thanks to Rich, Erik, Hawkowl and Anoa for all their work in getting us to rc stage.</p>

<p>If you haven't already heard, then I envy that you get to learn about it now: there is a credible new project which forks <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> and seeks to maintain and continue the project.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko-Reborn</a></strong> is a new project headed by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@red_sky:ocean.joedonofry.com">red_sky</a>, who told me:</p>

<p>I'm planning to start work on the component that will scrape blog content from a matrix room. This will most likely involve a dedicated bot that syncs new journal blog events, verifies the blog signature and then writes the blog content to a file on the blog server.</p>
<p>I'll probably ramble about the details of that at some point.</p>

<p>The bridge is being re-written. I excluded the jabber server (still need to setup SRV records) and implementing the xmpp s2s api in the bridge.
Done:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>rfc6120 in s2s part;</li>
 	<li>almost server dialback (XEP-0220);</li>
</ul>
Remaining:
<ul>
 	<li>MUC (XEP-0045);</li>
 	<li>stabilize.</li>
</ul>
New version will allow:
<ul>
 	<li>1:1 conversations between matrix and jabber users;</li>
 	<li>group chats by double-puppet mapping rooms to conferences;</li>
 	<li>additionally xmpp users can join directly to rooms via double-puppet bots.</li>
</ul>
Also I started breaking the bridge to modules. And the next module will be ActivityPub S2S module which allows communicate matrix servers with other fedivers.

 	<li>Since <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1711">MSC1711</a> is a breaking change, we will initially ship our next release (v0.35.0) with ACME support to make it easy to provision and renew certificates. The give everyone a month to upgrade and install a cert before we ship Synapse v1.0 which will require that servers have certificates in order to federate. Don't worry, there will be plenty of details on the steps necessary for admins when v0.35.0 lands - watch this space.</li>

<ul>
 	<li>The bridge could not create new Matrix rooms on versions of Synapse after a certain change, because it did not reserve the room alias prefix it used. That's been fixed, but anyone currently running matrix-puppet-slack will need to edit their slack_registration.yaml and restart Synapse. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack/releases/tag/1.10.1">the Release</a> for instructions on doing so.</li>
 	<li>The bridge will no longer send "Edit: " events when Slack sends it a "message_changed" message, if the message text has not actually changed (Slack sends these events for URL previews, for example, but this just causes duplicate bridged messages). This fix has been a long time coming.</li>

<p>From the notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reconciliation is now much faster, due to the way we retrieve account data from the Matrix server (no longer doing <code>/sync</code>).<br />From now on, the minimum requirement for running matrix-corporal is Synapse v0.34.1, as it's the first Synapse release which contains the new API we require (<code>GET /user/{'{'}user_id{'}'}/account_data/{'{'}account_dataType{'}'}</code>).</p>

<p>I've been working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/cl-matrix">cl-matrix</a> and I think now it might be in a good condition to talk about it.
<a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/cl-matrix">cl-matrix</a> is a WIP client library written in common lisp, most of the API endpoints have been covered using macros that allow you to copy straight from the spec, here is an example using the send event endpoint:</p>
<pre><code class="lisp language-lisp">(define-matrix-endpoint room-send-event (:put)
  ("rooms" room-id "send" event-type txn-id))
</code></pre>
<p>this will expand into a function with the signature:</p>
<pre><code class="lisp language-lisp">(PUT-ROOM-SEND-EVENT AUTHENTICATION ROOM-ID EVENT-TYPE TXN-ID CONTENT &KEY PARAMETERS)
</code></pre>
<p>it also has some basic events defined using <a href="http://shinmera.github.io/deeds/">deeds</a> that can be issued using the sync endpoint.</p>

<p>It's a New Year and there have been a lot of improvements to the <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> playbook:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>there's now support for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/docs/importing-postgres.md">importing an existing Postgres database</a>, which should make it easier for people with another setup to migrate over.</li>
 	<li>there's now support for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/docs/configuring-playbook-ssl-certificates.md">manually-managed and self-signed certificates</a>, in addition to the Let's Encrypt support we've always had</li>
 	<li>the playbook now uses a much better (20x smaller, faster) riot-web Docker image (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/avhost/docker-matrix-riot/">avhost/docker-matrix-riot</a> -&gt; <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bubuntux/riot-web/">bubuntux/riot-web</a>). At least until <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/7771">vector-im/riot-web#7771</a> gets merged and official images become available.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#bc-break-mxisd-configuration-changes">completely redone</a> way of generating mxisd configuration, letting people unleash the full power of mxisd without us having to explicitly add support for new features</li>
 	<li>mxisd 1.3.0-ready. We default to a stable mxisd release still (1.2.2), but people can try the much-improved 1.3.0 alpha releases even now (e.g. <code>matrix_mxisd_docker_image: "kamax/mxisd:1.3.0-alpha.2"</code>).</li>
 	<li>we now utilize <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/blob/4185b644b7b69af36bb1fdc81976a36590b1b97f/docs/features/directory.md">mxisd's User Directory Search feature</a> to augment the results coming from Synapse</li>
 	<li>the playbook has been <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#splitting-the-playbook-into-multiple-roles">split into multiple roles</a> (one role per component) and the <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#bc-break-making-the-playbooks-roles-more-independent-of-one-another">roles have been made independent of one another</a>. People who want to re-use our roles in their own playbooks can now more-easily do so.</li>
 	<li>even more components have become optional and can now be turned off completely (coturn, mailer)</li>
</ul>
Lots of thanks go to Maximus, jcgruenhage and Cadair for helping out!

Once the migration is complete all of the migrated users will be emailed with login instructions, so that they can seamlessly continue chatting where they left off in HipChat.

                <p>Hi all, Ben here.</p>
<p>Since joining the core team as Developer Advocate last year it's been quite a ride. One of the best things about the job is getting the chance to talk to so many people about their projects and what they would like to see happen in the matrix ecosystem. With so much going on, I just want to say thanks to everyone who has been so welcoming to me and share some of my personal highlights, as I recall them, from 2018!</p>
<h2 id="clients">Clients</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a></strong> was featured in the very first TWIM, announcing v1.26. Since then, the team have hosted two IRL hackfest events (Strasbourg and Seville - where to next, Stockholm? Salisbury?), engaged two GSOC students and continued to push out releases. At this point, Fractal is a full-featured Matrix client for GNOME.</p>
<p>Matrique became <strong><a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a></strong>, and is generally awesome. Apparently the name &quot;Matrique&quot; was chosen because it sounds French, but those who speak the language well revealed that this name was not ideal! The project was re-named &quot;Spectral&quot;, and is going strong. I really appreciate the multi-user facility! It's a great looking client, and runs great on macOS too (protip: get more attention from <code>/me</code> by providing a macOS build…)</p>
<p>On which subject, <strong><a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass">Seaglass</a></strong> is a native macOS client. First announced in June, this client supports E2EE rooms (via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">matrix-ios-sdk</a>), and is also available on homebrew.</p>
<p>Ubuntu Touch has the most Matrix clients per-user of any platform. UT epitomises the resilience and collaborative spirit of Open Source. It's a true community maintenance effort, and is as friendly a community as you might meet. <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a> came first, but it's <strong><a href="https://github.com/ChristianPauly/fluffychat">FluffyChat</a></strong> that prompted me to install it on my battered old OnePlus One. FluffyChat is now extremely full-featured, with E2EE support being actively discussed.</p>
<p>In the command line, <strong><a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a></strong> appeared and quickly became a competent client, but in terms of sheer enthusiasm and momentum, I must give commendation to <strong><a href="https://github.com/jgkamat/matrix-client-el">matrix-client.el</a></strong>, a newly revived mode for Emacs which turns your editor/OS into a great Matrix Client. I enjoyed using it enough that it began to change my mind about using emacs. Laptops have more than 8mb memory these days anyway.</p>
<h2 id="a-culture-of-bots">A culture of bots</h2>
<p>There is a tendency in the community to build a bot for everything and anything. This has reached the point where there are multiple flairs available depending on what bots you like to make (silly vs serious.)</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> was perhaps the first person I saw to get the obsession, creating</p>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-monitor-bot">matrix-monitor-bot</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-trello-bot">matrix-trello-bot</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-alias-bot">matrix-alias-bot</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-hashtag-bot">hashtag bot</a> (perhaps the most absurd!)</li>
</ul>
and more…
<p>Cadair even made <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/skill-twim">twimbot</a>, designed to make it easier to consume and produce <a href="/twim">This Week in Matrix</a> itself.</p>
<p>In June <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> started <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a>, a plugin-based bot system built in Python, which now also has a management UI.</p>
<h2 id="all-bridges-lead-to-matrix">All bridges lead to Matrix</h2>
<p>Or from Matrix, depending on which way you want to send the message.</p>
<p>Around May, I started to notice another obsession brewing in the community. Bridging is a core part of the Matrix mission, but it was around this time I started seeing it in the wild.</p>
<p>Summer 2018 <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> began working in the Matrix core team, and was <em>hugely</em> productive in maintaining and developing the bridge infrastructure for matrix.org. IRC bridging is far more stable and reliable now than it was a year ago. And yet there are still more bridges - too many to list, so I'm picking the ones I've used and enjoyed.</p>
<p>Discord is bridged by <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</a>, handled by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>, aided and abetted by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> but with a new maintainer this year, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a>. This bridge is now feature-rich and sits at v0.3.1.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>'s suite of bridges including <strong><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a></strong> are extremely stable and useful - big thank you to <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> for maintaining <a href="https://t2bot.io/">t2bot.io</a> and hosting the Telegram bridge too.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/tijder/SmsMatrix">SMSMatrix</a></strong>, a phone-hosted bridge is simple and works great for SMS bridging.</p>
<h2 id="libraries-sdks-frameworks">Libraries, SDKs, Frameworks</h2>
<p>I enjoyed using <strong><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a></strong> for building <a href="https://github.com/benparsons/elizabot">elizabot</a> (more coverage needed for that!), and the SDK recently received support for application services.</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> announced v0.2 of <strong><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libqmatrixclient</a></strong> describing it as “the first one more or less functional and stable&quot; - confidence! This library now powers both Quaternion and Spectral. QMatrixClient has continued to get updates, plus features including lazy loading and VoIP signalling.</p>
<p>There are a few libs I want to pay more attention to this year, starting with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>'s <strong><a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a></strong> now that it has been rewritten in Python. I'm also excited to see <strong><a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk">jmsdk</a></strong>, part of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a>'s broader ecosystem of Matrix tooling - a Java-based SDK.</p>
<h2 id="ruma-resurrection">Ruma Resurrection</h2>
<p>Until around June, <strong>Ruma</strong> was receiving regular updates. There was a pause as the team waited for Rust async/await to land, and also to get some stability in the Matrix Spec. Still waiting on Rust, but now that the Matrix Spec is stabilising, Ruma is showing signs of life too. I have also been watching other homeserver projects begin to restart, which makes for a great start to 2019.</p>
<h2 id="dsn-traveller-by-florian">DSN Traveller by Florian</h2>
<p>Matrix was featured as part of a Master's thesis by Florian Jacob.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/">DSN Traveller</a> tries to get a rough overview of how the Matrix network is structured today. It records how many rooms it finds, how many users and servers take part in those rooms, and how they relate to each other, meaning how many users a server has and of how many rooms it is part of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Florian's thesis was handed in last August. <a href="https://github.com/florianjacob/dsn-traveller">Source code is available</a>.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="still-more">Still more</h2>
<p>Synapse dominates the homeserver space right now, so if you want to host your own homeserver today it's the obvious choice. Too great a variety of installation guides was doing more harm than good, so <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@natrius:matrix.org">Stefan</a> took the initiative to create a <strong>definitive community-driven Synapse installation guide</strong>, including a room to discuss and improve the text. Find the <a href="/docs/guides/installing-synapse">guide linked from here</a>, and chat about the guide in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/synapseguide:matrix.org">#synapseguide:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>I want to use Matrix, and I want to host my own homeserver. As such, <strong><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a></strong> is a project I absolutely love. It uses Synapse docker images from the Matrix core team, and combines them with Ansible playbooks written and organised by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a>. It lets you quickly deploy everything needed for a Synapse homeserver, and it's simple enough that even I can use it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">Construct</a></strong>, a homeserver implementation in C++ began successfully federating with Matrix, work progressed <a href="/blog/2018/05/18/this-week-in-matrix-2018-05-18/">from around April/May</a>.</p>
<p>Having a <strong><a href="https://shields.io/#/examples/chat">Matrix-native mode for shields.io</a></strong> (those counter/indicator images you often see at the top of repos) seems like something petty at first, but it's actually a great indicator of the importance of Matrix from the outside. Plus, I love seeing the images at the top of different repos. Thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a> for helping this along.</p>
<p>Two students worked on Matrix-related projects during <strong><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a></strong>.</p>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Zil0:matrix.org">Zil0</a> created E2EE bindings for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a></li>
 	<li><a href="@apwhitehat:matrix.org">APwhitehat</a> worked on the federation APIs in Dendrite</li>
</ul>
Something which came in super-helpful for me when testing homeserver installations was <strong><a href="https://neo.lain.haus/fed-tester/">f0x's fed-tester</a></strong>. <a href="https://github.com/f0x52/fed-tester/">Source code available</a> (obv.)
<h2 id="thanks-for-all-the-projects">Thanks for all the projects</h2>
<p>Thanks for a great 2018. There was so much to learn about, so much to write about, and so many great community members to meet and chat to! If I didn't mention your project, I'm sorry to have been either forgetful or to not be able to include everything.</p>
<p>If you think I've missed something, or if there's a project I should have included rather than another, or even if you just disagree with my choices, let's discuss it in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a>. See you there, and let's all parade ahead to a productive, open, interoperable 2019!</p>

Also a shoutout to the XMPP community for guidling me through the XEP landscape and giving the bridge a thorough testing. :)</p>

<p>matrix-client.el gained more room sorting options and a /priority command to set room priority. It also includes a workaround for a Google Chrome drag-and-drop bug on Linux, so now Chrome users can drag-and-drop URLs, files, and images directly into room buffers to upload them.</p>
<p>matrix-client.el gained a new notifications-buffer feature that shows notifications from multiple rooms in a single list, allowing you to easily monitor multiple rooms at once and jump to events in them.<br />e.g. I can see messages from #matrix and #twim in the same window, and reply to messages in both rooms from the same prompt</p>

<h2 id="xmpp-as-jabber-turns-20">XMPP (as Jabber) turns 20</h2>
<p>As noted in <a href="https://xmpp.org/2019/01/the-xmpp-newsletter-4-january-2019/">The XMPP Newsletter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today is Jabber's 20th anniversary! Jabber would later be standardized and renamed to XMPP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this subject, it's always worth thinking about the importance of openness and interoperability in messaging. This <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/lessons-vendor-lock-messaging">recent article in Linux Journal</a> is a reminder of the need to avoid proprietary vendor lock in, and mentions both XMPP and Matrix.</p>

<p>It's the 28th of December as I write this, and I hope you had a good year. Long as it is, I recommend reading <a href="/blog/2018/12/25/the-2018-matrix-holiday-special/">Matthew's write-up of the year</a>, as it covers a lot of ground!</p>
<p>Many of the core team have been out of the office this week, but there are still plenty of updates to share from the Matrix ecosystem!</p>
<h2 id="mxisd-v1-2-2">mxisd v1.2.2</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> released mxisd v1.2.2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a> had a Holiday-special release: <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.2.2">v1.2.2</a> before v1.3.0.</p>
<p>This release introduces two new big features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Username login rewriting via 3PID to allow advanced flows, like bypassing the synapse restriction of having numerical usernames for non-guest users</li>
 	<li>Support for multiple Base DNs for LDAP backends</li>
</ul>
Work has started on v1.3.0 so this is definitely the last release before a non-backward compatible release.

<p><a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma-desktop">koma-desktop</a> is updated to JavaFx 11 and installation is simplified. Dependencies, including native modules can be packaged into one single file, which only needs to be downloaded and run. Java Runtime 11 is the only runtime dependency. Now it's just cross-compilation that needs to be set up before packaged releases can be provided for Mac, Windows, and Linux users.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:feneas.org">Jason Robinson</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started work on a Prometheus Alertmanager bot for Matrix. The basic idea is that Alertmanager can send webhook alert events to the bot which will then send the formatted events to configured rooms based on the alert receiver. It works, but is still early work in progress. See code and info here: <a href="https://git.feneas.org/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager">https://git.feneas.org/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager</a>.</p>

<p><a href="@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre Franke</a>:</p>

<p>As expected the Fractal team released 4.0 and is already hard at work on the next micro version. We recommend <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Fractal">getting it from Flathub</a> like we usually do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>

<p>The new command handling system in maubot is ready. The new system should be much nicer to use when developing plugins.</p>
<p>Previously <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a> had a system that was designed after the improved bot support spec proposal, but it wasn't very nice or pythonic. If/when the proposal or something similar goes through, I'll probably add support for it in the new command handling system.</p>
<p>Next I'll make some developer docs so that other people could actually make their own plugins.</p>
<p>The code is at <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">https://github.com/maubot/maubot</a> and you can ask about maubot in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#maubot:maunium.net">#maubot:maunium.net</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/apps/matrix-to">https://github.com/apps/matrix-to</a> is a Github App which makes use of their shiny and new Content Attachments API/Webhook. When a <code>matrix.to</code> or <code>view.matrix.org</code> URL is used this app is activated. It adds a little snippet with the Room Title and Topic (if the room is peekable from matrix.org). In future it'll work for event permalinks, but currently there is no support for peeking context/event in Matrix API.</p>

<p>You may have seen that <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> been working fearlessly and tirelessly on bridges for many, many months. In this episode of Matrix Live Half-Shot chats with Matthew about his work, progress and achievements, with a focus on recent <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a> and XMPP work. Audio is not amazing, but worth listening to get acquainted with recent work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a> bridge gained a XMPP specific backend for better performance when you want to do just xmpp bridging. It's rather quick right now, and needs dogfooding.</p>

<p>Just a head's up that I've increased the storage capacity of the database. With current projections, the server should be good for another year or two.</p>
<p>The database is also 1ms closer to Synapse and has a faster CPU in it. It probably won't make a dent in speed on federation, but it is a step forward.</p>

<p>Developers and creators of <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a>, the GNOME Matrix client, have been holding a <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/FractalDecember2018">Hackfest this week in Seville</a>. Matthew and I caught up with them on video for Matrix Live this week, and discussed the product improvements they've been making and their plans for the next release (due next week!)</p>

<h2 id="this-week-in-ruma">This Week in Ruma</h2>
<p>We don't often get to feature news from <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">Ruma</a>, but this week there is an updated <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/this-week-in-ruma-2018-12-09/">This Week in Ruma</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ruma is not dead, however, and small improvements have continued over the last year. The Matrix spec has advanced quite a bit and many of the blocking issues for Ruma have been resolved. Rust's maturity is another story. async/await is still under development and this is the most significant blocking issue to progress on Ruma.</p>

<h2 id="maubot-new-tooling">maubot new tooling</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been working on tooling for <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>maubot got a command-line tool for building plugins and managing maubot instances. I also added some server-side stuff for easy registration of accounts in the management interface using synapse shared secrets, but the UI for that isn't ready.
Also, I'm planning on adding some kind of small Matrix client in the management interface for manually managing the added bot clients. That might lead to a separate library that could be used in other projects or embedded in websites.</p>

<p>Purism announced they are sponsoring <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a> development, starting with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@iamjsparber:matrix.org">Julian Sparber</a> working last month to improve the message view. You can <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2018/12/03/better-room-history-in-fractal/">read about his progress here</a>. Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before, there was a jarring cut when new messages were loaded, but now you can just scroll upward and older messages are loaded continuously.<br />The part I'm most excited about is the new &quot;new message divider&quot;. When the user opens a room they can directly start reading the conversation from the last seen message and they don't need to search for the new message divider. Not only has the UX gotten a lot better, but also the underlying code is much cleaner now.<br />I also spent some time on making message rendering faster. I replaced the RegExp with more efficient code, this made the rendering much faster (from ~10ms to ~ 1ms) for every single message.<br />In summary, all of these things improve Fractal's UX a lot and make it feel more like a modern messaging app.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Work on the Informo specifications has slowed down a bit in the last couple of weeks, though since the last update we did manage to get some relatively big SCSs merged into the specs, including <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/9">SCS #9</a> (rendered <a href="https://specs.informo.network/information-distribution/article/">here</a>) which specifies how information sources must publish their information through the federation, and <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/11">SCS #11</a> (rendered <a href="https://specs.informo.network/information-distribution/source/">here</a>) which describes how sources must register themselves in order to be picked up by clients, and handle localisation. ?<br />There's still a couple of big items to take care of before we can cut a 1.0 release of the Informo specs but this is definitely a huge step towards this goal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beer! And pizza! And also Redecentralize<br />We chatted to a nice bunch of folks both demoing their decentralized projects and talked to the likes of scuttlebutt, BBC, IPFS and more. Was a interesting experience having around 8 minutes to quickly explain to newcomers what Matrix is and why they should use it in a speed dating format. We chatted (and demoed) bridges, <a href="https://riot.im/experimental/">new-riot</a> and generally how it all fits together. There were a lot of very interesting people with different profiles and backgrounds, and diversified questions which lead to a lot of interesting discussions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><small>Note for the confused: the <em>format of the meetup</em> was comparable to speed dating. There is no suggestion that Matrix should be used at regular speed dating.
