<blockquote>So now the K8s stuff has configuration examples for Synapse + Riot + mxisd + coturn, all runnable on your very own Kubernetes cluster - though with some manual tinkering required at the moment.<br />I've updated the Kubernetes configuration examples to include everything you need for a full Matrix stack; Synapse + Riot + mxisd - using the built-in K8s ingress<br />And + coturn of course, not to forget</blockquote>

<h2 id="googlesummerofcode">Google Summer of Code</h2>
The second evaluation for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a> is nearly here, so we have some updates from the student participants:
<h2 id="apwhitehatisworkingondendrite"><a href="@apwhitehat:matrix.org">apwhitehat</a> is working on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a></h2>
<blockquote>Dendrite updates for TWIM (before GSoC 2nd eval):
This month we've got most of the federation APIs working on Dendrite. These are:
<ul>
 	<li>State APIs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/486">#486</a></li>
 	<li>Get missing events API <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/516">#516</a></li>
 	<li>Query user devices <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/498">#498</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We still need to figure out pagination for backfill API.</p>
<p>On applications services, we've got a lot of APIs working, thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>. Authentication now acknowledges App services, though lot of other stuff is under review. I am eagerly waiting for it to land.</p>
</blockquote>
On the same topic, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> says:
<blockquote>We've had a PR from fadeAce/dirichlet_zby for the server-side implementation of end-to-end encryption support in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>. Will be looking forward to seeing that land as well.</blockquote>
There is an explanation of the endpoints required for this <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.3.0.html#end-to-end-encryption">in the CS API docs</a>.
<h2 id="zil0isworkingone2einthepythonsdk">Zil0 is working on E2E in the Python SDK</h2>
Sounds like <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Zil0:matrix.org">Zil0</a> has been going great guns on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a>:
<blockquote>Encryption in matrix-python-sdk should now work fairly well.<br />The biggest parts to write were device tracking and key persistence. All the PRs are now opened, and the code is fully tested and documented.<br />It is possible to try out the implementation before it lands by referring to instructions written here.<br />Also a special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/poljar">poljar</a> for some great work on new Olm bindings, which allowed the project not to get stuck with packaging issues.<br />Further work include encrypted attachments, device verification and key sharing.</blockquote>
<h2 id="komakotlinclient">koma, kotlin client</h2>
Last week I mistakenly referred to <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">Koma</a> as being written in Rust, then Java. This was all incorrect, though being written in Kotlin, Koma does run on the JVM and use JavaFx.
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sideboat:matrix.org">sideboat</a>:</p>
<blockquote>This week in <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">koma</a>, we are improving the room info window used for viewing and editing the name, icon, and aliases of a room.

<h2 id="riot">Riot</h2>
This week we welcome Bruno to the Riot team, he's off and away working on getting integration tests set up.
<p>Otherwise:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>More work on the Jitsi integration</li>
 	<li>More work troubleshooting E2E failures</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases/tag/v0.15.6">v0.15.6</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases/tag/v0.15.7-rc.1">v0.15.7-rc.1</a> now available</li>

Welcome to This Week in Matrix, let's see what updates the community has to offer this week!
<h2 id="koma">koma</h2>
Announcing his update nearly a week ago, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@radicus:matrix.org">radicus</a> released <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/releases/tag/0.7.3">v0.7.3</a> of <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">koma</a>.
<blockquote>There have been quite some changes since updates of the project were last posted, but the major ones are:
<ul>
 	<li>Upgrade to JavaFx 9</li>
 	<li>Experimental support for infinite scroll on message list</li>
 	<li>Rewrite ListView to improve performance and reduce jar file size</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="dialogflowconnector">dialogflow connector</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@vurpo:vurpo.fi">vurpo</a> has released <a href="https://gitlab.com/vurpo/matrix-dialogflow">matrix-dialogflow</a>, which allow the use of DialogFlow agents as chatbots:
<blockquote>I've written a little bot for connecting a DialogFlow agent to Matrix as a chatbot. I did this for my own personal purposes but I know someone else might find this handy as well.</blockquote>
<h2 id="mautrixtelegram">mautrix-telegram</h2>
<a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:
<blockquote>New stuff in mautrix-telegram:
<ul>
 	<li>A basic telematrix database import script</li>
 	<li>Improved config for relaybot message formatting, including the option to use Matrix displaynames (instead of just mxid localparts)
I've also been planning an improved Matrix-&gt;Telegram formatting converter and a provisioning API for integration managers like Dimension.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="jmsdk">jmsdk</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> has been working on a matrix client this week. To that end, he has implemented <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk">jmsdk</a>, a "very early version of the matrix sdk and common classes (client, bot, …)"
<blockquote>Currently implemented the matrix client on the java with full support of the C2S API. It still under development and contains bugs.</blockquote>
He has also been working on a "bot sdk with core classes to write custom bots and appservices."
<h2 id="matrixappservicevoip"><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/matrix-appservice-voip">matrix-appservice-voip</a></h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> has been working on VoIP bridging between Matrix and regular phones using Freeswitch:
<blockquote>We have successful VoIP bridging between Matrix and regular phones using Freeswitch, for 1:1, both directions! a v0.1 is scheduled in a few days once configuration is possible and a getting started doc is written.
<p>Next steps:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>more voice backends (think Jitsi, etc.)</li>
 	<li>SMS support with Twilio and/or OVH initially</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd">mxisd</a> integration to automatically invite bridge users if needed and suggest bridge users</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxgwd</a> integration to auto-join HS regular users if a VoIP bridge user invites them, so &gt; calls are directly seen</li>
 	<li>And much more in later releases</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="transform">transform</h2>
A wild <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bettiah:matrix.org">bettiah</a> appeared, announced a completely new homeserver implementation in TypeScript:
<blockquote>I have been working on a homeserver implementation over at <a href="https://github.com/bettiah/transform">https://github.com/bettiah/transform</a> . It is fairly basic at the moment, but the development experience is straight-forward and even fun.</blockquote>
I'm interested to see a TypeScript backend running, and of course it's great to have more homeserver implementations! Some highlights from the <a href="https://github.com/bettiah/transform">readme</a>:
<blockquote>Transform is a matrix homeserver built using Typescript and Redis. It is not fully functional yet.
<strong>Status:</strong> Register, Login, CreateRoom, Invite &amp; Join seem to be functional with riot web client. But quite a lot of functionality is missing and the software is definitely not ready for deployment in a public facing role.
<strong>Design:</strong> A lot of the code is auto-generated from the excellent swagger specs for the client-server api.
<strong>Contributing</strong>: It is early days yet. However, Typescript has enabled safe &amp; rapid progress. Redis streams too seem to have a very well thought out api and the whole thing has been a fun experience so far. Contributions are very welcome.</blockquote>
<h2 id="dsntravellersourcecodereleased">dsn-traveller source code released!</h2>
Good news for those following the progress of <a href="https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/">dsn-traveller</a>, the source is now publicly available!
<p>From <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@florianjacob:matrix.org">Florian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>I received permission to publish the source code of the DSN Traveller bot (<a href="https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/">https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/</a>) prior to handing in my thesis: You can find it at <a href="https://github.com/florianjacob/dsn-traveller">https://github.com/florianjacob/dsn-traveller</a>, it's written with <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-client">ruma-client</a> and Rust async/await.</blockquote>

<h2 id="e2eforpythonsdk">E2E for Python SDK</h2>
Late breaking, but not itself broken, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@adam:thebeckmeyers.xyz">&amp;Adam</a> has news from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a>:
<blockquote>first olm-centered E2E PR for the python sdk merged to master (finally). Lots of great work from Zil0 still to be merged waiting on PR review. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk/pull/224">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk/pull/224</a></blockquote>
<h2 id="fractal">Fractal</h2>
<p>From Tobias: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>No new Fractal release this week. Development was quite active nevertheless, with Jordan's new inline audio player landing in master, Julian getting close to landing the first part of the new room settings, and Eisha working on improving the image viewer.</p>

<blockquote>I am working on implementing end-to-end encryption in the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">Python SDK</a>. As of now, I have done a good part of the encryption and decryption work with Olm and Megolm, enough to allow communicating with Riot in an encrypted room. My next goals include device list tracking and key persistence, which are the main steps left before the implementation starts being usable in a real environment.</blockquote>
<h2 id="apwhitehat-on-dendrite"><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@apwhitehat:matrix.org">apwhitehat</a> on Dendrite</h2>
<blockquote>My aim is to achieve feature completion on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>. Have got lots of help from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>, for which I'm very grateful.</blockquote>
Features worked on this month:
<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>we made a transactions cache/table for idempotency. So now dendrite will not reprocess events as far as client-server api is concerned.</li>
 	<li>added request authentication function which recognises an application service user (partially landed.)</li>
 	<li>username auto generation, which let's you register without username (will be used for guest access later.)</li>
 	<li>We also added a tokens library based on macaroons, however we might not be using it anytime soon. Since it's been known to be very problematic (on synapse).</li>
 	<li>Other small bug fixes not big enough to mention.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="clients">Clients</h1>
We are rich in client announcements this week!
<h2 id="palaver">palaver</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@arne:matrix.localtoast.de">Arne</a> has announced v0.1.0 of <a href="https://github.com/MrCustomizer/palaver/">Palaver</a>:
<blockquote>More news from the JVM-world: I've just released the first Alpha version (v0.1.0) of Palaver, a Desktop client written in Kotlin: <a href="https://github.com/MrCustomizer/palaver/releases/tag/v0.1.0">https://github.com/MrCustomizer/palaver/releases/tag/v0.1.0</a>. As backend it uses the <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/matrix-java-sdk">matrix-java-sdk</a>, the GUI is written in TornadoFX, a Kotlin-Wrapper for JavaFX. The room for this client is <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#palaver:matrix.localtoast.de">#palaver:matrix.localtoast.de</a>. The current features are listed in the changelog: <a href="https://github.com/MrCustomizer/palaver/blob/v0.1.0/CHANGELOG.md">https://github.com/MrCustomizer/palaver/blob/v0.1.0/CHANGELOG.md</a>.

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has announced <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad">GTAD</a> v0.6 and <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> v0.3. We've covered <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad">GTAD</a> before, but I think it's worth including this note from the readme:
<blockquote>GTAD (Generate Things from an API Description) is a generator of code from a Swagger/OpenAPI specification. Initially made to generate marshalling/unmarshalling C++ code for Matrix CS API, it can be extended to support other API descriptions and other programming languages with static type checking.</blockquote>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> regarding the GTAD 0.6 release:
<blockquote>A new version of API code generator, GTAD, 0.6, has been released today, adding support of variant types, proper dealing with definitions referencing other files ($ref) and more options to override schema names - even defined inline. Most importantly, GTAD has got extensive README.md that describes (most of) the things needed to start writing your own templates! As usual, kitsune will be happy to help those who would like to try it (both with C/C++ projects and other languages).</blockquote>
<blockquote>libQMatrixClient has been benefiting from GTAD over the last 4 months or so - but this is the first release where GTAD is stable and feature-complete enough to be shared with other projects.</blockquote>
<a href="http://matrix.to/#/#gtad:matrix.org">#gtad:matrix.org</a> is the new room for GTAD chat and support.
<p>and <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> 0.3:</p>
<blockquote>A new version of libQMatrixClient, 0.3, comes out this weekend. This is the first libQMatrixClient release to include (almost) all CS API requests and supplementary (non-event) definitions, thanks to GTAD 0.6. Notably, it now includes jobs to register users, manage devices and keys on the server (no local key management yet - E2E work has just begun). This version also gains centralised request error handling so that clients could deal with problems in a unified way, and support "Consent not given" errors of GDPR fame, so that client authors could automatically open consent pages. You can also trigger logging out of all devices through libQMatrixClient thanks to a very recent addition to CS API spec from <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We've got a shiny new application service component which runs as a separate process (if you're doing multiprocess dendrite) that handles all outbound communication to application services. Last week I got event sending working. This week I'm hooking up an internal API for other components (roomserver, c-s api) to talk to the app service component, as we occasionally need to ping AS's to ask about existence of rooms or users. Getting those two endpoints covered is the goal of this week.</blockquote>
<h2 id="ma1uta-full-spec-implementation-in-java"><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> <em>Full</em> Spec Implementation in Java</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> appeared with an extremely ambitious piece of work. His goal:
<blockquote>I want to create a full spec's implementation on java (all 5 specification). After that I want try to write a homeserver (2 variants: distributed on java+kafka and simple which can run on a light vps). But it's a long-term goal.</blockquote>
So far work has begun on an implementation of the Matrix API in Java:
<blockquote><a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon</a> - another java implementation of the matrix api (client-server, server-server, application server, push server, identity server) using jax-ws. It corresponds the specification on <a href="/docs/spec">https://matrix.org/docs/spec</a>. On the next step I want dive deep into synapse to parse it's api and fill the gaps of the spec with sending pull request. May be I will write something like a TCK (test compatibility kit).</blockquote>
And an SDK for which there is a sample bot for mastodon:
<blockquote>Also this project has a very early sdk (client, bot). I will fix it after finishing works with the spec.
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/mxtoot">https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/mxtoot</a> - matrix-mastodon bridge.
With this bridge you can invite a bot and read your home mastodon's timeline, post messages, reply and boost messages.</blockquote>

And here it is. As you may have noticed, I'm leaning much more toward quoting wherever possible, rather than trying to paraphrase. The aim is to keep the content authentic and community-driven, rather than a narrative from one fairly naive observer.

If you'd like to try it out, <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> has hosted a <a href="https://t2bot.io/blueshine/">Riot instance with the theme included here</a>.

<h1 id="specproposals">Spec Proposals</h1>
Still posting about spec proposals. To get involved in the spec development process, take a look at the <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">Matrix Spec Change Proposals</a> page to find out what's happening, read the proposals, then talk about it in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a>. One proposal looking for attention and a good place to start:
<h2 id="interactivekeyverificationspecproposalfromuhoreg">Interactive Key Verification: Spec proposal from uhoreg</h2>
Long-time contributor <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg:matrix.org">uhoreg</a> joined the matrix.org core team this week, and is requesting feedback on a spec proposal relating to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SXmyjyNqClJ5bTHtwvp8tT1Db4pjlGVxfPQNdlQILqU/">Interactive Key Verification</a>.

</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Folks are already accepting the new policies - thanks.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">We're going to start requiring acceptance to access the matrix.org server on Tuesday (May 29th).
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">We're already receiving our first GDPR requests… :|
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Erasure and Right-to-be-forgotten work (Phase 2) is next up so we can action the requests in a timely manner.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like we will go ahead on removing MXIDs on events as a Phase 3 (although for now we do warn people that this is effectively a technical limitation of Matrix, albeit one that we're working on).

Big E2E progress from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mujx:matrix.org">mujx</a>, developer of the <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> client on his project <a href="https://github.com/mujx/mtxclient">mtxclient</a>. <a href="https://github.com/mujx/mtxclient/commit/7e522df71c804cbc04f38007c3958ebbb56815d3">As of this week</a>, mxtclient is able to decrypt group events. When writing (that is, sending encrypted messages) is complete, the idea is to migrate this work back to nheko, though mujx points out this library could be used in any client.

This tool is used to output the last five messages from a given room to displayed as HTML, the idea being to display output from a specific room as a website widget. You can see an example using <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev</a> <a href="http://matrix.hackerspaces.be:1337/!XqBunHwQIXUiqCaoxq:matrix.org?color=green">here</a>.
<h2 id="opsdroidroomstateconnector">opsdroid room state connector</h2>

<h1 id="specproposals">Spec Proposals</h1>
As you may have seen from the <a href="/blog/2018/05/17/introducing-matrix-specification-changes/">previous blog post</a>, we have a new drive to advance the Matrix Specification itself. Part of this is <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a>, which lists all the spec change proposals we've accumulated so far, and describes the flow for getting new proposals merged. There is a new room, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> for discussion, please join if you want to get involved in this process. Check out the page and the blog post for more detail.
<p>Next up: try to turn some of the many WIP proposals into Spec PRs...</p>

Lots of excitement at the variety of independent clients and servers able to interact over the matrix protocol. The images above show <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">The Construct</a> (server) and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a> (client), and then <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a> and <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a>. A fundamental part of matrix is to be an open protocol, so it's great to see entirely independent implementations liaising together! While implementing <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> has been documenting spec omissions <a href="https://kamax.io/matrix/api/client_server/unstable.html">in a branch of the spec</a> - we're hoping he will contribute these back!
<p>Honourable mention for <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mujx:matrix.org">mujx</a>, who was sending messages with <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">Ruma</a> a year ago!</p>
<h1 id="matrixcoreteamexpansion">Matrix Core team expansion</h1>
<ul>
 	<li>Stève - 17th May (yesterday)</li>
 	<li>Amber - 21st (Monday)</li>
 	<li>Anoa - 21st (Monday)</li>
 	<li>Hubert - 28th May</li>
 	<li>Half-Shot - 4th June
...and one more community member, hopefully (just sorting paperwork currently!)</li>
</ul>
Heads up that we're consciously trying to hire a mix of folks from the Matrix community as well as those outside it - and avoid hiring the whole community, both to ensure diversity of viewpoint &amp; experience in the core team, and also to avoid cannibalising folks who working on their own commercial projects on top of Matrix. We'd prefer Matrix to be as decentralised and heterogenous as possible, needless to say - and instead try to support folks in building on Matrix without hiring them into the core team (where we'd expect them to focus on the core project for everyone's benefit). This may change once we have Matrix set up as a separate foundation, once we've got out of beta, of course.

                <h1 id="fractalhackfest2018">Fractal Hackfest 2018</h1>
<p>The talk of the town in Strasbourg this week was the arrival of Fractal Hackfest 2018! Event is still ongoing, and I'm sure they will provide a report of the progress on <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Fractal2018">https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Fractal2018</a>, though <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre</a> kindly sent us a photo of the group in action</p>
<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-11-at-15.18.29-1024x596.png" alt="Fractal Hackfest 2018" />
<h1 id="homeassistants">Home Assistants</h1>
<p>Wonderful things are happening and being discovered regarding IoT and Home Automation. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg:matrix.org">uhoreg</a> was the first to point us to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tinloaf:matrix.org">tinloaf's</a> project to build a Matrix Chatbot component for <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>:</p>
<blockquote><br />  <p>This component allows you to send messages to matrix rooms, as well as to react to messages in matrix rooms. Reacting to commands is accomplished by firing an event when one of the configured commands is triggered.</p><br /></blockquote>
<p>(this is not the same as notify.matrix <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/notify.matrix/">https://www.home-assistant.io/components/notify.matrix/</a>, which is used to deliver messages from Home Assistant to a room.)</p>
<p>Enthusiasm for this work led to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jon:terracrypt.net">jfred</a> discussing his past adventures in Matrix, including a component for <a href="https://github.com/theschwa/sibyl">sibyl</a>, 'a python chatbot with a focus on XBMC' allowing Matrix communication.</p>
<p>All this excitement led to Cadair creating <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#homeautomation:cadair.com">#homeautomation:cadair.com</a>, which has started a more thorough discussion. I'm eager to see more non-chat applications of Matrix, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> came up with others with projects in progress.  </p>
<h1 id="ongdpr">On GDPR</h1>
<p>GDPR has been a <del>favourite</del> topic for a while now. If you didn't already, take a look at the latest thinking from the Matrix Core team here: <a href="/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/">https://matrix.org/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/</a></p>
<blockquote><br />  <p>It's worth noting that we feel that GDPR is an excellent piece of legislation from the perspective of forcing us to think more seriously about our privacy – it has forced us to re-prioritise all sorts of long-term deficiencies in Matrix (e.g. dependence on DNS; improving User Interactive authentication; improving logout semantics etc).  There's obviously a lot of work to be done here, but hopefully it should all be worth it!</p><br /></blockquote>
<h1 id="travisrongdpr">TravisR on GDPR</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/">TravisR</a> has also been thinking about GDPR, and how it relates to his <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-voyager-bot">Voyager bot</a>. In his words:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>TWIM: I've mostly been working on figuring out how GDPR affects t2bot.io for the last couple weeks. One of the things running on t2bot.io is Voyager - a bot that tries to join rooms it sees mentioned in people's messages, graphing them on <a href="https://voyager.t2bot.io">https://voyager.t2bot.io</a>. With the increase in talk about GDPR and more bots starting to wander the federation, the recurring topic of whether Voyager should change its approach to finding and listing rooms.</p>
<p>With the current approach, Voyager reads messages and tries to find room aliases to try and join. Individual people can opt-out of this tracking to stop Voyager from reading/parsing their messages (opting back in at a later time, if desired). The room moderators can kick or ban the bot to completely remove their room from the graph, and can invoke a 'soft kick' if they'd like to have their room remain listed, but don't want the bot in the room. Voyager will make sure to only show information for public rooms and will update the graph if the room flips between public and private.</p>
<p>If anyone has feedback on how this approach could be improved (or if it should be left as-is), please come by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#voyager:t2bot.io">#voyager:t2bot.io</a> on matrix to start the conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="translations">Translations</h1>
<p>I was surprised and excited to learn that a Russian translation of the Matrix FAQ has been produced by a group of Russian-language users. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote><br />  <p>There are a several Russian-speaking users spontaneously decided to unite and help Matrix. We created a room where translated FAQ using the embedded etherpad widget. Some of us are here: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@commagray:matrix.org">Magnolia</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@commagray:matrix.org">Fenneko is a Good Girl</a> for example. Anybody can join to us <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#perevodators:matrix.org">#perevodators:matrix.org</a> and helps. We accept any help.<br />  Preview: <a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/index.html">https://ma1uta.github.io/index.html</a></p><br /></blockquote>
<p>They've provided a PR which I will presently merge (though of course, as I don't speak Russian I will need to trust that it's really a translation of the FAQ!)</p>

<h2 id="specproposals">Spec Proposals</h2>
<p>Much-needed work has begun to classify and present the spec proposals for the Matrix specification. We've tagged up the all the issues in GitHub, new page will appear on matrix.org at the start of next week if I can just stop preening the generator.</p>

<p>Happily, I was at an unrelated event in London earlier in the week, and had my first IRL experience meeting someone who already knew (and then enthused) about the project. Feels good.</p>

<p>Do you have a suggestion for this series? What could we be doing more of? I have a nascent plan to do 'deeper' conversations with people or projects that aren't necessarily in the normal run of things, but are interesting uses of Matrix.

Ever modest, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been tearing through issues and fixes over on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a>. I'm quite excited to have a matrix-native console client getting up to speed so fast.

<h4 id="journal">Journal</h4>
One of the riot developers, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lb:ldbco.de">luke</a> has a fun side-project called <em><a href="https://journal.ldbco.de/#/journal/journal:ldbco.de">Journal</a></em>, this being a blogging platform built on matrix.
<p>Says Luke:</p>
<blockquote>The big news this week being that I'm going to redesign the interface to focus on the personal blog use-case, optimising for easy setup and easy blog post sharing.
And hopefully push a 1.0 release that I'd be happy to use as my own personal blog.</blockquote>
Worth noting that the linked project page (<a href="https://journal.ldbco.de/#/journal/journal:ldbco.de">Journal</a>) is <em>itself</em> a blog using journal (the url might give you a hint of this!)

<h4 id="gtad">GTAD</h4>
This week <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has been focused on 'GTAD (Generate Things from API Description)', which is a code generator for C++, taking API description in Swagger/OpenAPI as it's source. Now at version 0.5, apparently GTAD
<blockquote>can generate correct buildable (and runnable) code to convert data structures used in CS API between JSON and C++ - for the entirety of CS API calls. That basically means that libqmatrixclient gains (so far low-level) C++ CS API for all calls in <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/unstable.html">The Spec</a> and will follow updates to it.</blockquote>
This is super-exciting, especially as we are going to see discussion and progress on the spec...

Amber Brown of the <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted project</a> will be joining the Matrix core team in a few weeks. She'll be focusing on Synapse implementation work, and will bring a lot of Python experience with her. Having someone working full time on synapse will increase others bandwidth for homeserver and spec work.

<h4 id="riotweb">Riot/Web</h4>
<ul>
<li>We're committing to 2-weekly releases come what may, to avoid another massive gap like the one between 0.13 and 0.14.</li>
<li>RCs will get cut starting from Wednesday; actual release then happens on the Monday having given folks a chance to test the RC on /staging (and to iterate on the RCs).</li>
<li>Obviously this is flexible if we need to rush out fixes sooner.</li>
<li>On that note, 0.14.2-rc1 was cut on Wednesday!  Please test it at riot.im/staging. It's mainly bugfixes but also the full relayering between riot-web and matrix-react-sdk.</li>
<li>Dave's working on finally hooking in Jitsi as the default conferencing system</li>
<li>t3chguy's been working on Replies, which continue to look awesome</li>
<li>Next up: E2E cross-signing (at last!!!!)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="riotmobile">Riot/Mobile</h4>
<ul>
<li>New releases are out! Mainly preparing for sticker viewing and trying to fix the Android push notification situation.  PLEASE TELL US IF YOU ARE STILL HAVING ANDROID PUSH NOTIFICATION PROBLEMS!</li>
<li>Lots of review of Android by Benoit - adding in Kotlin support as of today and establishing a formal roadmap for Android work (we'll show the blog post when we have it)</li>
<li>Lots of Matrix-for-French-Government stuff.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="synapse">Synapse</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/2018/04/27/synapse-0-28-0-released/">Synapse 28.0 was released!</a> A major bump mainly thanks to lots and lots of contributions from the wider community.</li>
<li>Massive experimental work on GDPR in progress - doing the thought experiment of pseudonymising MXIDs throughout Matrix on a per-room basis so that it's possible to redact MXIDs in the event of a “right-to-erasure” GDPR event.  Rich vdH is leading the work.</li>
<li>The good news is that introducing an MXID abstraction layer like this could help us enormously with some of Matrix's longest-term architectural issues - i.e. account migration and portability; improving on PERSPECTIVEs for managing server identity; future support for P2P Matrix; solving the domain name reuse problem; etc.</li>
<li>The bad news is that it would obviously be a very significant change to the Matrix spec, although we'd be doing it in such a way which minimises impact to client implementers and keep the CS API looking as similar as possible.</li>
<li>We're not sure whether we need to rush this through or not yet; still waiting for final GDPR clarification from lawyers, but it feels like this might be a good opportunity to force us to finally tackle some of these harder problems.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Erik's Delta State Resolution algorithm work is continuing well; we're hoping to finish &amp; merge it asap in order to get back headroom on the server.</li>
<li>Thankfully the matrix.org synapse itself has been relatively stable this week, other than being completely overloaded causing Freenode to be almost unusable.</li>
<li>We've started using Ansible in production, although the playbooks need some iteration before we're fully happy to announce them &amp; recommend folks use them as an official way of running Synapse in production.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec">try-matrix-now</h4>

<h1>New Rooms roundup</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix_dsl:matrix.ffslfl.net">#matrix_dsl:matrix.ffslfl.net</a> As mentioned above, MTRNord is looking at creating a DSL for matrix. In his words: "A room to discuss about making a Matrix DSL to allow non coders to write simple as and bots. I would love to see some people discussing about syntax with me as this is my very first DSL and very first time trying JetBrains MSP. Anyone with Ideas what it should allow to do and how to have the syntax a welcome to join (and people who want to follow of course too)"</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#trellobot:t2bot.io">#trellobot:t2bot.io</a> (from above) TravisR: "a discussion/developer room for Matrix Trello Bot (https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-trello-bot). This is a bot that notifies rooms of changes to tracked Trello boards, similar to how the Github bot works. Future enhancements include being able to create, update, and delete cards from within Matrix."</li>

                <h1>Matrix Ecosystem Updates</h1>
<h4>Drupal matrix_api module</h4>
Updated the Drupal matrix_api module to pass the auth token as a header instead of as a GET param... the GET param was leaking the token if there was an http exception thrown.

<h4>mxisd</h4>
v1.0.0 has been released and is now stable, making it the first community Identity server and first open federation one.
<p>(<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a>) - <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd">https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd</a></p>
<h4>nheko</h4>
0.3.x of nheko was released! There is progress towards e2e encryption in mujx/mtxclient. Once this encryption is working there, it can eventually be included in nheko.
<p>(<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mujx:matrix.org">mujx</a>) - <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">https://github.com/mujx/nheko</a></p>
<h4>Fractal</h4>
Fractal 0.1.26 was released this week, which includes an animated scroll to bottom animation, fixed MacOS compilation, and bug fixes. Since then markdown support and many other commits have been spotted...
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/">https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/</a></p>
<h4>libqmatrixclient</h4>
kitsune released 0.2 of libqmatrixclient a couple of weeks ago, which he says is "the first one more or less functional and stable"!
<p>Highlights include redactions support, files transfer (both ways), rooms creation, account data (tags, direct chat flags). Also there are a few things making libqmatrixclient clients stand out compared to, e.g., Riot: one can set per-room names/avatars, and also the best estimate for the number of unread messages can be taken from the library and shown in the client application.&quot;</p>

<h4>matrix-monitor-bot</h4>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#monitorbot:t2bot.io">#monitorbot:t2bot.io</a> is a bot to measure latency between homeservers (as perceived by users).
<p>It's able to report metrics to Prometheus and has it's own built-in dashboard (see <a href="https://lag.t2bot.io/">https://lag.t2bot.io/</a> for some horrendous times). In the coming weeks it'll become more production-ready, however in the meantime if people are looking to help iron out the scalability issues, please run an instance on your homeserver.</p>

<h4>uMatriks</h4>
thrrgilag wrote on behalf of uMatriks, to say that v0.10 was published to the openstore this last week which now includes unread counts for rooms. Those not already familiar, uMatriks is a native matrix client being developed for Ubuntu Touch.

<h4>Construct</h4>
There looks to be lots of activity on Construct (jzk's fork of the charybdis ircd which adds in a C++ homeserver implementation) based on the commit log at <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis</a>. jzk's work there has been highlighting some of synapse's nastier problems (e.g. thundering presence bugs), and it looks like the federation support is progressing steadily, including handling EDUs (presence &amp; typing data).

<h4>matrix-puppet-maxs</h4>
tyler shared his "horrifying" project, for people that want to use Matrix to send an SMS via an XMPP bridge to their Android phone, in order to provide SMS and call notifications inside Riot.

<h4>matrix-register-bot</h4>
krombel built a bot to have a two step registration to synapse, check it out:

<h4>picard</h4>
Cadair reported that he and SolarDrew have written a bot to bridge a whole slack team into a matrix community. It basically handles all the room admin for you including:
<ul>
 	<li>Invite the slack bot to the channel</li>
 	<li>Creating matrix rooms</li>
 	<li>Setting users as admins</li>
 	<li>Setting room name and room avatar and as publicly joinable</li>
 	<li>Setting up the link with the slack AS</li>
 	<li>Creating and adding rooms to the community</li>
 	<li>Inviting all members of the communtiy to the rooms</li>
</ul>
It does these things on a 1 min cron, to pick up new channels as they are created on the slack side.

<h4>opsdroid connector</h4>
Cadair also mentioned that picard uses the opsdroid connector for matrix, also written by himself and SolarDrew, and has had recent updates.

<h4>matrix-python-sdk</h4>
Release v0.2.0 of the python sdk. Highlights from this release are a workaround for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3054">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3054</a> and use of connection pooling via a requests session.

<h4>matrix-twitch-bridge</h4>
MTRNord is at the early stages of working on a twitch bridge for Matrix, written in golang.

<h4>IdleRPG</h4>
remaeus wrote in to say "we (+rpg:verse.im) just launched an initial build of #idlerpg:verse.im (now also available at #idlerpg:matrix.org) — an automated RPG that rewards you for staying online (via the presence API). It's an initial test case for prototyping out a bot framework called "doorman" with multi-service support, but focused on Matrix as we are using it as a "backbone" for our p2p app framework."
<p>(<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@remaeus:verse.im">remaeus</a>) - <a href="https://github.com/FabricLabs/doorman">https://github.com/FabricLabs/doorman</a></p>
<h4>URI protocol scheme</h4>
kitsune started working on a design proposal for the Matrix URI scheme, with the ultimate goal to have the scheme passed through IANA so that we're no worse than IPFS and others. The document is here (alpha quality but comments are already welcome): <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18A3ZRgGR-GLlPXF_VIHxywWiX1vpMvNfAU6JCnNMVuQ/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/18A3ZRgGR-GLlPXF_VIHxywWiX1vpMvNfAU6JCnNMVuQ/edit</a>
<p>There is also a spec proposal room: <a>#uri-scheme-proposal:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>)</p>
<h4>Riot/Web</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>The Great Relayering landed - almost all of Riot/Web's code is now gathered together in one sensible place (matrix-react-sdk). No more duplicate PRs or CSS &amp; JS living in different repos!</li>
 	<li>Folks with open PRs against the riot-web repository will need to reopen them against matrix-react-sdk (or more likely, merge them into their existing equivalents on matrix-react-sdk)</li>
 	<li>Michael (t3chguy's) Replies work has almost landed and is looking fantastic!</li>
 	<li>Next up: improving test coverage slightly; fixing regressions in 0.14; and a few other minor bits and bobs before we land 0.15.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="riotmobile">Riot/Mobile</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>New releases on the horizon for both iOS &amp; Android</li>
 	<li>Welcomed Benoit to the Android team, acting as lead android dev!</li>
 	<li>Finalising all new UX for configuring push notification permissions…</li>
 	<li>Final touches for Sticker viewing (including animated stickers!)</li>
 	<li>Fix embarrassing crash on iOS on certain shapes of Riot/Web URLs...</li>
 	<li>Supporting French Government Matrix activity</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="synapse">Synapse</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Operational firefighting continues: stopping malformed events from impacting federation; investigating thundering herds of presence EDUs; trying to keep Freenode joins from lagging;</li>
 	<li>Meanwhile, Erik has been working hard on the problem of Incremental State Resolution (the big algorithmic win which could massively improve HS performance, especially for Synapse); this is looking promising and has ended up taking the form of a formal mathematical proof that the proposed algorithm works: <a href="/_matrix/media/v1/download/jki.re/hSmkLkFGVUnrXjtYcjsCUsyS">https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/jki.re/hSmkLkFGVUnrXjtYcjsCUsyS</a> (aka <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3122">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3122</a>) is where that's happening! Warning: contains maths.</li>
 	<li>...and also wrote a Rust testjig for state resolution to help reason about it: <a href="https://github.com/erikjohnston/rust-matrix-state">https://github.com/erikjohnston/rust-matrix-state</a></li>
 	<li>Official Ansible playbook repository dev is progressing on the develop branch at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ansible">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ansible</a> thanks to massive work from Michael K. We'll blog properly about this when ready for use in earnest.</li>
 	<li>Dave has been doing an interesting experiment in syncing user profile data from HSes into ISes (useful for folks running a private federation with its own IS who want to use the IS as a global user directory); almost complete - we'll see how this goes.</li>
 	<li>GDPR work is in progress. We're seeing how far we can push the envelope on improving privacy, including a very interesting thought experiment on pseudonyimsing MXIDs to provide 'perfect' right-to-erasure. vdH is on the case. Warning: this may well require a major federation protocol bump if we go through with it.</li>
 	<li>More Python3 port PRs are landing from NotAFile - thanks! They're getting slightly lost behind everything above.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Still stuck behind Synapse work.</li>
 	<li>Barring disasters we have at least 2 new folks starting fulltime in the core team (both synapse &amp; dendrite) to help backend progress at the end of May however!</li>
 	<li>Lots of PRs coming in from APWhitehat though - thanks!!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec">Spec</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>uhoreg has been looking at the .well-known URI proposal again</li>
 	<li>Spec work on the core team is currently stuck behind Riot/Web and Synapse work, sadly, on the basis that burning implementation problems are more visible and harming to the project than burning spec problems.</li>
</ul>
