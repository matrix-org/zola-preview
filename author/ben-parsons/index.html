<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone. This week the Synapse team cut <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.57.0rc1">a release candidate for Synapse 1.57</a>. It contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12040">Continued work on the faster joins project</a>.</li>
<li>Additional Module API support for working with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12302">3PID associations</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12391">account data changes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12341">making users admins</a>. The first two in particular are vital to to merge the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse-dinsic">DINSIC fork of Synapse</a> into the mainline source tree.</li>
<li>Experimental, partial support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11881">MSC3202, Encrypted Appservices</a>; additional support for threads <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12436">via MSC3666</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12403">via MSC2675</a>.</li>
<li>Plus a number of bugfixes within Synapse and fixes for spec compliance issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>As ever, our warmest thanks to to our contributors for sharing their time, effort and expertise with the project. We look forward to seeing your work in the wild, come the 1.57 release proper on  Tuesday the 19th of April.</p>
<p>On develop, we have been powering through a number of different tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>further work on fast room joins;</li>
<li>efforts to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12368">better document Synapse's config file</a>;</li>
<li>strides towards making Synapse's requests <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12468">internally cancellable</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12365">performance improvements for device list updates</a>; and</li>
<li>another spurt of work to get complement (finally!) testing Synapse in worker mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking personally, my efforts to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11537">manage Synapse's dependencies</a> using poetry are coming to a close. As I write this, I've just submitted <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12478">my last (planned!) PR</a> for <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/54#card-80652082">this project</a>. It's been several months in progress now, and there were many moving parts; some unexpected <a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3ABug+author%3ADMRobertson">bugs in <code>poetry</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9644">even one in <code>pip</code></a>; plus a heck of a lot of CI config to change and understand. My sincere thanks to the broader Synapse team for their help in getting the last batch of changes made, reviewed and merged. Once this is all said and done I hope we'll all reap the benefits of</p>
<ul>
<li>a stabler CI pipeline,</li>
<li>reproducible virtual environments in our docker and debian images, and</li>

<p>Hey webhook-consuming-people! The hookshot webhook bridge <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.5.0">1.5.0</a> update has now been released. This release is a bit softer than 1.4.0, containing some smaller features and bugfixes. Thanks to everyone who contributed!. The highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow specifying msgtype for generic webhook transformations. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/282">#282</a>)</li>
<li>Add new GitHubRepo config option<code>newIssue.labels</code> which allows admins to automatically set labels on new issues. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/292">#292</a>)</li>
<li>Allow priority ordering of connection command handling by setting a<code>priority: number</code> key in the state event content. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/293">#293</a>)</li>
<li>Support GitLab<code>push</code> webhook events (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/306">#306</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> playbooks have also been updated to be 1.5.0 compatible :)</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p>This week brings many new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>KT&lt;-&gt; Matrix message deletion/redaction
<ul>
<li>Note that KT doesn't allow deleting a message if it's too old, so Matrix-&gt;KT redactions will fail for old messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KT-&gt;Matrix user name/avatar live updates
<ul>
<li>As opposed to only being updated on backfill / manual sync</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KT&lt;-&gt;Matrix read receipts
<ul>
<li>Caveat: KT-&gt;Matrix read receipts are only updated live, not on backfill / manual sync</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KT-&gt;Matrix member join/leave
<ul>
<li>Only joins were tested so far, but leaves should work too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KT&lt;-&gt;Matrix admin status / power levels</li>
<li>KT-&gt;Matrix channel name, description, and cover photo</li>
<li>General stability &amp; usability improvements</li>
<li>systemd setup instructions</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also launched an instance of the bridge &amp; opened a public portal room for testing purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matrix side: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#kakaotalk-bridge-testing:miscworks.net">#kakaotalk-bridge-testing:miscworks.net</a> </li>
<li>KakaoTalk side: https://open.kakao.com/o/gjGQFuae</li>
</ul>
<p>Logging in to my bridge instance is restricted, but Matrix users can still join the room thanks to the magic of relaying!</p>
<p>At this point, I'd say the bridge is now fairly usable.  Please try self-hosting if interested!</p>

<h3 id="nheko-website">Nheko (<a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a long and arduous journey, LorenDB's dbus interface for Nheko got finally merged. Currently this allows you to list rooms as well as switch between them. In the future we might add simple messaging support, so that you can automatically send messages into specific rooms using scripts. The API is disabled by default, since it is not authenticated. Enable it at your own risk!</p>
<p>Another long standing PR, that finally got merged, was MTRNord (they/them)'s support for pretty power level formatting. Nheko can now tell you what changed in a power level instead of just telling you that it changed. This should make them much more accessible to users, that don't like looking at the raw event source all the time (weird, eh?).</p>
<p>The image viewer should also be more reliable now and notification counts should be correct after a restart.</p>
<p>We have also been playing around with qt6 support. At this point we have a working Qt6 branch, with a few functional regressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>No voip (gstreamer has no Qt6 support yet)</li>
<li>No drop shadows on buttons</li>
<li>No switchable color schemes</li>
</ul>
<p>So far Qt6 looks pretty great and seems to fix a lot of the minor annoyances.</p>
<p>We are also still looking for some student or interested individuum to take part in the Google Summer of Code and improve the call support in Nheko! Deadline is drawing close, so if you intend to apply, better work on your proposal quickly! If you need any feedback for your proposal, feel free to DM me and ask me to review it/questions. I'm looking forward to someone applying! &lt;3</p>
<p>Anyway, merry christmas everyone or whatever you are celebrating this weekend!</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan Abolivier</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, we've released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/04/05/synapse-1-56-released">Synapse 1.56</a>! It includes only a couple of new features but quite a few bug fixes and internal improvements. One of the main changes included in this version is that Synapse will now refuse to start if configured with open registration with no verification (e.g. email, recaptcha, etc). This is an attempt at reducing the likelihood of spam across the federation, as most cases of abuse we've observed over time usually involves the attacker(s) finding homeservers with open registration and automatically creating a lot of accounts on them in order to evade sanctions.</p>
<p>This version of Synapse also deprecates the groups/communities feature of Matrix. This is a feature we introduced back in 2017, and was the predecessor of Matrix spaces. But now that it has been mostly replaced by spaces, we have decided to retire this feature, which we thank dearly for its 4 years of good and loyal service to the federation.</p>

<li>Small exception: Matrix-&gt;KT replies don't yet work in KT &quot;open channels&quot; yet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ability to create a portal by inviting a KT puppet to a DM
<ul>
<li>Note that this currently only works for KT direct chat channels that already exist &amp; have been active recently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connection resilience between the Python and Node components of the bridge
<ul>
<li>i.e. If the Node component ever exits &amp; restarts, the Python component will reconnect to it automatically.  This helps both with deployment (since it allows the components to be started in any order) and crash tolerance (since a Node crash &amp; restart no longer requires a manual restart of the Python component) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clear warnings when receiving a KT message that the bridge doesn't yet support</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, the bridge should be fairly usable now.  Very soon I'll open a Matrix-bridged KT channel to act as a public stress-test!</p>

<p>Syphon is a Matrix client with heavy emphasis on privacy and ease of use; currently in open alpha.</p>

<p>We released <a href="https://github.com/syphon-org/syphon/releases/tag/0.2.13"><code>0.2.13</code></a> this week mainly fixing an annoying bug that could cause messages sent while a configured proxy server was down to be re-sent multiple times once the proxy came back online.

<p>In addition, this release will only show the option to use hidden read receipts if the feature is supported by your server.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the awesome polyjuice client, Nheko now supports MSC3700, which slightly improves privacy in encrypted rooms. It also lead to us fixing issues with the secure symmetric secret storage, where some clients use a different base64 encoding than recommended in the spec, which could make unlocking the secrets with a recovery key or passphrase fail. And we also improved the key queries on initial login, which would sometimes fail to_device messages with a warning, that the device is unknown.</p>
<p>As a small feature, you can now close the currently open room using Ctrl-W, spaces are not treated as DMs under some circumstances anymore, you should get a less confusing error message than 500 when entering an invalid alias now and lots of fixes to the translations.</p>
<p>Thank you, LorenDB, Apurv and Mikaela for the contributions!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since last time, we've made a lot of small quality-of-life improvements, but a few changes that stand out are:</p>
<ol>
<li>We've improved support for offline PWA usage.</li>
<li>We've improved caching of space contents, reducing the number of times that we need to hit the spaceHierarchy endpoint and improving performance.</li>
<li>We've moved to a more in-the-spirit-of-the-spec way of handling hidden annotations: these are now represented by rooms with an <code>m.space.parent</code> event, and no correpsponding <code>m.space.child</code> event in the resource-space.</li>
<li>We've added a modal for viewing image messages at full-size.</li>

<p>Matrix highlight saw some &quot;under the hood&quot; changes this week, in particular a refactor to rely less on the Chrome/Firefox extension API. This should make it possible (in theory, and with some more work) to run Matrix Highlight on pages without installing anything! Aside from the obvious, I think that there are additional use cases opened up by this change; one such case I have in mind is as a commenting system on a site (a la cactus comments, but with the ability to highlight page snippets!). </p>
<p>In the process of all of this, I've spent some time running Matrix Highlight in Firefox. I've encountered no issues during this time, so it seems like the tool is usable from FF, too.

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a> 2.0.0-RC1 has been released.
This release candidate contains many breaking changes due to a large refactoring, which allows us to share a lot code between server and client implementations of the Matrix APIs.
Yes, that means Trixnity can be used to implement a matrix server!
We also made some progress to make the client module (with all the high level logic) multiplaform. This is the only module, which does not support Kotlin/Native and Kotlin/JS yet.
There are many other features (like client-side notifications!), which has been added. See the changelog for more details:</p>
<p>features/improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>clientserverapi-server: new module for server-side REST endpoints of the Client-Server-API (Server-Server-API will follow soon)</li>
<li>olm: libolm is bundled into trixnity-olm jars</li>
<li>client: push notification support (push rules are evaluated)</li>
<li>client: introduce helpers to get complete timeline as flow (no more complicated loops to get the timeline)</li>
<li>client: allow subscribing to all timeline events -&gt; really helpful for bots with e2e support</li>
<li>client: allow to sync once (e. g. for push notifications)</li>
<li>client: content field of TimelineEvent gets also set for unencrypted events</li>
<li>client: public access to keys</li>
<li>clientserverapi-model: allow custom field in pusher data</li>
<li>core: introduce BaseEventContentSerializerMappings</li>
</ul>
<p>bugfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>client: remove direct room, when other user leaves room</li>
<li>client: change varchar length to support MariaDB</li>
<li>clientserverapi-client: first sync after pause without timeout</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension">Dimension</a>, an integration manager alternative for Element, got a refresh from @TimeWalker to bring the project up to modern day standards. Please give it a go if you've been running Dimension, and report bugs if there's problems! While I haven't personally had time to maintain it as much as I'd like, it's great to see people taking on 3 year old bad code and fixing it üòÑ</p>
<p>For TWIM readers, Dimension is an &quot;integration manager&quot; that replaces the default one shipped with Element. It's not entirely mobile-ready yet, but does give a user interface for managing various bots, bridges, and widgets. In practice, an integration manager isn't needed as most bots and bridges (and even widgets) can be set up without an integrations manager, like all of https://t2bot.io/ (ironically, given Dimension was originally targeted at t2bot.io). People do still use it though to configure self-hosted platforms with their very own Element, Synapse, bridges, and bots. </p>
<p>While I still probably won't have much time personally to maintain it, PRs are certainly accepted. Dimension is a bit complex to work within and test, but people in #dimension:t2bot.io should be able to help out.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, we're massively pleased to announce the third major release of the TS/JS bridging library <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/3.0.0">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>. This release contains several large breaking changes to the previous way of life, most notably we have stopped using the matrix-js-sdk for most of our code, instead using the matrix-bot-sdk (Hi TravisR , we see you up there!).</p>
<p>There are several reasons why we went this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notably, this library focuses work on simply implementing APIs and bridge/bot logic. There is no additional cruft to support client use-cases or browsers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's historically had a brilliant coverage of the CS and AS APIs, and has been extremely flexible to add new stable and unstable APIs to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the start of this project, it was the only library with a complete Typescript coverage. Typescript types continue to be extremely useful to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're hoping to make use of the upcoming encrypted appservices support, to replace the slightly janky pantalaimon support the bridge library currently uses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to Travis and the matrix.org bridge team for working through these changes!</p>
<p>There are a bunch of common sense improvements that break API compatibility in this release also, so please be sure to check them out and update. We don't anticipate supporting 2.X except for extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll be updating the matrix-org suite of bridges over the coming weeks so please watch for bugs and let us know how we're doing!</p>

<p>You might remember my short story from last TWIM about the race between different translators? Seems like that one was good enough to motivate a few people to contribute translations. While those don't seem to be 100% complete yet, we saw a significant jump in translation percentages (especially Portuguese), so thank you to everyone who contributed to that!</p>
<p>Thulinma also made the whole userprofile scrollable, which improves the experience on small screens a lot. He also implemented message deduplication by event id, which is required by the spec to be done on the client side. This fixes a lot of duplicates when using conduit and your join event appearing 2~3 times on synapse.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue with how different homeservers update one time key counts and added some additional code to remove old one time keys, if we ever uploaded to many (which might have happened in the past in a few edge cases). We also now escape img tags in usernames correctly in more places, redundant date separators when paginating back in a room should not appear anymore and tastytea decreased the margins on blockquotes, so that they look less jarring and take up less space.</p>

New badges has been added in the Readme of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2</a> and the sample (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2-sample">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2-sample</a>) has been updated to use this new dependency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Element Android 1.2.1 has been release to the beta channel of the PlayStore and should be push on production on next Monday. It includes improvement for the Spaces (still in beta) and improvement for the VoIP. Full changelog can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/releases/tag/v1.2.1">https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/releases/tag/v1.2.1</a></li>

<p>v0.6.0-beta.2 has been published of <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> as an early version to support encryption on bots and improvements to appservices. It's a bit self-directed to figure out how it works, but <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-bot-sdk:t2bot.io">#matrix-bot-sdk:t2bot.io</a> is available to try and help out.</p>
<p>Please give it a go and report bugs. The final v0.6.0 release is expected to contain not only encryption support for bots, but also appservices and real documentation. For now though, it's just the bots.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/patience">Patience</a>, a full stack integration testing approach for Matrix clients and servers, has added initial support for Hydrogen this week. As it already supported Element Web, we now have a (basic) system for testing multiple clients together which is taking shape! ü•≥ From here, we plan to add configuration options to express the permutations of clients you want to test together.</p>
<p>This project is still in its early stages, but we hope to eventually have support for many different clients and then use it to test common flows like user verification, which can differ quite a lot across clients.

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>You may be wondering: what's up with all of these abandoned MSCs?? The answer is that the matrix-org/matrix-doc repo <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3367">changed its base branch</a> to <code>main</code> to help preserve the git history since the spec website rewrite. In doing so, all PRs were automatically updated to the new base branch by github... except those that were coming from deleted users and repos. Those ones were simply closed!</p>
<p>But as they seemed to be have been effectively abandoned by their authors, it was more of a cleanup than an accident. However, if your MSC was affected by this change and you would like to continue it, please contact someone in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-office:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-office:matrix.org</a> and we'll help you out.</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of this week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2448">MSC2448: Using BlurHash as a Placeholder for Matrix Media</a>!</p>
<p>MSC2448 defines a way for clients to include a &quot;blurhash&quot;, or a short, textual representation of a blurred version of an image, inside events which other clients can show while waiting for thumbnails to download from media servers. This replaces the potentially blank space while an image's thumbnail is loading with a (IMO) beautiful alternative!</p>
<p>Yes I wrote this MSC... but I swear it's what <a href="https://github.com/anoadragon453/pick-a-spec">the script</a> picked! We do not question the script!!</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/08/31/synapse-1-41-1-released">Synapse 1.41.1 is out</a> and it contains patches for <strong>two security vulnerabilities</strong> which could inappropriately disclose private room metadata to unauthorized users on a participating homeserver. Please upgrade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">Room Version 9</a> is coming in Synapse 1.42 next week. This version fixes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3373">an oversight</a> in which event fields are protected from redaction in room version 8, making it possible for restricted rooms to break if a join event is redacted. Because event IDs are based on the redaction algorithm, we can't fix this without creating a new room version.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility across the federation, Synapse 1.42 will still instruct clients to create restricted rooms using room version 8. Synapse 1.43, scheduled for release on 21 September, will begin instructing clients to use room version 9 instead.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had a race between 3 Translators this week. All 3 of them were trying really hard, so in my opinion every placement is a first place, buuuuuut Thulinma actually came first by bringing the Dutch translation from 5% to 100%. A few hours later Priit came in as a close second updating the Estonian translation to 100%. ISSOtm noticed that and tried to catch up which resulted in a 3rd place finish for the French translation. Now I understand the excitement people feel watching others compete in sports without having to do anything themselves!</p>
<p>red_sky (nheko.im) meanwhile fought a much more difficult enemy, Apple documentation and code signing! To be honest, I expected him to be beaten, but Nheko's DMGs are now actually properly signed and notarized. So if you are on macOS, you should now see less ugly warnings when installing Nheko. All nightlies building of the master branch are signed as well as our future releases.</p>
<p>In more community contributions, resolritter fixed the right click menu not working on replies. So you can copy a link from a reply now by right-clicking it without having to scroll up. Thulinma fixed window alerts not working when using conduit, because Conduit does not implement the /notifications endpoint Nheko uses and he helped me debug and fix device lists not showing up when using Conduit as well as sessions always getting rotated in &quot;Send encrypted messages to verified devices only&quot; mode.</p>
<p>In our work to stabilize E2EE we also now require a proper secrets daemon running on Linux (and other platforms, but there it is always provided by the OS). This is used to store the pickle key as well as the cross-signing secrets, so that an attacker can't read the from the config file. We already used such a daemon before, but we failed silently and we didn't use it for the pickle key until now. So if this prevents you from running Nheko, please open an issue so that we can work on a solution. Those APIs can be really fickle so additional testing and feedback would help us out a lot!</p>
<p>Also exciting is that Nheko now supports playing encrypted audio and video files without storing a temporary unencrypted copy on disk as well as animated images like WebP and GIF! It took us a while to figure out a proper solution, but now you can send animated stickers and you will finally be able to understand why other people were lauging at still images. (We also had to fix some bugs in our sticker editor, where we didn't add the mimetype to the sticker info for that.)</p>
<p>Some more embarrassing news, I didn't know I was a moderator in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:fachschaften.org">#conduit:fachschaften.org</a>, so I happily pinged everyone in the room while discussing room mentions. To prevent that from happening in the future, Nheko now shows a red warning above the message input if you will be pinging the whole room to give you time to reconsider. If that is not enough to stop me from doing that, we might require confirmation before sending such messages in the future, but so far this seems to work. Pinging everyone by accident can really scare you and composing a message in Matrix shouldn't be scary!</p>
<p>I hope I didn't forget anything and please make sure you check out Conduit, since they are doing a great job in revealing bugs in Nheko!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cvwright:matrix.org">cvwright</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/circles-ios">Circles</a> is a project to build a secure, end-to-end encrypted social network, using Matrix as the foundation.</p>
<h4 id="news">News</h4>
<p>We're getting very close to a real App Store launch.  The latest beta release this week is <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/cWuDwqpG">0.98</a>  This version might be The One!  So please, if you haven't tried Circles in a while, give this one a shot.  Also please share the link with any friends and family who you think might be interested.  The current signup token has plenty of slots for everyone.</p>
<p>If you want to see some activity in your circles, invite me to follow your Community circle and I'll invite you to follow back.  I'm @cvwright:kombucha.social.</p>
<h4 id="warning">WARNING</h4>
<p>If you've been using Circles with your own (non-Kombucha) server, you probably DO NOT WANT this version.  Support for bring-your-own-server will return very soon after our App Store launch.</p>
<h4 id="latest-updates">Latest updates</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Broke and then re-enabled new account signup.  Thanks to everyone who helped diagnose this one, and sorry if you were unable to sign up using a recent build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a weeks-old bug where posting a message into a circle would then send you back to your list of all your social circles.  Big thanks to Yosef for bringing this to my attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug in recent 0.9x builds where the Matrix rooms underlying circles and groups were being created with invalid encryption parameters.  If you've been unable to post anything, this is the likely culprit.  The fix is to update to the latest build, then delete your old circles/groups and create new ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have a new icon.  It's blue!  I was worried that Apple might think the old icon looked too much like the Apple Photos icon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New and improved interface for managing your account information.  Added support for changing your password and for deactivating your account.  I hope you never want this last one, but Apple requires it for apps that allow you to create accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed support for Markdown formatting in posts and image captions.  This is a sad one, but unfortunately the performance of the open source library that we were using for Markdown just wasn't up to the task.  On the bright side, our timelines load much more quickly now, and the scrolling should be much smoother.  Look for Markdown support to return with the release of iOS 15 later this year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another update to the Recent Activity list.  Now it should refresh itself automatically if/when it initially comes up empty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved layout and usability on iPad.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tobi_fh:matrix.org">tobi</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CoMatrix project enables the usage of the Matrix protocol (more precisely Matrix Client-Server API) for constrained IoT devices via CoAP and CBOR in a constrained network (e.g. a 802.15.4/6LoWPAN network).</p>
<p>CoMatrix provides a gateway, which ports Matrix to CoAP/CBOR/(DTLS). This gateway communicates with constrained IoT devices on one side via CoAP+CBOR and translates to the Matrix protocol on the other side (i.e. HTTP+JSON). CoMatrix also provides a client library (for RIOT-OS) which is a starting point to implement CoMatrix clients (for constrained devices) which are able to interact with Matrix homeservers via the gateway.</p>
<p>Currently CoMatrix supports the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sending of messages to a Matrix room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receiving the last message of a Matrix room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User registration at a Matrix Synapse HS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joining a Matrix room upon invitation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Login of a user at a Matrix Synapse HS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logout of a user at a Matrix Synapse HS</p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@thejhh:matrix.org">thejhh</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have made a small 120k pipeline-agent software (including all dependencies except NodeJS v8)  which can run on multiple platforms (including OpenWRT) and takes pipeline work over the Matrix protocol. In the end it's going to be used to setup things like VPN connections between gateways. </p>
<p>We also have a commercial web portal almost published where one can create web apps and configure pipelines to process the results. And yes, the portal also uses Matrix as its persistent storage -- it was implemented using my Matrix CRUD Repository from last week :)</p>
<p>The agent software (pipeline-runner) is open source  and has zero (0) runtime dependencies except NodeJS, and available from here: https://github.com/sendanor/pipeline-runner -- It's still in early development, though.</p>

<li>GSOC! abbyck/Abhinav's email bridge</li>
<li>Bridge team has been busy, on the EMS side we've released Signal/WA for early bird testing.</li>
<li>Landmark changes in bridge libraries: we've released 3.0.0-rc1 of matrix-appservice-bridge. Both the IRC bridge and the Gitter bridge have tested it with great results.</li>
<li>Tadzik has been making massive gains on the IRC bridge, formatting tweaks and bugs being nailed.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>This week, we tagged the v0.5.0 release candidate, which contains two major advancements on the encryption front: support for server-side key backups and support for cross-signing. The addition of these features makes Dendrite significantly more user-friendly, as it is now possible to log out or share keys across devices without losing your conversations.</p>
<p>We'll be aiming to finalise this release next week. Stay tuned in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Sytest compliance currently sits at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 65%, up from 61% last time</p>
</li>

<p>Server-server APIs: 92%, same as last time</p>

<p>We are on track to release Synapse 1.41 next week. This version will use an unstable property proposed by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: Room version capabilities</a> to advertise to clients that they may create restricted rooms using Room Version 8, despite the default room version remaining at 6 for the time being.</p>
<p>This strikes a balance between the broad compatibility of an older default room version, while still making newer features available <em>when requested</em> at room creation time. However, from next week you are more likely to encounter v8 rooms, so please do ensure your homeserver is running at least 1.40.</p>
<p>I'd also like to tip my hat to Element employee Olivier, who has put in the work to ensure that tagged Sygnal releases are automatically built and uploaded to Docker Hub via GitHub Actions. Thanks, Olivier!</p>

Do note that if you are using the master branch or latest tag for Docker it may cause a breaking change in the future when the work starts being merged. Highly suggest moving to version tags regardless of the deployment method. If you are using <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> it has been updated to v1.0.0 as of writing so pulling the latest master there is advised.</p>

<p>If the car wasn't enough, I bring more news! Our matrix.org bridge library, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> has had a total shakeup. Version <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/3.0.0-rc1">3.0.0-rc1</a> is out and with it comes the migration from the matrix-js-sdk to the matrix-bot-sdk. This is a massive change underneath that should result in faster performance, better typings and hopefully lower memory footprints too.</p>
<p>I'd encourage everyone using this library to update and see how well it works for you! The IRC and Gitter bridges have already experimented with this change and have seen good results, so I look forward to hearing feedback :)</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now shows you the verification status of all devices in a room as well as in the memberlist. This is important so you can tell, if an unverified device may get access to a message, if you send it. You can always disable sending messages to unverified devices for extra peace of mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>callum's work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">Token Authenticated Registration</a> got merged! üéâ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manu's room directory (finally) got merged. This means you can now discover public rooms on your server and join them by clicking the room directory button, that Nheko had for 3 years but was disabled until now! Support for the room directories of other servers as well as filtering by network should come in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is now an &quot;Allow them in&quot; button on pending knocks in the timeline, joins via room membership in a different room now tell you, what user's server was used to sign off on the join and you can set a room to restricted or knock only. (You currently can't change the list of allowed servers though).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dialogs should now have a close button again on Windows, the emoji search field now clears on closing the emoji picker and we added a workaround for stickers not showing on Element iOS, because iOS can't display stickers without a thumbnail, even if a thumnail makes no sense for stickers. (We just copy the sticker url into the thumbnail url.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko can now download encryption keys from online key backup. Uploading to online key backup will come soon(tm).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are interested, I will talk about Nheko tomorrow (21.08. starting 16:10) at FrOSCon in the Matrix dev room. Make sure you check out the other talks too, if you speak German! https://programm.froscon.de/2021/events/2706.html</p>

<p>Updates from the teams</p>
<p><strong>Delight team</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This week, our web, iOS and Android engineers are all enjoying some time off. </li>
<li>On backend, we‚Äôve completed pagination of the Spaces Summary. This week, we‚Äôve been looking at performance improvements to the Summary API.</li>
<li>We intend to mark room Version 8 as the preferred version for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083 restricted rooms</a> on matrix.org and in Synapse 1.41 (due for release next week) via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244</a>. Once this change is made, Element clients will show UI to create restricted rooms within a Space, and prompt users to upgrade rooms if necessary when making them restricted.</li>
<li>Our design team is exploring some tweaks on how to make Spaces a little bit clearer and easier to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Web</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We released 1.8.1 which fixed some regressions with calls - sorry for any failed calls!</li>
<li>Work on our threads prototype continues. We‚Äôre hoping to have something to look at internally next week.</li>
<li><a href="https://sentry.matrix.org/sentry/riot-web/">Sentry</a> submission support has been added to Rageshakes. We expect to enable this on https://app.element.io next week.</li>
<li>We‚Äôve been fixing some bugs around cross-signing, Windows font rendering, and image blur hashing.</li>
<li>Our new triage process has been published <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/wiki#issue-triage">on the wiki</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Element Alpha work is complete. This is a new app for internal testing. A QR code is available on every PR like this <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/pull/4635">one</a> to install the build on a device. Only devices registered in the Element Apple Developer account can install this app. </li>
<li>Improved notification content: No more ‚ÄúMessage‚Äù notification.</li>
<li>Fixed some timeline layout issues.</li>
<li>Media upload sizing: We added a prompt when sending video to select the resolution of the sent video. Media size prompt can be disabled in settings.</li>
<li>URL preview work has started.</li>
<li>App Navigation improvement: Working on room navigation to prepare the ground for threading.</li>
<li>On the performance side, we are working on room messages lazy loading to improve application speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>

<tr><td><code>bot.add_message_listener(example_handler)</code></td><td><code>@bot.listener.on_message_event</code><br />or<br /><code>@bot.listener.on_custom_event</code></td><td>In version 1, each the <code>bot.add_message_listener</code> method was used on message handler functions for them to react to messages. In version 2, this has been replaced by a decorator, <code>@bot.listener.on_message_event</code>. A similar decorator, <code>@bot.listener.on_custom_event(event)</code> can be used to react to other events. For information on supported events, refer to the <a href="https://matrix-nio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nio.html#module-nio.events.room_events">matrix-nio docs</a>.</td></tr>

In version 2 it is also possible to login using a SSO login token as well. As before, the homeserver argument is required, and the session_stored_file argument is optional.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>match.args #For message &quot;one two three&quot;, returns &quot;two three&quot;</code></td><td><code>match.args #For message &quot;one two three&quot;, returns [&quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;]</code></td><td>In version 1, <code>match.args</code> returned a string. In version 2, <code>match.args</code> returns a list of strings.</td></tr>

<blockquote>
<p>Since element now landed voice message support I build a small maubot plugin which prevents audio and voice messages as those cannot yet get restricted by power level.</p>
<p>It starts by warning you via replies, after a configured amount of warnings goes over to kicking and after a certain amount of kicks it will ban you in the room the event was sent in.</p>
<p>The counter is global so if a user in room A runs out of warnings and the same user sents a voice message in room B where the bot is present the bot will ban the user also in room B without further warnings.</p>

I present to you <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-poweredup">matrix-poweredup</a>! This is a little bot that connects to any LEGO PoweredUp devices (using the node-poweredup library). You can then start controlling the motors via Matrix, and have the sensors report back into the Matrix room. It's currently limited to a RC buggy I picked up over the weekend but it's very extendible. It also includes a web application to control things via a gamepad, if that's your bag.</p>

You can also use it to share updates with your friends, without a creepy advertising company data mining every word.</p>
<p>Circles features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social &quot;wall&quot;-like functionality and timeline of friends' posts for each of your social circles, e.g. Friends, Family, Neighbors, Coworkers, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypted photo galleries</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recent updates to the Circles beta include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for use with any Matrix homeserver, including a new encrypted recovery and key backup mechanism that should be compatible with other Matrix clients like Element.  (<strong>Please note</strong>: For use with standard Matrix accounts, be sure to select &quot;Advanced options&quot; at login and enter your passphrase for key backup / recovery.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emoji reactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown formatting for text posts and image captions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better support for larger screens (iPad)</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>Work on Spaces continues with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946</a> (Space Summary API), specifically revolving around how to paginate the summary. This has called into question how <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1898#issuecomment-896717689">pagination across Matrix works in general</a>, which is a prime target for refactoring - perhaps an upcoming consistent pagination MSC? :)</p>
<p>Otherwise, as listed above, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289</a> (room v8) has merged! It brings with it the ability to grant the ability to join a room based on one's membership in another room. While the was originally conceived for allowing users that are part of one Space to be allowed to join rooms, it has been built upon in other creative ways. Such as in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3325">MSC3325</a>, where it could be used to make room upgrades more seamless!</p>
<p>And finally, a special thanks to Lukas Lihotzki for all of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Alukaslihotzki+sort%3Aupdated-desc+">their spec PRs</a> this week. They're been stellar!</p>

<p>Big news! <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/08/10/synapse-1-40-0-released">Synapse 1.40 is out</a> and it comes with support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">Room Version 8</a>! Version 8 includes &quot;<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>&quot; which are only visible and joinable by members of a specific Space (or via direct invitation). This finally makes it <em>useful</em> to use Spaces as containers for private rooms, like you might with a company, guild, or open source community. Once invited to the parent Space, members can join and discover the otherwise private rooms within. No more <code>/invite</code> spam every time you bring someone on board!</p>
<p>Also: If you've received any push notifications in Element Android or Element iOS this week, they've come via our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/releases/tag/v0.10.0">shiny new stateless release of Sygnal</a>!

All of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10245">big</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10498">pieces</a> are now merged for full-fat federated historical messages in Synapse üí™</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> was also consolidated and updated to propose the <code>/batch_send</code> implementation we're using in Synapse. There is also a plan for how this can be backwards compatible with existing room versions so no need for those pesky room upgrades. This will help us be able to jump in early and use this for Gitter as soon as the new event types become stable.

<h3 id="ement-el">Ement.el</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alphapapa:matrix.org">alphapapa</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el">Ement.el</a>, a Matrix client for Emacs, continues to improve.  Some of the changes in the past week:</p>
<p><em>Additions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Messages may now be written in Org-mode syntax (a format similar to but more powerful than Markdown).  Internally, it's automatically converted to HTML and sent as the message's formatted body.  This supports nearly any HTML feature that Org-mode can export to, including rich text, bulleted and numbered lists, and even tables (this message is being written directly in Org syntax; see a table of new bindings at the end of this list).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An optional pop-out compose buffer makes writing and editing long messages easier (also being used for this message).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read/fully-read marker lines are now displayed after the last read message, and these are synced with the server and other clients.  These lines can also be placed with a command, making it easy to return to a certain event later, even on other clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usernames at the beginning of messages may optionally be colored to match the addressee's username.  This especially helps following conversations in busy rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ement.el is confirmed to work with Pantalaimon, the E2EE-aware reverse proxy, making encrypted rooms work transparently.  Once Pantalaimon is installed and configured, connecting through it with Ement.el is trivial, and this step is documented in the readme.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Improvements</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Per-user displayname and message colors have improved (and configurable) contrast ratio with the background color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reactions are sorted by the number of users who have sent each one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unread rooms are displayed more prominently in the room list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New default bindings make it quick to jump to the mentions and notifications buffers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync timeouts are handled more gracefully and Ement.el re-syncs automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various minor fixes and enhancements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And here's the new-bindings table, written directly in Org syntax and sent automatically as HTML:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Binding</th><th>Command</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>S-SPC</td><td>Scroll up</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-SPC</td><td>Move to last-read marker</td></tr>
<tr><td>C-k</td><td>Delete message</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-g M-l</td><td>Switch to room list buffer</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-g M-m</td><td>Switch to mentions buffer</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-g M-n</td><td>Switch to notifications buffer</td></tr>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You now get notified, if someone reuses a megolm session index, because that in theory could be used by an attacker to send seemingly verified messages. We also now render decryption errors more nicely and users can now explicitly request decryption keys (in addition to the automatic key requests in the background that already existed). We also fixed an issue, that could corrupt the database when using the flatpak and if you lost your network connection, Nheko should now reconnect faster instead of potentially waiting 17 minutes for a TCP timeout. The storage for cross-signing secrets should now be more reliable, you can close image popups with the &quot;Escape&quot; key, close the current room by double clicking it and a few more miscellaneous bugfixes.</p>
<p>You can track the remaining E2EE bits, before we declare our E2EE support as stable, in this comment now: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/23#issuecomment-894689158</p>

<p>I find &quot;read it later&quot; services like Pocket extremely useful, but fail hard at actually keeping my read it later list at a sane level. For me it's hard to maintain the list and actually read through things as choosing which one to process feels overwhelming due to the amount of items.</p>
<p>Randomization to the rescue! I made a Pocket plugin for Maubot which gives me a random article from my list and allows me to easily archive it. Now I don't need to decide which article to pick, the computer does that for me!</p>

After a <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-raises-30m-as-matrix-explodes/">moment of reading this huge news</a>, however, I was relieved - Matrix has <em>exploded in popularity</em>, and <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> have all new funding to keep driving the ecosystem forward.

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>

</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>While a quiet week for MSC state changes (shown above), there's still plenty of work and collaboration happening!</p>
<p>Spaces work marches forward as MSC3083 has been merged - allowing for users to join a room in a space based on their membership in a space. We think this will really help with the management of Spaces that contain lots of rooms that are otherwise invite-only.</p>
<p>Otherwise <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3291">MSC3291</a> (Muting in VoIP calls) has been receiving positive feedback this week!</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289</a> (room v8) is ticking along as the implementation is tested in Synapse and Complement tests.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/29/synapse-1-39-0-released">Synapse 1.39.0</a> is out! </p>
<p>Of all the pull requests we landed, my hat is off to MadLittleMods and his Graphviz prowess in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10250">#10250</a>, which moves us one step further down the path toward <em><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a>: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms.</em> Mmm. Graphs.</p>
<p>But back to Synapse! You should check out the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/29/synapse-1-39-0-released">release announcement</a>, but the bulk of the work this cycle went into internal cleanups. Synapse should also be slightly more performant, reliable, and should log fewer spurious errors. Of note, ShadowJonathan did a lot of work with <code>pyupgrade</code> and <code>com2ann</code> to move the entire codebase to more modern Py3.6+ conventions and inline type annotations; thanks, ShadowJonathan!</p>
<p>Synapse 1.39 also continues our march toward unifying Synapse's interface for extension modules, and we've now exposed plugin hooks for the <code>account_validity</code> option, and experimentally implemented hooks for third party event rules.</p>
<p>Lastly, special thanks to kroeckx who has submitted 17 pull requests against our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">SyTest test suite</a> in the past month, mainly arising from running SyTest against <a href="https://conduit.rs/">Conduit</a>. Thank you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello! This week, I created a <a href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/matrix-synapse-backend">matrix 1-click app</a> on the DigitalOcean marketplace. It's basically a pre-baked droplet image that is pre-configured with synapse, element-web, caddy, postgres, plus some setup and moderation tools. My intent was to make self-hosting a Matrix system as easy as pointing some DNS records and running a single script. It makes a lot of sense for smaller, more casual Matrix homeservers, and can serve as a good starting point! It also includes some small utility scripts - <code>./reset-password</code>, <code>./new-user</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Secrets like the postgres password and registration password are generated on first boot, there's no sensitive data baked into the image. Of course, it would be nice to be able to verify this - the source code used to build the image is being open sourced. I'm just waiting for some internal processes to finish. It will show up at https://github.com/digitalocean/marketplace-matrix somewhat soon!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lazy joining of IRC users (see below)</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Bridge aliveness can be tracked from bridge bot presence</p>

<p>Ident replies can be customized by the admin for all users, default to mxid hash</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest impact feature this time around is configurable lazy joining IRC users which improves the experience of joining massive IRC channels by not flooding the homeserver with join events. This is now the default and can be changed globally by the bridge admin or overridden per room by users.</p>
<p>Many fixes here and there. Still a few issues left before 1.0 and a lot of testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ajbura:matrix.org">ajbura</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cinny is a web-based matrix client focusing primarily on simple, elegant and secure interface.</p>
<p>The story started when a friend of mine introduced me to matrix and even after his help it was too difficult for me to get around with Element. I guess it was because Element is too different from other popular chat apps. Then I tried to find a good alternative for web but no success.</p>
<p>That's when me and my friend thought about creating Cinny. For the few weeks we were doing it for fun but when we shared a screenshot of the prototype, the response from people was surprising and that's when things got interesting. We got to know that a lot of people out there are looking for a simple and modern client and so we started building it.</p>
<p>Screenshot on Chrome desktop (see below)</p>
<h4 id="features">Features</h4>
<p>Cinny support the following features:</p>

<p>This summer's gone by so fast it feels like it's only been a week! Here's a summary of what's happened with Ruma the past few weeks:</p>
<p>We have had a productive summer with our two Google Summer of Code students, Adam Blanchet and Devin Ragotzy. Adam finished implementing the last of our Identity Service API endpoints, bringing us to 100% implementation of all the Matrix API endpoints! (And we promise there are no bugs because &quot;Rust,&quot; right?)</p>
<p>Besides improving the Matrix ecosystem, Devin has been helping the Rust ecosystem at large by writing some Clippy lints to improve our codebase and upstreaming his additions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I made <a href="https://github.com/davidmehren/maubot-ldap-inviter">maubot-ldap-inviter</a>, a maubot plugin that (surprisingly) invites users into Matrix rooms, according to their membership in LDAP groups.</p>
<p>We are switching from RocketChat to Matrix in the next round of a software engineering course where students work on software projects in small groups.</p>
<p>RocketChat has a LDAP sync, which we previously used to auto-add students and tutors to the chatrooms they need to be in (global announcement room, helpdesk, chat for their group etc.).
As there was no such feature for Matrix, I built the bot over the last few days.</p>
<p>It's still somewhat specific to our LDAP setup, but if anyone wants to use the bot and has questions, just open an issue in the repo!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a personal project I started a couple of weeks ago. I was dreaming of a good open source solution for OneNote or GoodNotes far a long time. There are already great projects, like<a href="https://xournalpp.github.io/">Xournal++</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lovasoa/whitebophir">Whitebophir</a>. But, they do not include the extent of possibilities to flexible host, collaborate and structuring the notes I have wished for.</p>
<p>Recently, I was thinking about the exact requirements I wanted for such a whiteboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Real time synchronization (cloud storage)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authentication/account infrastructure (to invite and collaborate on one whiteboard)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding/Removing ppl to a whiteboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliable hosting (when having cloud storage, I don't want to trust a one-man project to continue hosting. And a lot of ppl won‚Äôt self-host.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structuring whiteboards in categories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Viewing history and display which part has been drawn by which person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annotating other whiteboards with new layers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hosting for media like PDF's and images</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at this list, Matrix was such an obvious choice. I could comment every point but basically with: &quot;A whiteboard should be a Matrix room&quot; everything is said.</p>
<p><strong>TheBoard (probably not the final name) is exactly that.</strong> The frontend is not done yet, but already in an okay looking and usable state.</p>
<p><strong>Before trying it out:</strong> It takes really long to log in with an account with lots of rooms. So, I highly recommend to NOT use your main Matrix account.
Additionally, it is necessary to tag rooms as whiteboards. (really un-intuitive UX that will be improved) But for now the + button needs to be pressed and a (empty (not necessary but recommended) AND UNENCRYPTED) room needs to be selected.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I just (on Friday) finished initial spaces support to categorize the whiteboard in notebooks (aka spaces). They can only be create within a matrix client that supports spaces. But they will be displayed properly in TheBoard. (see screenshot)</p>
<p>Any problems, ideas and feedback is highly welcome as a github issue or in the matrix channel #TheBoard:matrix.org.</p>
<h4 id="tldr">TLDR:</h4>
<p>This project is whiteboard (similar to OneNote) which is</p>
<p>using Matrix as its backend. All your drawings are stored in matrix rooms
on your matrix server and are accessible to anyone who is invited.</p>

Specifically, new Element Android sessions were unable to decrypt messages in end-to-end encrypted conversations.</p>
<p>‚öôÔ∏è Otherwise, we've been doing quite a lot of internal / infrastructure work. Notably, we've completed the move from three separate CI systems to just one: GitHub Actions. We're also, for the first time, publishing Debian packages for our Release Candidates. We hope these changes move us towards a more reliable and seamless release process.</p>

<p>A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<hr />
<p>This week brings plenty of usability improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is now the <code>list-contacts</code> bot command to--you guessed it!--list the Matrix puppets of all of your contacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's now possible to sync a chat with a LINE user by inviting their Matrix puppet to a DM, instead of having to wait for someone to send you a message in LINE for the bridge to auto-sync it. This is especially useful with <code>list-contacts</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LINE group chats that haven't been used recently are now included in the set of chats that get bridged on a <code>sync</code> operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of chats to sync at startup time &amp; on-demand is now configurable, as a bridge config setting &amp; a parameter to the <code>sync</code> command, respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes make it possible to sync LINE chats/groups that previously may not have gotten synced, due to the intricacies of how LINE on Chrome handles chat history (especially on first use of the bridge).</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LorenDB has rewritten the invite dialog as well as the memberlist in Qml. This means they work now much more reliably and show the users in appropriate colors and a few other small improvements.</p>
<p>Apart from that, Nheko now has support for sending stickers! This is based on Sorunome's awesome <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2545">MSC2545</a>, so no integration manager is needed and it is trivially easy to share your sticker packs (just invite someone into the same room!). You can use stickers from your account data or upload stickers into a room so every room member can use it. If you found a sticker pack you like, you can enable a pack from a room globally by going into Nheko's room settings. You can check my current preferred set of stickers here: matrix:r/nico's-stickers:neko.dev</p>
<p>Currently you can't edit a sticker pack yet from Nheko. Support for that will come in the near future. Until then you can use either FluffyChat, Element's DevTools or <a href="https://github.com/deepbluev7/stickerpicker">my hack to import Telegram sticker packs into a room</a>. Note that Nheko's sticker pack support is incompatible with integration server based sticker packs like the one Element uses. On the other hand, you don't need an integration manager to use them! Custom emote support based in the image packs MSC is coming in the future to Nheko too.</p>
<p>Furthermore we fixed some bugs to move E2EE in Nheko out of Beta. We are close now and we have a plan!</p>
<p>That's all, don't get your hands too sticky!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/02/this-week-in-matrix-2021-07-02">three weeks already since our last update</a> and we have a fair amount of new things to report.</p>
<p>As I write this, our interns Alejandro and Kai are at GUADEC, the annual GNOME conference, presenting during the interns lightning talk. The former has submitted a couple of merge requests (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/793">!793</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/794">!794</a>) that were necessary for the UI to accommodate his upcoming multi-account work. The latter has provided <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/788">a view for when no room is selected</a>. As for their mentor, Julian, he changed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/795">member loading so it only happens once a room is opened</a>, to improve performances. He also changed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/796">Matrix event handling to use <code>SyncRoomEvent</code></a>, which paves the way for display of various message types in the timeline of a room.</p>
<p>Giuseppe offered two nice additions to the login view:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in the form, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/783">one can now type enter to login</a> (it previously required to click on the button in the headerbar)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/791">errors are now displayed</a>, providing useful feedback on why the login may have failed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And to conclude this summary, we welcome üéâ newcomer Veli Tasalƒ± who fixed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/issues/802">a papercut I reported</a>: <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/787">when typing long messages, buttons next to the message entry were expanding along with the entry and now they keep nicely aligned</a>.</p>

<p>Related to the SMS bridge, I've made <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-syncproxy">mautrix-syncproxy</a>, which is a microservice to do the <code>/sync</code>ing required for end-to-bridge encryption (to-device events and such) in the cloud and forwarding the data to the normal appservice transaction endpoint. When combined with <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-wsproxy">mautrix-wsproxy</a>, it allows the SMS bridge to only have a websocket connection, which uses significantly less battery than a HTTP request every 30 seconds. The sync proxy partially implements <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3202">MSC3202</a> and the to-device part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> (partially because it only does individual users rather than all appservice-owned users).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several GNOME contributors and I have been following TWIM and really enjoyed the concept. Since open source is about <del>stealing</del> sharing ideas, we wanted to deploy something similar for GNOME.</p>
<p>I gave this room's beloved <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/twim-o-matic">twim-o-matic</a> a try and fiddled a bit with the code. But I soon found that it is too specialised for matrix.org. That's when I decided to write a project agnostic TWIx bot based on matrix-rust-sdk called <a href="https://github.com/haecker-felix/hebbot">Hebbot</a>!</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://thisweek.gnome.org/posts/2021/07/twig-1/">how it looks in practice with a companion website for GNOME</a>. If you‚Äôre interested in how it looks behind the scenes, <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/haeckerfelix/2021/07/16/introducing-this-week-in-gnome/">have a look at this blog post which explains how it works</a>.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/haecker-felix/hebbot/releases/tag/v1.0">released a first version</a> on July 17, but I‚Äôm already working on making it smarter for a next release. In the meantime you can already use it for your project!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week I have developed a new plugin for <a href="https://octoprint.org/">OctoPrint</a> which is a tool for controlling and monitoring 3D printers, which sends notifications about your prints and status of your 3D printer to matrix. The existing OctoSlack plugin also has Matrix support but fell foul of the /sync response changes in Synapse 1.38, and also sent the images from the camera to Matrix as inline images rather than m.image events, so they didn't render on some clients.</p>
<p>My new plugin can send messages on most events supported by OctoPrint, but the core events which are configurable through the OctoPrint web UI are print started, paused, completed and failed as well as print progress notifications. If you want Matrix notifications for your 3D prints, you can install the plugin through the official <a href="https://octoprint.org/">OctoPrint plugin repository</a> or by installing from the <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/octoprint-matrix-notifier-plugin">GitHub repository</a>. If you have any feature requests or pull requests, contributions to the plugin are very welcome.</p>
<p>Here is a preview of a print progress notification from something I was printing last night:</p>

Otherwise <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3245">MSC3245</a> (voice messages via extensible events) is moving along with final comment period proposed this week. The implementation in Element Web in reportedly working well, helping to prove the spec in practice. And finally, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3277">MSC3277</a> (scheduled messages) which appeared over the weekend to try and allow for scheduling events to send later in Matrix (and all the fun edge cases that come with it).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, we <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.0">released Dendrite 0.4.0 on Monday</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/12/dendrite-0-4-0-released">wrote a blog post about it</a>! It's taken us a little while to get to this release, but it includes a number of quality-of-life improvements and changes that will significantly reduce the amount of resources needed to run a Dendrite server. The full changelog is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.0">available on GitHub</a> and many juicy details in the aforementioned blog post, but at a high level this release includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All-new state storage, designed to reduce the amount of disk space that the roomserver takes up to store room state by aggressively deduplicating state blocks and snapshots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved appservice support, with a number of bridges now working with Dendrite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared secret registration (using the same API shape as Synapse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimisations in the federation API <code>/send</code> and <code>/get_missing_events</code> endpoints to reduce memory usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved state resolution v2 performance when dealing with power level events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per-room queuing to reduce head-of-line blocking on the roomserver input API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of bug fixes around invites, registration, sync and media, and 5 panics fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the release, we've been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Completing key notary support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing <code>state_default</code> for power levels in gomatrixserverlib</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolving some issues around rejecting invites, particularly when the remote server is not available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the cost of checking if the local server is in a given room</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since our last update, our Sytest compliance numbers have been on the rise again, taking us ever closer to our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 61%, up from 60% last time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 92%, up from 80% last time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appservice APIs: 52%</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But that's not the only thing new in Synapse 1.38. We also landed the ability to set an expiry time on cache entries, allowing you to reclaim memory from infrequently accessed caches. Configuring this to &quot;1h&quot; on matrix.org has already yielded a noticeable reduction in overall memory use üìâ:</p>

<p>And please, <em>feel free to try out this bridge!</em> It should be serviceable for day-to-day usage now. I still won't be able to host a public instance of it for a while, though (as it is fairly hefty due to having to run Chrome), so you'll have to self-host if you want to try it.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we fixed bugs. Switching room should now be quite a bit faster again and once Qt 6.3 is released with some important bugfixes, scrolling in Nheko should be super smooth. (We can't enable that flag yet, because of 3 bugs in the item pooling code in Qt.)</p>
<p>Other bugfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inline images sometimes wouldn't show, but now inline emotes and images should render once they are loaded! (This took me a year to figure out)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now send edits in encryted rooms again, if they are a reply to an event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No more reply fallback in the room list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At some point timed out verification requests started showing up on startup. That regression is fixed now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix rooms not showing up after login because we were off by one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix some cases where the loading spinner wouldn't stop animating and as such consistently use CPU, when a room is open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cache db transactions to reduce allocations and memory zeroing when loading a room or scrolling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix some edge cases in the blurhash decoding, that could lead to brownish image previews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix accepting an invite not placing you in the joined room.</p>

<p>After a month of hard work, we(I as GSoC student and kitsune  as mentor) have bindings with tests for almost all core classes and also initial version of the demo client, in which you can log in with a password or SSO, the server you enter is resolved automatically and also after successful login data is being synchronized. There is also a possibility to log out. So this part is on the same level as in Quotient.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nik:matrix.teckids.org">Nik</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the first weeks of July, <a href="https://teckids.org">Teckids e.V.</a> held their annual summer camp for kids between 9 and 15 years. This year, after we started introducing Matrix and Element as a chat platform from September 2020 onwards, the camp was heavily relying on the platform for various parts.</p>
<p>Before the camp started, we invited all 90 participants to a chat room to get together, share a bit about what they expect, already did with coding and technical stuff, talk about what food they'd like to have for the barbecue, and stuff like that. Many of them engaged in the discussion, and started exploring Element (before you ask, yes, we hat a lot of snow and party poppers üòõ!). Some got really excited that they could even change or add features to Element, or ask for such changes ‚Äì we had to promise to hold a session where we find out how to add one new animation to Element. Unfortunately, Element is developed on GitHub, so the potential young contributors are locked out by the exclusive Terms of Use there. We are trying to reach out to Element HQ to find a solution.</p>
<p>During the camp, verifying crypto sessions using emojis again made for a good party game to get to know each other (like, find the kid a nickname belongs to on the camp site, start verification, and compare emojis ‚Äì a lot of fun that we, again, did not even have to start, because someone always finds out about it and asks what it is about).</p>
<p>Now that everyone got to know Matrix for chatting, in one of our workshops, the participants discovered that not only people, but also devices can send messages, and react to replies ‚Äì in that workshop, the kids built a chat-ops IoT door beel (for their tent on site, or room at home). They soldered a circuit board to fit an ESP (MicroPython) micro controller on, and coded a small program (using templates with differing complexity levels), defining what the door bell should send when a button is pressed, on what messages to react, and the like. We produced a fun video about the project (German audio, English subtitles): https://eduvid.org/videos/watch/20a50c25-ecb4-48c0-9b13-de2548f290d4?subtitle=en . The (minimal and somewhat buggy) MicroPython client library is published as <a href="https://edugit.org/hacknfun/thema-mechatronik/mytrix">¬µtrix</a>.</p>
<p>Now, sadly, the event is over, and we slowly see (as expected, only a part of the) participants moving over to our long-term project chatrooms; we will start clearing the virtual camp site chatroom during the weekend to make room for a new group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asked about the regularity of these events, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nik:matrix.teckids.org">Nik</a> replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are still experimenting with our new camp formats. As bad as it all is, COVID caused a lot of innovation here because we were forced to leave the known roads we normally travelled, and now we are starting to integrate all that new stuff (like really embracing Matrix) into outdoor and presence events. I think we are on a really good way with it, and surely I will keep posting updates that might be of interest for the greater community.</p>

<p>Big(int) news! This week Matrix.org processed its 2^31st event, exceeding the range of a PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-numeric.html">integer column</a> for the first time. This caused a bit of a scramble in the aftermath of last week's spam attack, as we had a few <code>integer</code> columns in our schema which we needed to convert to <code>bigint</code>. Fortunately, we were able to complete the change sufficiently in advance (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8255">#8255</a>), and also took the opportunity to audit other columns and sequences in the database which could conceivably overflow. Synapse 1.38, due out next week, will automatically migrate homeservers when they upgrade. We run the migration as a background task, so homeservers should continue functioning as normal throughout, though they may use a bit more disk and memory, especially when rebuilding indexes for the new <code>bigint</code> column.</p>
<p>We're also starting to hone in on our team's goals for this quarter, and it's looking like our primary focus will be on improving room join speeds. Wish us luck!</p>
<p>Lastly, we're overjoyed to announce that <a href="https://github.com/reivilibre">@reivilibre</a>, a former intern on the backend team, joined Element this week! We can't wait to see where he helps us take Synapse!</p>

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line/">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>This week was spent on adding proper support for LINE user joins/leaves (though invites/kicks are still a TODO), bug fixes, and ease of deployment. Docker and systemd setups will be ready shortly.</p>
<p>And this bridge should soon be listed on https://matrix.org/bridges/, if it isn't already üôÇ Thanks madlittlemods (Eric Eastwood) for accepting <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/pull/1019">the PR</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://schildi.chat/">SchildiChat</a> is a fork of Element that focuses on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list for both direct messages and groups, which is a more familiar approach to users of other popular instant messengers.</p>
<p>There are two announcements that we can share with you this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SchildiChat for Android is back in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.spiritcroc.riotx">Google Play Store</a>! Users who have previously installed the release using our own F-Droid repo will be able to update without the need to re-install. All previous ways to install the app will remain available as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now help us translate SchildiChat using <a href="https://weblate.bubu1.eu/projects/schildichat/">Weblate</a>! Note that this only contains SchildiChat-specific translations, we continue to use <a href="https://translate.element.io/">Element's translations</a> where possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from that, we have mainly been focusing on smaller improvements and fixes, while staying up-to-date with new Element releases.</p>
<p>For more information about SchildiChat, feel free to visit our <a href="https://schildi.chat/">website</a> or check out our <a href="https://github.com/SchildiChat">source code</a>!</p>
<p>Also, feel free to join our Matrix rooms, which you can find in the new SchildiChat space: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#schildichat:matrix.org">#schildichat:matrix.org</a></p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spaces work is making progress. Some rooms can now be previewed. To improve that situation, I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3266">MSC to preview specific rooms</a>. Alternatively we will try to get the previews for the few rooms you aren't joined to from the space summary API, currently we are just fetching the existing state. You can also now join previewed rooms and the design of joining invites was adapted to match it.</p>
<p>red_sky‚òÑÔ∏è went through the pain of fixing the Windows builds after we changed our http backend last week. So if you want to try it out, you can test it on Windows. We also replaced the old, boring spinner with an animated Nheko logo. If you see that a lot and think it is Nheko's fault, don't hesitate to open an issue! But in most cases it will probably be your server. Sadly no screenshot of how the spinner looks like, my server is too fast and taking a proper screenshot is too much effort because of that. ;p</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue with updating device lists in the develop version of Nheko. If you were using the nightlies, now is a good time to update! In more E2EE news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3270">symmetric megolm backup</a> fixes the issues I had with the online key backup, so looking forward to implementing that.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The latest release of opsdroid is out with various fixes which can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/releases/tag/v0.23.0">the changelog</a>. The main point to note for matrix users is that older versions of matrix-nio (the matrix client library used by opsdroid) did not support the synapse change to omit <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10214">optional fields from sync</a>. Therefore if you are using our docker images you will need to update to 0.23 to get a container with the newest matrix-nio included.</p>
<p>The other change which is relevant to matrix users is that Oleg has added support for version 2 of the <a href="https://rasa.com/">Rasa NLU</a> framework, so you can once again do open source, self hosted natural language bots.</p>

<p>Thanks to Gwmngilfen  I touched RStudio and toyed a little with some data as well.</p>
<p>You can find some graphs over at https://github.com/MTRNord/server_stats_r_statistics/blob/main/scripts/rooms_members.md</p>
<p>For the first graph the credit fully goes to Gwmngilfen  :)</p>
<p>The second one is in log scale for both axis but essentially the same :)</p>
<p>This is obviously currently very spare but I hope to add more statistics when I understand R lang :) This is in fact my first time doing something with R so my skillset is limited :)</p>
