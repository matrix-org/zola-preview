<p>If you didn't read it already, I encourage you to read <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a>'s <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-special-2020">Matrix Holiday Special 2020</a> post. So much has happened this year! </p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@oleg:fiksel.info">Oleg</a> responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great summary! Very inspiring!</p>
<p>I have a feeling experiencing a revolution in how people perceive messaging. Now, public sector and multiple communities adopting Matrix, one cannot think of a world without Matrix any more.</p>
<p>Kudos to the Element team and to the wonderful Matrix community! ‚ô•Ô∏è</p>
<p>I'm very excited for the FOSDEM on Matrix!</p>

<p>What a wonderful year has been for matrix, and it looks like next year will be equally as exciting. I'm HYPED.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I'm hyped too. Simple statements like &quot;loads of different universities have rolled out Matrix for collaboration&quot; don't quite capture how much work is going on, and how much excitement there is to get the growth in the network we're soon to see. </p>

<p>We finally fixed the Windows build, so there are nightlies on Windows again! Also lorendb finished his profile work, which means that if you were using custom profiles before on one of the nightlies, you may need to login again, but the whole code is a lot cleaner now.</p>

Nothing too significant, but <code>.well-known</code>-unaware homeservers should be treated better, and Matrix identifiers with special characters (ahem, slashes) can now be turned to valid URIs (matrix.to or proper <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2312">Matrix URIs</a>). Also, room tags starting with a <code>.</code> are no more considered valid, you'll get <code>u.</code> prepended to them.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">Ansible playbook</a> is meant to easily let you run your own Matrix homeserver.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> now defaults to using the Postgres database engine for all bridges, bots and related services (ma1sd, Dimension, etc).</p>
<p>Previously we were only using Postgres for Synapse and couldn't reuse the same database server for other services.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/pull/740">this huge pull request</a>, we've added Postgres support to 17 other services.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jdreichmann">Johanna Dorothea Reichmann</a> for starting the work on it and for providing great input!</p>
<p>Existing installations will get automatically migrated from SQLite/nedb to Postgres the next time you run the playbook.</p>
<p>Not only does this bring better performance and compatibility, but also, being able to reuse the same Postgres database for services other than Synapse paves the way for us to introduce other Postgres-only services such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-signal">mautrix-signal</a> bridge (existing <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/pull/686">pull request</a>), etc.</p>

<h3 id="middleman">Middleman</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:elokapina.fi">kapina-jaywink</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Common accounts for support are tricky to handle due to needing the people using those accounts to keep separate clients open to use the common account. For this at Elokapina we created <em>Middleman</em>, which acts as a proxy between an account and a room.</p>
<p>It's a bit basic but works pretty well for pure text messages. Any messages in rooms where the bot is are relayed to the management room and any replies to those messages (prefixed with <code>!reply</code>) in the management room are relayed back. Optionally senders can be anonymised to enable a feedback bot.</p>
<p>Coming up is more configuration on for example ignoring non-mentions in rooms with lots of members and hopefully support for images and reactions in the not too long future.</p>
<p>Find it here: https://github.com/elokapina/middleman (built with nio-template).</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported something interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Threema published the source code for their apps this week: https://threema.ch/en/open-source</p>
<p>While that is not strictly Matrix related, it is great to see other E2EE enabled chat systems publishing the source code for their clients. It's the only way to verify their encryption actually works and is secure.</p>
<p>This move was announced a while ago, but I think that it actually happened now deserves a small shoutout! üéâ</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>Closed MSCs:</strong></p>

</ul>
<h4 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h4>
<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we made a healthy amount of progress on the MSCs in focus. A few members have also been iterating quite a bit on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a> for Spaces. Look for these MSCs to start landing come the first few weeks of the New Year as implementation work starts to relax a bit. The focus for next week is... Christmas! üéÑ</p>
<p>But first week of January will be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2844">MSC2844</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2366">MSC2366</a> (ready and done in key verification) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2790">MSC2790</a> (modal widgets).</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you haven't already seen it, we wrote a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/15/dendrite-2020-progress-update">Dendrite 2020 Progress Update blog post</a> detailing our year in Dendrite. It also includes an announcement for our new public <code>dendrite.matrix.org</code> homeserver, which is open for registration!</p>
<p>Today we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.4">Dendrite 0.3.4</a>, which is a performance and bug-fix release, including the following changes from the last two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The stream tokens for <code>/sync</code> have been refactored, giving PDUs, typing notifications, read receipts, invites and send-to-device messages their own respective stream positions, greatly improving the correctness of sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new roominfo cache has been added, which results in less database hits in the roomserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prometheus metrics have been added for sync requests, destination queues and client API event send perceived latency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event IDs are no longer recalculated so often in <code>/sync</code>, which reduces CPU usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync requests are now woken up correctly for our own device list updates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device list stream position is no longer lost, so unnecessary device updates no longer appear in every other sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A crash on concurrent map read/writes has been fixed in the stream token code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver input API no longer starts more worker goroutines than needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver no longer uses the request context for queued tasks which could lead to send requests failing to be processed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new index has been added to the sync API current state table, which improves lookup performance significantly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client API <code>/joined_rooms</code> endpoint no longer incorrectly returns <code>null</code> if there are 0 rooms joined</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver will now query appservices when looking up a local room alias that isn't known</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The check on registration for appservice-exclusive namespaces has been fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="github-gitlab-bridge">GitHub / Gitlab bridge</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone! It's been ages since I've talked about a personal project on here. I've been working on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-github">matrix-github</a> bridge, which is an all singing all dancing service to connect you to Github AND Gitlab. (Yes, it's now poorly named).</p>
<p>I've landed the initial bits to make GitLab work, so that you can join issues and MRs as rooms in the UI but there is more work to do to make that solid and more interactive. The thing I am most looking forward to is notifications for GitLab so I can get away from emails.</p>
<p>ALSO, off the back of TravisR's fantastic widget work, I've landed initial support for widgets in admin rooms and soon issue/PR rooms. The idea here being that widgets give you a nicer UI to control the bridge or render details like commits going past or diffs. All the groundwork for authenticating widgets against the bridge and rendering them is done, now it just needs features.</p>
<p>That's the highlights this week. I'm hoping to really tighten the documentation to get more people spun up on it as the notifications features have turned out to be a killer feature for me :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-12-18-x7YaI-image.png" alt="2020-12-18-x7YaI-image.png" /></p>
<p>I've been using this (the bridge, rather than the upcoming widgets) for a couple of months now and find it really really powerful. I'm not in GitHub most of the day, so getting notifs piped direct into Matrix is great!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few updates to the Gitter bridge itself this week handling Matrix edits outside of the 5 minute edit window on Gitter and fixing up @mentions being mangled by <code>:</code> colons on the Gitter side when someone mentions you from Element. We also strip the redundant Matrix reply quote when it goes into a Gitter threaded conversation because it's already easily viewable in the thread.</p>
<p>We're also getting started on some of the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Element feature parity with Gitter issues</a>. First directly tackling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">backfilling existing message history</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In celebration of the cross-signing MSC being finally merged, Nheko master now supports cross signing other users and your own devices. üéâ The UX is currently not final, you have to manually fetch the cross signing keys in the settings, if you don't have them after a verification. You are also not yet prompted to verify new logins and can't bootstrap cross-signing from Nheko, but the functional bits and bobs are there now. We are also still investigating, if prompting for your recovery key/passphrase is less confusing by using just one input field or if we should prompt for them separately. Currently Nheko just asks you to unlook and will accept whatever you input (if it can decrypt the secrets with it). FluffyChat does that and I think it is really nice!</p>
<p>There are also a few smaller features added recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now uses the icon from your theme on the login page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can react instead of reply with a (very) short text using /react</p>

<li>
<p>A few improvements(?) regarding whitespace and code rendering.</p>

<p><a href="https://fluffychat.im">FluffyChat</a> is a cute cross-platform matrix client. It is available for Android, iOS, Web and Desktop.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">krille</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FluffyChat 0.24.0 is released with new features and fixes.</p>
<p>What is new:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new public room discovery page, where you can find and join public rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental bootstrap support for cross-signing and keybackup and something really weird that is named SSSS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced power level managing for rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minor design changes like a new icon set</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beside of that we have of course a lot of bug fixes and stability improvements. All languages should now also work on iOS.</p>
<p>Also we are looking forward to publish the app in the AppStore for iOS but we will do this under the hood of Famedly. Btw. FluffyChat will soon move to the Famedly GitLab project and we will move the app in the PlayStore to the Famedly account too. This doesn't mean that anything will change there. It is just that Famedly will now handle the legal stuff for us and may offer paid customer support for businesses, which have interest in FluffyChat. But the app will still be available under the same AGPL3 license. This will just make it easier for us to publish the app in the official stores as we don't need to pay so much for the developer accounts.</p>

<p>Lots of things to talk about! Firstly I'm very happy to say that <em>spaces are happening</em>, you can keep track of them here: https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/15930.</p>
<p>Next <a href="https://matrix.org/open-tech-will-save-us/9">Open Tech Will Save Us</a>, was great this month, and you can also get a great introduction to Matrix Spaces there too.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mschopen:uni-bielefeld.de">Marcus Schopen</a> shared his love for Matrix by showing us the Matrix-branded mugs he has had printed:</p>

<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we've continued to be quite busy with implementation during holiday crunch time.

<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello, friends! On Wednesday we released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/09/synapse-1-24-0-and-1-23-1-released">Synapse 1.24.0 and 1.23.1</a>, which include security fixes. Please upgrade! (Also, if you've installed Synapse from source, be sure to <code>pip install 'cryptography&gt;=3.3'</code> in your virtualenv to address the recent <a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20201208.txt">OpenSSL CVE</a>).</p>
<p>This is our last full release for the year, as we don't want to do anything that might risk the stability Santa's federated command and control centre at the North Pole, but we're looking forward to lots of new features and improvements in the new year ‚Äî more details on that next week.</p>
<p>We'd also like to remind you that we're planning on removing support for Python 3.5 early next year (a formal announcement and timeline will accompany the 1.25.0 release), and we'd appreciate and comments or concerns in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8782">this GitHub issue</a>.</p>

<h3 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio">Ananace</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just updated my Synapse K8s-optimized image and Chart to 1.24.0, planning on deprecating the image at some point soon though, instead pointing people to upstream - or platform-optimized - images as I should be able to move all the Kubernetes-specific things into the chart itself to make it more compatible.</p>
<p>The image in question started off as a plain docker image, before there were official ones. I've since rebased it onto the official Matrix image with just the modified scripts and volume points.</p>
<p>My plan is to move all the Kubernetes-specific scripts into configmaps (which are a K8s way of storing text files/environment variables/etc), and then build my own launch arguments through the chart to get it to run on any image that has a Python interpreter and the Synapse modules available in the Python search path.</p>
<p>With all that done, it means I won't be a bottleneck in pushing updated image tags for people to be able to update, and I won't have to finagle multi-arch images üòÉ</p>

<p>In terms of bridge progress, we added support for <code>m.emote</code> status messages which means your <code>/me says hi</code> messages will bridge back and forth properly. On the Gitter side, we fixed the browser notifications so they show properly from the <code>virtualUser</code> instead of the generic <code>matrixbot</code>.</p>

<p>It's a bit barebones still, but text bridging and backfilling works. The main advantage over mx-puppet-instagram is that it uses the realtime MQTT API instead of polling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a second update from tulir, he added more features as of today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the initial announcement on Monday, I added bridging of reactions, redactions and photos in both directions and also typing notifications, read receipts and all types of messages from Instagram to Matrix.</p>

<h3 id="axon">axon</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kaiyou:tedomum.net">kaiyou</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a first update regarding a very small project named &quot;axon&quot;, aimed at operating the synapse admin API from Python, either as a library or a CLI tool. It is currently in use everyday on our synapse instance for managing users and looking for suspicious rooms, and is being integrated into a prototype Web interface for managing synapse.</p>
<p>Admin API coverage is currently about 50%, mostly focusing on users and rooms management (get, list, update, delete). It is still enough to delete a user, edit an offensive avatar, or run as a cron to periodically purge remote media.</p>
<p>Our main repository: https://forge.tedomum.net/tedomum/axon</p>
<p>Github project mirror for contributing: https://github.com/kaiyou/axon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked if there was a GUI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not currently, but we are integrating it with another of our tools named &quot;hiboo&quot;, which is a general indie hoster user manager (provides SAML &amp; OIDC authentication with config templates for many projects including synapse, and integrates the account workflows and moderation features). Currently it provides room navigation and purging, plus deleting accounts either on moderator decision or when the user deletes her SSO account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds promising! Synapse Admin would benefit from this kind of tooling...</p>
<p>... so it was a surprise to find another project designed to help in this area!</p>
<h3 id="announcing-synadm">Announcing synadm</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jojo:peek-a-boo.at">jojo</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, maybe it's about time for &quot;synadm - a CLI frontend to Matrix-Synapse admin APIs&quot; to be announced more officially. As the name implies it's a CLI tool that eases the usage of admin API commands for Synapse admins. It currently covers everything the room and user API's can do: https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#implementation-status--commands-list</p>
<p>It can be configured interactively and/or using a config file in yaml format: https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#configuration</p>
<p>It's configurable whether the responds of the API are shown in pretty printed JSON or in a table format (using Python tabulate).</p>
<p>It's well documented via it's online help and supposed to be quite self-explanatory to the admin.</p>
<p>Any thoughts, ideas, feature-requests are very welcome in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at">#synadm:peek-a-boo.at</a> or as usual by filing PR's or issues in the project repo https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm.</p>

Thus the same 3 MSCs are in focus: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2844">MSC2844</a> (global versioning), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2366">MSC2366</a> (ready and done in key verification), and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2790">MSC2790</a> (modal widgets).</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.neilalexander.dev">Neil Alexander's Dendrite mxid</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.2">version 0.3.2</a>, which contains some bug fixes. Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Checking if a server is allowed to see an event has been optimised somewhat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to disable federation has been added</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application services are now sent correctly formatted client events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>create-account</code> has been simplified so that you can just point it to your Dendrite config</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/unpeek</code> support has been added (for MSC2753)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event IDs are now calculated far less often in the roomserver, since this is an expensive operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federation sender now caches events in memory to reduce load on the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;since&quot; parameter is now checked more thoroughly in the sync API, which led to a bug that could cause forgotten rooms to reappear (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kaniini">kaniini</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The polylith now proxies signing key requests through the federation sender correctly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è The <strong>OpenSSL</strong> project has pre-announced a <a href="https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2020-December/000186.html">high severity issue</a> that will be disclosed on Tuesday. We will be regenerating Docker images and releasing Synapse 1.24.0 and 1.23.1 on Tuesday following that announcement. Note that these releases contain security fixes of their own, and you are encouraged to upgrade.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.24.0rc2/CHANGES.md#synapse-1240rc2-2020-12-04">Synapse 1.24.0rc2</a> is out and includes numerous bug fixes and internal improvements, especially around our OpenID Connect (OIDC) and SAML providers. Of note, the OIDC provider can now re-try generating MXIDs when there's a collision, reaching parity with the SAML provider.</p>
<p>We've been talking about <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</a> for a few weeks, but the end is in sight: the PR is reviewed and the tests pass, so we're on track for including it in 1.25.0!  We're also on the cusp of a finishing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8868">a new algorithm</a> for calculating the auth chain difference in <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/implementing-stateres">State Resolution v2</a>, which should significantly reduce worst case performance.</p>
<p>Lastly, the deprecated <code>/_matrix/client/*/admin</code> Admin API endpoints <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8785">have been removed</a>. If you have tools which target these endpoints, please update them to use the <code>/_synapse/admin</code> URL prefix instead.</p>

<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>This was actually just the beginning, the ground work needed to lay the foundations for A Better Future. We already have <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;state=opened">a bunch of other merge requests</a> to continue down that path. Hopefully there shouldn‚Äôt be such large ones in the (near) future. So what‚Äôs next? The work that landed this week was a switch to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/">the SDK</a> for almost all endpoint queries. Now need to handle the syncs with it. Later on, we will use it to handle storage, and then enable E2EE as well, but that will take quite some time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Big progress from Fractal here! Will be good to hear more from the Fractal club to see what the ETA is for storage and E2EE.</p>
<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I've actually not had much time to work on Nheko, I did at least fix most of the UTD (Unable to decrypt) issues, when sending encrypted messages. This has been a long standing annoyance, but it should now finally not be an issue anymore (well... at least it should not be caused by Nheko as often anymore)! With this there are only a few tickets left to finally bring E2EE out of beta in Nheko (SSSS and bootstrapping cross-signing, as well as a general review for potential issues).</p>
<p>And while I have actually not been doing much work, we actually had more Pull Requests (and merged them too) this week than I have ever seen before in Nheko! Thank you very much to everyone who contributed. A short summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now uses the Nheko icon from your system theme, if available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can finally look at avatars in their full resolution!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Megolm sessions are now lazily loaded from disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The registration page now also has nice inline error messages, hinting at why a specific input is unacceptable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updates to the russian translation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The README now lists all required GStreamer plugins for voice and video calls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It feels super great, when you have so many people contributing, I love it! &lt;3</p>

<p>On behalf of the Americans on the Synapse team: Happy Thanksgiving! This past week saw us land some improvements to the OpenID Connect SSO provider, bringing it closer to parity with the SAML provider. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8801">#8801</a> made it possible to gracefully handle username collisions when creating a new account over SSO.</p>
<p>We've also merged a pull request (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8785/">#8785</a>) from @dklimpel which removes deprecated paths for the Synapse Admin APIs. As of the next Synapse release, all Admin APIs will be accessibly only under the <code>/_synapse/admin/v1</code> path prefix.</p>
<p>Otherwise, much of our time has been spent on getting pull requests like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6739">#6739</a>, implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</a>, ready to merge. It's coming to a Synapse release soon!</p>
<p>Speaking of releases, we're looking forward to cutting a first release candidate of 1.24.0 early next week; keep your eyes peeled for that!</p>
<p>I'd be remiss in not mentioning that we started the week by <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/23/synapse-disclosing-cve-2020-26890">disclosing CVE-2020-26890</a>, which is a denial of service affecting Synapse versions prior to 1.20.0. If you've not upgraded, <em>please</em> do.</p>

<p>The new completer is now on master. Please try it out and report any issues you may find. It now actually inserts a user link, keeps a per room message history and should look quite a bit nicer and be faster,  when completing emojis or user names.</p>
<p>There were also quite a few cleanups, most of them done by Kirillpt! Some spacing here and there, saturation changes, the login page should now be less confusing, when you don't enter a valid mxid and toggles should now not get stuck in confusing intermediate states. There is also a russian translation now and some VOIP fixes. Pretty busy week, but I like it!</p>

<p>We released Synapse 1.23.0 on Wednesday! Read all about it on the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/18/synapse-1-23-0-released">Matrix Blog</a>. Otherwise, we'd like to highlight a few developments over the past week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We're discussing a policy for ending support for old versions of Python and PostgreSQL. If you have opinions, please <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8782">let us know on GitHub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our initial implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</a> is undergoing review, and will likely land soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've been looking at ways to improve the efficiency of state resolution, and Erik has managed to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622#issuecomment-729620021">devise some algorithmic improvements</a> that yield an order of magnitude speedup for a handful of pathologic cases. We hope to have a better idea of how this might work for real world workloads soon.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, we'd like to take this opportunity to remind you to <strong>please regularly upgrade your Synapse.</strong> Especially if you're not yet on 1.20.0, as we'll be disclosing a denial of service issue which affects older versions on Monday.</p>

<p>mewmew wanted to use my fork of Synapse, so I made the changes there configurable (instead of hardcoding to my user ID) and even added a readme to list the features. It might also be useful for other people who want custom room IDs and other fun stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fresh off the arXiv presses comes our</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06488">‚ÄúAnalysis of the Matrix Event Graph Replicated Data Type‚Äù</a> preprint!
This time, it is a deep dive into the data structure properties of the event graph:</p>
<p>What type of consistency guarantees does it provide,
how many of the other homeservers you share a room with can be faulty or malicious without violating those guarantees (short answer: all of them!),</p>
<p>and how is it possible that a frayed-out event graph ever laces back to just a few current events,
while there is a probability larger than zero for growth to arbitrarily high limits?</p>
<p>To shed light on those questions, we had a great cooperation between my <a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/">Decentralized Systems and Network Services
Research Group</a> and <a href="https://www.math.kit.edu/stoch/~henze/">Prof. Dr. Norbert Henze from the Institute of Stochastics</a>.</p>
<p>While we are still in search of the right venue for peer-reviewed publication,
we went for a preprint this time to share our results with the scientific and the Matrix community in a timely manner.</p>

<p>In this figure, k is the number of participating servers, U_n is the current width of the event graph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, with a current width of U_n = 1000 events and k = 200 servers,
we can expect that the width goes below E(U_{n+1}) &lt; 600 events in just one step.*</p>

<h4 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h4>
<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2744">MSC2744</a> has entered FCP. As such we're switching it out for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2844">MSC2844</a>, which aims to define a global versioning system for all spec documents. Note that MSC2844 does not currently have FCP proposed. Its purpose for being in the focus this time around is for asking the team whether ideas proposed are plausible.</p>
<p>Thus this week's focus is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1544">MSC1544</a> (QR Code verification), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2790">MSC2790</a> (modal widgets) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2844">MSC2844</a> (global versioning).</p>
<p>We've also started making use of a Github board to track the state of an MSC through the currently somewhat ambiguous process of putting up an MSC that is ready for review to starting FCP. You can find the board here: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/31">SCT Backlog</a>.</p>
<p>Some explanation of the columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Awaiting SCT Input - These are MSCs that are deemed reviewable by the MSC author, and require review by a subsection of the Spec Core Team (usually one or two people) that are most familiar with the scope of Matrix that the MSC is relevant to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ready for FCP ticks - At least one individual from the Spec Core Team has signed off on the MSC. It is not time for others to give a cursory review - mainly sanity checking from the perspective of the part of Matrix that they work on. Note that fundamental flaws may still be found in this stage, requiring the MSC to be reworked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In FCP - The MSC is in Final Comment Period, where everyone has a last chance to get their ideas in. This happens after most of the Spec Core Team have given their ticks from the previous column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Done - These MSCs no longer need immediate attention by some portion of the Spec Core Team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These definitions are all flexible as we continue to see what works for the limited resources we have available for review.</p>
<p>Do not be alarmed if a particular MSC is not on this board, we're placing things on here as deemed necessary, and more will certainly be added in time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We are aware of a trivially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in versions of Synapse prior to 1.20.0. Complete details will be disclosed on Monday, November 23rd. If you have not upgraded recently, please do so.</p>
<p>Happy RC day! The first release candidate of Synapse 1.23 is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0rc1">now available</a>. For Synapse admins, we've added numerous new APIs thanks to contributions by <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">@dklimpel</a>, and we now support generating <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.23.0rc1/docs/structured_logging.md">structured logs</a> in a standard manner. The <code>structured</code> and <code>drains</code> logging options are now deprecated in Synapse's configuration.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0rc1">Synapse 1.23.0rc1</a> also includes several significant bugfixes, especially around regressions in the SQLite-to-PostgreSQL database porting script, as well a fix to an issue that would prevent Synapse from recovering after losing its connection to the database. Synapse will also now reject modifications to access control lists which would otherwise result in a server blocking itself from a room. This is a particularly interesting case of unintended consequences in protocol design, and we hope to write more about it soon.</p>
<p>Next week should see the full release of 1.23, followed by a first implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403"><em>MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</em></a> landing in the development branch for 1.24.

<p>Hello TWIM! From this week on we're changing how we're reporting updates on the Element clients. Each week, we'll include a section for cross-platform feature work the Element team is working on, and some sections for platform specific work too.</p>
<p><strong>Spaces (previously known as Communities)</strong></p>
<p>Communities are back! They've been renamed to Spaces, and on the Element team we've been busy exploring user experience and critical thinking for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a>, to allow users to organise rooms into useful groups.</p>
<p><strong>Social Login</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to reduce friction in authentication, we've been R&amp;Ding how to allow homeservers &amp; Matrix clients to support multiple SSO providers.. Most of the work so far is captured in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2858">MSC2858</a> and we're starting initial implementations in Element web next week.</p>
<p><strong>VoIP: Voice &amp; Video Calls</strong></p>
<p>We've started foundational research, design and engineering to improve both the usability and stability of native matrix VoIP in Element. We've also started to look at how we can improve the continuity of the user experience between native Matrix calls and our current implementation of Jitsi.</p>
<p><strong>Usability</strong></p>
<p>We've been focusing on improving post-registration actions all round to make Element provide better prompts for first actions, and empty states for views on all platforms, with a multitude of fixes having landed on Element Web, iOS &amp; Android in the last week. We've also started paid user testing to better understand specific pain points in the first time user experience, which we're looking to improve significantly in the coming weeks. </p>
<p><strong>Web platform</strong></p>
<p>v1.7.13 is now live! Which includes a bunch of fixes &amp; improvements on VoIP.</p>
<p><strong>Android platform</strong></p>
<p>v1.0.10 is now available on the Play Store. We're also doing ongoing work to catch up with feature parity to Element Web, and <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">Dominaezzz</a> is migrating SDK APIs to suspend functions: no more MatrixCallback!</p>
<p><strong>iOS platform</strong></p>
<p>v1.1.0 is soon to be live on TestFlight for beta testers, and we'll soon be turning our attention to fixing end-to-end encryption regressions.</p>

We are using it in production with hundreds of target telephone numbers without problems. I also added an optional feature to use room aliases (e. g. #sms_4901234567:homeserver) to prevent multiple rooms with one target telephone number (which is still possible).</p>
<p>In a few weeks you can use this bridge with an old Android-Smartphone, which acts as an sms gateway with rest api.</p>

<p>Hello Matrix friends. I've been asked to share this here. I'm currently building a platform for building communities.

The matrix community is at <a href="https://gurlic.com/matrix">https://gurlic.com/matrix</a>, but I haven't had the time to post much. </p>

<p>I pretty much want all resources to have custom domain support, and matrix rooms for all communities, and nested communities. In the near future, I hope to have matrix servers for custom domains too. And of course, the source will also be open if folks want to host.</p>
<p>Right now, users on gurlic get a matrix account, and communities/galleries/publications get a room too, but i'm hoping to take some time to look at much deeper integration. Dendrite and hydrogen are great to build on top off...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy November from the Synapse team! As mentioned last week, we pushed a small <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.1">v1.22.1 release</a> last Friday which fixed two regressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug where an appservice may not be forwarded events for a room it was recently invited to. Broke in v1.22.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8676">#8676</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <code>Object of type frozendict is not JSON serializable</code> exceptions when using third-party event rules. Broke in v1.22.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8678">#8678</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't upgraded your Synapse in a while, <em>please do.</em></p>
<p>A major focus of Synapse is being able to meet the performance and reliability needs of massive homeservers like <code>matrix.org</code>. If you're curious about how Synapse's architecture has evolved over the years to meet these scaling challenges, check our our blog post from Tuesday: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/03/how-we-fixed-synapses-scalability">How we fixed Synapse's scalability!</a></p>
<p>Lastly, we anticipate releasing 1.23.0 in the next fortnight; keep your eyes peeled for release candidates and let us know if you have any feedback. For a preview of what's coming, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/compare/v1.22.1...develop">check out GitHub</a> for the new commits that have landed on the <code>develop</code> branch since our last release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PLUS <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synapse now horizontally scales across multiple python processes, as of 1.22: you can configure it so that events are no longer sent through the main proc, eliminating the single biggest bottleneck for large scale Synapse deployments.

<p>Hi all! I <em>think</em> this is the right place to share this ü§û. I've been working on a Matrix SDK for Elixir over the last few months as a side project, it's very early days and it's currently just a bare-bones wrapper for the Client-Server API. I've also written the Elixir/Erlang bindings for Olm (currently missing group sessions) which should be added to the SDK soon. The repo can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/niklaslong/matrix-elixir-sdk">https://github.com/niklaslong/matrix-elixir-sdk</a> and the Elixir bindings for Olm are linked in the readme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the right place! Thanks cognitive_tea :D</p>
<p>Asked if there were big plans for use of the project</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not as yet, though a few people have reached out to me already and are building on top of it. I started it as a way to get going with Matrix dev and as a fun side project. That being said, I think providing the tools to Matrix-enable Elixir apps might lead to some interesting things.
If anyone has any precise ideas on how they would want to integrate their Elixir apps with Matrix, I'd be super happy to have a chat üëçÔ∏è
Less precise ideas are also welcome, of course üôÇ</p>

We announced its first release candidate <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/23/this-week-in-matrix-2020-10-23#synapse">last week</a>, and after a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.0rc2">small rc2</a> the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.0">final release</a> was published last Tuesday. We anticipate a small 1.22.1 release later today with fixes for messages not always being sent to app services (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8673">#8673</a>) and serialization errors with third-party event rules (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8678">#8678</a>).</p>
<p>We continue to see improved client join <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">Apdex</a> scores for matrix.org, indicating that our work in 1.22.0 to split background tasks into separate workers and allow for sharded event persisters successfully improved the user-visible performance of large homeservers.</p>
<p>In other news, we pushed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8675">a temporary hotfix</a> to the matrix.org homeserver earlier this week, instructing it to drop all cross-user <code>m.key_share_request</code> messages. This was necessary to mitigate <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/famedlysdk/-/issues/126">a bug</a> in a third-party library which caused some clients to flood the server with requests. We'll re-enable these messages once we resolve <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8677">issue #8677</a>. In the meantime, we strongly encourage <a href="https://fluffychat.im/">FluffyChat</a> users to upgrade to version 0.21.1.</p>

<p>This was an exciting week again. Trilene did the usual and just opened a PR, that implements the video part of call support. In my testing so far this seems to work amazingly well (ignore, that my webcam is crappy in the video, I only have so many devices...)! It's hard to overstate my satisfaction, if I am allowed to quote songs without getting a DMCA! If you want to try it out, you will need the qmlgl plugin at runtime (I had to patch some ebuilds on Gentoo to do so) and build Nheko from source. Support in our AppImage and Flatpak and for our Windows and MacOS builds will come at a later date. A big shoutout to trilene, who just works on VOIP in Nheko, without saying a word, and then drops a ready PR.</p>
<p>Another exciting new feature by lorendb, you can now specify <code>--profile &lt;profilename&gt;</code>, when you start Nheko, to create a separate profile. This allows you to open multiple instances and use multiple accounts at the same time (but it still uses separate instances of Nheko). This is pretty useful, if you have multiple accounts on different homeservers or are testing stuff for example. He also added a shortcut to delete the current content of the message area (Ctrl-U).</p>
<p>We also fixed a long standing bug, that crashed Nheko when pasting an image on mac OS, prevented copying text in some cases and build times should be about halfed again.</p>
<p>That's all I got today. I guess we should do a new release at some point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked about trilene, who is a reliable Nheko contributor, Nico replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>trilene seems to be a bit camera shy and prefer to work on code than take credit and talk about upcoming features. I'm surprised everytime, when a new PR is opened or trilene asks a weird question, that can only end up in an amazing contribution :3</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Starting November 28th and 29th of this year, many bots on t2bot.io will be supporting end-to-end encryption. Though not all bots will be supporting it, this is an important milestone towards getting end-to-bridge encryption enabled on t2bot.io as a proof of being able to scale to the higher demand of encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>The eventual goal is to support encryption on all of t2bot.io‚Äôs bots and bridges, however we need to take small steps to get there üôÇ. Note that in order to function, bots will decrypt <em>all</em> messages they see, but only respond to the ones they care about - this can still be uncomfortable for some rooms though, so feel free to kick them out.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, normally anoa would be doing this update but today you get me (TravisR) instead. Luckily anoa has left me a script to run, so here's hoping I haven't completely messed up this week's update üòÖ</p>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a>.</p>

<h4 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h4>
<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we're still focusing on the same MSCs from previous weeks to get widgets over the line. This includes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2774">MSC2774</a> to have widgets aware of their widget ID, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2765">MSC2765</a> so widgets can be pretty in clients like Element, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2790">MSC2790</a> to support a form of user input with widgets.</p>
<p>Normally there would be a graph here of our MSC progress, however my machine refuses to accept that line graphs are a real thing today. As a replacement, here's a <a href="https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/generate_chart_e.html?hlyRange=1997-12-02%7C2020-10-22&amp;dlyRange=1995-04-01%7C2020-10-22&amp;mlyRange=1995-04-01%7C2007-11-01&amp;StationID=27378&amp;Prov=AB&amp;urlExtension=_e.html&amp;searchType=stnProv&amp;optLimit=specDate&amp;StartYear=1840&amp;EndYear=2020&amp;selRowPerPage=25&amp;Line=46&amp;Month=10&amp;Day=22&amp;lstProvince=&amp;timeframe=2&amp;Year=2020&amp;type=bar&amp;MeasTypeID=snow">snowfall accumulation graph for Banff</a> as reported by Environment Canada.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> on Tuesday, a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/20/dendrite-0-2-0-released">reasonably big update</a> containing various improvements over the initial beta release, and then followed it up with a bug-fix <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.2.1">v0.2.1</a> release on Thursday. </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has been running Dendrite and reporting their findings, and also to contributors who have been submitting pull requests!</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer builds separate binaries for each polylith component, but instead has one multi-personality binary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Docker images have been simplified into two images: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-monolith">dendrite-monolith</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-polylith">dendrite-polylith</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal HTTP API calls are now made using H2C (HTTP/2) in polylith mode, which resolves some head-of-line issues with the connection pool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities have been refactored, which should fix some cases where room state can end up corrupted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A couple of bugs when handling state rewrites have been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sync API no longer sends old state events to clients as if they were new</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQLite locking bugs around the latest events updater have been resolved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notification levels are now parsed correctly in power level events (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pestdoktor">Pestdoktor</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invalid UTF-8 is now correctly rejected when making federation requests (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pestdoktor">Pestdoktor</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance for v0.2.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 57%, up from 56% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 81%, up from 80% last week</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:conduit.rs">Timo</a> stepped in to tell us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was another productive week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved thumbnailing algorithm (higher quality, less stored data, correct)</li>
<li>Allow unjoined users to read state of world readable rooms (this makes shields.io work with conduit)</li>
<li>Docs for cross compiling conduit</li>
<li>Fixed stuck / double-join over federation</li>
<li>Fixed random timeline reload bug</li>
<li>Welcome message in admin room</li>
<li>More frequent flushing</li>
</ul>
<p>Some WIP things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide Conduit binaries for most platforms to make setting up or updating a Conduit instance even easier</li>
<li>More reliable sending over federation</li>
<li>Bring all features of our Ruma fork upstream</li>

<p>Hydrogen gained a settings panel this week with a better session backup UX and your end-to-end device information, which should make the manual verification easier.

<p>Nheko now shows the fontname in the font selection rendered using that font. This makes it easier to know, how the font will look, once you select it. (Contributed by lorendb)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a crash when closing Nheko. While this didn't really cause issues, since you were closing it anyway, it's just bad form to crash instead of exit properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed the membercache. Nheko used to load all members on startup and store them in memory. This made startup slower. Removing it sped up the start by a nice chunk and freed about 30MB of RAM on my system. One step closer to using reasonable amounts of RAM!</p>

<p>Fixed excessive clipping when rendering the timeline. This prevented all batching of text messages. Now it only clips the replied to message, which makes scrolling much smoother again!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, some controversial change, which is currently in master but may be reverted at some point: Nheko now automatically forwards keys to verified devices, when they request the keys, without prompting you. While that can be toggled off in the settings, it currently defaults to on. This weakens backward secrecy of e2ee a bit, but it makes it possible to recover from e2ee issues much more easily. Currently I'd argue, that it is an acceptable tradeoff. It is very hard to verify room membership of users at any point in time but the current one and room membership is not verified end to end in any way, so you need to trust the server to provide you with the correct memberlist or you just send keys to verified users. While Nheko still sends keys to all members of a room, when creating the session, it only forwards your own keys to trusted users without prompting you. Currently I think this is an acceptable tradeoff, as opening a popup with &quot;user x wants to have session y shared in room z&quot; is unlikely to be understood by anyone properly either. I'd be glad to hear your opinions though!</p>
<p>That's it for this week, but next week will be interesting too. Lorendb has been hacking on profile support, allowing you to run multiple login sessions of Nheko in separate windows and some other UI features.</p>

<p>In the past couple of weeks we implemented the last endpoint for the Federation</p>
<p>API. We are working on smoothing out some rough edges in the <code>ruma-federation-api</code>
crate, like a few that @Timo addressed this past week, so it will be a little while</p>
<p>before it's completely finished.</p>
<p>We've also created a milestone to track implementation of Identity Service API,</p>
<p>the last Matrix API we have to complete.</p>
<p>Finally, we've created a new Matrix room focused on Ruma development,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.6.2">Quotient 0.6.2</a> has been released, with a couple of minor bugfixes. This release is used as a foundation of <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.9.5-beta1">Quaternion 0.0.9.5 beta</a> that's also getting out today - with support of (proper Matrix subset of) HTML, rich text user links (like pills, only lighter), initial Markdown support (if you build with fresh enough Qt), reactions (thanks to Karel Kosek @krkk), navigation to earlier events (thanks to Roland Pallai @rpallai) and quite a few other improvements. To make this release Quaternion had to gain its own basic HTML parser and Matrix-to-Qt-to-Matrix converter, which is likely to end up being a separate micro-library, in the hope that it will be useful for other Matrix projects building on Qt (even non-Quotient ones). A separate call to translators - quite a few strings got updated, so please head to <a href="https://app.lokalise.com/project/730769035bbc328c31e863.62506391/">Quaternion project at Lokalise</a> and push the numbers at least to 80%!</p>
