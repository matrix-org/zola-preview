                <p>Rejoice everyone, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.53.0">Synapse 1.53</a> is out! Let's have a look at what's new with this release.</p>
<h2 id="stabilisation-of-registration-tokens">Stabilisation of registration tokens</h2>
<p>Registration tokens is a feature introduced in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.42.0">Synapse 1.42.0</a>, which allows homeserver administrators to force their users to use specific tokens when registering. This is similar to Synapse's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/6f440fd859c411af8c32478b4353f7550619c3bd/docs/sample_config.yaml#L1291-L1294">registration shared secret</a> support, but with added features, such as the possibility to limit how users can be registered with the same token, or to make a token expire. See <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.53/usage/administration/admin_api/registration_tokens.html">the admin API documentation</a> for more information on how to manage registration tokens on your homeserver.</p>
<p>Registration tokens were initially proposed to the Matrix specification in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">MSC3231</a> by <a href="https://github.com/govynnus">Callum Brown</a> during their Google Summer of Code internship last summer. The MSC has since been accepted, and released in the stable Matrix specification as of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/02/matrix-v-1-2-release">Matrix v1.2</a>. As a result, its Synapse implementation has been updated to remove support for unstable identifiers. Administrators of homeservers on which the reverse proxy rules explicitly allow the unstable route for this feature need to update their configuration. Same goes for developers of Matrix clients that support this feature. See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.53/upgrade#stablisation-of-msc3231">upgrade notes</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="time-based-cache-expiry-now-enabled-by-default">Time-based cache expiry now enabled by default</h2>
<p>To avoid being overly intensive on resources by making too many queries to the database, Synapse maintains several in-memory caches to store data it needs to use frequently. However, this comes with the inconvenience that, if Synapse needs to store too much data, these caches can become fairly big and occupy too much space in the host's memory.</p>
<p>Historically, Synapse has dealt with this issue by having set sizes for each cache, either hardcoded or set in the configuration, and evicting the oldest items when exceeding this size. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.38.0">Synapse 1.38</a> introduced the possibility for homeserver administrators to configure Synapse to evict cache entries based on the time they were last accessed on. This mechanism acts on top of the aforementioned eviction policy, and allows automatically evicting entries that haven't been accessed for some time, leaving more room in the caches to store data that needs to be accessed more often.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.53 enables this behaviour by default. Without specific configuration, Synapse will automatically evict cache entries that haven't been accessed for more than 30 minutes. Server administrators that were already using this feature might need to update their configuration, as this change deprecates the <code>expiry_time</code> configuration setting, which will be removed in a future version of Synapse. See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.53/upgrade#time-based-cache-expiry-is-now-enabled-by-default">upgrade notes</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>You might have heard that we're working on improving the time it takes to join big Matrix rooms with Synapse. If not, then you definitely want to have a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/yxV73TQAodE?t=1095">the demos Matrix live</a> that was published earlier this month and includes more details and a demo of the work we've been doing in this area.</p>
<p>This release of Synapse includes an implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3706">MSC3706</a>, which is part of this work. It's still very experimental and definitely not production-ready, but it's a huge stepping stone towards making room joins snappier than ever.</p>
<p>We've also been continuing our work towards enabling end-to-end encryption for application services (see the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/01/18/synapse-1-50-released">Synapse 1.50 release blogpost</a> for more context on that). Synapse 1.53 includes support for sending to-device messages to application services. This is also still very experimental, watch this space for future updates.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.53.0">full changelog</a> for a complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.53/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1530">upgrade notes</a> for this version.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular order) <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bradjones1">Brad Jones</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/a-mnich">Alexander Mnich</a>.</p>

<h2 id="twisted-security-release">Twisted security release</h2>
<p>The team behind <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a>, which is the main framework Synapse uses under the hood, recently released <a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/releases/tag/twisted-22.1.0">Twisted 22.1</a>. This version fixes a <a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/security/advisories/GHSA-92x2-jw7w-xvvx">security vulnerability</a> within the Twisted library.</p>
<p>While preparing the release of Synapse 1.52, we have investigated the impact of this vulnerability on Synapse. We came to the conclusion that it does not affect Synapse. We however advise server administrators to ensure they use an up-to-date version of the library as a matter of good practice.</p>
<p>For instances installed with <code>pip</code>, the library can be updated with <code>pip install --upgrade Twisted treq</code>. For instances installed with the <code>matrixdotorg/synapse</code> Docker image or Debian packages from <code>packages.matrix.org</code>, updating to Synapse 1.52.0 is sufficient, as these images and packages include up-to-date versions of all dependencies.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that a release candidate for <a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/releases/tag/twisted-22.2.0rc1">Twisted 22.2</a> has been published, with a fix for a potential denial of service vulnerability with SSH. Administrators of Synapse homeservers that have the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.52/manhole.html">manhole</a> feature enabled (which is the only feature of Synapse using SSH) are encouraged to ensure access to the manhole is correctly restricted (e.g. by preventing access from external locations).</p>
<h2 id="federation-admin-apis">Federation admin APIs</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse introduces a few admin APIs to help server administrators monitor and handle how their Synapse homeserver interacts with other federated homeservers. <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.52/usage/administration/admin_api/federation.html#destination-rooms">One of these APIs</a> offers server administrators a way to visualise which rooms are shared between the local homeserver and a given remote one.</p>
<p>Another API allows server administrators to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.52/usage/administration/admin_api/federation.html#reset-connection-timeout">reset federation timeouts</a>. If Synapse fails to connect to a remote homeserver, it will make note of the failure and will not retry the connection after a certain amount of time. This can happen if the remote homeserver goes offline or experiences connectivity issues. Synapse has a few ways of figuring out whether a remote homeserver has come back online, but this new admin API adds a way for administrators to manually tell Synapse a destination should be available.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release also improves Synapse's deactivation behaviour by deleting account data when deactivating a user. &quot;Account data&quot; refers to private arbitrary data that is specific to an account. It is used among other things for secure server-side storage (SSSS) which allows securely backing up end-to-end encryption keys.</p>

<h2 id="deprecation-of-the-webclient-listener">Deprecation of the <code>webclient</code> listener</h2>
<p>A long time ago, Synapse used to serve a very basic web Matrix client (named &quot;console&quot;) that could be used to connect to the homeserver. Server administrators could chose to make it available to their users by configuring a <code>webclient</code> listener.</p>
<p>This web client was removed in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.34.0">Synapse 0.34</a> back in 2018, but the <code>webclient</code> listener stayed, instead allowing server admins to serve the web client of their choice (or redirect to it) through the <code>web_client_location</code> configuration file.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.53 will remove the <code>webclient</code> listener, as well as the ability to set <code>web_client_location</code> to a static directory (instead of a HTTP(S) URL). See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1510">upgrade notes</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="aggregations-and-sync">Aggregations and sync</h2>
<p>The concept of server-side aggregation in Matrix is defined in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> and is the ability for homeservers to extend the information included in an event using other events that relate to it. This allows, for example, clients to quickly retrieve the reactions associated with a given message, or its latest edit.</p>
<p>This release includes a number of notable performance improvements to calculating aggregations when responding to <code>/sync</code> requests. We continue to measure and investigate potential performance improvements in this area, which should end up greatly benefiting <code>/sync</code> response times.</p>
<h2 id="fosdem">FOSDEM</h2>
<p><a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a>, one of the biggest gatherings around free and open-source software in the world, is happening next week! Just like last year, the conference will happen online and will be hosted on Matrix. And just like last year, it will be packed with super interesting Matrix-related (but not only) talks.</p>
<p>One new addition this year is the presence of a whole devroom dedicated to Matrix. It will be hosted on February 6th, and you can already find its whole schedule of talks <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/matrixorg_foundation_and_community/">right here</a>.</p>
<p>The Synapse team will be giving a couple of talks during the day: <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/matrix_events_uninitiatied/">Events for the Uninitiated</a> by Shay at 11:10, and <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/matrix_extend_synapse/">Beyond the Matrix: Extend the capabilities of your Synapse homeserver</a> by yours truly at 16:40 (all times CET). Come say hi! 🙂</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release includes a couple of spaces-related bug fixes, specifically related to the <code>/_matrix/client/v1/room/{roomId}/hierarchy</code> API. One of them in particular targets a bug in spaces that include more than 50 rooms, and should make it much easier to look for a specific room inside a space.</p>
<p>The <code>synapse_review_recent_signups</code> script, which allows homeserver administrators to review recent signups (e.g. in the event of a spam attack), was also improved with an option to exclude virtual users belonging to an application service from the results. See <code>synapse_review_recent_signups --help</code> for more information.</p>

                <p>Welcome all for the first Synapse release of 2022: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.50.0">Synapse 1.50</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that, as per our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.50/deprecation_policy.html">platform dependency deprecation policy</a>, Synapse no longer supports Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6 as of this version. As a result, we have also stopped shipping Debian packages for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver), as it ships with Python 3.6.</p>
<p>As a reminder, please note that Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo) reaches its own end of life <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2021-December/000275.html">on January 20, 2022</a>. Past this date we will stop producing new packages for Ubuntu 21.04.</p>

<h2 id="encrypted-application-services">Encrypted application services</h2>
<p>Application services (sometimes called &quot;appservices&quot;), are privileged processes that can interact with a Matrix homeserver in a way a normal user cannot. This is especially useful for bridges, as it allows them to register and puppet multiple users on the homeserver to replicate activity from other platforms.</p>
<p>One of the main shortcomings of application services currently is that they do not support end-to-end encryption. This means that messages sent through a bridge are never encrypted and always visible by the homeserver.</p>
<p>We've recently started work to tackle this issue in the form of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3202">MSC3202</a>. A first part of implementing this MSC (allowing application services to masquerade as specific devices) has landed in this release of Synapse; work is still ongoing towards a full implementation, so watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="improved-reliability-on-device-list-updates">Improved reliability on device list updates</h2>
<p>While working on this release, we identified a long-standing bug that could prevent Synapse from sending device lists update over federation if the server had a high number of active users and/or users with a lot of devices connected to their account.</p>
<p>This bug was introduced back in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.0.0">Synapse 1.0.0</a>, and meant that the homeserver would miss some device list updates when communicating with other homeservers if the amount of updates to send was too high. In practice, this means users on remote homeservers could see outdated device information for other users (including outdated device verification statuses).</p>
<p>Synapse 1.50 includes a fix to this bug. This should contribute towards making the propagation of device list updates more reliable.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release introduces support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a>, which allows guest users to send arbitrary state events into a room. This will be especially useful to the ongoing work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3401">group VoIP calls</a>, which involves having users send new state events into the room to signal their participation in a call.</p>
<p>We've also stabilised identifiers for cross-signing and fallback keys now that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1756">MSC1756</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2732">MSC2732</a> have been merged into the Matrix spec.</p>
<p>On the documentation side of things, the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.50/turn-howto.html">page</a> on setting up and configuring a TURN server has been updated to feature instructions on how to deal with NATs. This is a much welcome addition as configuring TURN is something a lot of Synapse admins struggle with!</p>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.50.0/CHANGES.md">release notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/itchychips">Donny Johnson</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AndrewFerr">AndrewFerr</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: An issue preventing client logins (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11763">#11763</a>) was identified immediately following the release of Synapse 1.50.0. We released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.50.1">Synapse 1.50.1</a> the same day with a fix for this issue.</p>

                <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.49.0">Synapse 1.49.0</a> is out now!</p>
<h2 id="platform-deprecations">Platform deprecations</h2>
<p>Synapse 1.49.0 is the last version of Synapse to officially support Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6. This follows our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.49/deprecation_policy.html">platform dependency deprecation policy</a>.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this, Synapse 1.49.0 is the last version of Synapse to support Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver), as it ships with Python 3.6.</p>
<p>On the topic of supported Ubuntu releases, please note that Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo) reaches its own end of life <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2021-December/000275.html">on January 20, 2022</a>. Past this date we will stop producing new packages for Ubuntu 21.04.</p>
<h2 id="improved-documentation">Improved documentation</h2>
<p>Up until now, a lot of very useful information was stored on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/wiki">Synapse repo's wiki</a>, which wasn't well advertised nor well reviewed.</p>
<p>With this release, we have migrated most of this information to Synapse's <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest">documentation website</a>, so all the information you need to set up, maintain and troubleshoot a Synapse instance lives at the same place. Included in these new pages are the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.49/usage/administration/admin_faq.html">server admin FAQ</a> and a <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.49/usage/administration/understanding_synapse_through_grafana_graphs.html">guide to Synapse's Grafana dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.49/media_repository.html">media repository</a> documentation has also been updated with a lot of details about how Synapse stores media files.</p>
<h2 id="refresh-tokens">Refresh tokens</h2>
<p>When a Matrix client needs to authenticate a request to a homeserver, it uses what is called an access token. Sometimes server administrators might not want a user's access token to live forever (e.g. for security reasons). To address this concern, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918</a> introduces the concept of refresh tokens to Matrix.</p>
<p>Initial support for refresh tokens in Synapse was introduced in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.38.0">version 1.38.0</a>. Synapse 1.49.0 finalises and stabilises this implementation, allowing any client that supports this feature to use it as it is currently described in the related MSC.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release introduces the last changes needed to Synapse for basic threading support. It also introduces support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>, which allows clients to jump to a specific date in a room's history (expect a sneak peek of this in the next episode of Matrix Live!).</p>
<p>Another interesting point is the addition of a couple of <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.49/usage/administration/admin_api/federation.html">admin APIs for federation</a>. More specifically, they allow you to visualise all of the other homeservers your Synapse instance has been interacting with, as well as how successful the last attempts at communicating with them have been.</p>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.49.0/CHANGES.md">release notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Ma27">Maximilian Bosch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir">Tulir Asokan</a>.</p>
<h2 id="till-next-year">Till next year</h2>
<p>This is the last release of Synapse of 2021! The Synapse team will take a break for the holidays, pushing the next release of Synapse (1.50.0) to January 11, 2022.</p>
<p>We'd like to thank everyone who has been using Synapse, contributing to it, and/or supporting us for the past year, and we hope to see you again in 2022! 🎆</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Synapse 1.49, due out on December 14th, will be the <strong>last release of Synapse to support Python 3.6 or PostgreSQL 9.6</strong> per our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.48/deprecation_policy.html">platform dependency deprecation policy</a>. Accordingly, we will remove support for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) at the same date, as it ships with Python 3.6.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="password-resets-and-identity-servers">Password resets and identity servers</h2>
<p>This release removes the long-deprecated <code>trust_identity_server_for_password_resets</code> configuration option. This option was initially deprecated in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.4.0">Synapse 1.4.0</a> back in October 2019.</p>
<p>Admins of servers still using this configuration option will need to update their Synapse configuration to send password resets through an SMTP server directly rather than relying on identity servers to send them on their behalf.</p>
<h2 id="new-admin-apis-and-improved-alignment-with-matrix-1-1">New <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin APIs</a> and improved alignment with Matrix 1.1</h2>
<p>This release also introduces a handful of new admin APIs, allowing administrators to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#controlling-whether-a-user-is-shadow-banned">un-shadow-ban users</a>, <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#block-room-api">block a room</a>, and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/background_updates.html#run">run specific background updates</a> (but we'll talk about this last one a bit later on). The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#delete-room-api">delete room API</a> has also been updated to be able to run in the background or to block a room pre-emptively, even if the server doesn't know about it yet.</p>
<p>This release also brings Synapse into greater alignment with version 1.1 of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">the Matrix specification</a> by adding support for API paths beginning <code>/_matrix/client/v3</code> and <code>/_matrix/media/v3</code>.</p>
<h2 id="background-updates">Background updates</h2>
<p>When Synapse updates from one version to another, it might need to run large scale updates on its database. In order to avoid blocking startup for too long while waiting for these updates to run, Synapse runs them in the background after starting.</p>
<p>Lately the Synapse team has been doing some work to improve the performance of these background updates. More specifically, this release includes a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11421">performance fix</a> for a background update introduced in Synapse 1.47.0, as well as a <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/background_updates.html#run">new admin API</a> to let admins rerun specific updates.</p>
<p>Future Synapse updates will also include <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11306">module capabilities</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11260">more configuration options</a> for controlling background updates.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release also includes some improved support of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> to help threading. It also adds support for the stable identifiers from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2778">MSC2778</a>, bringing Synapse closer to supporting end-to-end (or end-to-bridge) encryption support for application services.</p>
<p>We also now publish a Docker image, <code>matrixdotorg/synapse:develop</code>, which tracks the development head of Synapse.</p>

<p>It's demo week again this week! We've got three great demos to share with you this month:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robert, the latest addition to the Matrix VoIP team, gives us a sneak peek at his experiments with implementing native full mesh video calls in Matrix</li>
<li>Gil, from the Element iOS team, gives us an update on the implementation of Spaces in the app</li>
<li>and finally Ryan, who's been exploring ways to use Matrix beyond chat, shows us his shiny new full stack integration test solution for Matrix client and servers</li>
</ul>
<p>And I hear there might also have been a bonus demo that managed to sneak its way lower down this post 😉</p>

<p>Work on the new spec release continues, and the infrastructure side of it is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3310">making progress</a>. Once its in place, there are a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2844#issuecomment-892040300">few more changes to the spec content</a>, before it'll be ready. Watch this space!</p>
<p>Room version 8 is due to land soon - which will bring restricted rooms to the masses. This is most useful in the context of Spaces, which allows granting access to rooms in a space based on a user's membership of that space (or another space!).</p>

<p>Today in not-Synapse news, we're getting ready for a new release of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a>, our reference implementation of a Matrix push notification gateway, early next week. The most significant change is that Shay, one of our Outreachy interns, has determined that Sygnal can function completely statelessly, removing the need for a SQLite or PostgreSQL database. This clears the path for proper horizontal scaling and high availability deployments of Sygnal.</p>
<p>On the Synapse side of the world, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289: Room version 8</a> entered Final Comment Period (FCP) and we expect it to be merged into the Matrix spec over the weekend. If that occurs, we'll be on track to include support for this room version in Synapse 1.40 next week. Tune in next week to find out how that went!</p>

<p>Almost all features are on the master branch already, so please try to deploy your own Conduit now and try to find bugs. See https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit</p>
<p>State res has been tested a lot, so it's okay to join any public rooms (room version 6 preferred).</p>
<p>The barebones DEPLOY.md is the easiest and most tested way to install Conduit. We also have docker images, but I think the documentation still needs to be improved (please contribute if you can!)</p>

<p>Heya, we are very grateful for all the awesome translators helping us translate FluffyChat! Unfortunately, we aren't the best at managing such a huge effort as translating such a large app into so many different languages. As a result, suggestions went un-reviewed on weblate for long, people weren't able to submit translations, etc. We are very sorry for that, but want to work on fixing that! As, well, we are only really programmers with little time, we thought of asking for help from the community (you all!)! That is why we are looking for a translation manager for FluffyChat. No programming experience at all is required, it'd mostly be about managing our weblate and answering translation-related questions. If you are interested, please plop into our room <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fluffychat:matrix.org">#fluffychat:matrix.org</a> and say so! (And ping <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a> if you don't get answers). Looking forward to a where translations are managed better, and thank you again for everyone who did bite through all this and contributed translations so far!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I added a sticker/emoji pack editor to Nheko. This means you now don't need to create packs manually in /devtools anymore, but you can create and edit packs much more conveniently. There are still some rough edges, but we expect to sort those out in the near future. Make sure you check out the demo video I recorded!</p>
<p>Furthermore LorenDB has been busy porting more of the remaining dialogs to Qml, dialogs should now float properly on Wayland and have a proper close button on KDE. We also fixed a few more encryption bugs, which means we should be able to mark E2EE as stable in Nheko soon and we cleaned up old cruft in the codebase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if that's not enough for you, since it's demo week, Nico's also showing off Nheko's brand new sticker goodness!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A collaborative whiteboard based on the [matrix] protocol. <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard">github</a></p>
<p>A lot has happened this week. The biggest task was the switch to a proper build system (the project now is based on yarn and webpack). This gave the opportunity to do lots of refactoring and code cleanup. Additionally there is now a spec for the whiteboard events which got implemented this week. For the ones who are curious, here is the file: <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard/blob/main/spec.md">spec</a></p>
<p>There are also a couple of new features and fixes. Most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Text tool</strong> was added. Text in different colors and sizes can be added to the whiteboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Image tool</strong> was added. Images are uploaded and than rendered on the canvas (not yet published but will be available in a couple of days)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The styling was improved. There are less gray areas which I did not like and the corners are less round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the repository got a lot of love with more details in the <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard/blob/main/readme.md">readme</a> and better code/folder structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is now also a matrix room for feedback, issues and ideas: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TheBoard:matrix.org">#TheBoard:matrix.org</a></p>

Its goal is to provide a safe and convenient way for close friends and families to share things that they wouldn't post publicly -- e.g. for parents to safely share pictures of their kids.</p>
<p>Recent updates to the Circles beta include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for use with any Matrix homeserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emoji reactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown formatting for posts and photo captions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better support for larger screens (iPad)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The latest beta build of Circles (v0.90) is available from Apple on <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/cWuDwqpG">TestFlight</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've also added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE 1</strong> - If you're using an existing account, you'll need to tap the &quot;Advanced Options&quot; on the login screen so you can give it your password for SSSS / encrypted key backup / recovery / etc.  Otherwise Circles will try to use a login password that it generates with <a href="https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/matrix-doc/blob/single-password-SSSS/proposals/3265-login-and-ssss-with-single-password.md">MSC 3265</a> so it can do everything safely using just a single password.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 2</strong> - Circles is NOT RECOMMENDED for use on an account that you're already using for Matrix chat, for the above reason and more.  If you do this, prepare to see lots of extra, weird rooms in Element / Fluffy / Nheko / whatever chat client you're using.  Also if you decide to try this anyway, please let me know how it goes.  :-)</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 3</strong> - Circles is not available yet in France.  Sorry.  I gotta update my encryption compliance documentation with Apple.</p>

<p>I've been working on a <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK/dendrite-helm">helm chart</a> for Dendrite (polylith/monolith (untested)), since i was sick of creating a single deployment for each component.
For now it's working as expected, but since I'm pretty new to creating helm charts, please let me know if there's something wrong/bad practice.</p>
<p>NOTE: Polylith is not yet supported by the developers!</p>

<p>The 1.30 release focused on improving our resilience to interruptions in federation, both being smarter about what work we do, as well as improving the CPU and DB performance of the <code>state_ids</code> endpoint by at least an order of magnitude. Check the release post for full details.</p>

<p>In other news, we've decided to try out GitHub Actions for automated testing of Synapse and will report back in a few weeks. Our hope is that this makes our CI more amenable to iterative improvement and outside contributions.</p>

<li>If you’d also like access to a test build for Android, we’re working out a better way to deliver test builds, but in the meanwhile let us know in the new <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#spaces-feedback:matrix.org">spaces feedback room</a></li>
<li>There’s lots of rough edges, but we’re first focusing on polishing public spaces, and feedback is welcome in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#spaces-feedback:matrix.org">spaces feedback room</a>, or via GitHub issues</li>
<li>If you run an online community (using any platform), we’d love to talk to learn more about your general pains too, in you guessed it: the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#spaces-feedback:matrix.org">spaces feedback room</a></li>
<li>Watch this week's Matrix Live for a demo of the above!</li>

<p>Hey everyone 👋 One year ago I started to explore combining CRDTs with end-to-end encryption (Matrix's Olm/Megolm) to allow people to collaborate on the same documents/data. Couple months back I got a first prototype working and then evolved to a production ready app. Think of a simple Google Docs, but end-to-end encrypted and offline-first (iOS &amp; Android for now).</p>
<p>Feedback, ideas and question are very welcome!</p>
<p>Website: https://www.serenity.re/en/notes</p>
<p>The app/client source is available here: https://github.com/SerenityNotes/serenity-notes-clients</p>

                <p>Synapse 1.19.1 is a bug fix release to fix two bugs introduced in 1.19.0.</p>
<p>Those two bugs were related to the new rate-limiter on room joins, which was introduced in 1.19.0.</p>
<p>The first bug caused Synapse to ignore exceptions to rate-limiting for application services.</p>
<p>The second one prevented profile updates from being correctly propagated across rooms.</p>
<p>Sorry if you have been bitten!</p>
<p>Get 1.19.1 from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.19.1">github</a> or any of the sources mentioned at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md.</p>
