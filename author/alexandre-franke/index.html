<p>Julian Sparber from the Fractal team was here with us this week, to tell us about the Fractal Next initiative: a rewrite of the app that leverages new technology.

<h3 id="sync-v3">Sync v3</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> shared very exciting news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a brand new <code>/sync</code> mechanism, dubbed sync v3, for the past few months. This is a complete overhaul of how clients live-stream sync data from homeservers, and fixes numerous pain points with <code>/sync</code> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syncs taking minutes to complete.</li>
<li>Syncs sending back vast quantities of data (e.g read receipts for every room you're in).</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, this new API is designed around the idea of having dynamic sliding windows around a sorted room list for a user's account. The room list can be sorted in different ways and <em>only rooms in the window are returned to the client</em>. The room list can also be filtered down based on various criteria (e.g only rooms in these spaces, with events newer than this timestamp, etc) and a subset of current room state can be requested with each returned room.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>
</span><span>         All joined rooms on user&#39;s account
</span><span>Q W E R T Y U I O P L K J H G F D S A Z X C V B N M
</span><span>
</span><span>\                                                 /
</span><span> \                                               /
</span><span>
</span><span>  \      Subset of rooms matched by filters     /
</span><span>   Q W E R T Y U I O P L K J H G F D S A Z X C V
</span><span>
</span><span>                       |
</span><span>   A C D E F G H I J K L O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z     Rooms sorted by_name (or by_recency, etc)
</span><span>
</span><span>   |_______|
</span><span>       |
</span><span>
</span><span>   A C D E F                                         first 5 rooms requested
</span></code></pre>
<p>This list is kept sorted on the server and deltas are communicated to the client as a series of delta operations (e.g INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE). Multiple non-overlapping windows can be requested and the windows can also change their size dynamically.</p>
<p>This work is still currently in the pre-MSC stage as it's a huge undertaking, but an early, runnable, implementation lives at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sync-v3">sync-v3</a> repo. This works by setting up a proxy sync server which will make <code>/sync</code> requests to a target homeserver, and storing the data in a useful form for sync v3 queries. It then exposes the sync v3 API which can then actually show you real data from your account.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span> +---------+                     +--------------+                                 +----------------+
</span><span>
</span><span> | sync v3 | &lt;-- sync v3 API --&gt; |   sync v3    | &lt;--- normal /sync requests ---&gt; | Any Homeserver |
</span><span> | client  |                     | proxy server |                                 |      Impl      |
</span><span>
</span><span> +---------+                     +--------------+                                 +----------------+
</span></code></pre>
<p>The proxy server also hosts a barebones web client which talks sync v3 at http://localhost:8008/client/ - to get started just point the proxy server to any HS and then paste in your access token to the web client. The web client is <strong>just a test jig</strong> so only has a <em>read-only</em> view of your account and lacks any scrollback, only showing live data. IMPORTANT: generate a new access token before using this client. Do NOT use the token from an existing client (e.g Element web) or else you risk being unable to decrypt E2EE messages.</p>
<p>Intrepid people are encouraged to run a server and see how fast sync on their own account could possibly be in the future. Note that the <em>first</em> sync will be slow as it has to fetch all the user's data via v2 <code>/sync</code>.</p>

<p>This week the Spec Core Team has been marching ahead with getting the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc">matrix-doc</a> repository ready to start building new spec releases. Big props to Rich, Travis, Alexandre and others for charging ahead with it!</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Spec Core Team has been busy reviewing MSCs as can be seen from the above list of MSCs that have entered FCP this week. Particularly exciting is to see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> (event relationships, aka the stuff that powers message edits and reactions) coming close to merging! It's been a long time coming. Thanks to Bruno and everyone else who's reviewed it so far.</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3214">MSC3214: Allow overriding <code>m.room.power_levels</code> using <code>initial_state</code></a>.</p>
<p>MSC3214 looks like an MSC that's been somewhat abandoned by everyone involved... But since there are already implementations out in the wild, it may be a simple one to get through!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we have spent some time optimising the Pinecone overlay routing protocol. We have added cryptographic signatures to the bootstrap and path setup process for stronger verification and have also reduced the amount of protocol maintenance traffic.</p>
<p>We are also finally starting to document how Pinecone works ‚Äî you can find these living documents on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone/wiki">Pinecone repository wiki</a> and many new comments have been added throughout the source code too.</p>
<p>We have also released build 88 of the P2P demo today for <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/Tgh2MEk6">iOS</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uK_BcHGiAYHkN6OAA7P73obAquwShRg5">Android</a>. These demos are forks of the Element app with an embedded Dendrite homeserver and Pinecone-based federation. Users can communicate with each other locally on the same Wi-Fi network, direct between devices in close proximity using Bluetooth Low Energy and globally by using internet peers!</p>

<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/20/synapse-1-45-1-released">released Synapse 1.45</a> this week!</p>
<p>This is the first release to support oEmbed autodiscovery, leading to richer link previews for many sites. See the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/20/synapse-1-45-1-released">release announcement</a> for an example.</p>
<p>We also believe that we've <em>finally</em> fixed stuck messages! A <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9424">race condition</a> would occasionally prevent your sent events from syncing back  down to all of your clients. This caused messages to look like they were stuck at the bottom of the room, waiting to finish sending, even though other users would receive and see them normally.</p>
<p>Please shout loudly in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9424">this GitHub issue</a> if you see a stuck message on a server running 1.45 or later. üòâ</p>
<p>We've merged a further 9 pull requests to Sydent, making even more modules pass mypy --strict. We're not quite <em>all</em> the way there, but we're close! Most of the &quot;leaf&quot; modules are done, with the bulk of the remaining work to be done is on <code>sydent.http</code>. This is trickier because it's more exposed to the machinery of Twisted, but we'll get there.</p>
<p>We're already much more confident working in Sydent, and hope to apply these lessons to Synapse soon.</p>
<p>(Well, one lesson that won't apply is that type hints are <em>especially</em> valuable in codebases you don't touch as often... but we have no intention of slowing down on Synapse any time soon!)</p>

<p>Release v1.3.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>

<li>
<p>CertFP authentication support</p>

<li>
<p>Compatibility/workaround for Dendrite and Conduit registration configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>README has been improved</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Big ticket items this time around for privacy concerned users are connectivity improvements when using Tor/VPN with built-in SOCKS proxy support and CertFP authentication. Some WHOIS and CTCP has also been thrown in the mix for good measure!</p>
<p>Lately there has been quite a lot of people who are testing Dendrite or Conduit which has led to recurring support issues around some limitations they currently have with appservices. Heisenbridge now supports using and generating a &quot;compatible&quot; registration file (<code>--generate-compat</code>) for them that shouldn't be needed in the long run. I hope to drop this feature as soon as possible! üçª</p>
<p>While Heisenbridge somewhat intentionally has very little documentation due to not having a refined UX yet the README has been updated with some frequently asked questions about installing and configuring it to the point you can talk with the appservice bot. A self-contained docker-compose setup has also been added to the repository to help testing it without installing anything on your system.</p>
<p>Go grab your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last Saturday we had an improvised NeoChat mini development sprint in a small hotel room in Berlin in the occasion of the 25th anniversary of KDE. In a good KDE tradition, Carl spent this time on improving NeoChat settings. He ported both the NeoChat general settings and the specific room settings to the new Kirigami.CategorizedSetting component. Tobias fixed a lot of papercuts and now the power level should be fetched correctly, we show the number of joined users instead of joined+invited users in the room information pane, the user search is now case insensitive. Nicolas focused on fixing our Android build by making the spellchecking feature compile on Android.</p>
<p>Aside from the mini-sprint, we also made a few more improvements during the week. Tobias fixed the flicking of the timeline on mobile and Carl made it possible for the user to resize the room information drawer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thulinma added device management to Nheko. You can now also view your devices, that don't support encryption, delete devices, rename them and see their ip address. Additionally there were a few refactorings and code improvements. Most notably blurhashes should now decode twice as fast. Additionally there were a few small fixes to displaying hidden space rooms (we were checking the wrong power level, so in some cases fewer rooms got shown in a space, if they only had a parent set). That's all, was a busy week with lots of lasers!</p>

<p>a small, weird tool that just works.</p>
<p>Hey, TWIM. Did you ever face a situation where you need to run any command prefixed with <code>time command-name</code> and get a ping in matrix room when it's done? No? Well, doesn't matter, now you can do that with one small command!</p>
<p>That thing called <a href="https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/ttm">time-to-matrix (binary name: ttm)</a> it works like <code>time command-name</code> and sends results to matrix room. Yes, pretty simple. Now you can use it üòÄ</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Element One is here! We‚Äôre giving TWIM a sneak preview of the new Matrix hosting service from Element in advance of the official launch next week. Element One* is a consumer-focused hosting option which gives you an individual Matrix account on our shiny new one.ems.host homeserver (with a matching Element Web at one.element.io). However, in addition to being a fast, snappy Matrix account, it also comes with unlimited personal bridging to Whatsapp, Signal and Telegram thanks to mautrix-whatsapp/signal/telegram!</p>
<p>Hopefully this is good news for those of you who have chats with friends and family on these other platforms, as you can now chat with them in one place from Element without having to mess around having to run your own bridge - and accounts cost just $5 per month.</p>
<p>Right now this is a (relatively) private / limited beta intended for the TWIM and EMS inner circle, and we'll be announcing more generally in the next few days / weeks. So, if you are interested, please check it out and sign up at https://ems.element.io/element-one :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>The actual spec changes for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2844">MSC2844: Global version number for the whole spec</a> have now been merged [<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3420">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3421">two</a>]. You can take a look at <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/#specification-versions">this section</a> of the unstable spec to now see an explanation of the Matrix spec version numbering scheme.</p>
<p>Additionally, take a look at the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/client-server-api/#rooms-1">Client-Server API</a>, where all current APIs have been bumped from <code>/r0/...</code> to <code>/v3/...</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/old_master/proposals/2844-global-versioning.md#endpoint-versioning">this bit of MSC2844</a> for the rationale behind this change.</p>
<p>The pieces are starting to fall into place for the upcoming Matrix 1.1 spec release!</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1840">MSC1840: Typed rooms</a>!</p>
<p>This is a concept that was used in the Spaces MSCs to allow servers and clients to denote a room as a Space vs. a typical Matrix room (and set up their UI appropriately). Only the type for a Space has been specified so far, but there are many different applications room types could serve; for example profile rooms!</p>
<p>This MSC aims to create a general concept for a typed room, whereas future MSCs would identify those types and their meaning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy Friday! The Synapse team has been sorting out what we hope to accomplish before the end of the year, and it's looking like our main focus will remain research and experimentation towards making large room joins go very fast. We don't yet see an incremental path from where we are now to where we want to end up, so progress will likely come as a few discrete milestones, rather than a gradual acceleration over time.</p>
<p>Aside from room joins, we expect to spend a good bit of time time on bug fixes and preventative maintenance. For example, we hope to get Sydent passing <code>mypy --strict</code> by this time next week. Doing so would have prevented recent production issues, including one which caused phone number verification to silently fail.</p>
<p>Preparations for releasing 1.45.0 continue apace; I'm loking forward to telling you about it next week!</p>

<p>Making steps towards stable E2EE, we have now implemented bootstrapping cross-signing on a new account. This allowed me to finally enable cross-signing on my Nico (nheko.im) account (which I intended to only use with Nheko). Thulinma also added a way to refresh the current device list as well as highlighting your current device in the device list, which should make it easier to recover, if a misscommunitcation with the server lead to an outdated device list. Meanwhile LorenDB has been plugging away on converting more dialogs to Qml and we merged like 3 converted dialogs!</p>

<p>Can you believe we didn‚Äôt have a dept. of Widgets yet? We do now!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks! This week I took a bit of time out of my day to create a new widget for Matrix. We have the concept of &quot;Spanners&quot; at Matrix where one person wants to take control of a resource, and they will say &quot;I am taking the spanner&quot;. This prevents other people (verbally at least) from trying to use the resource at the same time.</p>
<p>For years we have been getting by with sending messages into Matrix, but no more! For now anyone can use the Spanner widget to set up a similar system in their room.</p>
<p>You can try this out now with <code>/addwidget https://half-shot.uk/spanner?spannerName=YourSpannerName</code> (although no promises about the uptime of half-shot.uk)</p>
<p>The repo can be found https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-spanner-widget.</p>
<p>You will need to ensure that all users who plan to use it must be able to send state events of type <code>uk.half-shot.spanner</code>. Otherwise, it should be ready to go!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@janshai:beeper.com">janshai</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rager is a CLI tool for matrix client developers to easily view and parse rageshake logs. It handles syncing (with many parameters to sync only the logs you want), searching through downloaded logs, and paging through any log on your device (with peudo-syntax highlighting to make it easier to understand), right from the comfort of your terminal. It has been in development for a few months (being used/tested by devs at <a href="https://www.beeper.com">beeper.com</a>) but I feel like it's now in a good enough state to release for everyone else to use. If it's something that may help you, try it out and let me know if it works for you!</p>

<p>Hi everyone! </p>
<p>We believe that having your own homeserver should be easy and require little technical knowledge. That's why we launched <a href="https://hingst.net">Hingst</a>, a privacy focused Matrix hosting service which takes care of (almost) everything for you. </p>
<p>Our goal is that our users spend no time whatsoever on maintaining the actual server so they can focus on what matters - chatting with friends and colleagues. </p>
<p>All servers are located in Sweden and of course they run entirely on renewable energy! </p>
<p>That's all for now. Thanks for reading :)</p>

<p>This week, I had the great pleasure of chatting with a lovely bunch from Element about Spaces. <a href="https://element.io/blog/spaces-blast-out-of-beta/">This feature just got out of beta</a> and they tell us all about it.</p>

<h3 id="the-spec">The Spec</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello TWIM, it's me, not-anoa, again with your weekly spec update. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to figure out how to run the tooling which generates fancy graphs, but it looks like you'll have a more qualified person next week üòá</p>
<p>This week we saw a couple new MSCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a> - Letting guests do more things (which is needed for things like full mesh conference calling)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3429">MSC3429</a> - A room preview API. Turns out this is more or less a duplicate of another MSC, but has a different approach. Be sure to check both out üôÇ</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also been making progress on trying to get the spec release out by formally specifying all the new global version numbering and new endpoint versioning (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3420">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3421">this</a>), and have been <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3432">experimenting</a> with how room versions are represented by the spec.</p>
<p>From page 6 of the open MSCs there's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2723">MSC2723</a>. The MSC is relatively small, but solves a fairly important problem with forwarded messages in Matrix: where were they forwarded from? From a glance, it has minor technical feedback and could do with an implementation (psst: client authors, this should be easy and fit well into a North American Long Weekend project üòá).</p>
<p>That's all I have for you today, but if I've missed something: sorry, and you should be in capable hands next week.</p>

<p>This week I have completely rewritten the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone">Pinecone</a> router with the aim of improving code quality and boosting performance. It now uses significantly less resources, making it much easier to simulate larger networks and using less battery power on mobile devices.</p>
<p>While there is still some work to be done to ensure the Pinecone network gracefully handles large-scale mobility events, protocol development is slowly progressing and we will soon be looking at how Matrix federation can be made more efficient by using routing intelligence from the overlay network.</p>
<p>If you have a passion for routing protocols and/or peer-to-peer systems, we're looking to hire engineers to work in the P2P Matrix space ‚Äî get in touch by <a href="mailto:elementio@jobs.workablemail.com">emailing your resume to us</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/05/synapse-1-44-0-released">released Synapse 1.44</a> this week! The release was mainly focused on bug fixes and internal cleanups. In particular, we've made significant strides toward enforcing static type annotations across several more Synapse modules, we continue to remove &quot;magic&quot; code from our configuration handler, and we've landed significant refactors to both the user directory and federated event authentication. These changes pay off significant technical debt, reduce Synapse's maintenance cost, and ease future bug fixes.</p>
<p>But that's not all. This release also includes performance improvements around JSON serialization, new capabilities for extension modules, and better metrics around cache evictions.

<h4 id="web-desktop">Web/Desktop</h4>
<p>The Web/Desktop variant has received plenty of love for the last few weeks, so best to list some of the bigger changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a setting for the room list style: you can now choose between &quot;roomy&quot; with big avatars and two-line previews, &quot;intermediate&quot; for a smaller avatar and a single line preview, or &quot;compact&quot; to get a tiny avatar and the room preview in the same line of the room name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a setting how to color usernames in the chat: either uniform, based on the MXID, or based on the user's power level (Android has this feature for some time already, too!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a setting to not open automatically the most recent chat when switching spaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved theme settings: you can now choose custom themes independently for both light and dark mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workaround for switching between light and dark mode together with the system on Linux</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>macOS builds are now signed</p>

Instead of asking you about each part of the standup post individually, it creates threads for each of the parts that you can fill in. Your replies get added to the standup post like before, but it's a bit more interactive of a process. Here's a picture of how it looks (ignore all the display bugs due to Element).</p>

<h4 id="an-unofficial-matrix-server-for-the-newgrounds-community">An (unofficial) Matrix server for the Newgrounds community.</h4>
<p>Since I was pressed for time last week, I didn't go much in depth on how this server works. Here is a brief overview of its components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>https://app.ngmvs.one: A self-hosted Element Web with some theming tweaks, and the easiest way to visit the server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>https://matrix.ngmvs.one: the homeserver itself (Synapse). It has open registration, but only for <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/supporter">Newgrounds Supporters</a> (ie. patrons) via SSO logins with Newgrounds accounts. But Newgrounds doesn't have its own &quot;Log in with Newgrounds&quot; capability, so that leads me to the next component:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs/ng-saml-idp">ng-saml-idp</a>: middleware built on <a href="https://pysaml2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PySAML2</a> for using Newgrounds logins as a SAML2 Identity Provider. The code is tailored for my Synapse installation, but it can easily be tweaked to allow Newgrounds SSO logins to any SAML2-compatible service!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs/wbot">W-Bot</a>: a Matrix appservice/bot built on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python">mautrix-python</a> that serves two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Creates Matrix rooms for Newgrounds movie/game submission pages (ie. maps <code>#portal_view_&lt;ID&gt;:ngmvs.one</code> to <code>https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/&lt;ID&gt;</code>), and adds a widget containing the submission itself to these rooms (but only if it's a movie--widgets for games will only have a link)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restricts membership of any room it moderates to logged-in Newgrounds Supporters. Users without a :ngmvs.one account can authenticate to the bot via the &quot;login&quot; bot command, which lets them log into their Newgrounds account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Point 2 also means that anyone on the Matrix network can make a room that's restricted to Newgrounds Supporters. Just make sure the bot has a high enough power level to kick users!</p>
<p>Public (and federation-accessible) instance is at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@w-bot:ngmvs.one">@w-bot:ngmvs.one</a>.</p>
<p>(PS: The &quot;W&quot; stands for &quot;double&quot;--because of its job of &quot;copying&quot; rooms into Matrix.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/newgrounds-mvsx/">MVSX</a>: a Firefox extension that, when visiting a Newgrounds movie/game submission page, puts a button in the URL bar that sends you to the Matrix room created for that submission by W-Bot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This week's updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>W-Bot now has the <code>inviteme</code> command to invite the issuing user to the invite-only space room for logged-in Newgrounds Supporters. (Users should be invited there automatically, but this command is for people who leave / reject invites to that space &amp; want to re-join it later.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MVSX extension has been updated to allow joining rooms with Matrix clients other than <a href="https://app.ngmvs.one/">app.ngmvs.one</a>. Right-clicking the URL bar icon now shows a drop-down list of alternative clients, and lets you set which one to use by default (on left-clicks of the icon).</p>
</li>

<p>Hi everyone! Did you ever feel lost in the Matrix world? The room directory is big, but it's still hard to find something you like. Or are you a room moderator, but there is not much activity in your room because it doesn't have enough users?</p>
<p>This is why I want to share rooms (or spaces) I find interesting.</p>
<hr />
<p>This week's space is: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#retro:nil.im">#retro:nil.im</a></p>
<p><strong>&quot;I‚Äòm in plenty of retro computing and gaming related Discords and got annoyed that there was no such thing on Matrix. So, I created a Matrix Space for all things retro computing and gaming, hoping there might be enough like-minded people on Matrix to build a community. There should hopefully be rooms for everything now, although a few are still missing room icons - that will come over the next days. Here‚Äôs to hoping that the retro computing community can also thrive outside of Discord üòÅ.&quot;</strong></p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2582">MSC2582</a> (Removing mimetype from EncryptedFile object) was one of those MSCs that were relatively small, but had been languishing for <em>ages</em>. Partly because it required client implementations to update, but also partly because one needed to go in after a while and actually confirm that all known clients had updated. @uhoreg took up the mantle on his own to do so, and as a result this MSC has hit FCP and is soon to be merged. Thank you!</p>
<h4 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h4>
<p>The random MSC of the week is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3262">MSC3262: aPAKE authentication</a>!</p>
<p>Alongside <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2957">MSC2957</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3265">MSC3265</a>, this MSC is requesting a better way of communicating one's password to the homeserver without sending it in plaintext (over TLS, hopefully).</p>
<p>Remember that this is only done in exchange for an access token, which is then used for all subsequent requests. Still though, I can see the merit!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el">Ement.el</a>, a Matrix client for Emacs, gained some more improvements this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multi-account support was merged, so you can now use multiple accounts at the same time.  You can even be in the same room in two different accounts, at the same time, in side-by-side windows (which is useful for testing).  (Note that existing users will need to log in again, because the format of the saved-session file changed.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rooms you have been invited to now show up in the rooms list, and you can join them by clicking a button in the room's buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypted rooms now display a warning in the header and suggest that users consider using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon/">Pantalaimon</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Membership events are now formatted more usefully, similar to Element's style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completion for room and user names and IDs is implemented using standard Emacs commands and bindings (i.e. <code>C-M-i</code> by default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last-read marker may be jumped to, even if it's at an earlier event that has not yet been retrieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emotes (i.e. <code>/me</code>-style messages) can be sent by pressing <code>e</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timestamps in the room list are shaded according to how &quot;hot&quot; (i.e. recently updated) the room is (see screenshot).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various small fixes and enhancements.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now supports uploading to online key backup and warns you before enabling it, that we don't recommend using the asymmetric version. If you update to one of the current builds (and or the next version), you will also experience a bit longer load times on first startup. That is because we force-cleared the cache to be able to handle the new goodies like spaces and sticker/emote-packs. In the best case, everything is seamless.</p>
<p>We also had contributions by various people:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>resolritter cleaned up that while tab moved you down most popup lists, it didn't move up when shift was pressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harmathy extended the FAQ to answer commonly asked questions like &quot;Does Nheko support E2EE&quot; or &quot;What commands are supported&quot;. Don't worry, we know most of you won't read that and will still answer that question when you undoubtedly come asking it again. We just can now be even more passive aggressive than just pointing at the right wiki page. Instead we will point at the FAQ now, which will point at the wiki!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thombles made the emoji completer behave more nicely. Instead of jumping to the bottom left corner before closing, it will now just close. It should also now behave correctly when selecting text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alfasi updated the install instructions for Gentoo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure we have ever seen that many new faces contributing to Nheko in a week, I'm pretty happy to see that!</p>

<h3 id="ruma">Ruma</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ruma.io/">Ruma</a> is a set of Rust library crates around Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org">jplatte</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been so long since our last update that I couldn't possibly list all of the individual changes, but here's a rough overview of the work since then (three months ago):</p>
<p>There's been loads of bug fixes, many compatibility improvements and at least one large refactoring. We've been much faster about releasing changes to crates.io after ruma 0.1.0, now we're already at ruma 0.4.0 (!);  the changes needed to upgrade are really not that significant though. Notable areas of improvement are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UIAA: No more stringly-typed auth type + map of properties. The <code>AuthData</code> enum that holds the authentication information clients send to servers now has one variant for every auth type defined in the spec.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event relations: These used to be serialized wrongly for encrypted events and were only (de)serializable as part of a larger event (making using them in custom ways impossible). Both of these issues were fixed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the GSoC coding period is over and our students have both written a blog post summarizing their work: <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/gsoc-coverage/">API Coverage project (Adam Blanchet)</a>, <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/gsoc-tools/">Tooling project (Devin Ragotzy)</a></p>
<p>If you want more detailed updates about Ruma, please watch <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">our repository</a>'s GitHub releases, since nobody in the project currently wants to write regular blog posts or TWIM updates (if you are interested in changing that, get in touch over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week a new stable version of libQuotient, 0.6.8, has been <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.6.8">released</a>. While the main focus has been fixing bugs and sustaining the codebase, one significant highlight is that read receipts and fully read markers are distinguished now, which should improve interaction with other clients that has been treating them differently for quite some time now. This version is anticipated to become the base of the upcoming Quaternion 0.0.95.</p>
