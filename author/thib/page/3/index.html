</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>There's been lots of new MSCs this week! Three of them - those regarding state restrictions and subkeys - are related to the ongoing live location sharing work that Element is currently working on. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3672">MSC3672</a> for the current state of the spec work for that feature.</p>
<p>Otherwise the spec core team has been reviewing a flurry of MSCs this week. This includes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3383">MSC3383</a> (Include destination in X-Matrix Auth Header), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3700">MSC3700</a> (Deprecate plaintext sender key) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2246">MSC2246</a> (Asynchronous media uploads). Exciting things in the pipeline!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2815">MSC2815: Proposal to allow room moderators to view redacted event content</a>!</p>
<p>Another MSC in the sphere of moderation, and one that aims to put moderation control more in the hands of room admins rather than homeserver admins. A similar MSC in this realm is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3215">MSC3215</a> (Aristotle), which aims to send event reports to room admins, rather than homeserver admins that may not even have control over the malicious user.

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan Abolivier</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happy Friday everyone!</p>
<p>In case you missed it, we've released the first release candidate for Synapse 1.56 on Tuesday. This one includes a couple new module-related features, but also quite a few bugfixes and internal improvements. I'll talk about this in more details next week when Synapse 1.56 gets properly released, but the key points of this release is that Synapse will now refuse to start if it's configured with unsafe registration settings (i.e. open registration without any form of verification) as well as if it's running against a PostgreSQL database with the wrong locale values. Have a look at the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.56/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1560">upgrade notes</a> for more information about this.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the team still continuing work on the two main topics I've been mentioning in previous weeks: fast room joins and integrating <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a>. The latter is getting <em>reeeally</em> close to the finish line now, as the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12337">pull request</a> has recently entered the review stage. So watch this space for more exciting news on this topic!</p>

<p>It feels like one of these comes out nearly every month, which probably means we're doing something right! This release takes a step back and fixes quite a few of our more longstanding bugs and fixes many nits here and there. Please read the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.3.0">change notes</a> carefully as some APIs have moved around and your load balancers / config may need adjusting. One final note is that this release drops support for Node 12, making the minimum version Node 14.</p>
<p>Once again, thanks to the wider Matrix community for filing bugs and submitting PRs, it's very much appreciated!

<blockquote>
<p>More updates! This week the bridge library itself gets a major update. We've made a few breaking changes, notably we now expect target homeservers to at least be Matrix v1.2 compatible. Also, this release brings the new &quot;Provisioning and Widgets API&quot; which allows developers to start creating HTTP APIs for their bridges which work for both provisioning mode (shared secret tokens) and widget API style (authenticating via Matrix OpenID token sharing). This stuff is still a little experimental, but it's starting to power our new experiments in the bridge world.</p>

<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Media messages, both from or to KakaoTalk, are now supported!  The biggest exceptions are inbound files &amp; stickers.  The latter may be a hard sell to get working, due to how KT manages stickers, but I'll look into it some more before giving a concrete answer.</p>
<p>The bridge is also now responsive to disconnects, like when you log in from another KakaoTalk desktop client (since the bridge mimics the desktop client, and KT only allows one desktop client to be logged in at a time!).  Luckily, not all KakaoTalk APIs rely on the same connection that chatting does, meaning that some functionality can continue to work even when &quot;disconnected&quot;.  The bridge now takes advantage of this, meaning that profile-management commands (currently just the <code>list-friends</code> command) will work even if you get disconnected from chats for whatever reason.</p>
<p>The bridge is drawing ever closer to &quot;good enough&quot; status...  Please give it a try if curious!</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.0 is a big number and a step not taken lightly. But Nheko has been in development for half a decade and we think it is time to take a step forward! As such we worked hard to fix readability issues in the app. Your messages should now be readable on any theme, because we send the first half as white text and the second half as black text (thank you, rrogalski for the contribution). For accessibility reasons this is enabled by default. We also added an improved typing indicator. Sometimes it is hard to notice when a message is too long, as such we gradually adjust the background color the longer the message gets. It also helps a lot, if you have a bad theme and can't read the text against the background color. Just enter a few characters and the background will change, so the messages should become readable. But that is not all! We all know some people have  a harder time seeing colors than others. So for accessibility we also slowly rotate the screen, so that even if your display is monochrome, you don't miss out. Please see the attached video for a demo or check out our release candidates <a href="https://matrix.neko.dev/_matrix/media/r0/download/neko.dev/GsEuaoEXokYtZUStAmxrRcOs">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/tree/march-2022">here</a>.</p>

<p>Before this month we also rewrote the room creation dialogs to be less confusing. We now have separate dialogs for direct chats and group chats, which should cut down confusion between the options by a lot. You can also now edit the topic and name of a room inline and Malte added a jump to bottom button. On mobile you can also now drag to the sides to reply. Last but not least, you can now knock on rooms from Nheko using <code>/knock</code> or if an invite failed because you were not allowed to join a room and you can add a reason to room joins, leaves, invites, knocks and everything. Some of those features require the server to support Matrix v1.1, so make sure you update your servers to use them.</p>

<p>I'm doing a <a href="https://accu.digital-medium.co.uk/session/matrix-is-a-distributed-real-time-database/">talk about Matrix</a> at the <a href="https://www.accu.org/conf-main/main/">ACCU Conference</a> on Saturday 9th April. Recordings of talks will be available soon after the conference, and tickets are still available to be there live in person or online! Here's the talk summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Matrix network provides messaging (like WhatsApp or Slack) that offers all the features you expect, but without centralised control: it's an open standard, and anyone can run a server. The servers link together, so you can talk to other people even if they use a different server (kind of like email).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first half of this session, we will explore the basics of the protocol: making simple HTTP requests to send and receive messages, and discuss some of the interesting distributed-systems issues that make writing a server exciting.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the second half we will explore the fact that messaging is only one potential use of this network, and look into some examples of other real-time use cases that are in active development, taking note of how these use cases benefit from the real-time and distributed nature of the network.</p>

<p>There was some silence lately on this, but activity is picking back up.</p>
<p>Mainly, the project is getting rewritten. Why? Well, I learned from the issues and ran into issues with the framework used. There are going to be various changes to the architecture (like no more SSR, no nextjs, pwa support and more).</p>
<p>Feel free to follow https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-art/pull/121 for progress.</p>
<p>Another big thing that's going to change is that I am working on a complete redesign.  While I am still fairly early in the iterations, I wanted to share the first art direction Matrix Art is going to go. The main changes are that I try to have an art language which distinguishes it from the other proprietary players, as well as compensating for the fact that Matrix Art has a much lower volume of images on it's feed. Please be aware that this is way before the first round of polish. :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey everyone! This week we've released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.0">Synapse 1.55</a>, which includes a bunch of new features, performance improvements and bugfix. If you're using Mjolnir to moderate your rooms, and/or <code>synctl</code> to manage your homeserver, this release also introduces a few changes you definitely want to be aware of, head over to the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/22/synapse-1-55-released">announcement</a> on the matrix.org blog for more!</p>
<p>Yesterday, we noticed a compatibility issue with a newly released version of <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/">Jinja</a>, which is the tool we use in Synapse to render e-mail and web templates. We've quickly put out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.2">Synapse 1.55.2</a> to address this - so if you were unable to start Synapse because of it just update and you should be fine üôÇ
Note that this doesn't apply to deployments of Synapse using the <code>matrixdotorg/synapse</code> Docker image or Debian packages from <code>packages.matrix.org</code> since they are already using a compatible version of Jinja.</p>
<p>Apart from that, work continues towards integrating <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> with Synapse, which should prevent this kind of issues from happening in the future, and on improving room join times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We've just released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.7.0">Dendrite 0.7.0</a>, which has quite a lengthy list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The roomserver input API will now queue all events into NATS, which provides better crash resilience</li>
<li>The roomserver input API now configures per-room consumers, which should use less memory</li>
<li>Canonical aliases can now be added and removed</li>
<li>MSC2946 Spaces Summary now works correctly, both locally and over federation</li>
<li>Healthcheck endpoints are now available at:
<ul>
<li><code>/_dendrite/monitor/up</code>, which will return 200 when Dendrite is ready to accept requests</li>
<li><code>/_dendrite/monitor/health</code>, which will return 200 if healthy and 503 if degraded for some reason</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>X-Matrix</code> federation authorisation header now includes a <code>destination</code> field, as per MSC3383</li>
<li>The <code>/sync</code> endpoint now uses less memory by only ranging state for rooms that the user has participated in</li>
<li>The <code>/messages</code> endpoint now accepts stream positions in both the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> parameters</li>
<li>Dendrite will now log a warning at startup if the file descriptor limit is set too low</li>
<li>The federation client will now attempt to use HTTP/2 if available</li>
<li>The federation client will now attempt to resume TLS sessions if possible, to reduce handshake overheads</li>
<li>The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.7.4</li>
<li>NATS streams that don't match the desired configuration will now be recreated automatically</li>
<li>When performing a graceful shutdown, Dendrite will now wait for NATS Server to shutdown completely, which should avoid some corruption of data on-disk</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool has seen a number of improvements, will now ask for passwords automatically</li>
<li>The <code>/sync</code> endpoint will no longer lose state events when truncating the timeline for history visibility</li>
<li>The <code>/context</code> endpoint now works correctly with <code>lazy_load_members</code></li>
<li>The <code>/directory/list/room/{roomID}</code> endpoint now correctly reports whether a room is published in the server room directory or not</li>
<li>Some bugs around appservice username validation have been fixed</li>
<li>Roomserver output messages are no longer unnecessarily inflated by state events, which should reduce the number of NATS message size errors</li>
<li>Stream IDs for device list updates are now always 64-bit, which should fix some problems when running Dendrite on a 32-bit system</li>
<li>Purging room state in the sync API has been fixed after a faulty database query was corrected</li>
<li>The federation client will now release host records for remote destinations after 5 minutes instead of holding them in memory forever</li>
<li>Remote media requests will now correctly return an error if the file cannot be found or downloaded</li>
<li>A panic in the media API that could happen when the remote file doesn't exist has been fixed</li>
<li>Various bugs around membership state and invites have been fixed</li>
<li>The memberships table will now be correctly updated when rejecting a federated invite</li>
<li>The client API and appservice API will now access the user database using the user API rather than accessing the database directly</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are some minor changes for Docker users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Docker images are now published to GitHub Container Register as well as Docker Hub ‚Äî they can be found <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/packages?repo_name=dendrite">here</a></li>
<li>Docker images are now being automatically generated for the <code>main</code> branch by CI and will be available on the <code>:main</code> tag</li>

<p>Hi all üëã.</p>
<p>A little over a year has passed since our last update, but we're not dead! On the contrary, Syphon has seen some significant improvements over the last year both in terms of features and project structure; the project is more alive than ever before, and we're really excited to share some updates!</p>
<p><strong>Core Team</strong></p>
<p>Syphon now has a core team, consisting of @ereio:matrix.org (creator of Syphon), @ed:geraghty.london, @dnisbetjones:mozilla.org, and @0x1a8510f2:0x1a8510f2.space (me)! With some of the workload now being shared, we're hoping Syphon will grow even faster with less time needed to review and merge PRs, triage and fix bugs, evaluate and implement features and answer support requests.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-platform Availability</strong></p>
<p>Syphon has been steadily expanding its list of supported platforms over the past year:</p>
<ul>
<li>@ed:geraghty.london worked hard to bring Syphon to Windows with full feature parity, including (currently unofficial) Windows builds of Syphon.</li>
<li>@btdmaster:asra.gr has created an <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/syphon-bin">AUR package of Syphon</a> for Arch Linux users.</li>
<li>I've been busy creating a <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.syphon.Syphon">flatpak for Syphon</a> which is available on Flathub.</li>
<li>Regular and official ARM64 builds are also planned soon, with the first manual one already released. Once the CI infrastructure is properly set up, these will be included for every release and the flatpak will receive ARM64 support too!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Releases</strong></p>
<p>Between <code>0.1.7</code> (21 Mar 2021) and <code>0.2.12</code> (23 Mar 2022), 21 releases were published. Of course, too much changed to list everything, but here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-account support üéâ</li>
<li>Media messages üéâ</li>
<li>Markdown support üéâ</li>
<li>Message editing üéâ</li>

<li>Countless new translations</li>
<li>Massive performance improvements</li>
<li>Numerous bug fixes (including encryption and SSO)</li>
<li>Lots of refactoring and cleanup</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these would not have been possible without our awesome contributors.</p>
<p><strong>Translations</strong></p>
<p>We have also received many contributions in the form of translations and Syphon now supports, at least partially, 26 languages. Of these, 6 languages are fully or almost fully translated. To deal with all the incoming translations, there is now also an <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/syphon/syphon/">official Weblate page for Syphon</a>.</p>
<p>All of these translations are submitted by volunteers and we're really grateful for their contributions in making Syphon more accessible to an international audience.</p>
<p><strong>Syphon Space</strong></p>
<p>We also now have an official Syphon space which we use for support, development discussion or just friendly offtopic chat. Come join us if you like at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#syphon-space:matrix.org">#syphon-space:matrix.org</a>!

<h3 id="schildichat-website">SchildiChat (<a href="https://schildi.chat">website</a>)</h3>
<p>SchildiChat is a fork of Element that focuses on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list for both direct messages and groups, which is a more familiar approach to users of other popular instant messengers.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@spiritcroc:spiritcroc.de">SpiritCroc</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SchildiChat-Android now has more styles of message bubbles! So if you prefer the Schildi-bubbles over the Element ones (which you can use too in SchildiChat if you want), you can  now also select between bubbles with or without tail, and select some more round bubbles than what we had previously, which was a highly requested feature!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/TCXQEWpnvMjytkXtIIoHEPGj.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you wonder what makes SchildiChat special except for the different design now that Element has bubbles as well: it's hard to describe in a couple of short sentences, as it's mostly in the details.
So if you are interested in a list of things that we did on Android, I wrote up some aspects <a href="https://github.com/SchildiChat/SchildiChat-android/blob/sc/FEATURES.md">here</a>.
Note however that this list is usually not really kept up-to-date, and there might already be some things that are now outdated since I added them.
However, it might give you some general ideas of what SchildiChat has to offer :)</p>

<p>Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jsparber:gnome.org">Julian Sparber</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello folks, quick update on what major things happened in Fractal-next the last two month. The most exciting addition is definitely the SSO support we merged this week and therefore we could  close a 2 years old issue.</p>
<p>Timeline</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now send files via drag-n-drop and via the file send button to a room. It also includes a nice preview for Images.</li>
<li>The timeline now shows audio messages with a small inline player.</li>
<li>Fractal-next lets you now remove messages you sent</li>
</ul>
<p>Session verification</p>
<ul>
<li>During first login, Fractal checks if the user hasn't started session verification from another client before offering to start a new one</li>
<li>The QrCode scanning is now spec compliant,  and asks for user's confirmation after scanning.</li>
<li>We dropped screenshot support for QrCode scanning, since it makes the UX worse without adding any real benefit. </li>
</ul>
<p>Room details</p>
<ul>
<li>The room details show now the members of the room including the power level</li>
</ul>
<p>Login</p>
<ul>
<li>Fractal-Next now supports SSO üéâÔ∏è</li>
<li>We implemented auto-discovery of the homeserver via .well-known</li>

<p>Sorry that I was a little bit silent in the last weeks. So much stuff to do...</p>
<p>If you haven't heard it yet (because I have not made it that much public yet) there are experimental video calls in FluffyChat now. You need to enable them first under Settings &gt; Chat and then you can try them out. They should be fully compatible with the Element video calls. But be aware that they are very unstable at the moment and may let your app crash.</p>
<h2 id="fluffychat-1-3-1-has-been-released">FluffyChat 1.3.1 has been released</h2>
<p>This release contains a lot of updated translations and bugfixes. I'm very excited about the new keyboard shortcuts from TheOneWithTheBrain. Also in your stories you can now pick the background color and the size of the picture. This is still a little bit experimental but I will share of course update the stories MSC asap.
Thanks to all contributors and translators.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone. It's been a quieter week for the Synapse team---many of us are away this week.</p>
<p>We released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.0rc1">Synapse 1.55.0rc1</a> yesterday, a little later than usual. A full release is still planned for the coming Tuesday (22nd March). Please note that this release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11700">breaks compatibility with Mjolnir 1.3.1 and earlier</a>. Administrators using Mjolnir should ensure it is upgraded before upgrading Synapse to 1.55.0rc1.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the release candidate includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12028">New tools in the module API</a> enabling modules to prevent administrators from deleting rooms and deactivating users. Half-Shot <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12026">explains the movtivation here</a>.</li>
<li>Experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12135">using Twisted's asyncio reactor</a>. If this is feasible, it might allow us to leverage tools and libraries for Python's growing <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html?highlight=asyncio#module-asyncio">asyncio</a> ecosystem.</li>
<li>A performance fix for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12132">logging in on large accounts</a>.</li>
<li>A variety of other bugfixes and internal tweaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please feel free to try it out and let us know how you get on: either in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new/choose">on GitHub</a> if you encounter any unexplained problems. As ever, many thanks to all contributors involved.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes we've been working on a few longer-term projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continued support for threading (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>) and the mechanism which supports it, relations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2674">MSC2674</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11537">Managing Synapse's dependencies</a> using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12028">poetry</a> to formally lock requirements across all our debian and docker releases.</li>
<li>Performance investigations: we're looking at getting better profiling information; and seeing if we can reclaim CPU cycles by cancelling processing when a requester terminates their request early.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully we'll see these plans come to fruition over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week brings some bugfixes to DMs, and general improvements to the way channels are synced on startup.</p>
<p>I've also written some <a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-appservice-kakaotalk/src/branch/master/SETUP.md">setup instructions</a> to assist anyone wanting to try this bridge out for themselves!</p>
<p>As for bugs, I just stumbled upon a big one just now: if a KakaoTalk channel hasn't had activity for a few days, sending a message in its Matrix portal may crash. This happens because of the KakaoTalk API's apparent eagerness in forgetting about inactive channels (IIRC content that's a few weeks old is deleted from their servers, for privacy reasons), and the likely fix is for the bridge to use the right API calls to trigger those channels back into an active state before trying to interact with them.</p>
<p>Once that's fixed, the next thing I'll get out of the way (for the sake of completeness) is the web-based login interface, which all of the other mautrix-python bridges support (and is quite nice for privacy-conscious users that would rather send their KakaoTalk passwords directly to the bridge, instead of through a Matrix homeserver).</p>
<p>After that, I'll work on contact searching &amp; inviting contacts to group chats or DMs.</p>

<p>After our release last week, of course all the bugreports came out of the woodworks.

Key backup is also now enabled by default (if it has the correct signatures and everything), various layouting fixes and more.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Keeping in step with our quarterly spec releases, the release of Matrix v1.3 is expected to land sometime early Q2 2022. This release will include Threads (as defined by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>), as well as a number of other MSCs which land in the meantime.</p>
<p>Speaking of other MSCs, client developers should be aware of upcoming work to support live and static location sharing in the ecosystem. A <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!XXSJTvRPInupfUgQVb:matrix.org/$SM5oKCPu1OYu1uVhn73YMUcJ4kBaQZEp_Z9Xx4EZUgQ?via=pixie.town&amp;via=matrix.org&amp;via=element.io">notice</a> on the subject has been posted today in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-client-developers:matrix.org">Matrix Client Developers room</a>.</p>
<p>A reminder that the matrix-doc GitHub repository has been split into two new repositories: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec">matrix-spec</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals">matrix-spec-proposals</a>. Read more about this in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix#msc-status">the last edition of TWIM</a>.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2398">MSC2398: proposal to allow mxc:// in the &quot;a&quot; tag within messages</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC makes the case for allowing linking to MXC content by using of an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag in the HTML-formatted <code>formatted_body</code> field of a <code>m.room.message</code>. As MXC urls could contain HTML files, it could be rather useful to link directly to them, as you would any other webpage. Your client would then translate this to an http/s URL which can be used to view/navigate to the file.</p>

<p>We've released Synapse 1.54! It includes quite a lot of nice improvements, including around URL previewing, and new callbacks for third-party modules. Check out the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/08/synapse-1-54-released">release announcement</a> for more info on all this goodness.</p>
<p>We've also landed more of the ground work to improve the time it takes for new servers to join big rooms, which Rich was talking about last week. Aside from this, we're continuing the effort towards switching Synapse to use <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>, which will enable reproducible builds for Synapse. These are some very exciting projects which will be maturing in the coming weeks, so watch this space!</p>

<p>The basics of the bridge are now ready! Backfilling, message sending, and message receiving are now implemented...albeit quite buggy and untested.</p>
<p>For anyone curious to try it out, installation follows the same general steps as <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/setup/index.html">tulir's Python-based mautrix bridges</a>, plus a backend Node module that must be launched before the Python component of the bridge. I'll write a README with proper setup instructions soon!</p>
<p>Just note that for the time being, <em>updates to the bridge may invalidate its database!!</em>. I won't guarantee stable DB upgrades until the bridge's early growing pains have settled down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Namaste</em>  üôè,</p>
<p>We are happy to announce that Cinny now support <strong>all the features of Spaces</strong> ‚Äî <em>a way to group rooms in Matrix</em>. This means that you can now create new spaces from client, add rooms or subspaces inside them or manage the added rooms.
We have also made our unique feature of <strong>Pinning spaces</strong> to sidebar more easy and organized. With this option all the spaces and subspaces will be visible at one place and you can select the one you want to pin or remove.
One more unique feature we added with update is the <strong>Categorized subspaces</strong>, what this do is make all the subspaces inside a space appear as categories. This is helpful when there are deep nested spaces inside a space and breadcrumb is pain to navigate back and fourth. Keep in mind that this ignore the nesting of subspaces and all of them will appear under mainspace, but nice thing is that you can select which subspace you want to categorized and which not.
Another exciting update related to spaces is the <em>Drag-and-Drop</em>. Earlier there was no option to reorder pinned spaces but now with DnD you can reorder them as you like.</p>
<p>Apart from spaces this update also include option to drag and drop files, ||sending spoiler||, desktop notification and viewing event source. (Thanks to @ginnyTheCat for these amazing additions.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gatho.party/">Gatho.party</a> is a replacement for Facebook Events for small social gatherings. I've used it for a number of parties and received great feedback, and I'm seeing others are starting to use it too üéâ</p>
<p>To receive confirmations of attendance you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the included Matrix bot to automatically sync RSVP emoji reactions in a linked Matrix room (great
for your friends on Matrix or in a bridged Signal chat)</li>
<li>Send a unique one-click RSVP links to you friends without Matrix (eg. Instagram DMs, SMS)</li>
<li>And as of this week, guests can &quot;self serve&quot; and add their own RSVP via the unique event link, so you can just drop the event link in a Facebook Messenger chat or iMessage group
(without email or phone verification at the moment, so hosts will need to moderate if
their guests go rogue and add multiple fake names!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other recent improvements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to delete guests</li>
<li>Improved call to action and copy text for when a guest with a &quot;magic&quot; link is prompted to RSVP</li>
<li>Confetti animations when your guests RSVP via the Gatho website as &quot;Going&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm currently testing an experimental chat embed using Matrix Live so your guests not on Matrix can optionally see your linked Matrix room - I've found some of my friends join Matrix after seeing this so they can join the action!</p>
<p>I'm keen to eventually use Cactus Comments once I figure out a bit of Elm and have more spare time so that non-Matrix guests can post too.</p>
<p>The Gatho website and bot is <a href="https://github.com/gatho-party/gatho-website">open source (AGPL-3.0) on Github</a>, PRs and Github issues are very welcome! It's built using Next.js in Typescript.</p>

<p>hello! wanted to show a small matrix web client made with unminified js/html/css &amp; web components (wip++)
https://libli.org/
https://gitlab.com/sctlib/libli + https://gitlab.com/sctlib/matrix-room-element
looking forward feedback comments or anything,
cheers &amp; viva la matrix!</p>
<p>for now it only uses default matrix messages, and it is read only, so users have to login/register/CRUD through element (or any other client)
the idea would be to give back users control on their data, allow them to &quot;collect&quot; (individually or as group), any type of content, gathered into matrix room</p>
<p>For now, the client is making HTTP requests to matrix API, to fetch the data of a (public) room, all message &amp; state events.
it also give a &quot;clean URL&quot; <code>libli.org/room:server.tld</code> so users can access their &quot;profile&quot; (chat room) easily (just like a twitter, instagram, medium) page</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://t2bot.io">t2bot.io</a> - a public integrations network for Matrix - has passed 1 Million known rooms and 8.3 Million bridged users. 10,000 of these rooms are attributed to Voyager (a bot which actively goes out to find rooms to map Matrix, with the map currently down for maintenance), leaving the remaining ones either bridged, previously bridged, or using a different integration offered by t2bot.io for free.</p>
<p>The 8.3 Million users are mainly Discord and Telegram users which have been brought over to Matrix through bridges. The stats say &quot;excluding Twitter-bridged&quot; because there's 424,832 old accounts from back in the day when t2bot.io had a free Twitter bridge available. To further break this down, about 6.8M are Telegram users (12% of Telegram) and 1.3M are Discord (&lt;1% of Discord). </p>
<p>For perspective, t2bot.io has about 569 Million events stored in its database and sees approximately 30 thousand people bridged daily from the wider world into Matrix through its bridges. </p>
<p>This post is just a milestone update, but it also serves as a reminder that running your own server/bridges is also possible. In fact, it's even recommended to have better control over your own data and avoid latency issues that large providers, like t2bot.io, can unintentionally introduce. Synapse is relatively easy to set up with minimal sysadmin knowledge (<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/setup/installation.html">guide</a>), and there's always paid offerings like <a href="https://element.io/matrix-services">Element Matrix Services</a> (<a href="https://element.io/element-home">for home</a> and also <a href="https://element.io/element-one">for fun</a>) and <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> for a richer bridging experience than t2bot.io can feasibly provide.</p>

<p>MSC3575 Sliding Sync work is progressing, and a number of new features have been added to the MSC with implementations in the built-in web client in the proxy. A list of changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>spec/proxy: the ability to filter the room list by room name.</li>
<li>spec/proxy: An<code>initial</code> flag on the room to distinguish between updates and the initial sync for a given room. This can be used as a hint to clients to determine if they should update/replace their local data for that room.</li>
<li>proxy: more efficient algorithm for determining overlapping sets of ranges, resulting in fewer bytes over the wire when scrolling.</li>
<li>proxy: the client implementation now supports sending basic text messages as well as issuing<code>/join</code>,<code>/invite</code>,<code>/leave</code> commands.</li>
<li>proxy: the client implementation now has a developer HUD which tracks the Tx/Rx bytes as well as a visual representation of the sliding window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/blog/img/ZCFijelEVxqrDDOrzyvZcpBG.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The net result is a basic but incredibly low bandwidth syncing client: 60.79KB to download an entire initial sync on matrix.org. Further improvements will be done on the client to make sure it doesn't scale with the number of rooms on the user's account (it currently does because it naively adds a placeholder for each room in the list) to ensure it remains extremely snappy and a vision for what Sliding Sync can do in practice, right now. Please continue giving feedback on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575">MSC3575</a> or in <code>#sliding-sync:matrix.org</code> as the API is still in development and will change depending on what clients require.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Heads up! You may have noticed some changes to the matrix-org/matrix-doc github repository this week. The first major one being that it no longer exists!</p>
<p>We have separated it out into two repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec">matrix-org/matrix-spec</a> - the source text of the spec. Issues and pull requests filed here should relate to the source of the spec.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals">matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals</a> - all Matrix Spec Change proposals. New MSCs should be filed against this repository as pull requests. Issues should not be filed against this repository (and no, the issue tracker cannot be disabled, as it would cause transferred issue link redirects to 404).</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary motivation for this was to separate concerns of interacting with matrix-org/matrix-doc. Those interacting with the spec's source would have to wade through long-lived spec proposals, while those only interested in spec proposals would need to filter out spec source files and other issues and PRs related to them. This also helps writing tooling against the repo either as it no longer needs to filter MSCs via issue labels.</p>
<p>Existing links to matrix-doc should be automatically redirected by github to the right place. MSC authors and developers should update their git remote settings to point to the new repos.</p>
<p>What happened in detail to achieve this was:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>matrix-doc</code> was renamed to<code>matrix-spec-proposals</code></li>
<li><code>matrix-spec</code> was created</li>
<li>All files other than the &quot;proposals&quot; folder were transferred from<code>matrix-spec-proposals</code> to<code>matrix-spec</code></li>
<li>All open issues from<code>matrix-spec-proposals</code> were transferred to<code>matrix-spec</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Further details are available here: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues/927</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3383">MSC3383: Include destination in X-Matrix Auth Header</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC asks for the simple change of adding a &quot;destination&quot; field to the <code>Authorization</code> header of federation requests. This would have the benefit of allowing reverse proxies - potentially handling traffic for multiple homeservers - to know where requests should be sent. Or for forward proxies, which could validate outgoing requests from a homeserver before they're sent.</p>
<p>There is currently some discussion on the fundamental idea of the MSCs, which will need to be resolved first before it can move forwards.</p>

<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">Kegan</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been asked by numerous people over months if there are any kind of graphs comparing Synapse and Dendrite. Up until now, my answer has been &quot;as far as I know, no&quot;. However, this got me thinking whether I can use <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a> to engineer some kind of performance testing infrastructure. After hacking on it for a day or two, I can now share some of the work I've done in this area. There now exists two new binaries in the Complement repo: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/tree/main/cmd/perftest">perftest</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/tree/main/cmd/perfgraph">perfgraph</a>. The former will run some tests and output a <code>.json</code> file. The latter will consume these files to generate <code>.svg</code> graphs. The tests performed include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a bunch of rooms with different users. (currently 10 users and 50 rooms)</li>
<li>Joining a bunch of rooms with different users.</li>
<li>Sending messages into rooms with different users. (currently 100 messages)</li>
<li>Doing an initial sync for all users.</li>
<li>Updating the display name of all users.</li>
<li>Doing an incremental sync for all users.</li>
</ul>
<p>The metrics are collected using <code>docker stats</code>. This means the <em>entire container</em> is measured, not just the homeserver binary (e.g any daemons or assistive processes are included in the metrics) and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU time consumed</li>
<li>Memory consumed</li>
<li>Bytes transmitted/received</li>
<li>Disk read/writes</li>
<li>Time taken</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some results:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/XqFhgSQyQMNuElZctQWoqdmx.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This was a surprising find and probably indicates that Dendrite has a memory leak somewhere when creating events. However, the fun doesn't stop there. We can also use this tool to compare different versions of the same homeserver:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/KcWIYkkVAcoHDSmWFmdEdvVF.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This allows us to quantify any performance improvements we've been working on, and you can clearly see how we're being more efficient with CPU in newer versions. But the fun doesn't stop there either. We can also compare different flavours of the same version of a homeserver:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/WwUSbKWYkIUPEOELmeJiPlYO.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>You can quantify the cost of running sqlite or postgres for your particular installation. </p>
<p>Care must be taken when interpreting results. Lower doesn't always mean better. For example, a low readout on &quot;create_users&quot; may be a cause for concern as it might indicate that the server is not hashing passwords correctly (e.g using bcrypt/scrypt which are designed to consume CPU/memory). Servers which don't implement all of the specification will also be abnormally low on CPU/memory (e.g not having to calculate unread counts or handle push notifications naturally means less work to do so less resources consumed). Furthermore, these tests do not yet test federation, so expensive remote joins are not measured (remote joins require the joining server to check signatures, hashes, etc of a lot of events which doesn't happen for local servers). That being said, I have hopefully illustrated how useful this tool can be for both server developers trying to improve their software and server admins who want to use the right server for their hardware. The graphs are still a work-in-progress and there's a lot more that can be done in this area beyond a few days work, but it's a start.</p>

<p>Today we've released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6.5">Dendrite 0.6.5</a> which contains early push notification support as well as a number of fixes and improvements. This release includes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early support for push notifications has been added, with support for push rules, pushers, HTTP push gateways and the <code>/notifications</code> endpoint (contributions by <a href="https://github.com/danpe">danpe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PiotrKozimor">PiotrKozimor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tommie">tommie</a>)</li>
<li>Spaces Summary (MSC2946) is now correctly supported (when <code>msc2946</code> is enabled in the config)</li>
<li>All media API endpoints are now available under the <code>/v3</code> namespace</li>
<li>Profile updates (display name and avatar) are now sent asynchronously so they shouldn't block the client for a very long time</li>
<li>State resolution v2 has been optimised further to considerably reduce the number of memory allocations</li>
<li>State resolution v2 will no longer duplicate events unnecessarily when calculating the auth difference</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool now has a <code>-reset-password</code> option for resetting the passwords of existing accounts</li>
<li>The <code>/sync</code> endpoint now calculates device list changes much more quickly with less RAM used</li>
<li>The <code>/messages</code> endpoint now lazy-loads members correctly</li>
<li>Read receipts now work correctly by correcting bugs in the stream positions and receipt coalescing</li>
<li>Topological sorting of state and join responses has been corrected, which should help to reduce the number of auth problems when joining new federated rooms</li>
<li>Media thumbnails should now work properly after having unnecessarily strict rate limiting removed</li>
<li>The roomserver no longer holds transactions for as long when processing input events</li>
<li>Uploading device keys and cross-signing keys will now correctly no-op if there were no changes</li>
<li>Parameters are now remembered correctly during registration</li>
<li>Devices can now only be deleted within the appropriate UIA flow</li>
<li>The <code>/context</code> endpoint now returns 404 instead of 500 if the event was not found</li>
<li>SQLite mode will no longer leak memory as a result of not closing prepared statements</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance, as measured by Sytest, currently sits at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 76%, up from 65% last time</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 95%, up from 94% last time</li>

<p>Hey folks, I'm back from holidays and I'm proud to say that hookshot is kicking out release after release. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.2.0">This release</a> is <strong>especially</strong> large and contains a bounty of new features and fixes. Of note are:</p>
<ul>
<li>JIRA Datacenter (On Premise) is now supported.</li>
<li>You can now configure fine grained permissions for users on the bridge by userId, homeserver domain or <em>room membership</em> (think spaces).</li>
<li>Generic webhooks has sprouted a <strong>versioned</strong> API, with v2 allowing for finer control over the output.</li>
<li>GitHub connections now include the closing comment when issues and PRs are closed.</li>
<li>GitHub connections will also notify a room when an existing issue has been relabled to one filtered by that room.</li>
<li>Figma now uses MSC3440 for comment threads.</li>
</ul>
<p>But seriously go check out the release, there is way more there than I can include in this TWIM post. Happy webhookin, matrix gang!</p>
<p>In case you did not know, Hookshot can be installed via spantaleev's <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">Ansible playbook</a>. In addition to updates for this new release, the role has recently gotten some improvements and fixes by the community, so in case you had issues before, now is the time to try again!</p>
<p>P.S oh and I almost forgot, we rehomed to https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot. This doesn't change much, other than some redirects in your browsers cache.</p>

<h3 id="matrix-appservice-irc-0-33-0">matrix-appservice-irc 0.33.0</h3>
<p>Two bridge updates from matrix.org in one week? You would be forgiven for thinking it was <del>FOSDEM</del> Christmas.</p>
<p>The highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support splitting users from different homeservers into different IPv6 blocks. We used this at FOSDEM to split attendeeds into a different ILINE.</li>
<li>Added a new metric <code>clientpool_by_homeserver</code> which lists the states of IRC clients, by the top 25 homeservers. Useful to know who is using your bridge.</li>
<li>Add support for subscribing to moderation policies. This allows a bridge admin to subscribe to Matrix &quot;ban lists&quot; and filter who can use their bridge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This release also now requires Node 14.x</strong> as Node 12.x will be out of support very soon.</p>

<p>This week, we've fixed a few annoying issues in NeoChat:</p>
<ul>
<li>On platforms with a system tray, NeoChat no quits correctly when the system tray integration is disabled</li>
<li>Similar state events are now aggregated into a single message (so no more scrolling through &quot;Moderation has changed the access control lists&quot; üôÇ)</li>
<li>Sending messages starting with a ':' works correctly again</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also improved NeoChat's startup time from cache by a factor of several hundred, depending on the situation</p>

<li>Offers high quality video calls with around 6 or 7 participants as a small &amp; simple, standalone app that allows anyone to drop into a video conference easily.</li>
<li>This is beta - please file bugs at https://github.com/vector-im/element-call/issues and be aware that currently all participants need good bandwidth</li>
<li>This is the first implementation of MSC3401: a spec for secure, federated voice and video conferences.</li>
<li>Integrations into other clients are coming soon, Hydrogen is working on it right now</li>
<li>We‚Äôll also be developing a server to mix media streams so calls can scale up to much larger number of participants. The server will only ever see your encrypted media, so calls will stay secure and confidential.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org">Jonas Platte</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're back (to TWIM)! Here's some highlights from the past few months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stronger types for some things:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/773"><code>Base64</code></a> which ensures you always decode / encode with the appropriate base64 dictionary [<a href="https://github.com/jplatte">@jplatte</a>]</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/809"><code>TransactionId</code></a> which is simply a little more explicit than <code>String</code> and easier to generate a random instance of [<a href="https://github.com/jplatte">@jplatte</a>]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stable support for lots of previously-unstable functionality that got stabilized upstream as part of the Matrix specification releases v1.1 and v1.2 [<a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a>]</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/issues/842">Support for versioned endpoints</a> in the client-server API [<a href="https://github.com/ShadowJonathan">@ShadowJonathan</a>]</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/906">Rehaul of our module structure</a> to match the client-server API's new versioned endpoints (before: <code>r0::foo::get_bar</code>, after: <code>foo::get_bar::v3</code>) [<a href="https://github.com/ShadowJonathan">@ShadowJonathan</a>]</li>
<li>More fine-grained feature flags for MSC implementations (before: everything behind <code>unstable-pre-spec</code>, after: most things behind dedicated <code>unstable-mscXXXX</code> features) [<a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a>]</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/916"><code>matrix.to</code> URI parsing</a> [<a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a>]</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/926"><code>MatrixUri</code> type</a> [<a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these changes are available in version 0.5.0 which was released about two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a> recently started implementing extensible events <em>and</em> doing some pretty heavy internal refactoring that will make our release process faster and hopefully make contributing to Ruma easier as well.</p>
<p>With all these changes we're very close to supporting all of Matrix v1.1 (and Matrix v1.2 too!), with the only major omission being Secure Secret Storage and Sharing (SSSS). Some work on that was done as far back as last year's GSoC but it was blocked on a medium-sized refactoring of how we handle account data. I'm planning to get that over the finish line over the next weeks.</p>

<p>I'm working on a little hobby project, The Matrix Scribe.</p>
<p><a href="https://lab.trax.im/julianfoad/matrix-scribe">The Matrix Scribe</a> helps us re-post or transcribe messages into <a href="https://matrix.org/">matrix</a> that we received from somewhere else, posing as different ghost users to represent the original authors.</p>
<p>Scribe will post this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Ann</code> I'm Ann.</p>
<p><code>Bob</code> Hello! I'm Bob.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when I write this to <code>@scribe-bot</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>@julian</code> /scribe as Ann</p>
<p><code>@julian</code> I'm Ann.</p>
<p><code>@julian</code> /scribe as Bob</p>
<p><code>@julian</code> Hello! I'm Bob.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is an illustration of the goal. The output part works already; the bot part isn't implemented yet.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to encourage people to experiment and play with extending Matrix in creative ways.</li>
<li>As a building block for myself towards building more usual matrix bridges. Scribe is the input half of the matrix half of a bridge, so literally one quarter of a typical matrix bridge.</li>
<li>I hope that I myself and maybe some other people will find Scribe fun or useful in itself.</li>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>

<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>

</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> continues to be the focus on much review as the proposal inches towards entering final comment period.</p>
<p>Otherwise both <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3589">MSC3589</a> (room version 9 as the default room version) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3582">MSC3582</a> (remove m.room.message.feedback) merged this week. The former brings with it updated versions for rooms as they continue to be created across the federation, whereas the latter is simply a nice clean up to the existing spec :)</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3593">MSC3593: Safety Controls through a generic Administration API</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC aims to introduce a set of generic administrative APIs for Matrix homeservers, starting with those that could potentially be useful for user moderation.</p>
<p>There has long been talk of adding administration APIs akin to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">Synapse's Admin API</a> to the spec, in part to reduce the number of tools that are specifically created for it, and thus can only be used with Synapse.</p>
<p>Feedback welcome!</p>

<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">neilalexander</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6.4">Dendrite v0.6.4</a> which contains a significant number of improvements and fixes. It includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Client-Server API endpoints are now available under the <code>/v3</code> namespace</li>
<li>The <code>/whoami</code> response format now matches the latest Matrix spec version</li>
<li>Support added for the <code>/context</code> endpoint, which should help clients to render quote-replies correctly</li>
<li>Accounts now have an optional account type field, allowing admin accounts to be created</li>
<li>Server notices are now supported</li>
<li>Refactored the user API storage to deduplicate a significant amount of code, as well as merging both user API databases into a single database</li>
<li>Guest registration can now be separately disabled with the new <code>client_api.guests_disabled</code> configuration option</li>
<li>Outbound connections now obey proxy settings from the environment, deprecating the <code>federation_api.proxy_outbound</code> configuration options</li>
<li>The roomserver input API will now strictly consume only one database transaction per room, which should prevent situations where the roomserver can deadlock waiting for database connections to become available</li>
<li>Room joins will now fall back to federation if the local room state is insufficient to create a membership event</li>
<li>Create events are now correctly filtered from federation <code>/send</code> transactions</li>
<li>Excessive logging when federation is disabled should now be fixed</li>
<li>Dendrite will no longer panic if trying to retire an invite event that has not been seen yet</li>
<li>The device list updater will now wait for longer after a connection issue, rather than flooding the logs with errors</li>
<li>The device list updater will no longer produce unnecessary output events for federated key updates with no changes, which should help to reduce CPU usage</li>
<li>Local device name changes will now generate key change events correctly</li>
<li>The sync API will now try to share device list update notifications even if all state key NIDs cannot be fetched</li>
<li>An off-by-one error in the sync stream token handling which could result in a crash has been fixed</li>
<li>State events will no longer be re-sent unnecessary by the roomserver to other components if they have already been sent, which should help to reduce the NATS message sizes on the roomserver output topic in some cases</li>
<li>The roomserver input API now uses the process context and should handle graceful shutdowns better</li>
<li>Guest registration is now correctly disabled when the <code>client_api.registration_disabled</code> configuration option is set</li>
<li>One-time encryption keys are now cleaned up correctly when a device is logged out or removed</li>
<li>Invalid state snapshots in the state storage refactoring migration are now reset rather than causing a panic at startup</li>
</ul>
<p>Sytest compliance is up slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 67%, up from 65%</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 95%, same as before</li>
</ul>

<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here are the first steps for a bridge to <a href="https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/service/service/KakaoTalk?lang=en">KakaoTalk</a>! The bridge is based on <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/python">mautrix-python</a> (having used <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> as a starting point--there's still plenty of Facebook-specific code in there), with the backend handled by <a href="https://github.com/storycraft/node-kakao">node-kakao</a> (connected via RPC, as there seems to be no Python API for KakaoTalk!).</p>
<p>The bridge doesn't do much yet; all it can do is log in &amp; sync your list of chats (if that). But it's under rapid development &amp; decent momentum, so hopefully it will be usable soon!</p>
<p>For anyone brave enough to try it out, its setup steps are very similar to that of any of the <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/setup/index.html">Python-based mautrix bridges</a> (though Docker is currently unsupported).</p>

<p>Apart from that Nheko now has support for hidden read receipts (thanks to symphorien, see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2285">MSC2285</a>). ZenWalker updated our usage of deprecated gstreamer APIs. Malte has been spending a lot of effort on improving the scrolling experience on the PinePhone as well as allowing to search on mobile. Forwarding should now work properly again as well as calling on mobile and we fixed a small memory leak when opening some dialogs.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTwosday‚Äù wasn‚Äôt the only exciting thing happening this week. Take a peek at everything else we had going on‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>Coming to a Poll near you‚Ä¶</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From next week‚Äôs releases, you‚Äôll discover two new updates on polls! First off, you‚Äôll be able to edit a poll as long as no one has yet voted on it - which is great if you create a poll and realise you‚Äôve made a small mistake. Even better, there‚Äôs now a new type of poll: ‚Äòclosed polls‚Äô don‚Äôt show any results until the poll has ended, to keep the surprise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Location Sharing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Location Sharing is now available by default for users on all platforms, except desktop (where you can receive but not send locations). Check it out!</li>
<li>The next stage is live location sharing and ‚Äòpin dropping‚Äô, expect more soon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threaded Messaging</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to make catching up on rooms easier, and to keep the main timeline as clutter free as possible, Threads are nearly here.</li>
<li>You can try Threads out on all platforms - you‚Äôll find them in Labs. This feature is experimental; let us know your feedback, and report any bugs as we continue to improve.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community testing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will be looking at search result ordering on Web as part of the new search experience at 17:30 UTC / 18:30 CET on Tuesday, 1st of March</li>
<li>We‚Äôre also hoping to test Threads on mobile devices towards the end of the week, join the testing room to get involved!</li>

<ol>

<li>Improved the generation of highlight rectangles.</li>
<li>Made sure that LaTeX and code listings are always displayed nicely</li>
<li>Made it possible to modify text selections within a PDF using the keyboard</li>
<li>Added &quot;one-click&quot; links for onboarding new users into a particular server, SSO flow and PDF collection.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>In the last 2 weeks, I increasingly had to learn how to moderate rooms properly, which brought up a lack of nice Mj√∂lnir gui for me.
Due to that, I just started to write one.
It is at the time of writing still fairly young.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-features-are">The current features are:</h2>
<ul>
<li>An overview of the ban list data the user is in (Not for the specific Mj√∂lnir currently. Also requires a user to have joined the list room)</li>
<li>A quick form to ban a person</li>
<li>A form to redact someone or a message</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="planned-features-are">Planned features are:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support for showing MSC1929 information if available</li>
<li>Writing a patch for Mj√∂lnir, so the widget can know which banlist the bot watches, so only relevant lists show up.</li>
<li>Editing the banlist (aka unbanning)</li>
<li>Adding support for more advanced features like deactivation of users and removal of media on the matrix-media-repo.</li>
<li>Covering most of Mj√∂lnir's commands</li>
<li>Redact on ban and similar utilities you might want while banning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="small-getting-started-it-is-simple-d">Small getting started (it is simple :D)</h2>
<p>To use it, you simply can add it to your Mj√∂lnir Admin room by putting <code>/addwidget https://moderation_widget.nordgedanken.dev?room_id=$matrix_room_id</code> (the variable will get replaced automatically) in the message bar and pressing enter. The widget runs entirely client side, so this is not sending any events to my server. If you still are concerned due to the big amount of permissions asked, you can just build it yourself and host it.</p>

<h2 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h2>
<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we've been looking at unblocking <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440: Threads</a> so it can make a smooth journey into acceptance. This involves quite a lot of work to ensure that the features we're concerned about are addressed, but so far the FCP progress on it is looking good.</p>
<p>We're also spending a bunch of time working out what room version 10 looks like to try and fix some usability issues with join rules and general maintenance of things like power levels. The hope is that in time for Matrix 1.3 we'll have v10 out (but not made default) for folks to experiment with.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>Your random MSC is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2974">MSC2974: Widgets: Capabilities re-exchange</a>. I swear it was actually random and only after running the script exactly once. The MSC is interesting because it allows widgets (a feature working its way into the general spec, slowly) to ask for more permissions when they need them. This ensures the widget doesn't need to ask for everything at startup (which is more likely to mean that it gets rejected), and that it can maintain a clean security state during normal operation.</p>
<p>One day it'll probably make it into the spec as part of the larger widget movement, but first we need to get widgets into the spec properly.</p>
<h2 id="the-graph">The Graph</h2>
<p>Numbers only mean so much, and graphs show progress. Here's the breakdown of MSCs over time:</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is using Nheko a bit of a pain on your PinePhone? Do you just want bubbles in your chat app, not raw lines of text? Does Nheko waste too much space on timestamps and other metadata for messages?</p>
<p>Well, I am assuming Malte was annoyed by that or similar reasons. But in the end, they did spend a lot of effort reorganizing the way Nheko layouts messages so that people can have bubbles. This should make Nheko feel much more at home on the PinePhone and it seems like they are doing even more to make Nheko a great experience on mobile devices! But just look at it yourself:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/clBmUlpDyQUmvIfIKSRCJsIb.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you are scared now and you think: &quot;This is not the Nheko I came to love!&quot;, don't worry, all of this is optional. You can play around with the different avatar sizes as well as the bubbles themselves. You can even make Nheko look like it always looked!</p>
<p>There will be some regressions though. If you want to contribute, it would help a lot if you test those changes and report issues that you find! &lt;3</p>
<p>Apart from that, there were also a lot of other bugfixes and cleanups by various contributors. You can also hide events by type now. If you don't want to see stickers or when someone joins a room, just disable that in the room settings! Tastytea implemented that. Long usernames should now also no longer overflow the profile pages and you can reset the state for a single room using the /reset-state /command. This is helpful when updating Nheko to use widgets, but Nheko just threw those events away (or pinned messages or other state events).</p>
<p>That's all, have a wonderful bubbly day!</p>

<p>I wrote a small web app thing that can download, decrypt and display Matrix media in a browser. The goal is to use it in the Android SMS bridge for sending attachments that are too big for MMS, but it might be useful for other things too.</p>
<p>Currently it consists of the web frontend, a maubot plugin to generate links, and a small server that stores file metadata (so the URLs just contain the decryption key and a short ID to find the metadata on the server). I'll probably continue working on the exact URL format to make it shorter and to encrypt the metadata, and maybe also add an alternative mode where all info is included in the URL to make the server component optional.</p>
<p>You can try it out by sending files in an encrypted room with @media:maunium.net. It'll reply with a link like <a href="https://media.mau.chat/AGIPyjtJQAU#KHBwuZFrv1ffCd4ZUylo8MV03P9N4sz2T75zLi1Urcw">https://media.mau.chat/AGIPyjtJQAU#KHBwuZFrv1ffCd4ZUylo8MV03P9N4sz2T75zLi1Urcw</a></p>

<li>Require user id (e.g. <code>@alice:example.com</code>) instead of username. Only show homeserver url field if .well-known lookup fails.</li>
<li>Add top-right &quot;X&quot; button to close login modal.</li>
<li>Login modal now closes when you press outside it.</li>
<li>Fix some CSS bugs related to positioning the login form in viewport center.</li>
<li>Make <code>LoginForm</code> a stateful component.</li>

<p>During that year, we did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pushed 234 updates and enhancements to the automation framework used as the service core</li>
<li>Integrated 17 additional components to the matrix stack</li>
<li>Developed 5 bots and tools to extend matrix capabilities</li>
<li>Installed 92 new matrix servers</li>
<li>Helped 172 people and organizations to achieve their goals in the matrix</li>
<li>Posted 74 updates in the announcements room</li>
</ul>
<p>Some history:</p>
<ul>
<li>the project (not service yet) started on February 12, 2021</li>
<li>the first installed server was etke.cc itself (yes, etke.cc homeserver is a customer of etke.cc service from the day 1)</li>
<li>the second installed server was a chatbot, that uses matrix as a platform to interact with users across different chat networks (Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, etc.) - one API to rule them all.</li>

<p>After a few years, <a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-room-directory-server">matrix-room-directory-server</a> has finally gotten an upgrade to modern times. Intended to eventually be a standalone directory server (making vanity aliases possible, but otherwise not functional as a homeserver), it currently only supports overriding the federation <code>/publicRooms</code> endpoint. </p>
<p>The changes made today are to replace the old, broken, appservice-backed approach with a space-backed approach. You can see this in action on t2bot.io: querying the room directory over federation will hit the room directory server, which is watching <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#directory:t2bot.io">#directory:t2bot.io</a> in the background to determine which rooms to serve.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> (threading) continues to move forward with a proposed final comment period this week. As a really useful feature in Matrix, it's great to see it getting closer to landing in the spec.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3613">MSC3613</a> (combinatorial join rules) had a proposed final comment period. The intention of this is to be a simple mechanism for resolving the &quot;it's not possible to have both a restricted and knock room&quot; situation - as both introduced mutually exclusive join rules. This MSC will likely serve as the basis of a new room version whenever it lands.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3144">MSC3144: Allow Widgets By Default in Private Rooms</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC makes the case for allowing widgets to be created in private rooms by default. The actual spec for it is blocked behind having widgets in the spec (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2764">this tracking PR</a> if you're interested).</p>
<p>As noted in the PR though, this MSC could build on the existing <code>im.vector.modular.widgets</code> unstable prefix for widgets in order to create an implementation for this feature. It does not appear to have happened yet though.</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial support for <code>m.login.token</code></li>
<li>A number of regressions from earlier v0.6.x versions should now be corrected</li>
<li>Missing state is now correctly retrieved in cases where a gap in the timeline was closed but some of those events were missing state snapshots, which should help to unstick slow or broken rooms</li>
<li>Fixed a transaction issue where inserting events into the database could deadlock, which should stop rooms from getting stuck</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where rejected events could result in rolled back database transactions</li>
<li>Avoided a potential race condition on fetching latest events by using the room updater instead</li>
<li>Processing events from <code>/get_missing_events</code> will no longer result in potential recursion</li>
<li>Federation events are now correctly generated for updated self-signing keys and signed devices</li>
<li>Rejected events can now be un-rejected if they are reprocessed and all of the correct conditions are met</li>
<li>Fetching missing auth events will no longer error as long as all needed events for auth were satisfied</li>
<li>Users can now correctly forget rooms if they were not a member of the room</li>

<p>Thanks to everyone who tested the maximised widgets feature which was recently added to Element Web. It received a sudden burst of attention as part of the FOSDEM conference. üòÑ This week we've been fine tuning the feature to ensure it works for more workflows, and we've also cleaned up various associated widget bugs. In particular, in the develop version of Element Web, the pin and maximise actions are more consistent accessible, so you can toggle between pinned and maximised if e.g. you're in a conference room and temporarily want the stream widget to be larger while still having access to the chat timeline.</p>
<p>Next week we'll be focusing more on our Matrix-native collaborative document plans.</p>

<p>Matrix Wrench is a web client to tweak Matrix rooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@christianp:vector.modular.im">ChristianP</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new version contains two new features around the Synapse Admin API, making someone a room admin and listing all unencrypted media URLs.</p>
<p>I've had some good ideas on how to make Matrix Wrench cover more use cases while staying simple for both users and me as a developer. New components allow me to add new API endpoints in as little as 7 lines. So far this only applies to simple endpoints without parameters, like joining and leaving a room, but it can be expanded to more endpoints because of how similar all Matrix endpoints are. Props to the Spec! üôå</p>

<p>We have been using Matrix as a chat solution for the attendees of our biannual conference (<a href="https://kif.rocks">KIF</a>) and for new students during the introduction week, as well as Pretix to register attendants. Up until now the process to invite attendees to the corresponding Matrix Rooms and Spaces involved some <code>curl</code> and <code>jq</code> magic as well as manual intervention to connect both.</p>
<p>We have now replaced said manual process with a Pretix plugin that invites registered attendees to a configurable Matrix Room or Space. This plugin is now available on the <a href="https://marketplace.pretix.eu/products/pretix-matrix-inviter/">Pretix marketplace</a> or directly from its <a href="https://gitlab.fachschaften.org/kif/pretix-matrix-inviter">repository</a>.</p>

<p>Gatho includes a Matrix bot which, when added to a room, can synchronise RSVP emoji reactions to a linked Gatho event! See <a href="https://gatho.party/getting-started">gatho.party/getting-started</a> to hear how the Matrix synchronization works.</p>
<p>You can also create one-click RSVP links to send to your friends - no matter which chat/social app they use!</p>
<p>It's fully GDPR compliant and multi-region with an EU server and database, and uses NextAuth.js for passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>The Gatho website and bot is open source (AGPL-3.0) on <a href="https://github.com/gatho-party/gatho-website">Github</a>, PRs and Github issues are very welcome! It's built using Next.js in Typescript.</p>

                <p>Last year was the first time FOSDEM was hosted on Matrix, and it was generally a huge success - and so the FOSDEM team trusted us again this year and we‚Äôre happy to say that it seems to have gone really well! This year‚Äôs FOSDEM was massive once again, featuring 654 speakers, 731 events, and 103 tracks.</p>
<p>This year hosting the event went smoother than last year, the only significant issue was some of the Q&amp;A Jitsis not being broadcast to the devrooms on Saturday before 10:15 UTC, for which we offer our apologies to the speakers impacted. This turned out to be a problem with the Matrix&lt;-&gt;Jitsi access control sync system which hadn‚Äôt showed up during earlier testing, but we patched around it rapidly on the day.</p>
<p>The most notable difference between this year and the previous year has been the usage of a ‚Äúattendees.fosdem.org‚Äù instance in addition to the original ‚Äúfosdem.org‚Äù one, specifically for attendees. The graphs speak for themselves: Synapse could handle the load of the 23K users (13K joined users and 10K lurkers) spread across a total number of 941 rooms. The real eye-opener however is that of the 13K joined users, only 4K came came from the FOSDEM attendee server, and 1K from Libera Chat, meaning that ~70% of the Matrix participants were already on Matrix and came in from existing servers! ü§Ø That means the vast majority of people attended over federation. Decentralisation at work, people! It works! We didn‚Äôt host the conference‚Ä¶ you did!!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-07-02-fosdem_attendees_heatmap.png" alt="FOSDEM attendees heatmap" /></p>
<p>But not only did the backend handle the load smoothly: the general user experience felt tightly integrated. People were welcomed by a tailor-made home page in Element to help them navigate through all the tracks and stands:.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-07-02-fosdem_homescreen.png" alt="Homescreen of chat.fosdem.org" /></p>
<p>One of the great things is it doesn‚Äôt require heavy modifications to Element: anyone who installs their own instance of Element can use a simple html file to display relevant information to their audience.</p>
<p>New this year, we also generated a space hierarchy for the whole conference at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fosdem2022:fosdem.org">#fosdem2022:fosdem.org</a> to help navigate the maze of rooms, making it even easier for users on their own servers to jump in:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-07-02-fosdem_space.png" alt="FOSDEM Space listing all the FOSDEM rooms" /></p>
<p>Another greatly appreciated feature was the famous ‚Äúmaximised widgets‚Äù I (Thib) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Matrixdotorg">keep telling you about in Matrix Live episodes</a>. Attendees and speakers could give the conference the central attention it deserved while simultaneously keeping an eye on what was happening in the chat. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-07-02-fosdem_stand.png" alt="FOSDEM stand with maximised widget view" /></p>
<p>From the speaker's perspective, we tried to streamline the user journey as much as possible: a bot invited them to a backstage room, in which they joined a Jitsi widget while their talk was being played in the track or devroom. They could see the most upvoted questions by the audience in a dedicated widget. A few minutes before their pre-recorded talk was over, a countdown (new this year!) could be displayed to tell them and the host they were about to go live. At the end of the countdown, the backstage Jitsi was broadcasted to the track so the speaker could answer the questions.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-07-02-fosdem_backstage.png" alt="Backstage room where the speaker and host could talk and see the questions" /></p>
<p>If you want to have an in-depth look at the backend‚Äôs architecture, it didn‚Äôt change much from last year. You can have a look at <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/15/how-we-hosted-fosdem-2021-on-matrix#how-was-it-built">last year‚Äôs blog post for the details on the setup</a>. Most of the heavy lifting was around <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/conference-bot">the conference bot</a> used to set rooms up, create the spaces, populate them with widgets, arrange layouts and trigger countdowns before going live‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Finally we are immensely proud that we had our first ever Matrix Devroom! Not only does it mean the staff of a large international open source conference thinks it‚Äôs worth having a track of our own, it also means our community has grown to the point where we could have <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/matrixorg_foundation_and_community/">8 hours of back to back Matrix content</a>! Here‚Äôs a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl5dnxRMP1hW7HxlJiHSox02MK9_KluLH">the YouTube playlists to which we are going to add the videos of FOSDEM</a> as they‚Äôre being published.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to the FOSDEM team for trusting us, massive shout-out to <a href="https://ems.element.io/">Element Matrix Services</a> and Element‚Äôs Ops and infrastructure team for their fantastic job in setting everything up and making sure everything was ready in time, a sincere thank you to all the fantastic speakers who shared awesome content, and finally to all the attendees. What a weekend!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today we've released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6.1">Dendrite 0.6.1</a> which contains a number of fixes and improvements. This release includes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roomserver inputs now take place with full transactional isolation in PostgreSQL deployments</li>
<li>Pull consumers are now used instead of push consumers when retrieving messages from NATS to better guarantee ordering and to reduce redelivery of duplicate messages</li>
<li>Further logging tweaks, particularly when joining rooms</li>
<li>Improved calculation of servers in the room, when checking for missing auth/prev events or state</li>
<li>Dendrite will now skip dead servers more quickly when federating by reducing the TCP dial timeout</li>
<li>The key change consumers have now been converted to use native NATS code rather than a wrapper</li>
<li>Go 1.16 is now the minimum supported version for Dendrite</li>
<li>Local clients should now be notified correctly of invites</li>
<li>The roomserver input API now has more time to process events, particularly when fetching missing events or state, which should fix a number of errors from expired contexts</li>
<li>Fixed a panic that could happen due to a closed channel in the roomserver input API</li>
<li>Logging in with uppercase usernames from old installations is now supported again (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/hoernschen">hoernschen</a>)</li>
<li>Federated room joins now have more time to complete and should not fail due to expired contexts</li>
<li>Events that were sent to the roomserver along with a complete state snapshot are now persisted with the correct state, even if they were rejected or soft-failed</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance, as measured by Sytest, currently sits at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 65%</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 94%</li>

<p>It's FOSDEM! Don't forget to checkout my 5 min ramble about custom stickers and emotes in Matrx: https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/matrix_custom_stickers/</p>
<p>In preparation for FOSDEM, I've also been working on some goodies so that you can participate using Nheko in a limited manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previews for rooms are now fetched for spaces using the hierarchy API</li>
<li>Widgets for the talks should be shown below the topic as links</li>
</ul>
<p>While this isn't grand, it should be good enough for some to participate using Nheko. You will need the latest master (some commits aren't even pushed at the time of writing!), but if you are just watching, this should give you an easy way to fetch the talk link for each room. You will still have to watch the actual talk in your browser though.</p>
<p>LorenDB also added a big, fat, red offline indicator. If your server dies because of FOSDEM, now Nheko will tell you.</p>
<p>I hope you all will have a great time and I hope I see you around!</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="viewer-updates">Viewer Updates</h3>
<p>Here's a big populus viewer update! Since last time, I've been mostly working on improving the user experience and onboarding for non-experts, as well as making my teaching-assistant bot a little smarter - this work is ongoing. But I have had time for a few new features üòÅ</p>
<ul>
<li>Populus now implements <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3592">MSC3592 - Markup locations for PDF documents</a>, a proposal building on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3574">MSC3574 - Marking up resources</a>, so there's a documented format for interoperable PDF annotations (though this is not the final draft, see below!)</li>
<li>I've reworked the sidebar for the PDF view, improving the aesthetics and allowing for a &quot;fullscreen&quot; view of PDF content.</li>
<li>I've added user-directory search and improved the usability of the invite modal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason that MSC3574 is not a final draft is that I'm increasingly looking at the w3c's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">web annotation data model</a> as a compelling foundation for annotations on Matrix. Stay tuned for a upcoming MSC, or come over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opentower:matrix.org">#opentower:matrix.org</a> to talk about the future of annotation on Matrix!</p>
<h3 id="populus-philarchive">Populus-Philarchive</h3>
<p>I've also been working on a proof-of-concept for one Matrix use-case that I'm hoping Populus can help fill. Social annotation can be a good tool for getting feedback on works in progress, or for discussing new research with your team or lab. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just pop open a paper on a preprint archive and start commenting, or say &quot;hey friends, I'm reading this paper, what do you think?&quot; And wouldn't it be nicer if you could do that and host the discussion on your university or team's Matrix server?</p>
<p>Here's a first pass at that idea: https://opentower.github.io/populus-philarchive/</p>
<p>At the moment works by just pasting in paper codes from <a href="https://philarchive.org/">philarchive.org</a> - it'll preview bibliographic information and give you a list of discussions taking place around a given paper, with the option to create a  new one. Sessions are shared with populus-viewer, and pdfs continue to be hosted by the original archive. There are a number of clear upgrade paths, by integrating with a preprint archive that has an open search API, or even by adding an OAI-PMH metadata harvester to the backend, to combine the metadata from a bunch of open paper archives. I'm really excited to see where this work goes.</p>

<p>A KRunner plugin to list joined rooms and possibly other things from nheko.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lorendb:matrix.org">LorenDB</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been working on a little project over the last week: <a href="https://github.com/LorenDB/nheko-krunner">nheko-krunner</a>. nheko-krunner is a <a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner">KRunner</a> plugin that loads rooms from nheko, displays them to the user, and allows the user to activate said rooms. How does it do this? Well, I've also been creating a D-Bus API for nheko! This code has not been merged yet, but once it is, you will be able to create your own plugins that access nheko via D-Bus!</p>
<p>The current functionality of nheko-krunner is simply (1) search and switch to rooms that you are in (not unlike the Ctrl-K switcher), and (2) join rooms from their aliases.</p>
<p>If you want to try out nheko-krunner, you will need to build from the <code>dbus</code> branch in my personal fork of nheko and then install nheko-krunner from the above repo.</p>
<p>I hope that somebody finds this useful and I am excited to see what other D-Bus plugins may show up in the future!</p>

<p>The Polyjuice Project has a new component: <a href="https://gitlab.com/polyjuice/polyjuice_client_test">Polyjuice Client Test</a>, a tool for testing Matrix clients.  Each test has its own preconfigured homeserver environment, implemented using the <a href="https://gitlab.com/polyjuice/polyjuice_server">Polyjuice Server</a> library, and can be customized according to the needs of the test.  Only a few tests are implemented so far, but many more are planned, initially focusing on testing functionality related to end-to-end encryption.  You can see a demo of it in the Matrix Live video.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/GregSutcliffe/ChatStat">ChatStat</a> is an R package for making reports on Matrix rooms.</p>
<p>Ahead of my <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/matrix_chat_stat/">lightning talk</a> on Sunday, ChatStat has been polished up and given it's first release. You can get it <a href="https://github.com/GregSutcliffe/ChatStat/releases/tag/0.1.0">here</a>. Huge thanks to @johrpan:johrpan.de for their contributions too.</p>
<p>The main highlight since my last TWIM is that we actually have report generation now! You can see an example <a href="https://emeraldreverie.org/example_chatstat_report.html">here</a>, or check the project <a href="https://github.com/GregSutcliffe/ChatStat/wiki/A-non-R-user&#x27;s-guide-to-ChatStat">wiki</a> for an example of using the raw data with <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> to make custom plots of your own.</p>
<p>If you do give it a try, please stop by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-matrix_chat_stat:fosdem.org">#matrix-matrix_chat_stat:fosdem.org</a> to let us know how you got on!</p>
