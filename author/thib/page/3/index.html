<p>Can moderation be automated? Can it be apolitical? How does it scale? Are decentralised systems inherently more insecure than centrlised ones? Let's find out!</p>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3890">MSC3890: Remotely silence local notifications</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC aims to provide a solution to remotely toggling do-not-disturb across your various Matrix clients without needing to set it on each device manually. It does so by using account data which is synced to each client. Upon a client seeing data intended for them, they will silence notifications locally until told to do so otherwise (either remotely or by the user interacting with the client directly).</p>
<p>Quite a neat idea, and adds more powerful functionality to the &quot;device manager&quot; of a client. Also handy if your other clients are things like embedded systems!

includes a significant speed-up to the <code>/messages</code> path. In addition you can find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved DB performance by reducing amount of data that gets read in device_lists_changes_in_room.</li>
<li>Support for handling avatar in SSO login. Contributed by @ashfame</li>
<li>Unstable support for an Extensible Events room version (org.matrix.msc1767.10) via MSC1767, MSC3931, MSC3932,
and MSC3933.</li>
<li>A bugfix for a long-standing bug where the List media admin API would fail when processing an image with broken 
thumbnail information</li>

<p>This week we bring you the very last (all fingers being crossed) hookshot release not to support e2ee encryption. Our resident expert is busy working away on supporting it and is a couple of bugfixes away from providing it to you all (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/pull/299#issuecomment-1327124799).</p>
<p>In the meantime, this release was so good we couldn't keep it from you any longer. This release is packed with quality of life improvements, and general bugfixes / stability. Deploy away!</p>
<p>The highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub <code>assign</code> command now automatically chooses the top issue and/or authenticated user if not provided.</li>
<li>The RSS feed connection no longer feels the need to spam you when GitHub fails to respond within 10s. It now waits for 30s.</li>
<li>Hookshot now supports creating GitLab connections without automatically provisioning a webhook. When this happens, the bot will tell you to talk to your admin to setup the webhook manually.</li>

<p>SchildiChat is a fork of Element that focuses on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list for both direct messages and groups, which is a more familiar approach to users of other popular instant messengers.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@spiritcroc:spiritcroc.de">SpiritCroc</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Version 1.5.8.sc62 of SchildiChat-Android got released this week, which adds a few new interesting features on top of Element:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reworked reply rendering, to follow the rich replies specification. This improves the following:
<ul>
<li>Update the replied-to message in case the original message gets edited or deleted</li>
<li>Fix replies edited on desktop not being shown as replies on Android</li>
<li>Fix replies edited on Android being shown on Desktop with the replied-to event twice</li>
<li>Fix some weird rendering issues, like lists in a reply being completely broken</li>
<li>Nicer design, using the original sender's color, and a maximum height for the replied-to event</li>
<li>Render the replied-to event also for media replies, for example when the mautrix-telegram bridge sends an image reply</li>
<li>In the future, this will also allow us to render replied-to images instead of just writing &quot;Image&quot; in there, but this one is still on the TODO-list since I didn't want to delay a release further.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Render captions as per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2530">MSC2530</a>.</li>
<li>We now allow sending all kinds of room-specific or account-specific global custom emotes as per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2545">MSC2545</a> (but you still need to configure them with a different client before sending).</li>
</ul>
<p>For those about to ask if I'll upstream these changes to Element: I'm currently not planning to do so, but you are free to pick my changes yourself and create a PR. For rich replies, see also <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/issues/3731#issuecomment-1330363453">here</a>.</p>

<p>The last few weeks of Sliding Sync in the various mobile clients is showing its fruits: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1193">Sliding Sync offline caching and session recovery</a> was merged this week, giving you the latest state of your sliding sync in milliseconds without ever having touched the network now. You need to activate it via a setting on the SlidingSyncBuilder - FFI is exposed as well. This PR also adds recovery when the server rejected our request upon a failing position, indicating our session was reset. Previously, you needed to reconstruct the entire sliding-sync with all its state yourself, now this does it internally and transparently for the API user. Additionally, we merged <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1249">a fix for invited rooms</a>, which caused a panic on FFI usage, and have one other <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1248">fix to the sliding-sync state post cache coming up</a>.</p>
<p>Talking about fixes, the retry code path had a bug, which caused retries even when the API clearly stated we needed to change request, which <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1237">is fixed now</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1247">memory store won't continue to keep all media cached anymore</a>.

<h3 id="synapse-operator-for-kubernetes-website">Synapse Operator for Kubernetes (<a href="https://github.com/opdev/synapse-operator">website</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mgoerens:matrix.org">mgoerens</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introducing a new way to run Synapse on top of Kubernetes ! </p>
<p>The current capabilities of the Synapse Operator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy Synapse: the operator can generate a default homeserver.yaml, or it can work with a custom homeserver.yaml, provided by the user.</li>
<li>Deploy the Heisenbridge and the mautrix-signal bridge: the operator automatically (re)configures Synapse to add the corresponding app_services.</li>
<li>Deploy a PostgreSQL database for Synapse (depends on the postgres-operator).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the operator is deployed, the <code>Synapse</code> resource becomes available. Deploying a basic instance goes as simple as:</p>
<pre data-lang="shell" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-shell "><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span>$ cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; synapse.yaml
</span><span>apiVersion: synapse.opdev.io/v1alpha1
</span><span>kind: Synapse
</span><span>metadata:
</span><span>  name: my-synapse
</span><span>spec:
</span><span>  homeserver:
</span><span>    values:
</span><span>      serverName: example.com
</span><span>      reportStats: true
</span><span>EOF
</span><span>$ kubectl apply -f synapse.yaml 
</span><span>synapse.synapse.opdev.io/my-synapse created
</span><span>$ kubectl get pods
</span><span>NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
</span><span>my-synapse-84d56d54df-c699k   1/1     Running   0          63s
</span></code></pre>
<p>The operator takes care of the deployment and lifecycle management of the Synapse instance. Similarly, the <code>Heisenbridge</code> and <code>MautrixSignal</code> resources can also be deployed alongside Synapse and are managed by the operator.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">operator</a> is written in Go. To know more about the project, please visit https://github.com/opdev/synapse-operator, there are explanations on how to deploy the operator, and examples demonstrating the main features. Or ping me on Matrix if you want to have a chat about it ! I'd love to collect some feedbacks !</p>

<p>Continued review on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706">MSC3706</a> (extensions to <code>/send_join</code> for partial state) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3852">MSC3852</a> (user agent information on /devices) by the SCT was seen. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3743">MSC3743</a> (standard error responses for unknown endpoints) was also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1347">merged</a> to the unstable spec!</p>

<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3896">MSC3896: Appservice media</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC calls out the issue that today application services, especially those that bridge third-party networks, need to re-upload all bridged media to the homeserver in order for users to view it. This can create a large strain on disk resources for homeservers that bridge third-party networks and is a problem that is worth considering.</p>
<p>The approach the MSC takes to solving this is to allow application services to reserve an exclusive namespace for MXC URL's, such as <code>mxc://example.com/_discord_.*</code>. When a user's client attempted to request a media item that falls within the exclusive namespace, the homeserver would request the media from the application service (which in turn could pull it from the third-party network's CDN) rather than the homeserver's local media repo.</p>
<p>Seems like a cool idea! Check out the MSC and leave your thoughts if you're interested or have suggestions.</p>

<p>Postmoogle v0.9.9 is here!</p>
<p>The biggest release so far. Hmm... let me try again</p>
<p><strong>THE</strong> Biggest Release (so far)!</p>
<p>The last few weeks we at <a href="https://etke.cc">etke.cc</a> enhanced and optimized Postmoogle to make it as close to common email services as possible (it's not a full Gmail/Outlook/%You-name-it% replacement for a regular user yet, some features are missing, but we're pushing it towards that goal!)</p>
<p>The most notable changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>automatic ban list (can be enabled by postmoogle admin) - no more nasty spammers will ever bother your host and if they will - Postmoogle will <del>cut the wires</del> drop TCP connections before even talking with them</li>
<li>automatic greylisting (can be configured by postmoogle admin) - good SMTP software must resend emails (and 99.99% of them do), RFC said.</li>
<li>internal email queue to re-send failed emails (with 45x errors) automatically - because Postmoogle is good SMTP software and it follows RFC</li>
<li>bridging email threads ‚áø matrix threads/reply-tos (for new emails) - that's a hard one. TL;DR: reply to email in matrix room (either by matrix thread or matrix reply-to) = email reply on email side, works both ways</li>
<li>multi-domain mode with the ability to select a domain for sending emails per room/per mailbox (all other domains will act as aliases)</li>
<li><code>!pm send</code> and thread replies send multipart emails by default (both HTML from formatted markdown and plaintext in the same email)</li>
<li>lots of other enhancements and fixes under the moogle</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You may have noticed it has been a bit quiet from our side lately. Partially that is because I was just busy fixing issues in our new features on the Synapse side (or implementing MSCs in Synapse). But we also just have been fixing boring old issues in our project, that have been not annoying enough to get attention. For example there was a warning when configuring the project with CMake, which now shouldn't happen anymore, but also is just really boring to talk about.</p>
<p>So maybe some more exciting stuff, in theory, if your distribution builds curl with the correct flags, Nheko now supports connecting to servers over HTTP/3. This in itself is not that useful, but it might improve how Nheko behaves when switching connections or when using mobile data.</p>
<p>Nheko now also shows a completer for /commands (stuff like /me, /react or /sovietflip).</p>
<p>You can also now invert the Enter setting, so that you can send using Shift+Enter (thanks to LordMZTE) and you can update your status message over D-Bus (thanks LorenDB), which allows you to show what song you are listening to or what project you are working on, if you enable the D-Bus API and implement that as an addon in your music player or IDE.</p>
<p>Also lots of boring cleanups going on behind the scenes still, so expect cool stuff to be slower for the next few weeks.</p>

While this is ongoing, some of them already found their way back into mainline or at least have PRs pending for it: Like the bug in the read marker tracking which sometimes caused a crash <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1231">1</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1233">2</a>, a problem with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1235">timeline construction being async</a> or some minor fixes on the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1225">xtask for swift</a>. We've also noticed a significant regression in the automatic retry mechanism, which would just continue to spin for ever if the server gave a fully warranted error code back - if you experienced this, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1237">this PR should be solving it for you</a>.</p>
<p>A significant milestone was achieved this week on Async UniFFI. After getting a first PoC ready the week before, Ivan packaged it all up and sent <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">a draft PR upstream</a> with async python code calling an async rust code over FFI and interpreting the rusty result. So cool! Swift and kotlin targets are next.</p>

<p>A Qt5 library to write cross-platform clients for Matrix</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As that <a href="https://tobiasfella.de/posts/neochat-e2ee/">blog post</a> by Tobias mentions, releasing libQuotient 0.7 is the immediate next step - and in line with that, 0.7 RC has been published! Not much has changed since two betas; despite a very big piece of E2EE introduced in 0.7 release cycle, things have been mostly ironed out earlier in the year. Packagers are welcome to try their tools on the new release. Be mindful though that E2EE has just been introduced and wasn't widely tested; besides, a few pieces are still missing (read the blog post!); so while it's probably reasonable to switch E2EE on for packaging libQuotient, it's NOT recommended to do the same in client applications, unless accompanied by warnings and disclaimers all over the place. The <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.7-rc">release notes</a> are still shallow and boring - the longer text will come with the final release.</p>

<p>Matrix server setup using Ansible and Docker</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> has received lots of optimizations to cut down playbook runtime, sponsored by the <a href="https://etke.cc">etke.cc managed Matrix hosting service</a>. The <a href="https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/ansible">etke.cc Ansible playbook</a> (which is an extension of <code>matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</code>) is growing to support more and more services (besides just Matrix), so the Matrix playbook being leaner prevents runtimes from becoming too slow and improves the customer experience.</p>
<p>The playbook now runs about 2x-5x faster, thanks to:</p>
<ul>
<li>various optimizations (using <code>include_tasks</code> instead of <code>import_tasks</code> in all Ansible roles)</li>
<li>the introduction of additional install-only tags (<code>--tags=install-all</code> or <code>--tags=install-COMPONENT</code>) which skip slow and often unnecessary to run uninstall tasks</li>

<p>Hi everyone, we have released Mjolnir <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/releases/tag/v1.6.1">v1.6.1</a> (via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/releases/tag/v1.6.0">v1.6.0</a>)</p>
<p>Which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Always echo policy list changes. List changes are now always enabled, whereas before they where only shown with <code>config.verboseLogging</code>. Mjolnir now no longer hides changes made by the same mjolnir account, providing the user with feedback for changes they have made to policy lists after using the ban/unban commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy lists created by mjolnir will now be done so with support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3784">MSC3784</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mjolnir now supports specifying the config file with the argument <code>--mjolnir-config</code>. It is highly recommended that you do this as opposed to relying on the environment variable <code>NODE_ENV</code>. The documentation for running with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/blob/v1.6.1/docs/setup_docker.md">docker</a> and from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/blob/v1.6.1/docs/setup_selfbuild.md">source</a> have been updated accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix the WordList protection which was matching every message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rework the banning and unbanning of entities in PolicyLists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unbanning no longer searches for rules by <code>state_key</code> but by entity.</li>
<li>Users with longer mxids can now be banned.</li>
<li>Mjolnir no longer waits for the next client sync before applying server ACL and member bans after using the ban command</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve the clarity of the unban command. Users marked as banned by the <code>Flooding</code> and <code>FirstMessageIsMedia</code> protections can now be unbanned with the ban command. Using the unban command without <code>true</code> will now warn the user that room level bans will not be overridden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replaced <code>acceptInvitesFromGroup</code> with <code>acceptInvitesFromSpace</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <code>config.protectAllJoinedRooms</code> leaking into explicitly protected rooms and mjolnir trying to protect watched lists in some circumstances. You would only have been impacted by this if you ran <code>latest</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Matrix v1.5 was released on November 17th, 2022! üéâ</p>
<p>While not as feature-packed as previous releases (v1.5 was intended as a maintenance release), it's still worth checking out! Included are two new MSCs that have landed, as well as loads of little bugfixes and clarifications to the spec text itself. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aclarification+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A%3E2022-10-01">all who helped fix issues</a> since v1.4!</p>

<h3 id="extensible-events-are-shaping-up">Extensible Events are Shaping Up!</h3>
<p>As may be apparent from the new MSCs this week, the SCT has been looking at extensible events to iron out some of the finer details of the system. They're not necessarily in the best position to review at the moment, but keep an eye on this space for when review would be most welcome üôÇ</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2705">MSC2705: Animated thumbnails for media (and thumbnail content-type requirements)</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to define a method for clients to indicate to their homeserver that they would like to have animated version if possible when requesting a thumbnail of some media. This would allow clients to provide a toggle to the user for whether media in the timeline should be animated, or whether room and user avatars should be animated, etc. Potentially separate options for each!</p>
<p>Today, there is no way for the client to indicate per-request whether they would like to receive an animated version of a thumbnail. This leaves the choice up to the homeserver, which gives individual users much less control.</p>
<p>The MSC also defines mimetypes that animated thumbnails should return. And it has an implementation in <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a>!</p>
<p>Check it out if animated avatars/thumbnails peaks your interest.

<p>Adding experimental support for MSC3912: Relation-based redactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding an Admin API endpoint for user lookup based on third-party ID (3PID).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing a background database update, introduced in Synapse 1.64.0, which could cause poor database performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving the performance of /context in large rooms.</p>
</li>

<li>This week has been exciting for ElementX (our <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios">brand new Element iOS client</a> based on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk">Matrix Rust SDK</a>) which gained a brand new navigation system and a new user notification system, support for displaying file messages in the timeline and playing back video ones, as well as sending states for new messages and an improved bubble layout. </li>
<li>We have also started working on an iPad specific layout, improved our logging components, improved hardware keyboard handling and fixed a few annoying issues</li>
<li>In Element land we have a made a handful of bug fixes which will hit the store next week and work has been continuing on threads, the new rich text editor, the device manager and our new crypto stack</li>

<li>The team is working on the device manager, the Rich Text Editor (to add more edition options: links, quote, etc.), and the voice broadcast.</li>
<li>On the Element Android X side, we are also making progress. We can now change the server (the server has to support sliding sync though). The room list is displayed and the timeline with the Rich Text editor too. We are now working to add more features such as supporting more Event types in the timeline, etc. And the app got a new monochrome icon!</li>

<p>A Social Annotation Tool Powered by Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gleachkr:matrix.org">gleachkr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since our last update, Populus viewer has added two features, both a bit overdue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Populus viewer now supports .well-known discovery, so you just need to know your matrix server name, rather than the full subdomain in order to connect.</li>
<li>Populus viewer now supports the &quot;restricted&quot; join rule for annotations, so that annotation membership can be restricted to members of the underlying resource space. This will likely be the default for newly created annotations in the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our server (at populus.open-tower.com) has also been rebuilt and reconfigured a bit, and will likely be converted from a test-bed to a stable home for annotation-based discussions in the coming weeks.

<p><a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> is a functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript with the promise that their generated JS code will <em>NEVER</em> raise any runtime errors and show high performance.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that certain implementations like <a href="https://cactus.chat/">Cactus Chat</a> already <a href="https://gitlab.com/cactus-comments/cactus-client">use Elm</a>, I could not find an SDK for it. That's why I've started to write one: https://git.noordstar.me/bram/Elm-Matrix</p>
<p>The SDK is currently in early development. The <code>/v3/sync</code> endpoint is functional and there are already a few other ways to interact with the API, so the repository can already be tested by developers who are familiar with Elm. If you aren't that familiar with the language, it is better to wait until I release the first complete version.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trinity is an experimental bot framework written in Rust and using matrix-rust-sdk, as well as
commands / modules compiled to WebAssembly, with convenient developer features like modules
hot-reload.</p>
<p>Two weeks of updates, because I've been slightly late last week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trinity now uses WebAssembly components as created with
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component"><code>cargo-components</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen"><code>wit-bindgen</code></a> under the hood for the Matrix
modules. This is quite experimental and early stage, but this allows multiple exciting things in
some not-so-distant future: switch API implementations at runtime, more security by isolating
specific APIs, using source languages for the modules that can be compiled with wit-bindgen, etc.</li>
<li>In particular, we've made a proof-of-concept for a bot module written in C (!) and compiled to
WebAssembly, and we've been very close to having a bot module written in Java using the excellent
<a href="https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm">TeaVM</a> project.</li>
<li>New APIs have been added for the modules:
<ul>
<li>a simple key-value store, that is backed by the <a href="https://github.com/cberner/redb/">redb</a> pure
Rust project, which comes with great performance.</li>
<li>modules can now specific help messages as well as admin commands (that will be available only
to a predefined admin user).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which then allowed to write a shiny new Mastodon module: configure it in a room with a set of
credentials, a Mastodon URL instance, define which users are allowed to use it, and then post
statuses from the room using <code>!toot message</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested to follow the project, feel free to join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#trinity:delire.party">our Matrix
room</a> or get the code on

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Major breakthroughs have happened behind the scenes this week: we were able to get a simple python3-asyncio to poll our rust-side future and receive its result via uniffi. While there isn't much to show for the outside world, this is a major step towards having async-uniffi. The team is super excited about this development.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Sliding-Sync-Land, we have debugged the session reset and added <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1193">transparent session recovery to the offline-caching PR</a>. Together with the latest <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1219">PR that hands over the already received timeline events to the new Timeline API</a>, this should visibly speed up things and improve overall performance across all major clients using both of these. Further more, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1215">Timeline API has UTD decryption retry support</a> now. The client interfaces are moving ahead fast.</p>
<p>On the always-on-going-improvement-front, we have upgraded to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1200">ruma</a>, merged <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1201">the component generation for swift in xtask</a>, switched to custom <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1208"><code>cargo</code> build profiles</a>, have a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1213">signaling mutex for crypto now</a>, moved <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1212">large parts of <code>deserialized_responses</code> to <code>matrix-sdk-base</code></a> and made the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1216"><code>sync_token</code> accessor private</a>.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I started experimenting with extending my moderation tools with a basic ML model that can give me early warnings on common spam.</p>
<p>As a result https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-spam-ml was made. It contains a basic ML model using tensorflow based on telegram spam from matrix and a standard SMS dataset. It provides a HTTP api which can also be found at https://spam.midnightthoughts.space and a Synapse and mjolnir integration for both sampling training data and using it as automated spam reactions and is planned for the future.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/11/11/this-week-in-matrix-2022-11-11#matrix-plays-gameboy-games">Last week's TWIM</a> presented a <a href="https://github.com/jaller94/matrix-plays-pokemon">GBA emulator</a> that was written and implemented in JavaScript. Due to some obscure Rust dependencies that weren't compatible with my server setup, I decided to rewrite the program in Python.</p>
<p>The Python implementation can be found at <a href="https://git.noordstar.me/bram/pyboy-to-matrix">bram/pyboy-to-matrix</a>. It only supports GameBoy games (no GBA), but it only needs one process (or Docker container) to run both the emulator and the Matrix bot.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with last week's post, the GameBoy emulator is a program that emulates games and then interacts with you on Matrix. You can send commands and the emulator will show you what happened in the game.</p>

Matrix.org Foundation and Community devroom <em>in person</em> at FOSDEM. Half a day of
talks, demos and workshops around Matrix itself and projects built on top of
Matrix.</p>
<p>We encourage people working on the Matrix protocol or building on it in an open
source project to submit a proposal! Note that companies are welcome to talk
about the Matrix details of their open source projects, but marketing talks are
not welcome.</p>
<p>This call for participation is only about the physical devroom. A separate CfP
will be issued for the online devroom once there are more details about it.</p>
<p>Key dates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conference dates 4-5 February, 2023 In person</li>
<li>Matrix Devroom date: Sunday 5 morning in person, online devroom to be
announced</li>
<li>Submission deadline: Monday 5th December</li>
<li>Announcement of selected talks: Thursday 15th December </li>
</ul>
<p>You must be available in person to present your talk for the physical devroom.</p>
<h2 id="talk-details">Talk Details</h2>
<p>The talks can follow one of thee two formats for the physical devroom</p>
<ul>
<li>20 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A, for topics that can be covered briefly</li>
<li>50 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A for more complex subjects which need more focus</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly encourage you to prepare a demo when it makes sense, so people can 
actually see what your work looks like in practice!</p>
<p>Of course, the proposal must respect the FOSDEM terms as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conference language is English. All content must relate to Free and Open
Source Software. By participating in the event you agree to the publication of
your recordings, slides and other content provided under the same licence as
all FOSDEM content (CC-BY).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="submitting-a-proposal">Submitting a Proposal</h2>
<p>Proposals must be <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM23">submitted on FOSDEM's conference management system Pentabarf</a>
before <del>December 5</del> December 8 2022. If you are not used to Pentabarf, you can
follow this <a href="https://eyskens.me/beginners-guide-to-pentabarf/">beginners guide to Pentabarf</a>.</p>
<p>We expect to receive more requests than we have slots available. The devroom
organisers will be reviewing the proposals and accepting them based on the
potential positive impact the project has on Matrix (as defined in by the
Mission section of https://matrix.org/foundation).</p>
<p>If a project proposal has been turned down, it doesn't mean we don't believe it
has good potential. Maintainers are invited to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a>
Matrix room to give it some visibility.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec updates</h2>
<p>This week the Spec Core Team has been working with the IETF More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working group to define a charter. With a charter, the working group is able to start thinking about implementation and design details, which means talking even more about Matrix!</p>
<p>We had the opportunity to discuss Matrix with several interested people at IETF this week, and are extremely excited for the (long) road ahead: even in the event where Matrix doesn't get accepted, we hope the protocol(s) the working group publishes will be fit for purpose and adopted widely (not to mention our own spec will be better as a result). </p>
<p>To find out more about what we're doing in this space or to learn more, check out this week's Matrix Live above!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3381">MSC3381: Polls (mk II)</a>!</p>
<p>Polls! They are useful for quickly gauging whether a group of people agree, or entirely disagree on a topic or choice. This is an MSC with a fairly long history, but has received experimental implementation in a small number of Matrix clients. The concept uses Extensible Events, and there are plans to rewrite it off the back of changes in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a> (extensible events). But for now, it works and is a fun feature.</p>
<p>It's likely worth waiting for the rewrite before commenting on the MSC with detailed changes, but otherwise feel free to have a read to see how it currently works!

<p>Synapse 1.71.0 has been released! It contains the usual round of bugfixes and performance improvements, plus some new features. Notably, Synapse now supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>back-channel logouts from OpenID Connect providers.</li>
<li>Postgres and SQLite full-text search operators in search queries.</li>
<li>MSC3664, push rules for relations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Server administrators should be aware that:</p>
<ul>
<li>legacy Prometheus metric names are now disabled by default, and will be removed altogether in Synapse 1.73.0.
If not already done, server administrators should update their dashboards and alerting rules to avoid using the deprecated metric names.</li>
<li>Synapse 1.71.0 will be the last release to support PostgreSQL 10. Server administrators are encouraged to upgrade their PostgreSQL servers before the next release, if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more about v1.71.0 here: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases</p>

<p>Yep, no pinned release yet, but there are some exciting features in the <code>main</code> branch (<code>latest</code> docker image):</p>
<p><strong>multi-domain support!</strong></p>
<p>You can have one main email domain (eg: <a href="https://etke.cc/">the-etke.cc</a>) and multiple additional domains that will be used as aliases (<a href="https://etke.cc/">not-etke.cc</a>, <a href="https://example.com/">example.com</a>), so you can get more spam to the <a href="https://example.com/">user@the-etke.cc</a>, <a href="https://example.com/">user@not-etke.cc</a> and <a href="https://example.com/">user@example.com</a> at the same time!</p>
<p><strong>bridged thread replies!</strong></p>
<p>the last planned feature of the roadmap: send reply (reply-to or thread reply) to an email message in the matrix room and it will automatically set all magic stuff (<code>In-Reply-To</code> header, subject with <code>Re: %original message's subject%</code>, etc) and send email.

<p>Since our last update in June (yeah, sorry...), we released Ruma 0.7.0 and a few patch releases including all of the following and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for refresh tokens (MSC2918 / Matrix 1.4)</li>
<li>Unstable support for discovering an OpenID Connect Server (MSC2965)</li>
<li>Unstable support for private read receipts</li>
<li>Lots of API refinements, like renaming <code>AnyRoomEvent</code> to <code>AnyTimelineEvent</code></li>
<li>Support for Room Version 10</li>
<li>Unstable support for sliding sync</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this release was released back in September, a bunch of things have also happened that are not released yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many features were moved out of unstable feature flags because they were stabilized in Matrix 1.4</li>
<li>We made message construction easier than ever with improvements to markdown detection and improvements to reply and edit creation</li>
<li>We refactored and extended the push notification code</li>
<li>We are about to conclude a massive refactoring that should make our codebase look less strange if you are familiar with Rust, and could help compile times as well</li>

<blockquote>
<p>This week has seen important strives forward on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1193">sliding sync, which now has a PR up for offline support</a> and the new timeline API, with some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1192">initial unittests</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1196">video messages</a> support merged and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1203">support for file messages coming up</a>. On the FFI, we now have support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1199">logging in Android</a> and work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1201">moving the iOS binding scripts into our internal xtask cli</a>.</p>
<p>As usual a lot of work is been going in the background without any visible, tangible outcome yet. On one side we are making great progress on getting a first async-prototype for uniffi with python working, on the other we have been profiling the sdk on iOS mobile devices for its memory footprint - which is a major blocker for notification support.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>This week we've been continuing our mission to define Matrix as the interoperable standard for instant messaging! With many of our discussions expected to happen next week in this area, we've prepared some drafts for the wider community to review (with even more on the way!). With <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/3923">MSC3923</a>, we're asking for feedback on whether people think the approach is something that could work for Matrix, though there is a cautionary note that there's a lot of TODOs to fill still. </p>
<p>We hope to have even more news next week, but as a reminder: The IETF process is fairly slow-moving as it takes a lot of time to get through the different stages. Keep an eye on MSCs tagged &quot;IETF&quot; or &quot;MIMI&quot; - or watch this space - for updates on how it's going üôÇ</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3911">MSC3911: Linking media to events</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to be an addition to authenticated media in matrix (specifically <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/3916">MSC3916</a>) where successful authentication would also be conditioned on whether or not the user was able to view an associated event in a Matrix room. In plain english, that means that if the media was sent in a room, then you'd need to be in that room to be able to see the media (even if you tried to load the media outside of a matrix client). This change helps address some concerns about media leaking outside of the room it was sent. It also opens up possibilities to delete media if all associated events have been redacted.</p>
<p>Check it out if you're interested in advancing media in Matrix!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://telodendria.io">Telodendria</a> is moving along slowly but steadily. Here are a few brief things to note for this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Telodendria/Telodendria">GitHub</a>:</strong> There's now a read-only Git mirror of the source code hosted on GitHub, which you can browse online, or clone if you want to do local work with it.</li>
<li><strong>Network &amp; Memory Improvements:</strong> I did a lot of work with my debugger this week and made a number of network and memory improvements that make Telodendria <em>much</em> more stable and efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Data API:</strong> I just have begun writing code for persisting data and caching it. At the current pace, I'd expect to see that done around the end of this year.</li>
<li><strong>Get Involved:</strong> If you want to speed up development, I'm happy to delegate any of the tasks in <a href="https://github.com/Telodendria/Telodendria/blob/master/TODO.txt"><code>TODO.txt</code></a> to you.</li>
<li><strong>Matrix:</strong> As a reminder, Telodendria is organized entirely on Matrix at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria:bancino.net">#telodendria:bancino.net</a>. There you'll find a number of rooms for various purposes, including submitting patches, discussing Telodendria, and digesting the official newsletter.

<p>Welcome to another Friday! Here in Synapse-land we have been hard at work on this week's release candidate: v1.71.0rc2. It contains bugfixes, a few new features, and continued work on speeding up Synapse. Some notable elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Legacy Prometheus metric names are now disabled by default, and will be removed altogether in Synapse 1.73.0.
If not already done, server administrators should update their dashboards and alerting rules to avoid using the deprecated metric names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synapse now supports back-channel logouts from OpenID Connect providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synapse now supports use of Postgres and SQLlite full-text search operators in search queries.</p>

<p>Announcing the first alpha release of <a href="https://gitlab.futo.org/cvwright/swiclops">Swiclops</a>, a server that handles authentication, registration, and other user management tasks for a Matrix homeserver like Synapse.</p>
<p>Swiclops can be configured to provide user-interactive authentication (UIA) on the Matrix <code>/login</code> endpoint, similar to <a href="https://github.com/Sorunome/matrix-doc/blob/soru/uia-on-login/proposals/2835-uia-on-login.md">MSC2835</a>.  This opens up many exciting possibilities for the future, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requiring acceptance of the latest terms of service at login</li>
<li>Multi-stage authentication protocols, such as WebAuthn or PassKeys, or various password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols</li>
<li>Two-factor authentication</li>

<p>We wouldn't ordinarily make so many releases in one week, but we've been quite busy! Instead of including the entire set of changelogs, please see the releases below which have more details about what's changed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.10.7">Version 0.10.7</a> today, which fixes a variety of things in <code>/sync</code> amongst other things</li>

<p>A Minimal, simple, multi-platform chat client for the Matrix protocol.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alariej:matrix.org">JFA</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quadrix v1.4.5 has been released and is available for mobiles and desktops in the respective app stores (Google Play, App Store, Mac App Store, Microsoft, Snap Store, Flathub).</p>
<p>The main improvement in this release is the added support for the .well-known API call, which allows to register and login on homeservers using a base domain URL.</p>
<p>Also, the displaying of redacted and edited messages has been improved.</p>
<p>I started testing Quadrix on the Conduit server implementation (thanks to @timo:conduit.rs for a test account on conduit.rs) and noticed right away some major issues. A few fixes are already included in this release.</p>
<p>Finally, for PinePhone users, the Ozone/Wayland switch has now been disabled in the flatpak build for Phosh, because of a compatibility issue between Electron and the on-screen keyboard. On Phosh, the app now runs in XWayland mode (it looks blurry) but at least the OSK works.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the Apple Silicon builds are now properly packaged.</p>
<p>Additionally we fixed the pagination issues in our search and you should now be able to find more messages. As part of that we also optimized a few database queries again to reduce disk load when running Nheko (which became more noticeable after we enabled some durability flags on the database last week).</p>
<p>There have also been more fixes to the pushrules code. Test code now outnumbers the actual implementation by 4:1. As an additional feature, we do highlight messages marked as &quot;highlight&quot; via a pushrule (i.e. when someone mentions you) in the timeline by adding a red outline.</p>
<p>As part of the push work I also implemented and fixed a few things in Synapse related to pushrules. If replies are not highlighted for you currently, it might be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14356">this bug</a>. A longer term fix will be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3664">MSC3664</a>, which <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11804">I also implemented</a>.

<p>Hello from Nordeck üëã This week we finally released the first of our widgets as open source: It's the <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-poll">matrix-poll-widget</a>.</p>
<p>The widget allows to conduct polls in Matrix rooms. But unlike <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/travis/msc/polls/proposals/3381-polls.md">MSC3381</a> it is designed for more complex scenarios, like polls with multiple parties in a council. You have full control over your data, as it's stored in your Matrix room. It is currently in use in the German public sector.
The widget is built using TypeScript, React, and the <code>matrix-widget-api</code>. We also extracted a thin layer of code that is shared between our widgets into our <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit"><code>matrix-widget-toolkit</code></a>, another project we made open source recently.

<p>Trixnity release 3.0.0-beta1</p>
<p>We released Trixnity 3.0.0-beta1. This is a major version with many (breaking) changes. We will wait for the 3.0.0 release until we have implemented the Matrix 1.4 spec changes (<code>m.replace</code> will be really hacky due to a - in my opinion - <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/client-server-api/#server-side-replacement-of-content">spec bug</a>).</p>

<p>We now support realm as a database backend. This allows you to use Trixnity on iOS with a persistent database.</p>
<h2 id="added-exchangeable-mediastore">Added exchangeable MediaStore</h2>
<p>Media is not saved into the database anymore, but in an exchangeable <code>MediaStore</code>. It is also streamed, so you can download and upload large files. There is <code>trixnity-client-media-okio</code> for a multiplatform file based implementation.</p>
<h2 id="improved-stateflowcache">Improved StateFlowCache</h2>
<p>The <code>StateFlowCache</code>, which basically is a reactive cache on top of an arbitrary database does not need a <code>CoroutineScope</code> parameter for any read or write operation anymore. It was needed to react to the lifecycle of the consumer, so that not used data could be removed from the cache. This was really error prone, because if the consumer passed a wrong <code>CoroutineScope</code> with a too long lifecycle, the cache could grow unlimited. We figured out to solve this with Kotlin <code>Flow</code>s, so everything is lazy and the lifecycle can be determined from the Flow consumer!</p>
<p>We also fixed a long standing bug, which could cause to return a <code>Flow</code>, which does not emit updated values.</p>
<h2 id="power-level-caluculation-support">Power level caluculation support</h2>
<p>We implemented some functions to calculate power levels (e. g. <code>canBanUser(...)</code>).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3917">MSC3917: Cryptographically Constrained Room Membership</a> is rather interesting. It aims to make room membership in a room cryptographically verifiable via a &quot;Master Signing Key&quot; that's controlled by users. This is in addition to the homeserver signatures typically placed on events in Matrix. The purpose is to prevent a homeserver from being able to lie about your membership in a room. While not the end-all-be-all solution to this particular problem, it's certainly a well-reasoned take.</p>
<h4 id="matrix-ietf-115">Matrix @ IETF 115</h4>

<ul>
<li>Matrix as a transport for MIMI: https://turt2live.github.io/ietf-mimi-matrix-transport/draft-ralston-mimi-matrix-transport.html (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3918">MSC3918</a>)</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a> explains</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A soon-to-be working group within the IETF called &quot;More Instant Messaging Interoperability&quot; (MIMI) is aiming to solve, well, messaging interoperability for primarily reasons of the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA). The DMA requires &quot;gatekeepers&quot; to interop with other platforms while maintaining the same level of encryption, and we think Matrix is the perfect fit for this use-case. While we'd likely be saying goodbye to Olm and Megolm in the process, we'd be saying hello to Messaging Layer Security (MLS) and its decentralized counterpart DMLS - a good thing in our books, at the moment. </p>
<p>In terms of what we've done this week in publishing our drafts (and soon to be real Internet-Drafts under the IETF process), we're formally proposing that Matrix's Federation API and event schema be used for messaging interoperability. Our very own Matrix spec process will be impacted by this sort of direction as it makes it (theoretically) &quot;harder&quot; to change details of the spec. To avoid it being extraordinarily difficult, we'll be nailing down some of the edge cases of the Federation API and event format ( üëÄ extensible events) naturally as we work closer and closer to an RFC series. We'll also be making some architectural changes to our specification itself to better support half of it being in the IETF domain, like defining room versions more clearly and splitting non-core spec out of the way. It's worth noting that this is a relatively slow process as we work towards the deadline of DMA a few years from now, but the changes might be felt by the ecosystem on a more rapid scale.</p>
<p>At the moment, we're planning to attend IETF 115 to help keep Matrix on the map for MIMI and raise our feedback about the proposed working group charter. Discussions about whether Matrix is the correct fit are already ongoing, but expected to increase as we get closer to IETF 116 next quarter. We were also already at IETF 114 a few months ago where many of these conversations started.</p>
<p>Future work is currently expected to come through under my name, as have the current drafts (both with obvious input from Matthew as project lead). Watching this space and the spec process for updates is best üôÇ</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jordan:bancino.net">Jordan Bancino</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone, I'm working on a little Matrix project called Telodendria.</p>
<p>Telodendria is eventually going to be another homeserver implementation.  It isn't one yet; I'm still in the <em>very</em> early stages of prototyping it, and writing some boilerplate code, but I've been encouraged to throw the project out there for more exposure, so here we are!</p>
<p>Telodendria is written in ANSI C, will use a custom flat-file database, and relies <em>only</em> on a POSIX system to be built and run. It won't pull in any dependencies; as much as possible will be written from scratch, including the HTTP stack, JSON parser, and any other baseline stuff a Matrix homeserver needs.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>One of the goals is simply to build a useful homeserver, but also just to learn about the inner workings of Matrix and the technology that supports it, as well as to have a bit of fun in the process.</p>
<p>At this point we've got Synapse, Dendrite, Conduit, Construct, and a few other great projects. So you're probably asking, What <em>practical</em> reasons are there to build another homeserver? The best answer to that is in <a href="https://telodendria.io/man/man7/telodendria.7.html">Telodendria's manual</a>, but what it really comes down to is being portable and lightweight.  It'd be cool to have a Matrix homeserver server that can run <em>anywhere</em>, but specifically targets the more obscure operating systems like the BSDs. Additionally, it should be light enough to perform well on Raspberry Pis, routers, cheap VPSs, and other low-power and low-storage devices that might not be as capable of running a full database plus a hefty Matrix homeserver.</p>
<p>For me personally, I just want a homeserver that feels like it belongs on OpenBSD and is capable of handling my use case without having to install any third-party packages. I'm a digital minimalist that wants to cut down on his software requirements, and Telodendria is one of the ways I've set out to do that.</p>
<h2 id="want-to-get-involved">Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>There's definitely plenty of code and documentation to be written, so if you're looking for a challenge and believe in the project's philosophy, you're highly encouraged to get involved in whatever way you're able.</p>
<p>The development discussion happens entirely on Matrix. If you're unsure where to start, start by joining the project rooms <a href="https://telodendria.io/man/man7/telodendria.7.html#DESCRIPTION">listed in the manual</a>. Do be sure to also check out main <a href="https://telodendria.io">project website</a>, which has a list of all the manual pages. The manual should contain much of the information you'll need to get started, but it's far from complete, so if you find the information to be insufficient, don't be afraid to ask questions in the rooms listed above.</p>

<p>Thank you as ever to our community of contributors, server operators and users who've been involved in this release. We'll be cutting a release candidate for Synapse 1.71 on the upcoming Tuesday (1st November), aiming to release the week after (8th November).</p>
<p>As for this week: we've been testing Synapse against the recent Python 3.11 release, dealing wit h CI deprecations and working through our backlog of old PRs. Lots of small things to juggle!</p>

<p>Another good news is that a fox fixed the upload widget sometimes breaking Nheko when trying to upload specific files on some platforms.

<p>Happy Friday all!  Once again we have a new build of the Circles Android app for your beta testing enjoyment.</p>
<h2 id="updates-in-this-release-v1-0-5">Updates in this release (v1.0.5)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Renamed the app back to &quot;Circles&quot;.  Technically the proper name of the app is &quot;FUTO Circles&quot;, but it will show up on your home screen as simply &quot;Circles&quot;, similar to how Google Photos is &quot;Photos&quot; and Google Maps is &quot;Maps&quot;.  The Circuli name was too hard for most English speakers to pronounce, and it didn't solve our other issues with the name.  &quot;FUTO Circles&quot; should do the trick.</li>
<li>We're keeping the Circuli name for our online service.</li>
<li>Added QR-code-based device verification.</li>
<li>Made registration tokens optional, i.e. it's up to the server whether to require them or not.  Currently we do require registration tokens on our servers, and you can sign up with the token 0000-1111-2222-4444.</li>

<p>Long-awaited and with a bunch of final bug-fixes on the server side, this week eventually saw the merging of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1054">sliding sync extensions</a>, enabling e2ee and to-device message support via sliding-sync on main. With that, and some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1154">additional APIs on</a>, a new Element-x with e2ee support was made available. A release that also features the latest <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1138">work on the timeline API</a>, which, too, has seen its fair share of progress this week - mainly internal fixes and debugging helpers.</p>
<p>As a result of the sliding sync work, just earlier today, an important PR was opened for jack-in, the experimental debugging TUI client based on matrix-rust-sdk (which we use for debugging sliding sync): <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1156">now allowing you send (encrypted) messages</a>, too.</p>
<p>Following last weeks announcement we also made the Rust-Sec public, indicating why we recommend uprgading to 0.6.1, which we released shortly prior.</p>
<p>Other than that, work has been progressed in the background on the pretty complex problem of async in uniffi and system-specific runners, namely libdispatch on ios rather than tokio, as well as work on uniff proc-macros.</p>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2700">MSC2700: Thumbnail requirements for the media repo</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC has the goal of clarifying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">mimetypes</a> of media that a homeserver both MUST and SHOULD support thumbnailing for. The intention is to give clients a clearer picture of what file formats will receive a proper thumbnail before they are uploaded to the homeserver.</p>
<p>Comments on the MSC seem to suggest that the MSC as it stands does not completely solve the problem: while it does give clients an explicit list of supported mimetypes, the list is quite short. And the list of SHOULD mimetypes cannot be relied on.</p>
<p>The MSC also clarifies that encrypted media should always be uploaded with a mimetype of <code>application/octet-stream</code>, instead of the original media's mimetype, which seems like a welcome and uncontentious point. And finally, it defines <code>501 M_UNSUPPORTED</code> to be returned instead of an internal server error on thumbnailing failure.</p>
<p>I believe the next step for this MSC is for the current threads to be incorporated into the text; so don't miss the threads when reading it!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan Abolivier</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we've released Synapse 1.69! It comes with improved caching tools for third-party modules, and support for a bunch of experimental features, such as thread-aware read receipts (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3771">MSC3771</a>) and an approval flow for new registrations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3866">MSC3866</a>). As part of this release, we've also laid out the removal schedule for the long-deprecated legacy Prometheus metric names, and the <code>generate_short_term_login_token</code> module API method. Read all about it on the matrix.org blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/17/synapse-1-69-released</p>
<p>Another big thing in Synapse 1.69 is experimental support for faster remote room joins! You can read more about it on the blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/18/testing-faster-remote-room-joins but briefly, we are ready for server admins to begin testing, with some caveats. If you've read the post and feel confident, turn it on, give it a spin and let us know how it goes!</p>
<p>Alongside 1.69, we're also disclosing a moderate severity vulnerability that we fixed back in Synapse 1.62. If your deployment runs a Synapse version older than 1.62, and is openly federating, please update to a more recent version of Synapse at your earliest convenience. More info on this in advisory <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-jhjh-776m-4765">GHSA-jhjh-776m-4765</a> and <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31152">CVE-2022-31152</a>.</p>
<p>This week we've also released the first release candidate for Synapse 1.70 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.70.0rc1">1.70.0rc1</a>). This release will include experimental support for thread-aware notifications (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773">MSC3773</a>) and filtering (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3874">MSC3874</a>), improved validation, advertising support for Matrix 1.3 and 1.4, and the usual load of bugfixes and internal improvements.

<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.10.4">Dendrite 0.10.4</a> which contains the following features and fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various tables belonging to the user API will be renamed so that they are namespaced with the <code>userapi_</code> prefix
<ul>
<li>Note that, after upgrading to this version, you should not revert to an older version of Dendrite as the database changes <strong>will not</strong> be reverted automatically</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The backoff and retry behaviour in the federation API has been refactored and improved</li>
<li>Private read receipt support is now advertised in the client <code>/versions</code> endpoint</li>
<li>Private read receipts will now clear notification counts properly</li>
<li>A bug where a false <code>leave</code> membership transition was inserted into the timeline after accepting an invite has been fixed</li>
<li>Some panics caused by concurrent map writes in the key server have been fixed</li>
<li>The sync API now calculates membership transitions from state deltas more accurately</li>
<li>Transaction IDs are now scoped to endpoints, which should fix some bugs where transaction ID reuse could cause nonsensical cached responses from some endpoints</li>
<li>The length of the <code>type</code>, <code>sender</code>, <code>state_key</code> and <code>room_id</code> fields in events are now verified by number of bytes rather than codepoints after a spec clarification, reverting a change made in Dendrite 0.9.6</li>

<li>Release candidate 1.5.4 is available for the tester on the PlayStore. It includes a lot of new features, most of them behind lab flags: new device management, new WYSIWYG editor, Voice broadcast, etc. Also the application is now targeting Android 13 devices.

<blockquote>
<p>It's been a little while since our last update, but Populus development continues! In addition to the usual bugfixes, we've made a number of ergonomics improvements suggested by the experiences of other users at my university. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Buttons for message actions (react, redact, reply, and so on) are now displayed in a way that doesn't overlap with sender names</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avatar images for discussions can now up uploaded simultaneously with discussion creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Older collections of discussions can be &quot;archived&quot; using <code>m.lowpriority</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moar tootips!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We've also made some minor graphical improvements: loading messages are now indicated with a nice low-contrast SVG hint, rather than the literal-minded &quot;loading message&quot; message. Some icons have been improved, and the bartab (lines in the margins) display logic has been improved. And, we're now on the latest JS-SDK version.</p>

<p>üëã Hello form the VoIP team. This week we have a bunch of news. 1) We released Element Call version 0.3 with a lot of UX polishing  including i18n (thx to the great community) and paving the way for a proper 2) integration into Element Web and Desktop. If you want to give it a try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use https://develop.element.io or Element Desktop Nightly</li>
<li>Enable in Settings -&gt; Labs -&gt; Calls
<ul>
<li>Element Call Videorooms</li>
<li>New group call experience</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now you can create
<ul>
<li>A new video room backed by Element Call or</li>
<li>Enable Calls in the Rooms settings of a room and just press the regular call button</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>And by the way we also added screen-sharing with Element Desktop Nightly using the embedded Element Call.</li>

<p>While the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1054">sliding sync extensions</a> are being tested and bugs found during the tests reported and fixed, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1106">FFI for the new timeline API</a> has been approved and merged this week. The third big chunk that was merged this week, was a refactoring to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1098">Replace QR with SAS verification</a> and the yet to be merged <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1124">signaling for SAS verification</a>. </p>
<p>While forcing the (not clearly spece'ed) sending of authentication tokens for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1120"><code>get_profile</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1118"><code>get_display_name</code></a>, we've also noticed a bug where we sometimes, unintentionally include the access_token in debug output - <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1130">and fixed that</a>. We will be providing a patch release and RustSec about this soon.</p>
<p>Other than that, this week has seen many smaller fixes, like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1131">making the store-setters on client-builder actually adhere to the builder pattern</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1119">removing string from storerrors</a>, and improvements like the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1126">API to set local trust</a>  or setting workspace wide dependencies for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1116">uniffi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1122">others</a>.</p>
