<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h3 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h3>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>

<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1">Matrix v1.1</a> was released! Read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">blog post here</a> if you missed it; it summarises everything that's new in v1.1, as well as plans for the future. Now that the new spec build pipeline and release infrastructure is in place, we're aiming for roughly quarterly releases going forward. Thank you all for being so patient in the meantime!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767: Extensible event types &amp; fallback in Matrix (v2)</a> (yes it really chose that).</p>
<p>Extensible events is something that has been a long time coming in Matrix. It unlocks so much potential, and is even currently being built on (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> (polls)). Definitely one of the next big ticket items to tackle in the medium term.

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dan (aka callahad) is away this week, so let me report on his behalf.</p>
<p>We cut a release candidate for Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0rc2">1.47.0rc2</a>, but see the changelog for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0rc1">rc1</a>). It exposes new functionality for <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">pluggable modules</a> and new endpoints to the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">Admin API</a>. We've fixed a bunch of long-standing bugs and continued to drive forward efforts to improve documentation and code quality. Thank you to all of our contributors!</p>
<p>With future releaes in mind, we've been continuing work to support threading and E2EE application services. We've also been prototyping a new Admin API to remove users from all rooms belonging to a certain space.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we've been doubling down on our effort to improve reliability and maintainability of our services as a whole. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent">Sydent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a> have a number of PRs in flight for both, aimed at improving type coverage and driving down error noise in the logs. We've drafted a blog post to summarise the process of type annotating mypy (keep your eyes out for that one). We also worked to make the matrix.org database more resilient, and made changes to improve the experience of rolling out upgrades to Synapse en masse.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mijutu:ellipsis.fi">mijutu</a> also tells us</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P√§ikky was created by a group of parents who wanted to make communication with daycare staff easier. They started a company and later sold it to Abilita. P√§ikky is currently used in 40+ municipalities in Finland and also in some private daycare companies too.</p>
<p>P√§ikky is also used for reserving daycare times for kids.</p>

<p>Release v1.6.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>Make reconnect loop more robust</li>
<li>Sensitive flag for MSG and NICKSERV to hide it from network room (for AUTOCMD)</li>
<li>Improved STATUS for admin room and simple STATUS for network rooms</li>
<li>Small fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Not much going on this week. Hopefully the reconnect refactor doesn't cause any breakage as it fixed multiple issues that have been around since the inception of Heisenbridge.</p>
<p>Vacuum your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you love bugs as much as I do? ‚ô•üêõ‚ô•</p>
<p>I guess not. For that reason bug fixing in Nheko for the next release continues. We fixed a super annoying issue, where loading keys from the online backup could make Nheko stuck in a flickering mode with no way to interact with it anymore. You can now also click anywhere on a read receipt to open someones profile instead of just their avaitar, edited messages now also show as redacted, if only the original message got redacted and don't lose the reply in encrypted rooms, if the edit was sent by a client, that is not Nheko. You also used to get logged out after registration, which should finally be resolved. There were also a bazillion translation updates! Thank you, everyone who contributed to those.</p>
<p>We also finally merged the prettier video player, which also fixes a video playback issue on macOS. Try it out and give us feedback on it!</p>
<p>We are still hunting down some last bugs, but expect the release soon now. In the meantime, I did start summarizing the changes, if you want to see what will be in the next release: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#090----unreleased</p>
<p>That's all and have a great weekend!</p>

<h3 id="polls">Polls</h3>
<ul>
<li>We also recently started implementing Polls.</li>
<li>On the web/desktop, we‚Äôve implemented poll creation and displaying them in the timeline. Next up is implementing voting.</li>
<li>Mobile development started recently too, with Android slightly ahead of iOS.</li>

<ul>
<li>In the background, if you‚Äôve been paying close attention to our issue tracker, you might have noticed lots of changes to our triage &amp; issue workflows over the past couple of months. We‚Äôre continuing to iterate on these, extending the best learnings to iOS &amp; Android too. </li>
<li>We recently started a project to improve the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-meta/issues/56">info architecture</a>/layout of our apps, starting on the web first. We‚Äôre merging our first tweaks and experiments soon, so expect exciting things to be landing on develop!</li>
<li>We‚Äôre continuing to implement more Space creation &amp; management support on iOS. We‚Äôve added in Space creation screens (implemented in SwiftUI!) and we‚Äôre polishing inviting people to Spaces.</li>
<li>We‚Äôve also been conducting user research to see what parts of the app are tripping users up, and working on fixes to various issues. Expect tweaks to land soon!</li>
<li>Otherwise, we‚Äôre also merging &amp; testing release candidates for upcoming releases, merging several branches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="element-android">Element Android</h3>
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôve been conducting the same user research on Android, watch this space for more tweaks &amp; improvements coming soon!</li>

<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3217">MSC3217: Soft kicks</a>!</p>
<p>Other than this sounding like something out of a workout routine, soft kicks are proposed as a hint to clients that the user has been kicked from the room, but that it was not out of moderation, but for a technical reason (the example given disconnection from an IRC network). The client can then present a different UX as opposed to a normal, &quot;hard&quot; kick.</p>

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.46.0">Synapse 1.46</a>! This release includes a fix for the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> from 1.44 which could cause smaller hosts to lock up when clients reconnected after some time offline.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.46 also includes experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440: Threading via <code>m.thread</code> relation</a>, a big step toward threaded messaging in Matrix. It's otherwise mainly a bugfix release, as we've spent much of our time reviewing infrastructure and making plans to improve our resilience should we experience hardware failures similar to what took out matrix.org two weeks ago.</p>
<p>We continue working toward a prototype implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775: Lazy loading over federation</a>, starting with setting up automated infrastructure to repeatedly measure the join speeds of assorted large, public rooms. Our goal is to have a rough proof of concept for lazy room joins by the end of the year.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.0">Sydent 2.5.0</a>! In addition to fixing bugs, this release passes <code>mypy --strict</code>, uses Jinja2 for templates, and supports the <code>room_type</code> field from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3288">MSC3288</a> to better differentiate between invitations to rooms and invitations to Spaces.</p>

The main change is switching to the new WhatsApp multidevice API, which means the phone doesn't need to be connected 24/7 anymore. The release also includes a new backfilling system using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a>, and making the relaybot mode less special-cased and more like what mautrix-signal does.</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.5.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow opening multiple simultaneous connections to the same network</li>
<li>New STOP/STAHP ROOM command to end a long paste flood</li>
<li>Clear channel send queue if the user gets kicked to prevent continuing flood on rejoin</li>
<li>New KB ROOM command to do a proper kick &amp; ban (contributed by GitHub user @blastrock, thanks!)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most useful feature this week is having the ability to open multiple connections to the same network. This can be used to plumb channels with a secondary connection while using the bridge as yourself with the main one. You can also STAHP long pastes from being actually sent out completely to a channel if you weren't careful enough on Matrix side.</p>
<p>Upgrading from previous version to v1.5.0 will cause a small migration for every channel/pm that is open so it might take a little longer for the first startup to complete. If no multiple network connections are opened it is safe to downgrade but if someone uses the feature it will cause shenanigans for the duplicate networks in the older version.</p>
<p>Inject your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are preparing for a release! That means, if you are translator, we could use your help to get our translations <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/">updated</a> and if you want to have a bug fixed before release, now is the time to report it or complain about it! Please come and see us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> for complaints and questions!</p>
<p>We saw a lot of translation updates by Linerly, Priit and Thulinma already. The click ghosting issue in the room list should be fixed as well as the crash when accepting an invite from your browser. You can now register on matrix.org again, after fighting with some... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3471">reality deforming wording in the spec</a>. Notifications on macOS now use the &quot;modern&quot; API for notifications, including grouping notifications by room. (Expect more fancy improvements there in the future!) The warning about mentioning the whole room now vanishes properly, hiding space children from the roomlist now doesn't hide them from the space itself anymore, the loading spinner shouldn't show in a fully loaded room again, the room directory search bar is now focused by default and a few smaller fixes.</p>
<p>We also completed the bootstrapping UI now. This means you get prompted for unverified devices, when your device isn't verified or when cross-signing isn't configured for your account yet and you are given ways to remedy that.</p>
<p>We have a few more bug fixes we want to land before the release, so don't expect it tomorrow, but we have the featureset down now. And if you thought the changes listed in this snippet are long, wait for the full release changelog. It will probably take a few days for me to tidy that up and I think this will be our biggest release yet! Happy testing, everyone!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://buymeacoffee.com">buymeacoffee</a> listings integration - pretty basic, but that's just a first step! So now you can list subscribers, supporters and extras purchases directly in matrix room (spolier: next releases will bring notifications about new subscribers, supporters and purchases)</li>
<li>rate limiter for http forms - no one can bother you if you don't want that! So now you can configure specific rate limits per form</li>
<li>enhanced email validation (mostly used in the forms module) - you had spam hosts and emails list before, but now you have MX records checks, regular expressions check and some other useful tricks to <del>hold the door</del> stop spammers</li>

<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: Europe is close to officially regulating big corporations and forcing them to open their silos via the Digital Markets Act. Element joined forces with other companies to make sure that the members of the European Commission about to vote on the regulation knew how important it is.</p>
<p>Matrix was created to break the silos, as an interoperable layer for all communications. We wanted to ensure people had the ability to choose where their data is stored, and had the choice of interface to access them. This was also a good way to enable better competition and innovation in the communication space, forcing the players to compete on value add. But whilst Matrix is already a 39M users open network in itself, it could be even better if the bigger silos decided to open up and participate into it.</p>
<p>In December last year, as part of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Commission proposed to update the competition law for digital markets with rules mandating ‚Äògatekeeping‚Äô platforms to open up, in order to enable innovation and data sovereignty. </p>
<p>This move is so aligned with Matrix and Element‚Äôs mission, that Element joined over twenty other organisations to launch the Coalition for Competitive Digital Markets on Tuesday the 26th. The coalition supports stronger rules for large online platforms in the DMA, calling for amendments to it to make sure that major services offer a public API to interact with their core services and to ban the pre-installation and default setting of core platform apps.</p>
<p>Matrix is a perfect example of how technology can thrive through openness and collaboration. We will bring our experiences of using federated and decentralised technologies to MEPs and Council members, in the hope for a regulatory framework which supports European innovation, competition and interoperability. </p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the weekend, one of the servers backing matrix.org suffered a hardware failure, leading to around half an hour of downtime as we failed over to another system. Remediating and monitoring that has been the focus of much of the Synapse team over the past week.</p>
<p>We also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.46.0rc1">shipped a release candidate</a> for Synapse 1.46, due for formal release next week. Notably, we believe this solves a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> which was introduced in Synapse 1.44. If you've been experiencing long hangs or other periods of unresponsiveness, please try upgrading to <code>1.46.0rc1</code> and let us know if it resolves your issues.</p>
<p>The Synapse team has also decided to aim for building a rough prototype of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775: Lazy loading over federation</a> by the end of the year, in hopes that this will pave the way to extremely fast joins of large rooms.</p>
<p>We're also continuing to work on static type checking in our projects: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/448">As of today</a>, Sydent passes <code>mypy --strict</code>! We hope to write about what we've learned in the near future.</p>

<li>Free form AUTOCMD after joining a channel, per channel</li>
<li>Automatic rejoin on invite or kick (invite enabled by default)</li>
<li>AVATAR network room command to set avatars for IRC users (admin only)</li>
<li>WHOIS room command for PMs, PART for channels</li>
<li>Add ROOM command in network room to run channel room commands safely</li>
<li>Move PLUMBCFG stuff under ROOM command</li>
</ul>
<p>A smaller release this time around which consists mostly of QoL stuff to make things a little easier. <a href="https://idlerpg.lolhosting.net/">IdleRPG</a> users can now rejoice and login to your character automatically with channel AUTOCMD when joining on reconnect as what's more important: running a bridge to engage in deep conversations or sit in a channel doing nothing?</p>
<p>Plumb users need to use the new generic ROOM command in network rooms to configure plumbs now that PLUMBCFG has been removed.</p>

<p>I work on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs">Collabs</a>, a library for making decentralized collaborative apps, and we have some demos that run on Matrix!  E.g., in a widget-capable client like Element, send the message:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>/addwidget https://compoventuals-tests.herokuapp.com/host.html?network=matrix&amp;container=demos/rich-text/dist/rich_text.html
</span></code></pre>
<p>to add a collaborative text editor widget.  (Fair warning: loading and saving is flaky, so don't type anything you can't afford to lose.)</p>
<p>All collaboration happens using messages sent to the Matrix room.  So, you're not dependent on any external service provider, and the document is end-to-end encrypted if your room is.</p>
<p>We have more demos <a href="https://compoventuals-tests.herokuapp.com/">here</a>, with instructions on how to use them in a widget.  You can follow those same instructions to run your own Collabs apps (<a href="https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/blob/master/collabs/docs/getting_started_guide.md">Getting Started Guide</a>), without needing to host any servers yourself!</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Collabs and see an app running on Matrix, check out my Strange Loop talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exr0iY_D-vw&amp;t=3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exr0iY_D-vw&amp;t=3s</a>.  The library is in an alpha state and not yet ready for production use, but we'll be improving it steadily over the next year.

Game creates a chat. Any message with 'boom' posted into there spawns the Red Triangle of malice.

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! It is not-anoa here with the spec update this week, which unfortunately means no pretty graph of MSCs (sorry). I do however have some curated updates to the spec for you:</p>
<p>This week we saw a couple new MSCs get opened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3417">WIP: MSC3417: Call room room type</a> from SimonBrandner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3414">WIP: MSC3414: Encrypted state events</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Though WIP, both are exciting steps towards much larger goals - looking forward to see how they progress! We also saw FCP finish on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC3231: Token authenticated registration</a>, part of Callum's <a href="https://calcuode.com/matrix-gsoc/">GSOC project</a> this summer - congratulations! <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a> also finished FCP this week, making it a good time for clients to consider that access tokens might expire or appear in a different format in upcoming versions of the spec. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2582">MSC2582: Remove mimetype from EncryptedFile object</a> was also merged to the spec - thanks Sorunome for finding the duplicated field which was duplicated!</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the Spec Core Team (SCT) has been thinking about how we can release the spec as we've been talking about doing so for months. We're declaring a bit of a freeze on new things entering the spec for the time being, but that doesn't stop MSCs from completing FCP or being opened - they just might miss the v1.1 cut (sorry). Most of the work needed to release is deployment stuff rather than Matrix stuff, so the hope is is we can get it all worked out soon.</p>
<p>I don't have the random MSC script on hand, but I do have access to the MSC list and found <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">WIP: MSC3030: Jump to date API endpoint</a>. It's listed as work in progress, but is one of the MSCs I personally look forward to being accepted in time!</p>
<p>That's all for spec this week. I'm not sure about next week, but you might be stuck with me again. Maybe I can find those fancy graph tools in time...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks, it's been a while since we released changes to the Slack bridge but here we are on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/1.9.0-rc1">our next RC</a>. This one includes a few new things, most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The bridge now automatically invites users to private rooms if there is a message and they are not joined. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/613">#613</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update bridge to matrix-appservice-bridge 3.1.0 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/614">#614</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, a PSA: If you were struggling to bridge your rooms to matrix while using the matrix.org bridge, this should now be fixed. An update made to the Slack APIs silently broke the oauth flow, which has since been fixed. This was a misconfiguration-gone-unnoticed in our Slack app configuration, so self hosters don't need to upgrade. The details are in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/617#issuecomment-932047990</p>

<p>Pasting images should now work properly again on Windows and macOS, including pasting SVGs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The help and version command line parameters now work properly, even if an instance of Nheko is already running.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There has also been a lot of progress on the translations! We just cracked 50% translated, but since that includes a lot of languages with only a few percent, this is actually much more than it sounds! We actually have 8 languages with over 90% translations now. If you speak one of the languages at 70% or so, any help translating the remaining bits is very much appreciated. You can easily translate without an account here: https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/#translations If you want to translate without having to rely on the upvote mechanism, feel free to ask for translation permissions directly in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a>. That is also the right room to ask questions about the translation process or translations themselves.</p>
<p>Nheko is also participating at Hacktoberfest this year. Translations done using the webinterface won't get counted for that though, you would need to submit a pull request manually for that. If you always felt like contributing to Nheko would be fun, but you had no reason to, now you can do it to let someone plant a tree for you (or get a T-shirt)!</p>
<p>That's all, I need to get back on my train!</p>

<p>A minimal Matrix chat client, focused on performance, offline functionality, and broad browser support. https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hydrogen saw a few bug fixes (<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.14">0.2.14</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.15">0.2.15</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.16">0.2.16</a>) this week again, and also gained the possibility to recover from low-storage scenarios where the browser would clear indexedDB.</p>
<p>One of the bugs fixed might have caused a timeline corruption, so when you get the 0.2.16 update the history cache will be cleared and you'll notice a bit of delay as you do an initial sync again.</p>
<p>Aside from working on Hydrogen as a standalone app, I'm also making it easier to embedded in other projects. More info to come on that!</p>
<p>We've also had a priority planning this week, which spawned an updated backlog. <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/projects/1">Have a look</a> if you're interested what can be expected next (although be aware that the backlog has proven volatile in the past üôÇ).</p>

<p>After 4 years, <a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-email-bot">matrix-email-bot</a> finally got an update. Now at v2, the bot has been rewritten using TypeScript and matrix-bot-sdk (farewell, js-sdk from 2017). It still requires manual setup and the behaviour overall should be the same as before, though the amount of testing is somewhat minimal - please complain in #email:t2bot.io if something goes wrong. </p>
<p>The bot also now supports encrypted rooms out of the box, including on the t2bot.io instance. Check out <a href="https://t2bot.io/emailbot/">t2bot.io/emailbot</a> for information on how to get the bot set up in your room.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An (unofficial) Matrix server by and for the <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a> community.</p>
<p>This is a Matrix server with membership restricted to <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/supporter">Newgrounds Supporters</a>. Newgrounds is an independent arts &amp; entertainment site that has been around for over 20 years, and I felt that its spirit of independence is a perfect match with the openness of Matrix!</p>
<p>The most notable feature of the server is <em>comment rooms for Newgrounds submissions</em>. Unlike other content-sharing sites, Newgrounds submissions don't have comment sections, but <em>review</em> sections, which let you post a single comment (and optional rating) for a submission. This encourages reviews to be focused on providing constructive feedback instead of being a place for off-topic discussions. With that said, open comment systems are nice too, so this Matrix server provides it! Simply visit <code>#portal_view_SUBMISSION_ID:ngmvs.one</code> to view!</p>
<p>These comment rooms are world-visible, but (at least for the time being) only Newgrounds Supporters may join these rooms &amp; post comments in them.</p>
<p>To help along with this, I made a Firefox extension to make joining these rooms a breeze: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/newgrounds-mvsx/">NG MVSX</a>. Simply view a Newgrounds submission page, and click on the icon that appears in your URL bar!</p>
<p>Code for all components is open-sourced on <a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs">GitLab</a>.</p>
<p>This is all very new, so things might break! If they do, tell me in <code>#ngmvs-public-discussion:ngmvs.one</code></p>

<h3 id="the-latest-in-appservice-proposals-synthetic-events">The latest in appservice proposals: Synthetic events</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, I've been let loose on more spec things: This time I'm looking at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">synthetic events</a>. The goal with this proposal is to give appservices more visibility over the innards and actions of a homeserver. When a user registers, we want an appservice to know (perhaps to send them a little greeting, or to provision some resources) or perhaps you want to clear up bridge resources when the user deactivates their account.</p>
<p>The hope with this proposal is that it's going to set the foundations for services to be able to hook into and provide richer functionality based upon user actions outside of rooms. It might sound a little dry right now, but eventually I'm hoping this can be extended in lots of ways and potentially do away with per-implementation modules, instead writing services that work with all homeservers.</p>
<p>Please give the proposal some love/feedback :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When asked if that was a specification change he drafted because of limitations faced when trying to implement a bridge, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, so it's something I've been plotting for a while, but internally we wanted the ability to &quot;act&quot; based upon signups to a homeserver i.e. sending a welcome. In the past this has been implemented client-side in Element, but that has obvious caveats.</p>
<p>The traditional response has usually been to write a Synapse module, but I wanted to do something that could be used on other homeserver implementations and also not have to have it co-located with the homeserver, so the natural home for this kind of logic was appservices. </p>
<p>There are other things there too like logouts / deactivations which are good for erasing data on a service too. Generally I'm hoping it can be extended further once it's stable, for other use cases too</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3401">MSC3401</a> (Native Group Voip Signalling) has been receiving positive feedback over the course of the week. The MSC spells out how one would go about implementing native, decentralised group voice and video calls over Matrix without the need for a third-party service. This is the next step forward after the full-mesh group signalling work, as demoed in previous editions of TWIM, lands. Quite exciting stuff!</p>
<p>Otherwise there was another Spec Core Team retro this week. Discussion focused mainly on how to handle event types that not every implementation using Matrix may need (think pinned messages and how that might not be very useful for IoT networks...). Watch this space!</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2666">MSC2666: Get rooms in common with another user</a>!</p>
<p>This is actually already implemented and enabled by default in Synapse, believe it or not. But no clients have support for it yet (there is an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/4897">outstanding matrix-react-sdk PR</a>...).</p>
<p>This is a pretty cool feature in my opinion, any client want to be the first?</p>

<p>This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/09/21/synapse-1-43-0-released">released Synapse 1.43</a>! This mainly contains internal changes, including those in preparation for Spaces leaving beta, but it's worth calling out that this version of Synapse now uses the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: room version capabilities</a> API to ask clients to prefer <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">room version 9</a> when creating restricted rooms.</p>
<p>Support for room version 9 was introduced in Synapse 1.42, so we'd strongly encourage administrators to upgrade.</p>
<p>Perhaps more notably for Synapse developers, we've spent quite a lot of time over the past few weeks improving the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/">SyTest</a> suite of integration tests. Several of the tests had race conditions which would cause them to occasionally fail when testing a multi-worker deployment of Synapse. These flakey tests have plagued our continuous integration pipelines, and are finally being fixed.</p>
<p>The long term plan is still to transition to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a> (written in Go) and away from SyTest (written in Perl), but we still need to ensure that SyTest is reliable in the meantime.</p>

<p>Even with that update (literally the most requested thing, was in every third order we got), provided hosting considered as your own server, the only difference that you don't pay hosting provider directly, but through us. So, you get root access to the server and we treat it as any other customer's infrastructure</p>

<p>What improvements did hifi bring to the formatting you may ask? I asked, and hifi answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the fallbacks are inconsistent and usually are markdown which is a lie üòÖ
replies and mentions are completely all over the place in the fallback in addition to being markdown 
the unformatted html is now something in between and doesn't do code blocks at all because those ticks are just noise on irc 
it tries to look like more that you pasted long text rather than sending markdown </p>

<li>We‚Äôre testing &amp; polishing Spaces, releasing them out of beta in the upcoming release cycle next week!</li>
<li>On iOS
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre anticipating some performance issues on a very small number of accounts which participate in a very large number of rooms. After trying the next release, if this affects you, please let us know as it‚Äôll help inform whether we cut an off-cycle hotfix or prep changes for the next release.</li>
<li>iOS doesn‚Äôt support pagination in the Space Summary API yet, so will only return the first 50 rooms in large Spaces when browsing. Support for this is planned for the following release.</li>

<h3 id="spec">Spec</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3394">MSC3394: New auth rule that only allows someone to post a message in relation to another message</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs are in FCP.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>If MSC2918 above is giving you feelings of d√©j√† vu, don't worry. It already had FCP proposed, but due to a resolved concern being incorrectly processed by mscbot on github, a new FCP proposal was carried out.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> (Polls - mk II) receive a fair amount of attention this week. It implements inline polls via a new <code>m.poll</code> type and makes use of the concept of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">extensible events</a>. Do check it out if you're interested in voting through means other than message reactions!</p>
<p>Otherwise Alexandre Franke and myself will be looking at cleaning up the CI of the matrix-org/matrix-doc repo next week, as well as continue to move the infrastructure for the new spec release forwards.</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1235">MSC1235: Proposal for Calendar Events</a>.</p>
<p>This one is entirely new to me, and has some slight overlap with some work for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2762">MSC2762: Allowing widgets to send/receive events</a>, where we were thinking about how a widget could act as a calendar using Matrix rooms and events as a calendar backend.</p>

<p>The Synapse team is busy gearing up for 1.43.0 next week, which will make room version 9 the default for newly created <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>We've also been doing quite a lot of work on Sydent. Notably, last week's 2.4.0 release introduced a few regressions which have been resolved in subsequent point releases. The one-shot <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/v2.4.3/docs/casefold_migration.md">case folding migration script</a> for Sydent is still performing unexpectedly slowly; look for that to be resolved soon.</p>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, now is a good time to ensure you're ready for the deprecation of PostgreSQL 9.6 (November) and Python 3.6 (December). Do you have plans to upgrade to Pg 10 and Py 3.7 or newer? If not, there's no time like the present! üóì</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest 2021</a> is less than two weeks away! Many Matrix projects intend to participate, including Synapse.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko got a lot more colorful this week. red_sky (nheko.im) and LorenDB finished up the jdenticon support. This means instead of the first character of a users display name, you now have the option to see a colorful avatar for users without an explicit avatar. You may have seen something similar on Github and other platforms. Currently this needs the <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/qt-jdenticon">qt-jdenticon</a> plugin, which is a bit troublesome to install correctly, but we should improve that in the near future.</p>
<p>Prezu added a homeserver entry field to the room directory, making it much more useful (no history yet though). Thulinma added a /goto command to navigate to specific events or room and fixed scrolling to a specific event (in the past it only approximately scrolled to the right location). Symphorien added the Alt+A shortcut to navigate between rooms with active mentions and notifications. Additionally Priit completed the Estonian translation.</p>
<p>Additionally we released a security fix on Monday (together with a few other clients). We only released a fix for the master branch in Nheko instead of also the latest stable release. This confused a few people, but I hope my explanations made sense. The gist of it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the master branch the local homeserver admin could force Nheko to forget which identity keys it saw for a user and as such insert a new device with the same device id, but attacker controlled identity keys and request old encryption keys from Nheko. In Nheko's case we had some protections against that, but if the server sent a device_list.left event for that user, Nheko would delete those protections. From our understanding this could not be abused over federation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 0.8.2 this can also be abused, but 0.8.2 does not implement key sharing completely. It can only forward the currently in use encryption key, not historical ones. As such the impact in our opinion was too limited to release a security fix. 0.8.2 does not allow you to send encrypted messages only to verified devices as such the homeserver admin could always insert just a different device to get access to new encrypted messages. Because of that we have a big warning in the README and when enabling encryption in 0.8.2, that one should not rely on the security of the E2EE implementation in it. We are aiming to have stable and secure E2EE in the next release (and so far it is looking good), but if you are using 0.8.2 I can only repeat, that it won't protect you from an attacker even without the disclosed security issue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this clears up some of the confusion. Feel free to visit us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> and tell me, that I am wrong.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca">uhoreg</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week saw two releases of libolm, a library that implements olm, megolm, and some other Matrix-related encryption functions.  The main changes in version 3.2.5 are new functions for getting error codes rather than error strings so that implementations don't need to rely on string parsing to decode errors, and added support for fallback keys in the Android and iOS bindings.  There were also improvements in error handling in the  unpickling functions, and the shared library no longer exports certain private symbols, which caused problems when those same symbols were exported by other libraries.  The initial implementation of this last change caused build failures in some environments, so version 3.2.6 was released to fix this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am super happy to finally give you another update on TheBoard, due to holidays during the last weeks I had less time to work on TheBoard. But now there still accumulated enough changes for a little Update:</p>
<p>I experimented what technologies I could use for the still required GUI elements. A new User List was implemented using Vue.js. Vue seemed to be a little overkill for the kind of GUI required in the case of TheBoard. So I re-implemented the user list with react-no-js.
I am happy with <strong>react-no-js</strong> and it is used for a <strong>user list plus a tool settings menu</strong> on the right hand side of the canvas.</p>
<p>The tool panel in particular opens up a lot of possibilities. The eraser already makes use of it by giving the option to only delete specific item types (Image, stroke or text). This can be very handy if you want to delete strokes drawn on top of an image without deleting the image as well. What can be deleted is highlighted by a new <strong>filter system</strong> which allows to make any modification to objects selected by a filter function (see the attached image)</p>
<p>Other small changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Animated camera movement (for a upcoming &quot;follow other user&quot; feature) currently used for the Go Home Button</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opening a board now loads at the last edited location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The touchscreen navigation (zoom/pan) was re-implemented and should now work much better</p>

<p>The Board is very exciting! I could see in <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard#planned-use-cases">the planned use cases</a> that Timo already intends to make a widget out of it. It would be very useful for real-time collaboration, but that's not all! When asked if a standalone app will come, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo</a> confirmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed. I wasn't thinking about a builtin home-server yet. But a standalone app is still planned because I want the app to be able to manage different boards. Therefore I need to be able to control room creation and listing rooms. It should basically feel like onenote if you intend to use it like that.</p>

The game is a text-based sandbox multiplayer browser game that I (Maze) have been building for the past 3 years. Built from nothing, no game engine. It generates an infinite procedural terrain to venture in. The integrated chatbox is nothing special but it's really nice to have it bridged to Matrix now, it's less lonely when playing alone. The appservice bridge creates users matching player name and color. Display names from Matrix are presented in the same color as in Element.</p>
