<p>I had the chance to have Ryan with me for a special edition of Open Tech Will Save Us on Thunderbird to celebrate their 102 release, which includes Matrix support for the first time in a stable release.</p>
<p>We covered many interesting topics, such as the importance of specifying the expected behaviour of clients and servers in a protocol to deliver the best experience to end users (wink, wink, reminds you of something?), why Thunderbird was more dormant and is now vibrant as ever, what they plan for the future. I had good fun and I hope attendees did too! Next episode is going to be at the end of July, but you can already join the

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2974">MSC2974: Widgets: Capabilities re-exchange</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC is a relatively simple it. Currently widgets are only allowed to specify their capabilities (what the widget is allowed to do, like reading the logged-in user's display name) when the widget is loaded. This MSC attempts to allow that model to be extended to let widgets ask for additional (or fewer) permissions over time.</p>
<p>I can't help but be reminded of the shift in permissions on iOS and Android here in how they shifted from &quot;ask all permissions up front&quot; to &quot;ask for permission for each thing when it's used in the app&quot; :)</p>
<p>Check it out if widgets are your thing!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.9">Dendrite 0.8.9</a> which contains a number of improvements around backfilling room history, amongst other things.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Incoming device list updates over federation are now queued in JetStream for processing so that they will no longer block incoming federation transactions and should never end up dropped, which will hopefully help E2EE reliability</li>
<li>The <code>/context</code> endpoint now returns <code>&quot;start&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;end&quot;</code> parameters to allow pagination from a context call</li>
<li>The <code>/messages</code> endpoint will no longer return <code>&quot;end&quot;</code> when there are no more messages remaining</li>
<li>Deactivated user accounts will now leave all rooms automatically</li>
<li>New admin endpoint <code>/_dendrite/admin/evacuateUser/{userID}</code> has been added for forcing a local user to leave all joined rooms</li>
<li>Dendrite will now automatically attempt to raise the file descriptor limit at startup if it is too low</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>A rare crash when retrieving remote device lists has been fixed</li>
<li>Fixes a bug where events were not redacted properly over federation</li>
<li>The <code>/invite</code> endpoints will now return an error instead of silently proceeding if the user ID is obviously malformed</li>
</ul>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever noticed that some people are just plain @*%&amp;!¬ß%&quot;+? Well, to quickly deal with what they wrote, Nheko now has a <code>/redact @userid:server.name</code> command, so you can redact everything they wrote (as long as it is in the currently cached section of the timeline). Note that you will run into rate limits when using that and Nheko is not yet applying an appropriate backoff in that case.</p>
<p>Similarly, q234rty fixed a lot of cases where icons in Nheko were either blurry or the wrong size. We fixed a few crashes, the room list should now not sometimes store the wrong order of rooms, brausepulver made large avatars cropped locally (since servers don't guarantee any size over 96x96 when cropped and synapse doesn't properly save the full image size in that case) and added a menu entry to copy a roomlink. You can also now define new powerlevels for users instead of using the existing levels in the room and Jason fixed some compiler warnings when a private member struct doesn't have an explicit constructor on some compilers. Nheko also now downloads the full online key backup when you explicitly toggle the switch.</p>
<p>A more noticeable topic might be, that Nheko now requires servers which support the v1.1 API or later and will not allow you to login or register otherwise. At the same time we also enabled support for the shiny and new knock_restricted rule and all remaining groups code was removed (you know, the feature from before spaces were cool).</p>
<p>I also updated Nheko on my work laptop now and since I was quite surprised by how fast it starts now (while my room count is over 900 !), I attached a video of that below for your pleasure.</p>

<p>Because sometimes you just have to do something else and it might be interesting to some people:</p>
<ul>
<li>I fixed calls not working when trying to use Element Web with a Conduit server: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/8931</li>
<li>I fixed Element Android still using the unstable endpoint (i.e. the one from the MSC, that proposed it) to list aliases: https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/6288</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes fixing something that annoys you isn't even that hard, and since it annoys you, you have some motivation to fix it. I call this Anger Driven Development (ADD). If you have some things that annoy you, I encourage to try fixing them for a bit. It might help out some other people too. If that makes you want to contribute to Nheko, don't hesitate to join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> and ask me to help you out with whatever fix you are trying to contribute.</p>
<p>This time I just decided to clean out some issues, that came up in the Conduit development channel and that weren't fixed yet. Turns out it was just a few lines to change and it hopefully makes the Matrix experience better for everyone in  the long run. The changes were also quickly reviewed and are merged now. Do you have any such little fixes that no one hears about, but you are proud of them? Please post about them, I'd love to see them!</p>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the last few weeks, a significant push on rust-crypto-support for Nodejs has taken place, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/803">this PR</a>. Major parts are available, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/763">infrastructure to create releases ready</a>, however, a pretty rare huge memory allocation that causes a crash in Nodejs on the CI has blocked progress of the team recently. Debugging this <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/804">costs a lot of time and it is yet unclear</a>, how much of a problem this really is (as the cause stays mysterious), however it has also been seen in the wild on Windows now-- a concerning development.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean, there isn't any development going on. Thanks to the active community around the project, we now have a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/560">fix to prevent us from processing the same transaction twice</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/785">a method to create permalinks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/771">you can now verify sessions through FFI</a> as well as use the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/739">Client Builder via FFI</a>.

<p>Matrix SDK written in pure Dart and maintained by <a href="https://famedly.com/">Famedly</a>.</p>

<p>Dart Matrix SDK: Version 0.10.2</p>
<p>This week, the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.10.2">version 0.10.2</a>. In this version, we added experimental support for native group call signaling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401">MSC3401</a>. We have been playing with it in our internal clients, and we have to say that we are pretty happy with the result! There are still some bugs, as sometimes a new call is creating instead of joining the existing one. But it's looking great!</p>
<p>We also took the opportunity to fix some bugs in call handling. Now the ringtone is properly properly when rejecting a call. Also, when opening the client, we don't trigger a call event anymore if the call end event is in the sync response.</p>
<p>We also did some refactoring for the sync handler, reducing the usage of JSON objects and adding some try catch to handle issues when handling event room updates. We switched to custom CachedStreamController so even if the stream has already been listened to, you can still access the last sent value.</p>
<p>Finally, when sending messages when under unreliable connection, messages could be sent out of order. This is now fixed thanks to the implementation of a message sending queue.</p>
<p>See you next time ;)</p>

<p>Two is better than one! Ascurius joined the <code>synadm</code> team and helps maintain the github repo, code new features and support users on github and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at">#synadm:peek-a-boo.at</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to all <code>synadm</code> users, feature requesters and contributors, issue submitters and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at">#synadm:peek-a-boo.at</a> members. It's fun to maintain a project and see its community grow each day!</p>
<p>Some features from the latest releases we'd like to highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>The local part of an MXID can now be used as the &lt;user_id&gt; argument in various <code>synadm</code> commands. Of course, there is still the possibility to use the full MXID if desired.</li>
<li>We have added a shadow-ban command so that admins now can more easily deal with abusive users: <code>synadm room shadow-ban</code></li>
<li>The room state API is now supported, try <code>synadm room state</code></li>
<li>And with the help of that API we created a command to easily generate a list of rooms and corresponding admins and mods: <code>synadm room power-levels</code></li>
<li>The <code>synadm room search</code> command was adapted to make better use of current Synapse versions possibilities.</li>
<li>Documentation chapter around using synadm together with Synapse instances deployed with matrix-docker-ansible-deploy.</li>
<li>The magic around &quot;retrieval of the own homeserver name&quot; got a massive overhaul. This affects several <code>user</code> and <code>media</code> subcommands.</li>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3834">MSC3834: Opportunistic user key pinning (TOFU)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3837">MSC3837: Cascading profile tags for push rules</a></li>

<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The big news from the spec <del>this</del> last week is the release of Matrix v1.3 üéâ (read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release">blog post</a> if you haven't already)! Roughly three months since the release of Matrix v1.2, this release brings improvements such as knocking on rooms, room version 10, reduced metadata in encrypted messages and the first pieces of aggregations finally landing in the spec proper. And more! See the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release">blog post</a> for the full changelog.</p>
<p>Most of the Spec Core Team has been away this week, thus there has not been much moving forwards. But we do have two new MSCs from <a href="https://github.com/duxovni">@duxovni</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Johennes">@Johennes</a>, which you can view above.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3077">MSC3077: Support for multi-stream VoIP</a> by <a href="https://github.com/SimonBrandner">@SimonBrandner</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC allows for differentiating between different incoming streams of media coming from a single user by adding a <code>sdp_stream_metadata</code> dictionary to Voice over IP (VoIP)-related events. This is a relatively simply addition with useful functionality, such as allowing a single user to share both their camera feed and screen share at the same time!</p>
<p>Check it out if that kind of stuff interests you!</p>

<p>The release date for Matrix v1.3 has been set in stone for Thursday, June 16th 2022! Expect a blog post on the day detailing all of the new additions.</p>
<p>The bot that posts MSC updates in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> and elsewhere has been switched from @mscbot:amorgan.xyz to @mscbot:matrix.org. The backend of the bot uses https://github.com/Informo/specs-bot/.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2000">MSC2000: Server-side password policies</a>!</p>
<p>This is a proposal that adds a mechanism for homeserver administrators to define a password policy for users. This policy can decide rules such as a minimum password length, whether a digit is required, etc. This policy can be enforced by the homeserver when a user registers an account or changes their account password and is communicated to the client so that it can also be enforced locally.</p>
<p>Astute readers will possibly note that authentication in Matrix will eventually be replaced by OAuth2 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2964">MSC2964</a>). This will move operations like password policy enforcement from the homeserver to a separate authentication service, essentially removing the need to reinvent-the-wheel in a homeserver.</p>
<p>Registration, login and managing passwords and connected third-party IDs is often a complex part of a Matrix homeserver. Moving these out to a separate authentication service will both unlock new features (log in with Matrix!) as well as reduce the resources required to implement a Matrix homeserver.</p>

<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.8">Dendrite 0.8.8</a>, which contains the following improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of state resolution has been increased significantly for larger rooms</li>
<li>A number of changes have been made to rate limiting:
<ul>
<li>Logged in users will now be rate-limited on a per-session basis rather than by remote IP</li>
<li>Rate limiting no longer applies to admin or appservice users</li>
<li>It is now possible to configure additional users that are exempt from rate limiting using the <code>exempt_user_ids</code> option in the <code>rate_limiting</code> section of the Dendrite config</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Setting state is now idempotent via the client API state endpoints</li>
<li>Room upgrades now properly propagate tombstone events to remote servers</li>
<li>Room upgrades will no longer send tombstone events if creating the upgraded room fails</li>
<li>A crash has been fixed when evaluating restricted room joins</li>

<p>FluffyChat 1.5.0 goes Material You</p>
<p>FluffyChat 1.5.0 has been released and will soon be in all stores. This release comes with a bunch of bugfixes and introduces the first iteration of a Material You based design. We also try to support Android 12 accent colors (while this does not seem to work yet). On other platforms, our own purple shape will stay the default.</p>
<p>I like the new Material You design while we needed to tweak it at some points. Also the dropdown menu misses some elevation but this is a known issue in the Flutter repo which will be fixed soon.</p>
<p>This is also the first build with Flutter 3 which should improve the performance a little bit. Unfortunately it brings some regressions. We are forced to ship a little bug with it: Sharing on iPads seems to be broken. I'm very unhappy with this situation but otherwise we would have ended up in different releases for different platforms. As there afaik are not that many iPad users out there, we decided to live with this compromise and ship a bugfix release asap.</p>
<p>Yeah... Flutter has a lot of pros but also a lot of cons. Every new release of this framework leads to the fear of new regressions. Shipping a new major release where basic stuff like &quot;Sharing&quot; is just broken, is totally stupid... but that's the decision of Google. :-P</p>
<p>We didn't want to wait to ship the new design and also we needed a new release to come back to F-Droid where FluffyChat wasn't available in the last weeks because of a ProGuard problem, which should be fixed now.</p>

<p>This week we landed Element Call beta 2 (https://call.element.io) including a bunch of nice updates. First of all, everything is now end-to-end encrypted by default: not only the WebRTC streams but also the matrix signaling (It was consciously disabled in beta 1 for debugging purposes). Moreover, we have experimental support for spatial audio rendering. Give it a try ‚Äî you can find it in the settings section. It's a lot of fun to play with and really supports immersion during a video call. This release also introduces a whole new experimental way of communicating: Walkie-talkie mode. In that mode, videos are disabled, and everyone is muted by default. To speak, press the ‚Äòpush-to-talk‚Äô (PTT) button ‚Äî takes me back to my childhood üôÇ</p>

<p>We also did some housekeeping and renamed some methods and getter to make them explicit. For example, the <code>futureSender</code> getter is now an asynchronous method called <code>fetchEventSender()</code> to make it clear that calling this function may trigger an API call.</p>

<h2 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h2>
<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we've been working on getting Matrix 1.3 out the door and generally working towards a better process for handling releases alongside critical proposals for the protocol. The goal is to be able to ship these major features while reducing the risk of a release falling behind. Watch this space for more details as this should result in MSCs getting through the process a little bit quicker.</p>
<p>For Matrix 1.3, we're targeting <strong>Thursday, June 16th, 2022</strong> as our release date, though this comes with a small asterisk: we're looking to land quite a lot of stuff so might have to adjust the date once more as needed. We do feel reasonably confident in the date though - watch for blog posts titled Matrix 1.3 in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>The script has chosen <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2846">MSC2846 - Decentralizing media through CIDs</a> as your random MSC this week. The MSC raises an interesting question about how to make media more akin to events in Matrix. If you're interested in this area, take a read of it and the related MSCs.</p>

<p>Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've had breakthroughs this week on implementing a native Matrix SFU (selective forwarding unit) which speaks <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401">MSC3401</a>, thanks to <a href="https://siobud.com/">Sean DuBois</a> - all round WebRTC superstar, project lead for the <a href="https://github.com/pion/webrtc">Pion</a> WebRTC implementation for Go, and author of <a href="https://webrtcforthecurious.com/">WebRTC for the curious</a>.</p>
<p>Sean generously contributed an initial proof of concept to show how you'd build an MSC3401 SFU using Pion at https://github.com/matrix-org/sfu-to-sfu - which (I think?) is the first time that the first implementation of a major core MSC has been contributed from outside the core team.  Huge thanks to Sean to setting the ball going on this - the current PoC demonstrates not just SFU capability but also the decentralised cascading architecture which makes MSC3401 unique. The initial PoC speaks a 'test jig' version of MSC3401 hooked up to a simple web client for experimentation, but Matthew's now experimenting with adding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sfu-to-sfu/pull/10">genuine Matrix support</a> to it via mautrix-go, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/2423">hooking up Element Call</a> to speak to it.</p>
<p>Adding SFU support to Element Call will mean that we can support more than ~7 simultaneous calls - and with MSC3401-style decentralised cascading, we should be able to support hundreds or even thousands. There's lots of work remaining here, but the ball is now rolling.  For more info about SFUs and MSC3401, check out Matthew's <a href="https://2021.commcon.xyz/talks/extending-matrix-s-e2ee-calls-to-multiparty">CommCon 2021 talk</a> (which was what prompted Sean's implementation work here!)</p>
<p>Separately, we've been running Element Call on staging with E2EE enabled for the last few weeks, and should be releasing the first major Element Call update next week.  And once SFUs land, then Element Call can exit beta - watch out Zoom!</p>

<p>Dart Matrix SDK : Version 0.9.9</p>
<p>This week, the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.9.9">version 0.9.9</a>. In this new version, we added a search function to allow searching for an event in database and on server through several requests to the <code>/messages</code> endpoint.</p>
<p>There was also some work on updating the image size when generating thumbnail, which allow saving a bit of calculation when sending events. If using a custom resizer make sure to update the resize response as <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/company/frontend/famedlysdk/-/snippets/2342277">here</a>.</p>
<p>We also did some refactor with the event sender getter. The getter result is now a future to allow requesting the member event to the server if we cannot find it in memory, to help fix the issue when the user was not found in memory.</p>
<p>Finally, a quick helper function (<code>client.waitForSync</code>) was added. It allows you to wait for a room to appear in (left, join, invited) section of the sync response.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Some new MSCs popping up this week around widgets, room types, fixing notifications with threads and room version 11! Though note that the last one currently serves as a means for the Spec Core Team to publicly track what should be included in room version 11, and is by no means is its content considered final.</p>
<p>The Spec Core Team are currently focused on room version 10 and getting Matrix v1.3 out the door soon. There's also been some discussion on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676: Message editing</a> this week, with the intention of finally landing that in the spec. Thanks to richvdh for driving the charge there.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1902">MSC1902: Split the media repo into s2s and c2s parts</a>!</p>
<p>Homeservers currently make use of Client Server Media APIs to pull media from other homeservers over federation. This has worked for a long time, but is a bit of a confusing blur of the lines between client&lt;-&gt;server and server&lt;-&gt;server traffic. It also makes it difficult to require different authentication rules for clients versus servers.</p>
<p>This MSC aims to help clean that up. Take a look if you're interested!

<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week's <code>testing</code> updates are now in <code>master</code>!</p>
<p>Also included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better error handling:</strong> if the backend hits an error that causes your connection to KT chats to be dropped, the bridge should notify you about it (not that it should ever happen in the first place, but you never know!)</li>
<li><strong>Better logging:</strong> the Node module can be configured to print the arguments of RPC commands received from / sent to the Python module.  The example Node config includes a default set that should be helpful for general debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Room metadata bridging:</strong> setting an Open Chat title &amp; topic from Matrix should work now!
<ul>
<li>Setting the title of a Direct Chat should work too, but topics remain unbridged (since KT Direct Chats don't have topics/descriptions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Defensive error handling:</strong> Attempts to add a non-friend user to a DM will be refused by the bridge, since KT only allows Direct Chats between friends
<ul>
<li>KT does allow &quot;1:1 Open Chats&quot; between non-friends, but those aren't bridged yet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, <code>testing</code> adds support for joining KakaoTalk rooms from Matrix, either by joining an existing portal or providing an Open Chat URL to the bot with a <code>join</code> command. ...However, I've been unable to test this, since KT is stingy about whom it allows to join Open Chats!  So please give this a try if you can.</p>
<p>In other news, this bridge is now listed on <a href="https://matrix.org/bridges/#kakaotalk">Matrix.org</a>! ü•≥  Thanks Thib !</p>
<p>Also, for the time being, I will be taking a hiatus from this bridge &amp; the LINE bridge, as I'll be quite occupied for the foreseeable future on account of having joined Element ü§©!!  (The bridges aren't paused forever--I just have to work out the details of their future before making any promises I can't keep üôÇ)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.13.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>Read default port and listen address from config url (@BtbN)</li>
<li>Improvements to pillifying IRC nicks, again</li>
<li>Fixes for AUTOQUERY not always working correctly</li>
<li>Allow anyone to use STATUS command to get their own status</li>
<li>Filter control characters only for plumbs so people can send garbage to IRC if they wish from Matrix</li>
<li>Support for converting IRC color codes to Matrix (@tjaderxyz)</li>
<li>Fixed compose docker Synapse configuration for registration</li>
<li>Improved Python 3.10 compatibliy (@BtbN)</li>
<li>Hidden room to hide joins using restricted rooms join rule (@BtbN)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some cool stuff this time around! Aside from many bug fixes this release has two great new features: IRC message colors and hiding invites from channels.</p>
<p>IRC colors are enabled by default and are rendered how your Matrix client sees fit. They can be disabled per network if needed.</p>
<p>Hiding joins works with room v9 restricted join rules feture to allow IRC ghosts to join rooms without an invite from the bridge bot first. This clears some clutter and may even make joining a bit faster in the long run - we will see. This feature is disabled by default and needs to be enabled by the bridge administrator as it is consiered a &quot;labs&quot; feature for now.</p>
<p>Go and get a Dell from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Post release (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0">we have release 0.5.0 last week</a>) the main focus was on minor fixes and bigger features we had pending but didn't want to merge before. Aside from a few documentation and other minor fixes - among others switching to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/677">resolver v2</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/686">more accurate <code>power_level</code> calculation</a> - the biggest <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/571">merge was around the FFI interface for Apple (iOS and Mac)</a>, which we have initial support for now üéâ.</p>
<p>The main work is currently happening behind the scenes, while we prepare for the upcoming tasks - like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/675">WASM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/699">NodeJS support</a> for the crypto-crate and work on UniFFI. We are also hardening our processes for improved security and risk management around our code base, dependencies and the potential to ship binaries.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The Spec Core Team has decided to not include <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> (threading via <code>m.thread</code> relations) specifically in the upcoming Matrix v1.3 release. We previously stated that it would be in v1.3, but there's a few unproven MSCs (namely <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773">MSC3773</a> (notifications for threads)) which make it feel improper to put threads into the spec at this stage. We're aiming for a future (very near) spec release to contain threads, assuming we can get enough of the feature landed. This is a very similar approach to what we did with Spaces: while the core feature existed as FCP-concluded for a while, we wanted to give some other MSCs a chance to land before writing it up formally.</p>
<p>As a follow-on from this, any implementations that are currently assuming &quot;v1.3&quot; spec support translates to threading support should note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients which are pre-emptively checking for v1.3 in <code>/versions</code> should stop doing that. Look for <code>org.matrix.msc3440.stable</code> as an &quot;unstable&quot; feature flag instead.</li>
<li>Servers which offer MSC3440's behaviour should expose it on stable endpoints and expose <code>org.matrix.msc3440.stable</code> for clients to detect.</li>
<li>Optionally, clients and servers can drop support for the <code>org.matrix.msc3440</code> (truly unstable) flag, given clients &amp; servers should have already upgraded.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the spec level, we'll still be writing up MSC3440's dependencies (aggregations and friends), but will notably be missing MSC3440 specifically in v1.3. If folks can update their clients urgently, it would be massively appreciated!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2596">MSC2596: Proposal to always allow rescinding invites</a>!</p>
<p>A simple change to the auth rules to help prevent an edge case where one is able to invite a user, but not disinvite them as the latter requires a separate permission. The MSC attempts to solve this by always allowing the cancellation of invitations you've sent.</p>
<p>A small MSC, but one with some open threads still. Perhaps a good opportunity to go in and clean it up!</p>

<p>This week we've actually made two releases ‚Äî <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.4">Dendrite 0.8.4</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.5">Dendrite 0.8.5</a> ‚Äî which are both primarily targeting performance and bug fixes.</p>
<p>We've also released our new living documentation, which is available at https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/, which features new installation instructions and documents that will be helpful to Dendrite server administrators. We will be writing more documentation and expanding this over time.</p>
<p>Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.8.2</li>
<li>Monolith deployments will no longer panic at startup if given a config file that does not include the <code>internal_api</code> and <code>external_api</code> options</li>
<li>State resolution v2 now correctly identifies other events related to power events, which should fix some event auth issues</li>
<li>The latest events updater will no longer implicitly trust the new forward extremities when calculating the current room state, which may help to avoid some state resets</li>
<li>The one-time key count is now correctly returned in <code>/sync</code> even if the request otherwise timed out, which should reduce the chance that unnecessary one-time keys will be uploaded by clients</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool should now work properly when the database is configured using the global connection pool</li>
<li>Fixes a regression introduced in the previous version where appservices, push and phone-home statistics would not work over plain HTTP</li>
<li>Adds missing indexes to the sync API output events table, which should significantly improve <code>/sync</code> performance and reduce database CPU usage</li>
<li>Building Dendrite with the <code>bimg</code> thumbnailer should now work again (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/database64128">database64128</a>)</li>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rust Matrix team is very excited to announce the next major release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0"><strong>Matrix SDK 0.5 &quot;stores and native crypto&quot;</strong></a>, now available for everyone by adding <code>matrix-sdk  = &quot;0.5.0&quot;</code> to their dependencies in their <code>Cargo.toml</code>. This first major release in about 8 months brings significant changes many have been waiting for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better, safer, native-er crypto</strong>: matrix-sdk 0.5 ditches libolm in favor of Vodozemac, the completely fresh rust-native re-implementation of the crypto crate. It has also been audited, the report of which is scheduled to be released soon.</li>
<li><strong>Store revamp</strong>: the entire cache storage infrastructure for crypto and state has been restructured to allow for full plug-ability, with even the two default supported backends, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-sled">sled</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-indexeddb">indexeddb</a> both being separate crates now. And as a matter of fact, a community-driven <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-sql">sql implementation has already been published as beta</a> (with postgres and sqlite support) by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lotte:chir.rs">charlotte ü¶ù</a>.</li>
<li><strong>WebAssembly</strong>; both of these changes also allow us to finally make WASM a Tier 1 supported target for the SDK. Not only does it build and even use the browser native indexeddb for permanent storage, we also have CI tests ensuring nothing will break this support going forward.</li>
<li><strong>Features, Features and Process</strong>: there's plenty more features and bug fixes in this release, e.g. native thumbnail generation support, as well as changes on our processes going forward.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Sidenote</em>: If you want to contribute, or just learn Rust by actually doing it, we recommend taking <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">a look team at the <code>help wanted</code> issues</a> in our repo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you use Matrix with the Signal bridge (or any bridge) with relay mode
enabled, your guests have probably experienced the confusion where they don't know who else (on Matrix) is in the chat as only Matrix can double-puppet.</p>
<p>When this bot is added to a Matrix room, it will announce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who the room members are when a new Signal user joins;</li>
<li>When a Matrix user joins or leaves, who that Matrix user was.</li>
</ul>
<p>I built it just this afternoon using the excellent <code>matrix-bot-sdk</code>, but it's in Typescript and has plentyful unit tests!</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Wowza, that's a lot of new MSCs!&quot; I hear you say. This is actually a listing of the last 3 weeks, as it was pointed out to me that the last 3 editions of TWIM have not all features an MSC status update - which means some MSCs may not have necessary made it into the limelight.</p>
<p>As such, here's those from this past week, as well as the ones that were missed!</p>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>It's that time of the year again - a new Spec release is on the horizon! Matrix v1.3 is expected to land <em>sometime this month</em>, and will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> (threads) + related MSCs</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3787">MSC3787</a> (knock+restricted join rules)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3604">MSC3604</a> (room version 10)</li>
<li>Any other MSCs which have so far been accepted, but not yet made it into the spec.</li>
</ul>
<p>MSCs which land between now and v1.3 might get incorporated if easy enough, though chances are they'll slip to v1.4 (expected next quarter).</p>
<p>On top of that, the other bit of news is that the <code>proposal-in-review</code> label has now been removed from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals">matrix-spec-proposals</a> repo and thus all MSCs. This doesn't mean your MSC is no longer in review! We simply found the label redundant along with the other labels in the process (it was attached to all MSCs which hadn't been accepted/merged yet, which means very little) and thus we decided to remove it to reduce noise.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2881">MSC2881: Message Attachments</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC has actually been potentially(?) superseded by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3382">MSC3382</a>. In short, both look to provide a solution to the problem of attaching (multiple!) images to messages, such that clients can display an album of images in a single event in the timeline.</p>
<p>Check it out if you're interested in introducing such a feature!</p>

<ul>
<li>Our Docker images and Debian packages are now built from a dependency lockfile courtesy of Poetry. Props to David for leading the charge on this multi-week epic.</li>
<li>An experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3383">MSC3383</a> has been contributed by @Bubu and @jcgruenhage at Famedly, which will help with proxying federation traffic, amongst other uses.</li>
<li>An experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2815">MSC2815</a> has been merged, which allows room moderators to view redact event content for the purposes of moderation. This was contributed by @tulir at Beeper.</li>
<li>Device list updates are now asynchronous thanks to Erik, leading to much faster login times for accounts in big rooms.</li>
<li>plus many other bug fixes and improvements!</li>
</ul>
<p>We also released a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.1">v1.58.1</a> patch shortly afterwards to address an issue with the Debian packages on some configurations. Server admins not using the Matrix.org Debian packages do not need to install this patch release.</p>
<p>Otherwise, ongoing work from the core team continues with Sean and Rich working on faster room join performance, Olivier pushing forwards on testing Synapse with workers in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/">Complement</a>, while Erik has been tackling general performance work.</p>

<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week brings another round of big improvements &amp; new features!</p>
<p>Features &amp; fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes to Docker support &amp; the documentation for setting it up</li>
<li>Changes to the login flow
<ul>
<li>The bridge can now be configured to enforce a login flow that more closely matches the official KakaoTalk desktop client's, and to better warn you when a new login will kick out another one of your KT sessions.  This will hopefully prevent the bridge from getting KT accounts banned!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Backfilling for KT-&gt;Matrix read receipts</li>
<li>Commands for adding/removing KakaoTalk friends</li>
<li>Commands to edit your KakaoTalk ID &amp; mark it as shared or hidden</li>
<li>Matrix-&gt;KT DM creation, i.e. the ability to create a new DM with a KakaoTalk user from within Matrix
<ul>
<li>This might fail on the first attempt at creating a DM.  If it does, try re-inviting the KakaoTalk puppet to the room.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many stability &amp; correctness improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>With the combination of friends list curation &amp; DM creation support, it should now be possible to connect with KT contacts entirely from Matrix!  Simply add some friends, list them, and invite a listed friend to a 1:1 room!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone on Twitter complained that no chat client works like MSN anymore, where you could have separate windows for each chat. So for MSN compatibility we added that. (It is a bit experimental still, expect some stuff to not work or crash)</p>
<p>Bulbu also went through a lot of effort to add a second set of emoji shortcodes to Nheko. Those should be more familiar to people coming from other platforms or clients while the old shortcodes are available still as well. We also saw a lot of progress on the Finnish, Chinese, Indonesian and Russian translations, animated images should work properly in the image viewer again, buttons for opening the member list are now clearly marked with a people icon next to them. The memberlist is also now search- and sortable.</p>
<p>Anyway, have a look at how important multiple windows are:

<p>Matrix client for Emacs</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alphapapa:matrix.org">alphapapa</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ement.el has received several updates since the last time it was mentioned in TWIM:</p>
<p><em>Additions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A new room list command, <code>ement-taxy-room-list</code>, shows rooms grouped &quot;smartly&quot; (and programmably).  (It will be made the default soon; until then, call the command to use it.)
<ul>
<li>The new room list shows unread-notification/highlight counts, similar to Element.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basic support for spaces:
<ul>
<li>Rooms (and spaces) can be added to and removed from spaces.</li>
<li>Rooms are listed under their spaces in <code>ement-taxy-room-list</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reactions can now be toggled off (i.e. redacted) by clicking them, like in Element.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-room-send-file</code> allows uploading non-image files to rooms, and file messages are now displayed usefully, so the files can be downloaded or viewed.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-ignore-user</code> ignores and unignores users.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-tag-room</code> adds and removes favourite, low-priority, or custom tags on rooms.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-room-occur</code> allows searching messages in a room buffer, similar to Emacs's <code>occur</code> command (i.e. it locally searches already-received messages).</li>
<li>Membership events are now coalesced by default, similar to Element (especially helpful in large public rooms, like bridged IRC rooms, where join/part spam can be overwhelming).</li>
<li>&quot;In reply to&quot; links in replies, as well as other <code>matrix.to</code> links, can be activated in a room buffer to go to the linked message.</li>
<li>Mentions in outgoing messages are HTML-linkified (aka &quot;pilled&quot;), like Element.</li>
<li>Generated avatars for rooms that have none, similar to Element.  (Only displayed in <code>ement-taxy-room-list</code> for now.)</li>
<li>Option <code>ement-shr-use-fonts</code> (disabled by default, which prevents HTML messages from being displayed in a different font).</li>
<li>Faces for favourite/low-priority rooms.</li>
<li>Redacted messages that are still known locally are now displayed with a strikethrough (after reconnecting, their content will be unknown).</li>
<li>When images are disabled, image messages are presented as clickable URLs, so they can still be viewed.</li>
<li>Some events, like membership events and images, are displayed alongside a vertical bar to help distinguish them from normal messages.</li>
<li>Even &quot;hotter&quot;-looking timestamps for rooms updated in the last hour.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Changes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Refactored notification system.  Now easier to configure (see <code>M-x customize-group RET ement-notify RET</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fixes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved error handling when looking up homeserver hostnames and <code>.well-known</code> URIs.</li>
<li>Improved error handling when processing malformed events.</li>
<li>&quot;Elemental&quot; display style (not used by many users, apparently).</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?=n78tHoCx1es">this months demos</a> (also shown off at the top of the TWIM post), Eric showed off a <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9615#issuecomment-1108992901">proof of concept to anonymize your screenshots</a> so you can easily include more context when submitting logs or bug reports without worrying where the bug occurred. The current concept will color block all of the text on the page to still maintain the structure of the app but completely hide the content itself.</p>
<p>This still has a ways to go before it's integrated in Element under the click of a button so if anyone wants to take over or give feedback, go comment on the issue, https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9615. If you want to use the anonymization now, you can manually run the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9615#issuecomment-1108992901">JavaScript snippet from the issue</a> in the browser devtools.</p>
<p>This mode could even be further extended further to include <code>event_id</code> labels in the corner of each message to easily correlate the logs to the screenshot.</p>

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a few release candidates and weeks later, we released <a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity/">Trixnity</a> 2.0.0 today! It contains many breaking changes due to a large refactoring, which allows us to share a lot code between server and client implementations of the Matrix APIs.
This means, that Trixnity can be used to implement matrix servers in addition to application services and clients!</p>
<p>Trixnity finally has support for Kotlin/JS. You can implement a browser client or even better: multiplatform client. Support for Kotlin/Native will follow soon (e. g. for iOS clients). Right now, there is no <code>trixnity-client-store</code> implementation for JavaScript (e. g. IndexedDB), so you need to stick with <code>InMemoryStore</code> at the moment.</p>
<p>Besides notification support (push rules are evaluated), we introduced helpers to get the complete timeline as Kotlin-Flow (no more complicated loops to get the timeline). You can even subscribe to all timeline events, which is really helpful to implement bots with e2e encryption support. Speaking of e2e encryption: libolm is bundled into <code>trixnity-olm</code> jars, so you don't need to build olm by your own anymore.</p>
<p>These are the most important features. For the complete changelog, have a look at the <a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity/-/releases">release candidates</a>.</p>

Support for the Element recent emoji (<code>io.element.recent_emoji</code>) was added.  A new method to get the last read marker was added.
Lastly, the timeline logic was enhanced, and it's now possible to load the timeline at a specific event. So you can load the room to the last event and then paginate through the new events. When reaching the last event, the timeline will automatically allow new events to be added in the timeline when received.</p>

<p>Hello together. I made a generic bot, named <code>Safed Sundarata</code>, or <code>Sundar</code> in short, that should make it easy to get basic special functionality working. It has a lot of different functionality so you have an example code to work off of. The main motivation for this bot was to provide an <code>!error &lt;code&gt;</code> command for the developers in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#community:reactos.org">ReactOS Matrix Rooms</a>, which translates error codes to human readable text. Then of course i added other useful or fun commands to the bot. You want to read the <a href="https://github.com/BieHDC/sundar/blob/master/README.md">Readme</a> to find out more.
This is the first time i ever wrote a bot, so feedback and corrections to the <a href="https://github.com/BieHDC/sundar">Source Code</a> are highly appreciated. It is written in Go using the mautrix-go framework (thanks tulir and everyone who worked on this making it easy!). Even easier is to run and build it with go, no insane build system with broken dependencies required, which was the reason why i made it from scratch.</p>

<h2 id="mjolnir"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir">Mj√∂lnir</a></h2>
<p>We have released v1.4.2 of Mjolnir https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/releases/tag/v1.4.2 which includes:</p>
<p><strong>Bot</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new <code>JoinWaveShortCircuit</code> protection, thanks to Jonathan  with https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/pull/280. This protection can be used to detect a mass-join scenario and set the room to invite-only.</li>
<li><strong>Change of behaviour:</strong> Mjolnir will now apply server ACL and member bans to the most recently active rooms first (while syncing). The order was random before.</li>
<li>The causes of errors at startup (e.g. via misconfiguration) have been made more clear.</li>
<li>The image with the <code>latest</code> tag on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixdotorg/mjolnir/tags">dockerhub</a> is now correctly in sync with the <code>main</code> branch.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Synapse Module</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/blob/main/synapse_antispam/setup.py#L5">python module version</a> is now in sync with the current git tag.</li>
<li>The Readme's example config has been fixed (thanks to Maranda  ).</li>

<p>A bot to moderate communities bridged with Discord via matrix-appservice-discord</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@trent:gra.im">luphoria</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am releasing a brand new moderation bot, <strong><a href="https://gra.im">graim</a></strong>! This bot allows you to moderate communities that are bridged with Discord via <strong>matrix-appservice-discord</strong>. You can tie a Matrix account to a Discord account, and moderate both platforms seamlessly from either end! Graim supports one Discord server and as many Matrix rooms as you want, per instance. :)
You can run it yourself from the Github - https://github.com/luphoria/graim
You can join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#graim:gra.im">matrix space</a>, which is bridged to the <a href="https://discord.gg/MV7fDb4AKy">Discord server</a>

<blockquote>
<p>Taking my GNOME Foundation hat on for this news: the GNOME Foundation is adopting Matrix! Is this TWIM worthy? It probably wouldn't have been if it wasn't for all the great work of Gwmngilfen! We published a joint blog post (though in all fairness Greg did all the heavy lifting) to explain how the decision was taken, and transparently share the data we had at hand.</p>
<p>In practice that means after <em>years</em> of Matrix being around in the GNOME community and being the most popular platform, it's finally moving out of the grey zone of &quot;everyone is using it but some older contributors really like their current set up, so it exists but it's not officially our primary platform&quot;. For now we're keeping both our Matrix instance and the bridge to GIMPnet (the IRC network GNOME people have been using for years). The major change is that IRC is now our legacy, so if tradeoffs have to be made Matrix will keep the premium experience.</p>
<p>Again, huge shout out to Gwmngilfen who gave meaning to the data I handed to him.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Hello again everyone! Your regularly-scheduled TWIM Spec update has returned, along with graph-based media!</p>
<p>Quick news to point out this week is that a new maubot plugin has been written to simply note the details of MSCs after their IDs (&quot;msc1234&quot;) have been posted in a room. The bot supports multiple MSC IDs in a message, message edits, threads and end-to-end encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>A copy of the bot is currently running under <code>@mscbot:matrix.org</code>, so feel free to invite it to a room if you'd find that useful!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3216">MSC3216: Synchronized access control for Spaces</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC serves as an alternative to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2962">MSC2962</a>, and essentially allows for user permissions to be simultaneously enforced across a set of rooms in a Space. This would allow functionality to users of platforms like Discord, where a user can be a moderator in a guild, and thus in all of that guild's channels.</p>

<ul>
<li>Locked python dependencies for our Docker images and Debian packages, thanks to David's <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/54">poetry work</a>.</li>
<li>Some big performance fixes, including <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12365">an optimisation to login</a> from Erik and one to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12522">message backfill</a> from yours truly.</li>

<p>Meanwhile on the core team, Sean has been continuing to lay groundwork for faster room joins, and Olivier has been doing some exciting work so that we will (finally) be able to test Synapse in worker mode under Complement.</p>

<h4 id="features">Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lazy-loading has been added to the <code>/sync</code> endpoint, which should speed up syncs considerably</li>
<li>Filtering has been added to the <code>/messages</code> endpoint</li>
<li>The room summary now contains &quot;heroes&quot; (up to 5 users in the room) for clients to display when no room name is set</li>
<li>The existing lazy-loading caches will now be used by <code>/messages</code> and <code>/context</code> so that member events will not be sent to clients more times than necessary</li>
<li>The account data stream now uses the provided filters</li>
<li>The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.8.0</li>
<li>The <code>/state</code> and <code>/state_ids</code> endpoints will now return <code>M_NOT_FOUND</code> for rejected events</li>
<li>Repeated calls to the <code>/redact</code> endpoint will now be idempotent when a transaction ID is given</li>
<li>Dendrite should now be able to run as a Windows service under Service Control Manager</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fixes">Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fictitious presence updates will no longer be created for users which have not sent us presence updates, which should speed up complete syncs considerably</li>
<li>Uploading cross-signing device signatures should now be more reliable, fixing a number of bugs with cross-signing</li>
<li>All account data should now be sent properly on a complete sync, which should eliminate problems with client settings or key backups appearing to be missing</li>
<li>Account data will now be limited correctly on incremental syncs, returning the stream position of the most recent update rather than the latest stream position</li>
<li>Account data will not be sent for parted rooms, which should reduce the number of left/forgotten rooms reappearing in clients as empty rooms</li>
<li>The TURN username hash has been fixed which should help to resolve some problems when using TURN for voice calls (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/fcwoknhenuxdfiyv">fcwoknhenuxdfiyv</a>)</li>
<li>Push rules can no longer be modified using the account data endpoints</li>
<li>Querying account availability should now work properly in polylith deployments</li>
<li>A number of bugs with sync filters have been fixed</li>
<li>A default sync filter will now be used if the request contains a filter ID that does not exist</li>
<li>The <code>pushkey_ts</code> field is now using seconds instead of milliseconds</li>
<li>A race condition when gracefully shutting down has been fixed, so JetStream should no longer cause the process to exit before other Dendrite components are finished shutting down</li>

<p>A set of Rust library crates for working with the Matrix protocol. Ruma‚Äôs approach to Matrix emphasizes correctness, security, stability and performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org">Jonas Platte</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our last update included the words &quot;if things go to plan&quot;, and even though that's usually calling for trouble, not so this time!
We released Ruma 0.6.0 yesterday and apart from a tiny missing feature that was fixed and released as 0.6.1 today, everything went smooth üôÇ</p>
<p>The biggest breaking changes are</p>
<ul>
<li>new owned identifier types ‚Äì calling <code>.to_owned()</code> on <code>&amp;UserId</code> now gives you an <code>OwnedUserId</code> instead of <code>Box&lt;UserId&gt;</code></li>
<li>a new event enum hierarchy, where redacted events are better taken into account</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, with this release we can now claim practically 100% coverage of Matrix v1.2, that is you can send and receive requests for all specified endpoints of the various APIs, as well as send and inspect all specified event types, all with a strongly-typed Rust API.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Matrix Community Manager has seen some work in the features department over the past week.</p>
<p>With the new Ansible playbook I think it's possible for someone with a bit of Ansible experience to get this bot up and running in under 10 minutes. I did a fresh install in 4 minutes. That is a fresh VPS and creating a new matrix account. Instructions for the Ansible deploy can be found <a href="https://sleuth56.gitlab.io/Matrix-Community-Manager/Installation-With-Ansible/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The major features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Ansible playbook that should simplify the installation process for new users.</li>
<li>Edits to the message that triggered the bot will now be reflected in the bots message. This bot now has a feature Twitter doesn't have :laughing:.</li>
<li>Hashtags are now called filters. Filters are more customizable allowing for custom delimiters and now show the originating room.</li>
<li>The AutoJoin feature has filters to control who or from where invites will be excepted.</li>
<li>Announcements can have more than one output room. Using a comma separated list of room ids.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few bugs were fixed as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some text characters were causing messages to be classed incorrectly thus causing crashes.</li>
<li>Exotic characters specifically in links were causing crashes.</li>

<h3 id="synapse-website">Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello again everyone. This week the team <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/04/19/synapse-1-57-released">released Synapse 1.57.0</a>, followed by a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.57.1">1.57.1 patch release</a> that fixed a problem in the 1.57.0 docker image.</p>
<p>This week was a little on the quieter side again, with some of us away on holiday and others away with illness. Nevertheless, this week <code>develop</code> saw a variety of activity. Some personal highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shay's effort to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/3c758d9808ddc00ee96c5426dda3caea356c8745">document Synapse's numerous config options</a> <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html">landed</a>. This is a huge and comprehensive effort that'll help administrators to understand all the options they have to configure Synapse.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12399">Further progress from Rich on the fast room joins project</a>. In some tests we've seen a 5x speed-up over the status quo!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12496">A subtle bugfix</a> from Erik which corrects incorrect counts in one of the Admin API endpoints.</li>
<li>The remainder of <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/54">the poetry work</a> has landed. There were a few last-minute complications in CI to smooth out, but we've now finished the migration. Synapse's docker images and debian package now come with a fixed set of dependencies (even transitive ones) in a way that lets us support multiple Python versions and interpreters.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're looking forward to shipping these in Synapse 1.58, whose RC is scheduled for Tuesday the 26th of April.</p>
<p>I'm also keen to see how <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12522">PR 12522</a> from Rich and Olivier progresses. It aims to fix a nasty memory bug which can cause Synapse to get stuck in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_memory">OOM loop</a>.</p>
<p>As ever, I'd like to express thanks to our community of users, server operators and contributors. Thanks are also due to @callahad: today is his last day of managing the Synapse team. We're all going to miss him and wish him well: thank you for everything you'd done over the last year and a half.</p>

<p>A Social Annotation Tool Powered by Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gleachkr:matrix.org">gleachkr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've added two major user-facing features to populus viewer:</p>
<ol>
<li>A two-up view in the pdf viewer, allowing you to view and annotate two pages at once on a wider screen</li>
<li>An audio viewer, complete with audio annotation, so that you can annotate temporal segments of an audio recording</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm especially excited about the latter - being able to discuss audio recordings will be a great teaching tool, and I'm hoping it might also be useful for things like people who want to talk about podcasts together (for purposes of editing, or just for fun), and people who want to annotate recordings of public talks of various kinds. The last use case would also be pretty well served by <em>video</em> annotation - so that's now rising on the agenda. I've created an MSC, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3775">here</a> where I'll be filling in the details of a proposed format for interoperable audiovisual media annotations. As always, if you've got questions, want to follow development progress, or just want to talk about the future of social annotation on Matrix, come join us at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opentower:matrix.org">#opentower:matrix.org</a>.

<p>A KRunner plugin to list joined rooms and possibly other things from nheko.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/LorenDB/nheko-krunner">nheko-krunner</a> has finally been <a href="https://github.com/LorenDB/nheko-krunner/releases/tag/v0.1.0">released</a>! Version 0.1.0 contains several handy features such as searching your rooms, joining new rooms, and starting and switching to direct chats. Furthermore, if a room has unread notifications, nheko-krunner will let you know by tacking on a notification count to the room name (e.g. <code>This Week in Matrix (TWIM) (1)</code>. Currently this feature is not disable-able, but I plan to dive into writing KCMs (KConfig Modules) soon so that I can add a toggle for this.</p>
<p>Hopefully a few people find this handy, and remember that if you don't use KDE, nheko still has a handy D-Bus API that you can use to write integrations with other software.</p>

<h3 id="matrix-dart-sdk-website">Matrix Dart SDK (<a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/company/frontend/famedlysdk">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Matrix SDK written in pure Dart.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@henri_carnot:famedly.de">Henri Carnot [famedly]</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We haven't done any regular posts about it in a while, but the SDK sees almost weekly releases. (We did release version 0.8.20 last week) If you forgot about it, the Matrix Dart SDK is the SDK FluffyChat, the Famedly clients and a few others use. Let me summarize some of the changes for those who haven't kept up:</p>
<p>One of the killer features is probably WebRTC support üöÄ. It handles all the signalling for you, which makes integrating call support into your Flutter or Dart Matrix client fairly simple. Currently it supports version 1 of the call protocol, which is still an MSC and implements a few of the other MSCs. Experiments with group calls are still in progress.</p>
<p>We also switched databases a few times and tuned it more (we posted about FluffyBox last year). The database backend should now be a lot more stable and more performant, while also using less memory.</p>
<p>Continuing with stability, we worked a lot on how the timeline is stored and structured, leading to a much more robust experience. The SDK is also now completely nullsafe üéâ, which gets rid of a lot of annoying error modes. There were some fixes to E2EE here and there, but mostly the experience has been really solid and didn't need much work.</p>
<p>Some of the more recent developments include widget support as well as improving the file upload experience. The SDK now inserts a dummy event for a pending upload, images are thumbnailed and resided in a different isolate and uploads are automatically retried after a connection failure. We are also working on improving the push support, making it easier to fetch events from a push.</p>
<p>And I'm currently working on bringing fragmented timeline support. Nico told me it would be pretty (not) easy to do... and I¬†have to say, he was right. Good first issue üôÉ</p>
<p>See you next week ;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've created a NixOS module, nix-matrix-appservices, that can simplify the bootstrap and maintenance of matrix appservices on nixos. With it, appservices can be spun up easily with registration and tokens handled by the module. Most mautrix and mx-puppet bridges have been tested to work and they can be setup in a couple lines of nix code. There are plenty of options you can make use of to configure more complex appservices.
You can find the the code, matrix room(gitlab badge), and usage information here: https://gitlab.com/coffeetables/nix-matrix-appservices</p>

This one includes a couple new module-related features, but also quite a few bugfixes and internal improvements. I'll talk about this in more details next week when Synapse 1.56 gets properly released, but the key points of this release is that Synapse will now refuse to start if it's configured with unsafe registration settings (i.e. open registration without any form of verification) as well as if it's running against a PostgreSQL database with the wrong locale values.

<p>More updates! This week the bridge library itself gets a major update. We've made a few breaking changes, notably we now expect target homeservers to at least be Matrix v1.2 compatible. Also, this release brings the new &quot;Provisioning and Widgets API&quot; which allows developers to start creating HTTP APIs for their bridges which work for both provisioning mode (shared secret tokens) and widget API style (authenticating via Matrix OpenID token sharing).

<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Media messages, both from or to KakaoTalk, are now supported!  The biggest exceptions are inbound files &amp; stickers.  The latter may be a hard sell to get working, due to how KT manages stickers, but I'll look into it some more before giving a concrete answer.</p>
<p>The bridge is also now responsive to disconnects, like when you log in from another KakaoTalk desktop client (since the bridge mimics the desktop client, and KT only allows one desktop client to be logged in at a time!).  Luckily, not all KakaoTalk APIs rely on the same connection that chatting does, meaning that some functionality can continue to work even when &quot;disconnected&quot;.  The bridge now takes advantage of this, meaning that profile-management commands (currently just the <code>list-friends</code> command) will work even if you get disconnected from chats for whatever reason.</p>
<p>The bridge is drawing ever closer to &quot;good enough&quot; status...  Please give it a try if curious!</p>

<p>Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Heyo, we released a hotfix release for the IRC bridge this week. This fixed a rather nasty
regression where the bridge would kick <strong>everyone</strong> from the Matrix side when a Matrix ban
list is updated. People who aren't using the new ban lists feature don't need to upgrade.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1.0 is a big number and a step not taken lightly. But Nheko has been in development for half a decade and we think it is time to take a step forward! As such we worked hard to fix readability issues in the app. Your messages should now be readable on any theme, because we send the first half as white text and the second half as black text (thank you, rrogalski for the contribution). For accessibility reasons this is enabled by default. We also added an improved typing indicator. Sometimes it is hard to notice when a message is too long, as such we gradually adjust the background color the longer the message gets. It also helps a lot, if you have a bad theme and can't read the text against the background color. Just enter a few characters and the background will change, so the messages should become readable. But that is not all! We all know some people have  a harder time seeing colors than others. So for accessibility we also slowly rotate the screen, so that even if your display is monochrome, you don't miss out. Please see the attached video for a demo or check out our release candidates <a href="https://matrix.neko.dev/_matrix/media/r0/download/neko.dev/GsEuaoEXokYtZUStAmxrRcOs">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/tree/march-2022">here</a>.</p>

<p>Before this month we also rewrote the room creation dialogs to be less confusing. We now have separate dialogs for direct chats and group chats, which should cut down confusion between the options by a lot. You can also now edit the topic and name of a room inline and Malte added a jump to bottom button. On mobile you can also now drag to the sides to reply. Last but not least, you can now knock on rooms from Nheko using <code>/knock</code> or if an invite failed because you were not allowed to join a room and you can add a reason to room joins, leaves, invites, knocks and everything. Some of those features require the server to support Matrix v1.1, so make sure you update your servers to use them.</p>

This means that we now have nightly flatpak builds[1], so users can already try out the new version of Fractal without having to build it from source. This will also give use much more feedback and many more bug reports, hopefully not too many :) Note that this isn't a release and the software should still be considered  unstable.</p>

<p>I'm doing a <a href="https://accu.digital-medium.co.uk/session/matrix-is-a-distributed-real-time-database/">talk about Matrix</a> at the <a href="https://www.accu.org/conf-main/main/">ACCU Conference</a> on Saturday 9th April. Recordings of talks will be available soon after the conference, and tickets are still available to be there live in person or online! Here's the talk summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Matrix network provides messaging (like WhatsApp or Slack) that offers all the features you expect, but without centralised control: it's an open standard, and anyone can run a server. The servers link together, so you can talk to other people even if they use a different server (kind of like email).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first half of this session, we will explore the basics of the protocol: making simple HTTP requests to send and receive messages, and discuss some of the interesting distributed-systems issues that make writing a server exciting.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the second half we will explore the fact that messaging is only one potential use of this network, and look into some examples of other real-time use cases that are in active development, taking note of how these use cases benefit from the real-time and distributed nature of the network.</p>

<p>There was some silence lately on this, but activity is picking back up.</p>
<p>Mainly, the project is getting rewritten. Why? Well, I learned from the issues and ran into issues with the framework used. There are going to be various changes to the architecture (like no more SSR, no nextjs, pwa support and more).</p>
<p>Feel free to follow https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-art/pull/121 for progress.</p>
<p>Another big thing that's going to change is that I am working on a complete redesign.  While I am still fairly early in the iterations, I wanted to share the first art direction Matrix Art is going to go. The main changes are that I try to have an art language which distinguishes it from the other proprietary players, as well as compensating for the fact that Matrix Art has a much lower volume of images on it's feed. Please be aware that this is way before the first round of polish. :)</p>
