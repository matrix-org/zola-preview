<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Hot on the heels (relatively speaking) of v1.1 of the Spec being released in November, v1.2 is now on the horizon! As a reminder, we're working towards quarterly releases of the spec going forwards - no hard dates yet though.</p>
<p>While this is certainly an improvement in speed, when it comes to writing software and updating implementations: quarterly spec updates may actually seem <em>too fast</em>. This is OK; implementations of the spec are <strong>not</strong> expected to update as soon as a new spec release is published. Rather, it is more realistic to expect that the ecosystem updates gradually over the course of the next few months/year after the release.</p>
<p>Look forward to more concrete dates soon!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2702">MSC2702: Specifying semantics for Content-Disposition on media</a>!</p>
<p>This looks like a small, but useful improvement to the spec that never really received much love. Feel free to give it some!</p>

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happy Friday everyone! Today the Synapse team has <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.50.0rc2">released Synapse 1.50.0rc2</a>. It fixes a particularly nasty federation-breaking regression that crept in during 1.50.0rc1. If you're currently running 1.50.0rc1, we implore you to update to 1.50.0rc2 as soon as possible!</p>
<p>In other news, a reminder that as of Synapse 1.50.0rc1, we have ended support for Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6 as per our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/deprecation_policy.html">dependency deprecation policy</a>, as upstream has marked them as end-of-life.</p>
<p>We'll let the community test 1.50.0rc2 over the weekend to ensure that no other regressions have emerged (please test if you can)! If not, expect Synapse 1.50 to land sometime early next week.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timokoesters:fachschaften.org">Timo ⚡️</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been a long time since my last TWIM post, so here's a summary of all exciting news:</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>We now support RocksDB as a backend. Migrating to RocksDB improved both my memory and IO usage a lot.</li>
<li>You can select the database backend at runtime. No need to recompile a special version anymore.</li>
<li>Lazy loading works. This means initial syncs are significantly faster (1-2 minutes instead of an hour!)</li>
<li>Voice calls are now supported (requires configuring a TURN server)</li>
<li>The report feature is now implemented and sends a report into the admin room</li>
</ul>
<p>Improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Much faster state resolution</li>
<li>Batch inserts for events</li>
<li>Better appservice docs</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is currently available on the <code>next</code> branch. We are preparing to make a v0.3.0 release soon!</p>
<p>Join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:fachschaften.org">#conduit:fachschaften.org</a> to help us test it.</p>

<h3 id="heisenbridge-website">Heisenbridge (<a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.10.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>RELAYMSG sending support 🚀</li>
<li>Allow forwarding all IRC noise to network room 🤫</li>
<li>Support ZNC self-message caps ✅</li>
<li>Support CHGHOST caps (prevents leave+join on host change) ✅</li>
<li>Fix owner auto-registration (regression) 🐛</li>
<li>Upgrade to Mautrix 0.14 ⬆️</li>
</ul>
<p>Sending RELAYMSGs have been requested for a while so now we do support that if the cap is added to request list. This makes plumbs on networks that support it work nicer. Receiving RELAYMSGs has not been implemented yet so they show up as external like before.</p>
<p>If you prefer keeping your IRC rooms clean without any IRC noise (mode changes etc.) you can now use a new FORWARD command in the network room to make all such events happen in the network room instead. This affects in-room commands as well.</p>
<p>ZNC users can now enjoy messages coming from your own clone in IRC rooms (including PMs!) if you wish so by keeping the znc.in/self-message cap enabled. This isn't extremely well tested yet but feedback welcome.</p>
<p>Not a breaking change but the caps support will cause connections to networks that ignore CAP requests take a few seconds longer unless you remove all the default caps for said network and it will never try requesting them again.</p>
<p>Mautrix 0.14 upgrade bumps the minimum version as well so packages beware.</p>
<p>Get some global warming from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We rewrote the whole settings page (as a stepping stone to 100% QML). Please test it and complain about everything I broke! We also tried to organize it a bit better so that similar settings are grouped together and tried to use the right controls for the right things. Best case you didn't notice anything. ;-)</p>
<p>And we also now show which profile a notification is for on KDE. I don't think other DEs have such a feature, so those will just show the generic Nheko as always.</p>

<p>Hydrogen is a lightweight matrix client with legacy and mobile browser support</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're about to release 0.2.23 after somewhat of a release hiatus. We've been working on two fronts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the SDK out! Hydrogen was always meant to be easy to embedded, reuse in parts, and make customized versions of. But until now, actually doing that was quite challenging. Now that the SDK is out, you can use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hydrogen-view-sdk"><code>hydrogen-view-sdk</code></a> package in your projects and use parts of Hydrogen in your application. It's still early days, and we're still working out what symbols should be exported (finding a balance between APIs we want to support and utility), etc. Expect updates in the coming weeks. We're also not yet promising API stability for now, some APIs will very likely still change. Once we hit 1.0, we won't change things from underneath you anymore without increasing the major version. </li>
<li>Rich reply previews: as part of providing minimal support for threads (representing them as replies), we're switching from using the embedded reply fallback and actually looking up the replied-to message. One benefit is that reply previews will now updated when they are redacted (and edited, once we support that :).</li>
<li>Also fix some minor other things, like loading images when they are only partially visible, and a very basic location tile.</li>
</ul>

<p>The maximised widgets feature in Element Web that Timo K. has been working on is now available for everyone on develop, and it's on track for the next web release. 🚀 It's a great match for widget-based collaborative editors, dashboards, games, and more. The widget becomes the focus of the room. You can optionally show chat from the room in a side panel, allowing easy discussion of the document / dashboard / game.</p>
<p>To try it out, add a widget to a room in the usual way, then look for the new &quot;maximise&quot; button in the room info panel's widget section. Please let us know in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#beyond-chat:matrix.org">#beyond-chat:matrix.org</a> or in issues if you have any feedback. 😄</p>

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a> version 1.0.0 is out! I decided to make it 1.0.0 not because it is out of beta, but because it has most features you need to build a usable client.
That means: cross signing has landed into Trixnity! The next big features will be room key backup and push notification.</p>
<p>Here is the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>fully support cross signing</li>
<li>load members of rooms in an async way (you don't need to catch errors anymore)</li>
<li>reactive displayname and avatar url of the logged-in user</li>
<li>reactive avatar url for rooms</li>
<li>reactive is-direct-room state for rooms</li>
<li>better Android support for thumbnails</li>
<li>make part of device keys API public</li>
<li>merge SecureStore into Store (encrypt your database if you want to keep secrets secure)</li>
<li>move trixnity-client-api model-classes into separate module to use them e.g. for a matrix server implementation (thanks to <a href="https://gitlab.com/NicolasJouanin">@NicolasJouanin</a>)</li>
<li>fixed long standing bug of wrong room name calculation</li>
<li>account data events are handled as if they have a key (like state events) to bypass inconsistency in the spec (maybe this will lead into a MSC)</li>

<p>I just open sourced a library called Matrix-CRDT: https://github.com/yousefED/matrix-crdt - feedback very welcome!

<blockquote>
<p>If you have a distributed data structure and an algorithm that ensures all participants end up with the same result when their actions are combined, then that's effectively a CRDT as well. For Matrix, there a few research papers like https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06488 which examine the CRDT-like properties.</p>

<p>First stable release of the <a href="https://github.com/Jaedotmoe/gh-bot">gh-bot</a> which is a simple webhook to Matrix bot made in Python.
As of now, the bot supports webhooks from Github, Gitlab and Gitea (although support for this one is very light).
Some other projects might do that way better than this bot but this is a learning project, to learn step by step how client interact with servers.
The next step would be to add a CRT.sh integration to get notified when a certificate is issued for a certain range of domains (which is something we want since we saw an IRC bot do the same).</p>

<p>A Devianart Fork based on Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev">MTRNord (they/them)</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrix-Art is a new social network prototype on Matrix.</p>
<p>It is a direct Devianart style clone. It currently has a focus on only images but is going to get extended to other media types eventually.
I am doing this as a toy project, so it may sometimes have slow progress. The goal is covering the main functions Devianart provides (Posting, Sharing, Profiles, Following, Collections, Comments) as well as integrations to other social networks on matrix using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3639">MSC3639</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of things are currently still missing, but I am trying to get uploading working next :)</p>
<p>An instance is hosted at https://art.midnightthoughts.space/ and the code is at https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-art</p>
<p>Currently, the interface is limited to viewing basic data from a matrix room. In the future, there are plans to have an open registration as well as login with any account to use it. :)</p>
<p>Note however that I suggest against using your personal account just yet, even though the login works, as it may have unexpected room joins at this time. This is known and expected, but not production ready.</p>
<p>Also, at this time, there are no plans of e2ee support. This may get added after the main features are finished.</p>

<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for <del>this week</del> the last little bit, we've been working on getting MSCs merged into the formal spec itself in preparation for v1.2 this quarter. We expect the release to happen quite soon and to contain <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3610">Spaces</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3387">room versions 8 and 9</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">refresh tokens</a> (no spec PR yet) in addition to all the other wonderful stuff which has landed.</p>
<p>The merged MSCs can be seen over at <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/">https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/</a> where they're queued up for the next release. Look out for <code>Added in v1.2</code> labels throughout the spec, denoting what is new and exciting.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>The random MSC this week is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2192">MSC2192: Inline widgets</a> (I promise it was random, after a few re-rolls). Inline widgets are a concept that allows for rich functionality in the timeline without needing to necessarily specify an explicit event type. For example, video embeds, minigames, etc could all be represented by inline widgets instead of dedicated event types.</p>
<p>The MSC needs updating to handle <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767: Extensible Events</a> (and friends), but once there it could be a very powerful bit of functionality, with free fallback thanks to Extensible Events. </p>

<p>Sliding sync (aka sync v3) is described in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3575">MSC3575</a> - it's still very early days for the proposal which means a lot can change: and YOU can be a part of that. Please take a look at the MSC and provide any and all feedback, be it on the names of keys, format of JSON objects, or the kinds of operations that can be performed. I'm particularly interested in feedback from client developers who have complex room list sort orders or room list filtering requirements and bot/bridge developers who typically don't have a visible room list UI.

<p>If polylith is your thing then I recommend <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK/dendrite-helm">the chart by S7evinK</a> for now, although it is likely these charts will merge in the future.</p>
<p>The chart and documentation are available here: <a href="https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/tree/master/charts/incubator/dendrite">https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/tree/master/charts/incubator/dendrite</a></p>

<p>An add-on for the matrix-appservice-webhooks bridge. Webhooks are essentially web interfaces for applications to &quot;push&quot; data to. The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.</p>

<p>A multi purpose multi platform bridge, formerly known as matrix-github</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Howdy folks, it is the time of the year where everyone scarpers! Anyway, perfect time to announce that <strong>matrix-hookshot has gotten it's first major release!</strong>. 1.0.0 is here!</p>
<p>For those not in the know, the hookshot bridge is used to bridge GitHub, GitLab, JIRA and Generic Webhooks into Matrix rooms. It doesn't just bridge into existing rooms, but can also spawn dynamic rooms based on aliases, send you your notifications in a DM and do lots of other wonderful things!</p>
<p>The notable changes from the 0.1.0 release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridge has now been renamed from matrix-github to matrix-hookshot.</li>
<li>Now supports JIRA and Generic Webhooks in addition to GitHub and GitLab.</li>
<li>Includes new commands and metrics reporting.</li>
<li>Includes <a href="https://half-shot.github.io/matrix-hookshot">complete documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get involved and start playing with it by checking out the release <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.0.0">here</a></p>
<p>And that will be my last TWIM entry of the year. Have a good one and stay safe all 🐶</p>

<p>Hey folks! It was only last year we released the 1.0 release of hookshot, after many years of work to get it that far. I'm happy to announce that this week we've got <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.1.0">another release</a>. There are a number of buxfixes and improved documentation pieces landing (special shoutout to HarHarLinks for ensuring the docs are competent). The highlights are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Figma webhooks. this also means the archival of my old project <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-figma">matrix-figma</a></li>
<li>Support GitLab wiki page change events.</li>
<li>Added a new script <code>validate-config</code> which allows you to check your config file for simple errors. Handy for people writing ansible roles!</li>
<li>Add support for a html key on generic webhooks to set the HTML content of a Matrix message.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project can be found over at https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot/, with pretty pretty docs at https://half-shot.github.io/matrix-hookshot.

<p>Heisenbridge roundup!</p>
<p>Release <del>v1.8.0</del> <del>v1.8.1</del> <del>v1.8.2</del> v1.9.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>Spaces support 🌃</li>
<li>Sort NAMES reply nicks 🔤</li>
<li><code>UNPLUMB</code> network command to force unplumbing without being in the room</li>
<li>Proper SASL external with CertFP with mechanism override option (see notes)</li>
<li>Disconnect and cleanup from networks that have no rooms open ♻️</li>
<li>Reply (and reject) DM requests to ghosts with <code>QUERY</code> command ↪️</li>
<li>Try to keep IRC users in the room at all costs if they are on the IRC channel</li>
<li>Fix assumption of all IRC replies to have arguments</li>
<li>Prevent accidental namespace changes to cause mayhem</li>
<li>Finally convert from homegrown Matrix API stuff to Mautrix</li>
<li>Bump Mautrix requirement to 0.12=&gt;0.14</li>
<li>Conduit support was broken in 1.8.x but fixed again in 1.9.0, sorry</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally there's network level spaces support with a new <code>SPACE</code> command. This creates a new bridge controlled space for the network and automatically manages rooms in and out. There's an issue/feature with Element that all rooms that have been converted to DMs with <code>/converttodm</code> will appear in all bridge spaces. The workaround is to convert them back to regular rooms.</p>
<p>CertFP SASL has been updated to do SASL external flow by default. If you are upgrading and have used CertFP with OFTC you need to run <code>SASL --mechanism=none</code> for it to connect again.</p>
<p>Abandoned networks where the user has left all rooms including the network room will now automatically disconnect and cleanup. This is more in line what people would expect and prevents idle connections from hanging around.</p>
<p>Get your third vaccination from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We just released 0.9.1!</p>
<p>This is a small bug fix release. If you reported an issue, there is a 15% chance it is fixed now! This release also supports pinned messages, although those will only show up after someone changed the pinned messages in a room currently (we didn't want to force a full resync just for such a small feature). The spaces list is also now nested, Nheko offers you quick access to your recently used reactions and Nheko will show you your direct chats in the sidebar. Apart from that there are quite a few bugfixes and smaller improvements, you can find the full changelog and downloads here: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases/tag/v0.9.1</p>
<p>Thank you everyone, who helped shape this release!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now is a lot more efficient. We now use one Threadpool instead of 3, got rid of more than 60% of the allocations when scrolling through messages, layout half as much content when scrolling, blurhashes decode in 10% of the time and jdenticons allocate ~10% as much temporary buffers. We also deleted around 1000 lines of unused code. Tooltips also shouldn't steal the mouse focus when scrolling anymore, which could lead to sudden stalls when scrolling.</p>
<p>Additionally edits now replace existing notifications, tastytea added a manpage and fixed blurry or incorrectly sized custom emoji, you can now send custom emotes via the inline completer using ~ and completers now show a scrollable list with more Elements than before. Advanced users can also now opt into an insecure client side secrets storage via a hidden setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're baaaaack! Anyway, last week Drake just translated all of Nheko into Spanish, you can now zoom in and pan in the image viewer, emojis shouldn't split up into their segments anymore and Nheko should always be sending the qualified version of it (according the to the unicode test files, not by just appending FE0F). Blurhashes should be even faster still and we now have support for running the call event loop on macOS and Windows (although call support is still disabled there for now). </p>
<p>We are also now working to restructure our README. It has a lot of outdated stuff in it and you really want to see screenshots pretty early in the README! You can sneak a peak here: https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/nheko/-/tree/README_updates</p>

<ul>
<li>Relicense from GPLv3 to LGPLv3.</li>
<li>Rewrite large parts of the stylesheet to use flexbox.</li>
<li>Introduce CSS variables to the stylesheet.</li>
<li><code>.dark</code> and <code>.light</code> CSS classes with default values for dark/light mode.</li>
<li>Bugfix: &quot;View More&quot; button no longer blinks when auto-refreshing short comment sections.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> has had a v0.6.0-beta.3 release with beta support for crypto! It even includes documentation!</p>
<p>The crypto is considered beta quality at the moment: good enough to use for somewhat unimportant bots, but not fully recommended for production just yet. With that being said, I'm interested in bugs you run into - please use the issue tracker if you run into crypto not working.</p>
<p>Tutorials for the crypto setup are at https://turt2live.github.io/matrix-bot-sdk/tutorial-encryption.html</p>
<p>Note for appservice support to work then you'll need a Synapse with these PRs enabled (may require manual merge too):</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11538</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11617</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11215</li>
</ul>
<p>For non-linux platforms, the rust-sdk will try to build itself which means you might need a working Rust stack. The Rust SDK repo itself has more information: </p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/travis/node-bindings/crates/matrix-sdk-crypto-nodejs/README.md</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/travis/node-bindings/README.md</li>
</ul>
<p>Bots and appservices don't automatically support encryption, but adding encryption <em>should</em> be easy. The Rust SDK dependency is required in either case, sorry.</p>

<p>I don't think we've previously had any <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix/NixOS/nixpkgs</a> related entries in TWIM, so I'll start ^^</p>
<p>The current unstable channel has extended its Matrix ecosystem support to also include <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge">Heisenbridge</a> and <a href="https://conduit.rs/">Conduit</a> packages and modules. This makes it super easy to deploy any of those services: For example, my configuration for Heisenbridge is 21 lines long, and Conduit is only 11 lines. You can browse the available configuration options online: <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&amp;query=services.matrix-conduit"><code>services.matrix-conduit</code></a>, <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&amp;query=services.heisenbridge"><code>services.heisenbridge</code></a> (note that some of them are freeform and simply forward to the upstream configuration).</p>
<p>For those that are not into NixOS, a module is the code that turns the declarative configuration files into your running system setup. As an example, if you enable <code>services.heisenbridge</code> the following things are done for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new <code>heisenbridge</code> user and group for the service</li>
<li>Create and manage the registration file for the homeserver (i.e. automatically regenerate it after the configuration changed)</li>
<li>Create a systemd service that runs the <code>heisenbridge</code> command with the requested bridge configuration. The unit also sets a few systemd security hardening options.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hey all, it's me again, not-anoa, with your spec update. I don't have a graph for you this week, but I do have curated content which hopefully holds you over until next week 🙂 </p>
<p>This week we've seen a few new MSCs get opened up:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3567">MSC3567 - Allow requesting events from the start/end of the room history</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3570">MSC3570 - Room history visibility changes for relations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3571">MSC3571 - Relation aggregation pagination</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3572">MSC3572 - Relation aggregation cleanup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As demonstrated, a few of them are follow-on work from aggregations. A lot of the work is an effort to get <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675 - Serverside aggregations of message relationships</a> through FCP - it's changed quite a bit in the last week, so if you reviewed it before then please give it a quick read! </p>
<p>We're also gearing up for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767 - Extensible event types &amp; fallback in Matrix</a> receiving attention early next year. This is currently being evaluated by features like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3245">MSC3245 - Voice messages</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381 - Polls</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3488">MSC3488 - Static location sharing</a>. If all goes according to plan, the first pieces of Extensible Events will land soon.</p>
<p>Thib has caught me quite close to the deadline on TWIM, so while I don't have a random MSC for you this week I do recommend some light reading around aggregations and extensible events - these are both major features for Matrix and help shape the future for other, even more exciting, features.</p>

<h2 id="random-msc">Random MSC</h2>
<p>Since the script didn't run, I manually generated random numbers until I actually got one, that matches an MSC and is not a draft!</p>
<p>So the random MSC is: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2461">MSC2461: Proposal for Authenticated Content Repository API</a></p>
<p>The goal of this MSC is to restrict who can access files in your content repository, which is used to share files, images, voice messages and more on Matrix. Currently this is secured by using random identifiers, but this MSC wants to add a few more restrictions: A signed-in user can still access everything, but if you don't provide an access token, when downloading media, you either can access no media, only media that was sent from that server, only media which the server already downloaded or everything. The level of access can be set by the server admin.</p>
<p>I think this would be really nice to have, but it has various challenges when implementing it in clients and when it needs to work across federation. It could limit how much random users can fill up your disk though, which is especially important for small server admins!</p>

<p>Happy holidays! This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/14/synapse-1-49-0-released">released Synapse 1.49.0</a>, our last planned release of the year. This is the last release that supports Python 3.6 or PostgreSQL 9.6; if you've not upgraded, now is the time!</p>
<p>Most notably, this release includes stable support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a>. This is a more secure alternative to long-lived access tokens, and we'd encourage clients to implement support for refresh tokens as described in the MSC.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/releases/">Sygnal 0.11</a>, which includes <em>loads</em> of bugfixes. For the Element-managed Sygnal instances, this release has reduced our daily Sentry error rate by over 99%, dramatically improving the signal-to-noise ratio of our monitoring.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are planning to have a small release next week, that fixes a few issues with the 0.9.0 release. It would be lovely if some of you could test one of our <a href="https://matrix-static.neko.dev/room/!TshDrgpBNBDmfDeEGN:neko.dev/">nightlies</a> or could check if the translations for a language you speak are up to date in <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/#translations">our weblate</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the fixes this week include another crash fix for handling matrix links from your browser, notification bubbles that can show values over 9000(!), better preview images for sticker and emote packs created in Nheko, allowing you to click links in replies, a few layout and click area fixes. Nheko now also keeps track of your latest reactions and gives you easy access to them in the hover menu.</p>
<p>Nheko now also finally supports pinned messages! Most of you probably don't know, but that feature has pretty much always been in the matrix spec, but very few clients expose it. Today Nheko joins that rank! It's part of our goal to provide better support for building communities. Topics can be quite limiting, because they can only contain plain text. Pinned messages allow for much more creative freedom! They can also be encrypted, while state events currently never are, but the key for that isn't reshared, so currently experience in encrypted rooms is a tradeoff. Maybe we'll go for an encrypted description event in the future, but for now this seems to be a good solution to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Let's hope the current master branch is good and we'll have a release with ALL THE FIXES next week! And thank you everyone, who already translated and reported issues! It took less than 10 hours to have 5 languages updated to 100%! Last year we didn't even have that many languages at 100%! You guys are AMAZING! &lt;3</p>

<h3 id="matrix-highlight">Matrix Highlight <a href="https://github.com/DanilaFe/matrix-highlight">↗</a></h3>
<p>A decentralized and federated way of annotating the web based on Matrix.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@daniel:matrix.danilafe.com">Daniel</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a matrix-based tool for highlighting and annotating websites. By building on top of matrix, we can effectively have a decentralized, federated and collaborative way to leave notes and highlights on pages. I wrote a <a href="https://danilafe.com/blog/introducing_highlight/">brief introduction on my blog</a>, as well as made a little bit of a simple <a href="https://youtu.be/Q3h5A0DsE1s">demo video</a>. Here's a copy-pasted list of planned and existing features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Create and send website annotations over Matrix.</li>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Store data in a decentralized and federated manner.</li>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Share highlights with other users, including those on other servers.</li>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Group annotations together and create multiple annotation groups</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong>: Use Matrix's End-to-End encryption to ensure the secure transmission and storage of highlight data.</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong>: Leverage the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/gsouquet/threading-via-relations/proposals/3440-threading-via-relations.md">m.thread MSC</a> to allow users to comment on and discuss
highlights.</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong>: Use something like <a href="https://archivebox.io/">ArchiveBox</a> to cache the current version of a website and prevent annotations from breaking.</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong> Highlight PDFs in addition to web pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Come join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-highlight:matrix.danilafe">#matrix-highlight:matrix.danilafe</a>.com to receive updates about the project!</p>
<p>I haven't published the code just yet, but I'm going to as soon as the tool is in better shape.

<p>A Social Annotation Tool Powered by Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gleachkr:matrix.org">gleachkr</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been teaching a class this semester using a tool built on the matrix-js-sdk and tentatively entitled <a href="https://github.com/opentower/populus-viewer">populus-viewer</a>. Populus-viewer uses Matrix as a backend for the social annotation of PDFs, with the goal of helping matrix become a platform for teaching and scholarly collaboration. If you're interested in learning more, or adopting populus-viewer in your teaching, come visit <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opentower:matrix.org">#opentower:matrix.org</a>! </p>
<p>Populus-Viewer currently supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotation of PDFs with highlights and pin-drops</li>
<li>Matrix conversations based on annotations</li>
<li>Audio and video messages</li>
<li>Replies, reactions, and redactions</li>
<li>Markdown for rich text</li>
<li>LaTeX for mathematical notation</li>
<li>Typing notifications</li>
<li>Synchronized reading position across devices</li>
<li>SSO, with single-click links for embedding in an LMS like Canvas or Blackboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the project develops, I'm hoping to continue to polish the reading experience, and to add support for other mime types (audio and video especially).</p>

<p>A project has started to re-implement the venerable mIRCstats for Matrix!

However, we're moving quickly, and I hope to have some initial easy-to-use viz in place over the Christmas break.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo K.</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Board games are great. And Matrix and its widget api turned out to be an excellent environment to create collaborative board games. With some really impressive conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't have to maintain a server with a database.</li>
<li>I don't have to create a custom account systems user need to register. They play with their matrix account, which also makes accessibility great. Someone invites you in a room with the game and you can play!</li>
<li>I just need to host one static file and ppl will be able to play as long as that static site exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project tries to be two things. A tech demo and inspiration to what is possible with widgets (Especially, with the changes on how widgets can be displayed in element (Check the &quot;matrix live&quot; Demos! 😊) )
Second it should serve as source and resource. For ideas and solutions on how no trust games can be executed without server (third party) side logic. And, for the ones interested, also as a resource on how widgets are implemented.</p>
<p>Last but not least the game Saint Petersburg is really fun. It takes a couple of minutes to grasp the rules but it is one of those games where there are so many things that can be considered with simple rules that it becomes more and more exciting with each round. So I really invite you to check out the <a href="https://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/rules4/Saint%20Petersburg%20-%20rules.pdf">rules</a> and give it a try. Its best to start in the <a href="https://github.com/toger5/st-petersburg-widget">Git Repo</a> or join the this room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#st-petersburg-auth:matrix.org">#st-petersburg-auth:matrix.org</a></p>
<p>To put it simple, the widget works like this: The game state is stored in the room state and is updated through the widget directly.
This of course raises <strong>questions</strong>: How is it still possible to prohibit users from cheating and manually changing parameters like, how much money they own. Everyone (who has the permission) is always able to send whatever state events they want?
How is it possible to draw random cards if there is no third party involved. Could I not just send a state event with the cards that I hope are going to be drawn and are beneficial for me. Can we make card drawing deterministic? Not really since then everyone know what is going to happen. Which kind of breaks the game...</p>
<p>I would be super happy, if someone is interested and wants to find answer to the questions above by checking out the <a href="https://github.com/toger5/st-petersburg-widget/blob/main/README.md">README</a>.

<p>Last week the Matrix Scientists had turned this room into a portal to TWIM bot's ship tank so we could all fuel it with news about our work. The spec and hookshot news were reported late when the tank was already full, sending TWIM bot's ship into hyperspeed mode 🚀</p>
<p>We lost contact with the bot for a few days but managed to restore a connection with it. It appeared to have crashed on the green planet of Fuj'ehr. Its ship shattered in pieces at impact! 💥</p>
<p>The bot managed to find most of them, but some critical pieces of the engine were missing. We needed to find those pieces quickly before the mushy ground of Fuj'ehr swallows them forever! 😱</p>
<p>The Editor has asked the Matrix Scientists to reconfigure the room and bridge it to TWIM bot's navigation tools. Each news report highlighted the position of a piece of engine on its map. 🗺️</p>

<p>Extensible events are coming! With lots of potential usecases to be built on top of the concept (such as threading, polls, and any type of data one would like to through on top of existing room events), extensible events are finally getting some love. New MSCs are available above, which detail some of these usecases. Exciting times!</p>
<p>A small correction from last week's issue: the next aggregations MSC to be focused on (after <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (serverside aggregations) is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2677">MSC2677</a> (annotations and reactions), as it's a more pressing blocker for usecases such as threading and polls.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Spec Core Team is continuing to wind down in preparation for the holidays ☃️</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3015">MSC3015: Room state personal overrides</a>.</p>
<p>Quite a novel concept, and one that would enable many usecases, such as the ones described in the MSC itself.
Check it out if that's something that interests you!

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we cut Synapse release candidate <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.49.0rc1">1.49.0rc1</a> It includes a bunch of work to supporta plethora of MSCs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675/">MSC 2675</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/main/proposals/2918-refreshtokens.md#msc2918-refresh-tokens">MSC2918</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946</a>), a crop of bugfixes and improvements to our documentation which incorporate Synapse's old wiki. And as ever, there's a bunch of internal type hinting to keep the Synapse team's blood pressure at healthy levels.</p>
<p>The formal release of Synapse 1.49.0 is scheduled for the coming Tuesday. This will be the last Synapse release of 2021 as the Synapse team prepare for a break over the Christmas period. Releases will continue at the usual pace in the new year, with 1.50.0rc1 slated for 2022/01/04 and 1.50.0 for 2022/01/11.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Synapse 1.49 will be the last version to support Python 3.6, PostrgreSQL 9.6, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic): by our next release, these will have reached their upstream end-of-life. If you're reliant on any of these platforms, please ensure you have plans to upgrade.</p>
<p>In other news, we're <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#sygnal-0110-2021-12-09">preparing</a> to release a new version of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a> with a series of fixes for common errors.

<p>NeoChat version 21.12 is out! You may have noticed that this version number is roughly twenty times higher than the previous one. This means that NeoChat is now twenty times as good as the last version. Or it means that version numbers are utterly meaningless and we switched to a date-based version number system since NeoChat is now released together with many other plasma-mobile related apps. This also means that new versions will arrive monthly from now on. New features and fixes in this version include - but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spell checking while writing a message</li>
<li>Improved markdown to html conversion when sending a message</li>
<li>Built-in theme switching</li>
<li>Various fixes to login, logout and account switching</li>
<li>Support for custom emojis</li>
<li>Support for Spoilers</li>

<p>Wily Messenger Matrix client</p>
<p>Wily has launched an iOS Matrix client to enable messaging in restricted- or poor networks. mText and Room events are transferred as DNS payload, thus bypassing most captive portals, while message headers are minimized to enable messaging in very low bandwidth/high latency networks.</p>
<p>Wily Messenger is in POC stage, missing i.e. encryption at the moment, among others. We are committed to develop it further and invite a Kotlin developer to join our journey. DM @hp:hq.wily.im</p>

<p>The members of the Federation have been very active and helped TWIM bot to find all the pieces of its ship! TWIM bot assembled everything together and put the engine back in its place... but at the last moment, as it was ready to take off, another bright spot appeared on the map following madlittlemods late report!</p>
<p>How could this happen? All the pieces of the engine were already there! Unsure of what to do, the bot asked Earth for directions. Earth confirmed: it was worth going to that new bright spot on the map.</p>
<p>The bot welded back the plate of the engine casing, made sure nothing could get into the ship in its absence, and started heading to the mysterious spot. The signal of our communication tools with TWIM bot weakens as it enters in the thick forest of Fuj'ehr…</p>

The <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> room is a portal to its energy tank, and we had received a distress signal!</p>
<p>To help the TWIM explorer fulfil its mission, we asked the Matrix community to fuel it with news before it crashed into space debris made of aggregated ignorance!</p>
<p>This week again, the community has been very active and explored many possibilities of the Matrix universe!</p>

<p>Goooood evening TWIM readers!</p>
<p>I want to start by drawing attention to a blog post which we published today: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/03/type-coverage-for-sydent-motivation">Type coverage for Sydent: motivation</a>. This the first in a series of three articles discussing what we've learned from making Sydent pass the <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/">mypy</a> type checker in strict mode. Improving type coverage across Synapse, Sygnal, and Sydent has been a major focus of the backend team at Element for the past few months, and we think we've learned a few useful things in the process.</p>
<p>This week we also <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/30/synapse-1-48-0-released">released Synapse 1.48</a> with loads of internal improvements, new Admin APIs, better alignment with the Matrix 1.1 spec, and more. We're planning one more release for the year, 1.49 on December 14th, and then we're taking a break until Synapse 1.50 on January 11th.</p>
<p>Importantly: Synapse 1.49 will be the last release to support Python 3.6, PostrgreSQL 9.6, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) — if you're reliant on any of these platforms, please ensure you have plans to upgrade.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think of the article (and the Synapse release!), and we'll see you next week!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org">madlittlemods (Eric Eastwood)</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the vein of <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Gitter feature parity</a> on Matrix, we've made the first steps towards a better public static archive. We merged an experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> into <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> which lets you use the unstable <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> client API endpoint go from a given timestamp to the closest event ID. This will allow us to implement a calendar jump to date interface to be able to navigate to any day in the rooms history. Our first target to add the jump to date UI in is <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen</a> since we plan to server-side render Hydrogen for the actual public static archive as well.</p>
<p>To enable the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> unstable API endpoints in Synapse, add <code>experimental_features</code> -&gt; <code>msc3030_enabled: true</code> to your <code>homeserver.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/client/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/rooms/&lt;roomID&gt;/timestamp_to_event?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;
</span><span>{
</span><span>    &quot;event_id&quot;: ...
</span><span>    &quot;origin_server_ts&quot;: ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Also as part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>, when you use the client API endpoint, if your homeserver sees that the closest event it has locally in the database is next to a gap in the history, it will go out and ask other federated homeservers what they have as the closest event instead.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/timestamp_to_event/&lt;roomID&gt;?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;

<p>Stop the press. This is a last minute TWIM. We've been beavering away on <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot</a>. It's gained many features in the last week, but the big thing is that hookshot has gained the ability to provision connections over a provisioning API, which means it should hook nicely into Dimension (and other integration managers, in the future)!</p>
<p>Other notable features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple webhooks per room</li>
<li>Support for the username/text fields on an incoming webhook (slack style)</li>
<li>Named webhooks, so each hook now has a sensible displayname</li>
<li>The ability to spawn GitHub actions from rooms using the <code>!gh workflow run</code> command</li>
<li>Lots of new supported events from GitLab, such as reviews and tag pushes</li>
<li>Hosted documentation (so all of the above is easy to setup), it's a bit in progress atm.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're aiming for a release very very soon, hopefully in the next week or so!

<p>We finally figured out what caused the issues with the flatpak on GNOME, especially on Arm. It should now work properly, if you use Flathub. On the Pinephone (and other systems, that don't set a locale/use the C locale), timestamps should now not be needlessly long anymore. Redactions got a face-lift to distinguish them better from normal messages. We added a workaround for Synapse not allowing you to leave a banned room. We now delete the room from the room list permanently if Synapse returns &quot;unknown room&quot; when trying to leave it. Spaces can now show the entire hierarchy in the sidebar (if you pull it out) and you can navigate to subspaces by clicking on them in the roomlist, even if you collapsed the space hierarchy in the sidebar.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">Krille Fear</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we have released FluffyChat 1.0.0 with a whole new design, a lot of bug fixes and huge performance improvements.</p>
<h3 id="new-design">New design</h3>
<p>The new design has bigger message bubbles with fancy shadows and bigger fonts. The contrast has been improved and some elements, like the time on every single message bubble, are now hidden by default. But they are not gone! Detailed message information are now accessible in the new message info page, where we not also can see the message type and the timestamp, but also the whole JSON source code of each timeline event.</p>
<h3 id="spaces">Spaces</h3>
<p>Spaces have got a lot improvements and bug fixes. They have moved to the bottom bar of the chat list (while this bottom bar is still hidden if you have not joined any space yet). The multi account switcher have instead been moved to a top left drop-down menu. So we finally got rid of the drawer, which seems to be a deprecated material design feature anyway. This new UX makes spaces much easier to use. You can long press on them to go to the space settings and long press on any chat in the chat list, to add or remove a chat to (or from) a space.
We still have no support for the spaces summary API though so we don't have yet the ability to discover new rooms inside of a space but this feature might land soon in the Matrix Dart SDK.</p>
<h3 id="multi-account">Multi Account</h3>
<p>FluffyChats multi account is still in beta but got a lot of bug fixes as well. You are now able to sort your accounts in &quot;bundles&quot; which can be very handy. The new account switcher button gives you a much better overview over your connected Matrix accounts now.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>We did a lot refactoring under the hood in our Matrix Dart SDK and have improved our in-app database a lot. On the web it now uses IndexedDB natively while it tunes all database transactions on all platforms. This leads to the fastest FluffyChat experience we ever had and makes the app finally kinda usable with bigger accounts on all platforms. The room list is now lazy loaded which speeds up the app start (especially with multi account enabled) a lot.
Choose your own primary color
This was a long requested feature. You can now choose your favorite color to style your FluffyChat for your needs:</p>
<p>What will you choose? Let me know in the comments. I mostly like blue on my Ubuntu desktop.</p>
<h3 id="new-major-version">New major version?</h3>
<p>Ahhh by the way... What does it mean that we now have FluffyChat 1.0.0? It does NOT mean that the previous versions were not yet stable or ready for daily use. It just means that we make so many changes at once that we thought, bumping the first digit of our pseudo-semver version string might make sense. We totally messed up our versioning and are now going to do it better. Promised!!
What's next?
We are often asked: What is the roadmap of FluffyChat?
Well... we still don't have a clear roadmap and might never have. FluffyChat is completely driven by volunteers. But what I can say that we would like to do in the next months is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better QA -&gt; We would like to write some integration tests, push release candidates before new releases and involve everyone in testing them to offer the best stability possible.</li>
<li>Native video calls -&gt; Yes! There will soon land support for native video calls in the Matrix Dart SDK and we are going to implement this in FluffyChat.</li>
<li>Stories -&gt; Like you might know from SnapChat, WhatsApp or Instagram, stories are little messages you can send to all of your contacts and which will disappear after 24 hours. I would really like to implement this in FluffyChat!</li>
<li>Better notifications for iOS</li>
<li>Deeper support for spaces</li>
<li>Knocking feature</li>
<li>Drag&amp;Drop for web</li>
</ul>
<p>But as I said this is what we would like to do. We can't give any warranties on anything. We can only do our best. But you can help us if you like (You don't have to).</p>

<p><strong>Threads</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On Web, work continues on notifications and integration with homeserver APIs to improve user experience.</li>
<li>On Mobile, link sharing has been added and work is about to start on notifications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Polls</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Polls are nearly ready!  If you enable this feature in labs, you can create a poll with several options, and people can vote on it.</li>
<li>We’re working on the finishing touches, and the first version of polls will be available in a release (on Element Desktop, Web, Android and iOS) within a few weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community testing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We closed 34 encryption bugs which had been resolved by improvements to the workflows and user interfaces.</li>
<li>Due to the overwhelming success with bug squash sessions in the last few weeks, we are making these a regular feature. Our next session will be on Thursday 9 December at 17:00 UTC.</li>

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a>, a multiplatform Matrix SDK written in Kotlin, has grown up since the last release 6 month ago! It has it first release candidate for v1.0.0!</p>
<p>If you don't heard about Trixnity: Trixnity aims to be strongly typed, customizable and easy to use. You can register custom events and Trixnity will take care, that you can send and receive that type.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing is the new trixnity-client module. It provides a high level client implementation and allows you to easily implement clients for Desktop, Mobile and Web. You just need to render data from and passing user interactions to Trixnity. The key features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
exchangeable database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
fast cache on top of the database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
E2E (olm, megolm)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
verification</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
room list</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
timelines</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
user and room display name calculation</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
asynchronous message sending without caring about E2E stuff or online status</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
media support (thumbnail generation, offline &quot;upload&quot;, etc.)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
redactions</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, Trixnity only supports JVM in all modules, but JS and Native will follow soon (to be exact: when Kotlin 1.6.10 and ktor 2.0.0 is released). I also implemented the module trixnity-olm, which implements the wrappers of libolm for Kotlin JVM/JS/Native.</p>
<p>Cross signing is one of the next big features, I want to implement.</p>

                <h2 id="a-full-day-of-matrix-talks">A full day of Matrix talks</h2>
<p>This year, the Matrix.org Foundation is excited to host the first ever <em>Matrix.org Foundation and Community</em> devroom at FOSDEM. A full day of talks, demos and workshops around Matrix itself and projects built on top of Matrix.</p>
<p>Matrix is the open source project that publishes the Matrix open standard for secure, decentralised, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed reference implementations.</p>
<p>We encourage people working on the Matrix protocol or building on it in an open source project to submit a proposal! Note that companies are welcome to talk about the Matrix details of their open source projects, but marketing talks are not welcome.</p>
<p>We want this devroom to be a space where the Matrix community can show its work, where developers can talk about the challenges they faced and how they overcame them, and where people can get a glimpse of the future of the Matrix protocol and ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="talk-details">Talk Details</h2>
<p>The talks will be pre-recorded in January. They will be played during FOSDEM, followed by a session of live Q&amp;A depending on the format. During the playback of the talk, people will be able to comment and ask questions in the chat (via Matrix!).</p>
<p>The talks can follow one of three formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 min lightning talk, ideal to showcase your project and make people want to have a look at it</li>
<li>20 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A, for topics that can be covered briefly</li>
<li>50 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A for more complex subjects which need more focus</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly encourage you to prepare a demo when it makes sense, so people can actually see what your work looks like in practice!</p>
<p>Of course, the proposal must respect the FOSDEM terms as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conference language is English. All content must relate to Free and Open Source Software. By participating in the event you agree to the publication of your recordings, slides and other content provided under the same licence as all FOSDEM content (CC-BY).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="submitting-a-proposal">Submitting a Proposal</h2>
<p>Proposals must be <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22">submitted on FOSDEM's conference management system Pentabarf</a> before December 17th 2021. If you are not used to Pentabarf, you can follow this <a href="https://eyskens.me/beginners-guide-to-pentabarf/">beginners guide to Pentabarf</a>.</p>
<p>We expect to receive more requests than we have slots available. The devroom organisers (two community members and one core team rep) will be reviewing the proposals and accepting them based on the potential positive impact the project has on Matrix (as defined in by the Mission section of https://matrix.org/foundation).</p>
<p>If a project proposal has been turned down, it doesn't mean we don't believe it has good potential. Maintainers are invited to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> Matrix room to give it some visibility.</p>

<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (serverside aggregations) is getting lots of updates from Bruno in order to align the proposal with what is currently implemented in the wild (as it's easier to iterate on incremental improvements from a starting point grounded in reality). This MSC is a bit of a special case though, as it was implemented with stable prefixes before the MSC landed (in the before times...).</p>
<p>Regardless, thank you very much to Bruno for going through and finally untangling and help land aggregations in the spec! This MSC is one of four which describe how aggregations should work in Matrix, and it's great to see them finally being properly spec'd, especially as further features start to be built on top of them (such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440/">threading</a>!).</p>
<p>And finally, a further thank you to community members <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3509">an OpenAPI schema fix</a>!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a>!</p>
<p>This proposal aims to allow appservices to get ever greater visibility into what is happening on the homeserver, while still maintaining full process separation.</p>
<p>A lot of the time solutions to complex problems require knowing when a user has registered or logged in, with what name/3pids etc, when users change their emails, etc. Hooking into these non-room-based actions can help with developing useful features. Maybe you want an appservice that plays a sound effect whenever a user signs up to your homeserver!</p>
<p>These days, that is often achieved by homeserver implementation-specific solutions, such as <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/">modules</a> in Synapse. Being able to notify of these events using a standard API shape would be hugely beneficial to generalisation of projects.</p>
<p>So give the proposal a look over and review if that interests you!

<p>Some exciting MSCs this week, I've been waiting for server-side aggregations for long!</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">↗</a></h3>
<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As predicted last week, we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/23/synapse-1-47-1-released">released Synapse 1.47.1</a> on Tuesday. This is a security release which fixes an issue with Synapse's built-in media repository. Admins are strongly encouraged to upgrade.</p>
<p>Otherwise, relatively slow week: a handful of of the team have been away (Happy Thanksgiving, Americans!), but we <em>did</em> release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.48.0rc1">Synapse 1.48.0rc1</a>. Most importantly, this release candidate includes changes to improve the efficiency of large background updates from past releases, which should significantly reduce database load when upgrading. It also adds support for the <code>/v3</code> APIs defined in version 1.1 of the Matrix specification.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about 1.48 when it's formally released next week, but as always, we appreciate folks trying out the release candidates and letting us know how they behave.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mautrix/googlechat">mautrix-googlechat</a> has seen lots of improvements over the past few days. New features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bridging edits, deletions, reactions, formatting and read receipts in both directions (even <code>/rainbow</code> somewhat works from Matrix)</li>
<li>Bridging typing notifications and any types of files from Matrix to Google Chat</li>
<li>Bridging Google Meet links from Google Chat to Matrix</li>
<li>Syncing group members from Google Chat</li>
</ul>
<p>(edits and deletions are only available on Google Workspace accounts, not normal accounts. I have no idea why they did that, but that's just how Google Chat works 🤷)</p>
<p>There's still a bug where it sometimes silently stops receiving messages, which I'm currently trying to solve (or work around). After that I'll make a v0.3.0 release. Backfilling history may also happen in the near future</p>

<h3 id="matrix-webhook-receiver">Matrix Webhook Receiver <a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver">↗</a></h3>
<p>An add-on for the matrix-appservice-webhooks bridge. Webhooks are essentially web interfaces for applications to &quot;push&quot; data to. The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver">Matrix Webhook Receiver</a></p>
<p>Do you like to receive notifications in matrix?
Matrix Webhook Receiver (MWR) is an add-on for the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-webhooks">matrix-appservice-webhooks</a> bridge. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">Webhooks</a> are essentially web interfaces for applications to &quot;push&quot; data to.
The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.</p>
<p>This is where MWR comes in:
It can receive any (JSON) content, optionally reformat it nicely (customizable!), and forward it to the webhooks bridge which will post it to a room for you. If you are running any software service, there is a good chance it can notify you via webhooks!</p>
<p>Right now, several example configurations exist, ready for you to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>GitLab (including Community Edition/self hosted)</li>
<li>Ansible Tower/AWX</li>
<li>Grafana Alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here is the GitHub webhook as seen in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org">#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org</a>:
<img src="/blog/img/webhook_receiver.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>More examples of apps currently in development: Prometheus Alertmanager, Jellyfin</p>
<p>It is also easy to use to send messages from the commandline with standard tools (<code>curl</code>), e.g. for your cron jobs! See the README for an example.</p>
<p>Some other webhook matrix things exist, but often require</p>
<ul>
<li>➖ admin access to server (appservices)</li>
<li>➖ installing and running and maintaining a specific bot per service</li>
<li>➖ create and set up accounts and passwords for each bot to use</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, MWR requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>➖ matrix-appservice-webhooks set up on your server by your admin</li>
<li>➖ some knowledge of how to send POST requests for one time setup. I want to improve that, suggestions are welcome!</li>
<li>➕ MWR can be installed and run by anyone who can access the bridge</li>
<li>➕ one single MWR supports any amount of notifying apps!</li>
<li>➕ you don't need admin access to the server to add more apps</li>
<li>➕ no need to develop a bot/plugin to support new apps, just write a quick jinja template</li>
<li>➕ multiple people can use a single MWR instance by sharing HTTP basic auth credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>Other features:</p>
<ul>
<li>can post into encrypted rooms (see readme)</li>
<li>automatically generated API docs</li>
<li>message formatting presets including html markup or m.notice</li>
<li>arbitrarily customizable webhook URLs</li>
<li>list and manage currently installed webhooks in your browser (<a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver/blob/main/examples/GUI_screenshot.png">screenshot</a>)</li>

<h3 id="matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot">↗</a></h3>
<p>A multi purpose multi platform bridge, formerly known as matrix-github</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks! Some exciting new news on the bridge front: I've renamed <code>matrix-github</code> to <code>matrix-hookshot</code> to better reflect it's not-just-GitHub-ness. That's not all though, as there are new features too:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridge now supports <strong>Rust</strong> as a companion language (we're aiming to rewrite critical sections in rust). Some parts of the formatting code have already been rewritten.</li>
<li>The bridge now supports JIRA (full puppeting!)</li>
<li>The bridge now supports generic webhooks too, with the ability to write <strong>custom handling code</strong> inside the state event to process these hooks into pretty messages.</li>
<li>Basic support for GitHub discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the works:</p>
<ul>
<li>A provisioning API to hook into integration managers</li>
<li>More GitLab support</li>
<li>Better GitHub discussions support</li>
</ul>
<p>We're not quite ready for a 0.2.0 release, but please check us out at https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the 0.9.0 release last week, we have of course been busy fixing all the bugs different people reported. Messing around with the sticker pack editor and then leaving room should not make Nheko crash anymore. The problems where the flatpak has issues starting on Gnome systems are still under investigation. We thought we had a solution, but that seems to have broken other stuff! 💥</p>
<p>Apart from that we have been doing some after release party cleanup. Apart from some refactorings, you can now filter your rooms on whether they are a direct chat or not in the sidebar. This is in addition to the filters we already had for favourites, spaces and your other personal tags. User colors should also now be much less biased towards blue and jdenticons should have more variance. Expect the next release to be a much more colorful experience!</p>
<p>Speaking of colors, Twily made this awesome ZX Spectrum inspired logo after we changed our Gitlab bot to be more colorful! Check it out:

<p>Today is a good day for those calling me a spy, someone not wanting to care about privacy and for those who did publicly harass me for server_stats.</p>
<p>People using the API likely already noticed it wasn't reachable for a while. Effective immediately I am currently leaving all rooms  the bot is part of. This will take days or even months considering this are 6397 rooms at the time of writing. I am not going into the motives of why I am shutting it down. It comes down to personal reasons.</p>
<p>There won't be any dump of the data. The source will be kept public. Note though if anyone ever tries to run it that you need about 600GB of space for synapse, a lot of CPU, a lot of RAM and plenty of workers as this can easily crash synapse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Server_Stats was an incredibly useful project. It pains me a lot to see it go, but it pains me even further that its author got harassed. This is not an acceptable behaviour, and we are better than that as a community. Thanks for this incredible project MTRNord, it's been both exciting and useful.</p>

                <p>Friday already? Did this week already happen? It looked like the spacetime continuum was broken and we didn't know who did it. We needed witnesses to solve the case: did things really happen this week? And the witnesses showed up! A huge thanks to everyone in the Matrix community who reported their progress, and to everyone currently working on making awesome projects around Matrix!</p>
<p>The case is closed: the week has not been stolen from us. Time appears to have wings, and flies faster than we had anticipated.</p>

<p>A very very dense and exciting wrap up of what's happening these days in the Matrix space by Matrix Foundation co-founders Matthew &amp; Amandine! Matrix is stepping up a gear with blazing fast Sync v3, Threading Support, VoIP, VR, a new release of the Spec, always more monthly active users, a full security audit and progress on P2P.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h3 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h3>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3489">MSC3489: Sharing streams of location data</a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>This week we finally, finally had one of the aggregation-related MSCs, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> (event relationships) enter final comment period! This MSC, along with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issue-406544216">several others</a>, document the stuff that powers message edit, reactions, the upcoming threading and polls MSCs, and much more! So it's really great to see the MSCs start to actually land.</p>
<p>Speaking of threading <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> has had a good amount of review from the Spec Core Team last week. Threading in Matrix has been a long awaited feature for chat applications - as well as helping extend the flexibility of Matrix as a data structure even further. The MSC relies on both <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (or a modified version of it), so the latter will be an area of focus for review for next week.</p>
<h3 id="spec-prs">Spec PRs</h3>
<p>It seems that the recent <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">Matrix v1.1</a> has drummed up some more community support for spec PRs. Thank you to everyone who's sent in clarifications, changes and even typo fixes. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aankur12-1610">fixes to the OpenAPI fields, and for typo corrections in the spec copy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for helping review them. Thank you both! </p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2867">MSC2867: Marking rooms as unread</a>!</p>
<p>This is definitely a feature that I would love to have for chat. Note that this MSC proposes marking <em>a room</em> as unread, rather than a specific point in the room's timeline. This is intentional as noted in the document, as the latter is more complicated, as it intersects with sending out read receipts to other users.

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> we plan to release a <strong>security release, Synapse 1.47.1</strong> on the coming <strong>Tuesday, 23rd of November</strong>; see the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/18/pre-disclosure-upcoming-security-release-of-synapse-1-47-1">predisclosure</a>.</p>
<p>We released Synapse 1.47.0 after squashing a couple of problems related to database migrations remaining in 1.47.0rc2.  Briefly, this release includes</p>
<ul>
<li>new features for users of the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin</a> and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">module</a> APIs;</li>
<li>a number of long-standing bug fixes, including a thorny bug which prevented joining certain old rooms; and</li>
<li>continuing efforts to prototype new MSCs and improve type coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/17/synapse-1-47-0-released">blog post</a> has a better summary, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0">GitHub</a> has the full gory details.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.1">Sydent 2.5.1</a>, a minor release which improves the way we handle and log various error cases.</p>
<p>Thank you as ever to our community contributors, and everyone out there who's using Synapse to communicate!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> also reminds us</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we release the fix, the changes will be publicly known and bad actors will have the ability to deduce the vulnerability. Most servers don't run release candidates, so releasing the fix in an RC will mean there's a larger window for an attacker to exploit the problem. Internally, there will be an RC deployed to test homeservers and eventually matrix.org. This means we'll be able to confidently recommend the upgrade to server administrators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dkasak:termina.org.uk">dkasak</a> adds</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that's the very reason we have dedicated security releases, instead of just rolling the security fixes into a feature release. The security release doesn't contain anything new apart from the security fix so it minimizes the chance of things going wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep your servers up to date, and your users safe, administrators!</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.7.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement &quot;best effort&quot; basic IRC moderation in plumbed rooms if bot has ops on IRC</li>
<li>Allow configuring topic sync for plumbs (IRC&lt;-&gt;Matrix or one way)</li>
<li>Allow using forward slash (/) as MXID separator for IRC ghosts</li>
<li>Bump max mautrix version to &lt;0.12</li>
<li>Small fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Plumb moderation! If the bridge bot has ops on IRC it will do its best to map kicks and bans (regarding IRC users) from Matrix. This definitely isn't perfect and is meant as a convenience.</p>
<p>Topic synchronization is now configurable for plumbs as well to make it possible to share the same topic between an IRC channel and a plumbed Matrix room. Default is still off and it requires the bridge bot to have enough PL to work.</p>
<p>The separator for IRC ghosts can now be changed to forward slash (/) from the default underscore (_). This happens by modifying the regex in the registration file. Only do this for new installations and it will cause <em>all</em> IRC users to duplicate in rooms who you can't remove and probably other bad side effects as well. The default may be changed in the future.</p>
<p>There were lots of refactoring issues so I hope I fixed all of them 🙈.</p>
<p>Best effort your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>With new release, following things were added:</p>
<ul>
<li>arch linux AUR package</li>
<li>automatic room alias resolving, so you can use <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ttm:etke.cc">#ttm:etke.cc</a> instead of !XODRhTLplrymaFicdK:etke.cc</li>
<li>help message and human-readable errors</li>
<li>option to change message type (<code>m.text</code> or <code>m.notice</code>)</li>
<li>option to omit plaintext and send only html-formatted message (to get some more space for log)</li>
<li>option to override message type to <code>m.notice</code> if the command exits with non-zero exit code (by default <code>m.text</code> is sent, so you will get <code>m.notice</code> on failure)</li>
</ul>
<p>Go check out the <a href="https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/ttm">source code</a> and say hello in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ttm:etke.cc">#ttm:etke.cc</a></p>

<h3 id="version-2-3-0-released">Version 2.3.0 Released!</h3>
<p>simplematrixbotlib is an easy to use bot library for the Matrix ecosystem written in Python and based on matrix-nio. Version 2.3.0 adds support for additional configuration via config files and other methods. Currently, there is only one setting that can be changed, however many existing and future features will be able to be enabled or disabled via this config.</p>
<p>Example usage is shown below:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>&quot;&quot;&quot;
</span><span>random_user
</span><span>     !echo something
</span><span>echo_bot
</span><span>     something
</span><span>&quot;&quot;&quot;
</span><span>
</span><span>import simplematrixbotlib as botlib
</span><span>
</span><span>creds = botlib.Creds(&quot;https://home.server&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;)
</span><span>
</span><span>config = botlib.Config()
</span><span>config.load_toml(&quot;config.toml&quot;)
</span><span>
</span><span>bot = botlib.Bot(creds, config)
</span><span>PREFIX = &#39;!&#39;
</span><span>
</span><span>@bot.listener.on_message_event
</span><span>async def echo(room, message):
</span><span>     match = botlib.MessageMatch(room, message, bot, PREFIX)
</span><span>
</span><span>     if match.is_not_from_this_bot() and match.prefix() and match.command(&quot;echo&quot;):
</span><span>          await bot.api.send_text_message(room.room_id,
</span><span>                                &quot; &quot;.join(arg for arg in match.args()))
</span><span>
</span><span>bot.run()
</span></code></pre>
<p>An example of a toml config file is shown below.</p>
<pre data-lang="toml" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-toml "><code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml"><span>[</span><span style="color:#808080;">simplematrixbotlib.config</span><span>]

<h3 id="mjolnir-v1-2-1-released">Mjölnir v1.2.1 released</h3>
<ul>
<li>New feature: if a user on your homeserver reports abuse, Mjölnir may now show the abuse report in your moderation room and offer you two-click moderation options. This feature is considered a preview for the time being.</li>
<li>Performance improvements for protections that need to lock back in the history of a room, decreasing the number of cases in which we could end up timing out.</li>
<li>Many improvements to testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Any rumor of a v1.2.0 Docker image borked by yours truly is sadly true. There should be no risk in 1.2.0 but, to be on the safe side, if you have updated to 1.2.0, please update to 1.2.1.</p>

<p>An important note on the interesting projects using Matrix for the login: those are community projects, and there are MSCs in the works to &quot;do it right&quot; at the Spec level!</p>
<p>As Matthew Hodgson <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29242445">reported in a comment on Hacker News</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The direction we're headed in the Matrix spec core team is instead towards replacing Matrix's current auth mechanisms with normal Open ID Connect (rather than wrapping our own OIDC-like thing, as we do today) - as per https://github.com/sandhose/matrix-doc/blob/msc/sandhose/oauth2-profile/proposals/2964-oauth2-profile.md The common login flow would then be for users to be authed by their server using a trusted OIDC identity provider, rather than ever trusting arbitrary clients with their credentials.</p>

<p>I have compiled <a href="https://austinhuang.me/matrix-homeservers.html">a list of public homeservers</a> available for registration, since previous such efforts to make these homeservers more discoverable fell through. This list serves as a sanitized version of the asra.gr list, with only homeservers intended for public consumption included. It is a static list and does not include pings, but rather than focusing on the technical aspect, my list has an emphasis on the written rules of a homeserver, which I believe to play a larger role in the Matrix experience. Hope this can spark other efforts in maintaining a better list!</p>

<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>

<p>Extensible events is something that has been a long time coming in Matrix. It unlocks so much potential, and is even currently being built on (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> (polls)). Definitely one of the next big ticket items to tackle in the medium term.

It exposes new functionality for <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">pluggable modules</a> and new endpoints to the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">Admin API</a>. We've fixed a bunch of long-standing bugs and continued to drive forward efforts to improve documentation and code quality. Thank you to all of our contributors!</p>
<p>With future releaes in mind, we've been continuing work to support threading and E2EE application services. We've also been prototyping a new Admin API to remove users from all rooms belonging to a certain space.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we've been doubling down on our effort to improve reliability and maintainability of our services as a whole. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent">Sydent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a> have a number of PRs in flight for both, aimed at improving type coverage and driving down error noise in the logs. We've drafted a blog post to summarise the process of type annotating mypy (keep your eyes out for that one). We also worked to make the matrix.org database more resilient, and made changes to improve the experience of rolling out upgrades to Synapse en masse.</p>

<p>Do you love bugs as much as I do? ♥🐛♥</p>
<p>I guess not. For that reason bug fixing in Nheko for the next release continues. We fixed a super annoying issue, where loading keys from the online backup could make Nheko stuck in a flickering mode with no way to interact with it anymore. You can now also click anywhere on a read receipt to open someones profile instead of just their avaitar, edited messages now also show as redacted, if only the original message got redacted and don't lose the reply in encrypted rooms, if the edit was sent by a client, that is not Nheko. You also used to get logged out after registration, which should finally be resolved. There were also a bazillion translation updates! Thank you, everyone who contributed to those.</p>
<p>We also finally merged the prettier video player, which also fixes a video playback issue on macOS. Try it out and give us feedback on it!</p>
<p>We are still hunting down some last bugs, but expect the release soon now. In the meantime, I did start summarizing the changes, if you want to see what will be in the next release: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#090----unreleased</p>
<p>That's all and have a great weekend!</p>

<h3 id="threads">Threads</h3>
<ul>
<li>Message threading is coming to Element! If you haven’t yet, head to develop.element.io and ensure ‘Enable threading’ is turned on in Labs to test on the web.</li>
<li>We’re spinning up development on iOS &amp; Android as we speak. </li>
<li>We’ll also be running the first Threads community testing session next Thursday (18th Nov) at 17:00 GMT. Come join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#element-community-testing:matrix.org">#element-community-testing:matrix.org</a>!</li>
<li>Threads are backed by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="polls">Polls</h3>
<ul>
<li>We also recently started implementing Polls.</li>
<li>On the web/desktop, we’ve implemented poll creation and displaying them in the timeline. Next up is implementing voting.</li>
<li>Mobile development started recently too, with Android slightly ahead of iOS.</li>

<li>We recently started a project to improve the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-meta/issues/56">info architecture</a>/layout of our apps, starting on the web first. We’re merging our first tweaks and experiments soon, so expect exciting things to be landing on develop!</li>
<li>We’re continuing to implement more Space creation &amp; management support on iOS. We’ve added in Space creation screens (implemented in SwiftUI!) and we’re polishing inviting people to Spaces.</li>
<li>We’ve also been conducting user research to see what parts of the app are tripping users up, and working on fixes to various issues. Expect tweaks to land soon!</li>
<li>Otherwise, we’re also merging &amp; testing release candidates for upcoming releases, merging several branches.</li>
</ul>

<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3217">MSC3217: Soft kicks</a>!</p>
<p>Other than this sounding like something out of a workout routine, soft kicks are proposed as a hint to clients that the user has been kicked from the room, but that it was not out of moderation, but for a technical reason (the example given disconnection from an IRC network). The client can then present a different UX as opposed to a normal, &quot;hard&quot; kick.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.46.0">Synapse 1.46</a>! This release includes a fix for the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> from 1.44 which could cause smaller hosts to lock up when clients reconnected after some time offline.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.46 also includes experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440: Threading via <code>m.thread</code> relation</a>, a big step toward threaded messaging in Matrix. It's otherwise mainly a bugfix release, as we've spent much of our time reviewing infrastructure and making plans to improve our resilience should we experience hardware failures similar to what took out matrix.org two weeks ago.</p>
<p>We continue working toward a prototype implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775: Lazy loading over federation</a>, starting with setting up automated infrastructure to repeatedly measure the join speeds of assorted large, public rooms. Our goal is to have a rough proof of concept for lazy room joins by the end of the year.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.0">Sydent 2.5.0</a>! In addition to fixing bugs, this release passes <code>mypy --strict</code>, uses Jinja2 for templates, and supports the <code>room_type</code> field from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3288">MSC3288</a> to better differentiate between invitations to rooms and invitations to Spaces.</p>

The main change is switching to the new WhatsApp multidevice API, which means the phone doesn't need to be connected 24/7 anymore. The release also includes a new backfilling system using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a>, and making the relaybot mode less special-cased and more like what mautrix-signal does.</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.5.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow opening multiple simultaneous connections to the same network</li>
<li>New STOP/STAHP ROOM command to end a long paste flood</li>
<li>Clear channel send queue if the user gets kicked to prevent continuing flood on rejoin</li>
<li>New KB ROOM command to do a proper kick &amp; ban (contributed by GitHub user @blastrock, thanks!)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most useful feature this week is having the ability to open multiple connections to the same network. This can be used to plumb channels with a secondary connection while using the bridge as yourself with the main one. You can also STAHP long pastes from being actually sent out completely to a channel if you weren't careful enough on Matrix side.</p>
<p>Upgrading from previous version to v1.5.0 will cause a small migration for every channel/pm that is open so it might take a little longer for the first startup to complete. If no multiple network connections are opened it is safe to downgrade but if someone uses the feature it will cause shenanigans for the duplicate networks in the older version.</p>
<p>Inject your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>We are preparing for a release! That means, if you are translator, we could use your help to get our translations <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/">updated</a> and if you want to have a bug fixed before release, now is the time to report it or complain about it! Please come and see us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> for complaints and questions!</p>
<p>We saw a lot of translation updates by Linerly, Priit and Thulinma already. The click ghosting issue in the room list should be fixed as well as the crash when accepting an invite from your browser. You can now register on matrix.org again, after fighting with some... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3471">reality deforming wording in the spec</a>. Notifications on macOS now use the &quot;modern&quot; API for notifications, including grouping notifications by room. (Expect more fancy improvements there in the future!) The warning about mentioning the whole room now vanishes properly, hiding space children from the roomlist now doesn't hide them from the space itself anymore, the loading spinner shouldn't show in a fully loaded room again, the room directory search bar is now focused by default and a few smaller fixes.</p>
<p>We also completed the bootstrapping UI now. This means you get prompted for unverified devices, when your device isn't verified or when cross-signing isn't configured for your account yet and you are given ways to remedy that.</p>
<p>We have a few more bug fixes we want to land before the release, so don't expect it tomorrow, but we have the featureset down now. And if you thought the changes listed in this snippet are long, wait for the full release changelog. It will probably take a few days for me to tidy that up and I think this will be our biggest release yet! Happy testing, everyone!</p>
