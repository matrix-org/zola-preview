<h2 id="ietf-mimi-dma">IETF/MIMI/DMA</h2>
<p>With the Extensible Events Core (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) being accepted last week, the focus now turns to all the other extensible event MSCs for images, files, etc. How does extensible events relate to IETF/MIMI/DMA, you ask? In our mission for having Matrix be the standard for interoperability, we need a content format that works for everyone. Events prior to MSC1767 <em>could</em> work with enough effort, though MSC1767's system makes things <em>a lot</em> easier when representing arbitrarily complex messaging features.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to TWIM for progress in this area. It's a relatively slow process, but we're working through it.</p>

<p>This week's random MSC is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2785">MSC2785: Event notification attributes and actions</a>! This is effectively a replacement for the push rules system we have today, and a super interesting one (how do you even design a notifications system?). Focus has shifted a little bit since this MSC was first opened, though its ideas still comes up frequently when aiming to make smaller changes to push rules today.</p>

<p>We released another breaking change this week :p bump to v0.17.0</p>
<p>Introduced a couple of new features like upgrading voice calls to video calls, some neat helper functions for group calls. Fixes include cleaning group call state events, fixing the searchEvent function, a way to get own profile from server and then fallback to room profile and also fixes to the /markasdm command.</p>
<p>Complete changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>fix: ability to upgrade audio calls to video calls (td)</li>
<li>chore: add a fetchOwnProfileFromServer method which tries to get ownProfile from server first, disk then (td)</li>
<li>fix: clean expired member state events in group calls (td)</li>
<li>fix: hasActiveGroup call now checks all group calls (td)</li>
<li>fix: Check if argument is valid mxid in /maskasdm command (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>fix: Fake User object (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>fix: Request key in searchEvent method crashes because of wrong preconditions (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>refactor: Check config at file sending after placing fake event and add error handling (Krille)</li>
<li>chore: bump dart to 2.18 (Nicolas Werner)</li>
<li>fix: setMicrophoneMuted is now async to match setVideoMuted (td)</li>
<li>fix: implement activeGroupCallEvents to get all active group call state events in a room (td)</li>
<li>refactor: (BREAKING CHANGE) move staleCallChecker and expires_Ts stuff to an extension on Room, instead of Voip because it makes much more sense per room rather than on voip, also makes testing easier (td)</li>
<li>fix: populate local groupCalls list on instantiating VOIP() (td)</li>
<li>fix: starting stale call checker is now handled by the sdk itself because clients can forget to do so (td)</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net">K√©vin Commaille</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been a while since our last update in November, but it just means we have been busier than ever! A lot has happened to follow changes in the Matrix specification as well as fixing bugs in our codebase or making our API easier to use.</p>
<p>We have released Ruma 0.8.0 and 0.8.1 at the beginning of the month. It was long overdue with a lot of improvements, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stabilized support for all the changes and features of Matrix 1.4 and Matrix 1.5</li>
<li>Making our request types use owned instead of borrowed data</li>
<li>Replacing <code>ruma_api!</code> with more flexible macros</li>
<li>Fixing the serialization and deserialization of redacted events</li>
<li>Reorganizing our <code>*EventContent</code> traits to allow event content types to only implement what is really needed</li>
<li>Removing sensitive data from the <code>Debug</code>-format representation of our types </li>
</ul>
<p>And on the 15th we released Ruma 0.8.2 with a few bug fixes but also stabilized support for all the changes and features of Matrix 1.6!</p>
<p>Although it might be less visible in our changelogs, we also regularly add support for MSCs, and try to keep our implementations up-to-date. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sliding sync (MSC3575 and others, currently used by Element X via the matrix-rust-sdk)</li>
<li>Extensible events (MSC1767 and others)</li>
<li>Push rule condition for room version features (MSC3931 and MSC3932)</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have a bunch of issues opened if you feel like contributing, so come say hi!</p>

<p>Recently, <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp">Whisper.cpp</a> took off and I started to <a href="https://github.com/MTRNord/transcribe-matrix-live">tinker</a> with it. Earlier I did already try to transcribe Matrix Live <a href="https://en.miki.community/wiki/Draft:Matrix_Live_S0704">manually</a>. Today I combined the 2 things.</p>
<p>As a Result, I am trying to better/faster build small pages with Shownotes and a Text Transcription of Matrix Live episodes each week.</p>
<p>The first one can be found at https://en.miki.community/wiki/Matrix_Live_S08E17 for the last episode.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>In keeping with our (roughly) quarterly release schedule of the Matrix Spec, v1.6 is due to be released on February 14th. That's only four days from now! The headline features are a new Jump-to-Date Client-Server API (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>) and initial work on speeding up room joins (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706">MSC3706</a>), along with many other fixes and clarifications to the spec text itself.</p>
<p>If you haven't yet seen it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPJ9zFV5IE">Matthew's Matrix 2.0 talk</a> at FOSDEM walks through some of the upcoming features in the spec. Each will land in subsequent, future releases of the spec. Once all have landed, we'll call that Matrix 2.0 (in name and in actual version number).</p>
<p>Extensible events is one such upcoming feature. While the core proposal outlining the feature (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) will land in v1.6, the smattering of MSCs which describe how various event types will work under extensible events will span multiple upcoming spec versions. Watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2974">MSC2974: Widgets: Capabilities re-exchange</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC is relatively simple; proposing a method for widgets to ask the client for additional capabilities after it has already been initialised. Doing so allows for increased security and privacy workflows, as the widget need only ask for access to certain pieces of data at the point that it needs it (rather than all up front).</p>
<p>A similar transition of permission granting happened in mobile devices and apps. Initially mobile apps would ask for all permissions they would need up front - which users would blindly accept. These days, mobile OS's have shifted to a model where individual permissions are requested upon attempting to complete an action in an app. This way, users have better context on the reason for the permissions request. (Oddly, browsers have yet to reach this stage with extensions - those still ask for all permissions up front.)</p>
<p>Do check out the proposal and its technical details if widgets are your thing!</p>

<p>The UK Online Safety Bill is shaping up to be a catastrophic piece of legislation, mandating clientside scanning of end-to-end-encrypted communication to attempt to intercept CSAM (child sexual abuse material). By adding the requirement for a scanner which executes ambiguous rulesets to submit encrypted content to the authorities, it would massively undermine the security of encryption: you simply wouldn't be able to trust whether content stays encrypted, or the rules used to scan it and submit it to the authorities. We wrote about it at https://element.io/blog/the-online-safety-bill-an-attack-on-encryption/ to try to sound the alarm before it's too late.</p>

<p>Although having lost a lot of popularity in the last few years, <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> has a great performance and tiny asset size, which means great Matrix support for tiny browsers like on <a href="https://www.kaiostech.com/">KaiOS</a> or for small-size projects and games that wish to use Matrix as a simple back-end.</p>
<p>I hope to release a version v1.0.0 in the near future, but I wanted to share my first breakthrough as I managed to write a simple program that sends message (and state) events in versions that the homeserver supports. See the image below!</p>
<p>Support will mostly be from spec version v1.2 and on, but some legacy endpoints will remain available. You can find the project on <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk">GitHub</a> for now. Hopefully I'll have more to show you in the next few weeks!

<p>Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org">Ivan, the Language Mangler</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in the Rust SDK team is a bit special. We are making our farewells to Ben, as he is leaving Element. He will continue to hang around as its new gig involves Matrix, feel free to take a glance at <a href="https://effektio.org/">Effektio</a>. Once our tears have dried, we carried on with our current main focus: Sliding Sync, and Crypto.
The Sliding Sync client has seen improvements in terms of documentation, along with some clean ups, and stabilisation patches (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1439">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1440">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1449">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1482">4</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1467">5</a>‚Ä¶). The team has decided it's time to write a small testing framework to improve the safety of this code specifically. Indeed, it's quite challenging to test it, and as it's a fundamental piece of the user experience in ElementX and other Matrix clients, there is no debate to have: the quality requirements are high.
The Crypto part now. The Crypto Store has been refactored a little bit (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1477">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1457">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1462">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1465">4</a>‚Ä¶). There is other patches to handle inconsistencies if they happen, and to always mark our own device as verified (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1452">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1456">2</a>).
Apart from that, they have been many work on setting and exposing OpenTelemetry logs for multiple clients and platforms. It will help the teams to coordinate on bugs when they happen.
Finally, a new release of the <code>matrix-sdk-crypto-js</code> has landed: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1444">v0.1.0-alpha.4</a>.
Outside Matrix itself, we have a merge window for <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">the uniffi-async project</a>, along with more contributions to improve errors (<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1468">1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1467">2</a>). It means that the bindings to Swift and Kotlin will soon support native Rust async functions. More contributions are in the pipe to generate documentations for the foreign languages (Swift, Kotlin etc.) directly from Rust documentations.
I will conclude by saying that we were also quite busy preparing the demos for FOSDEM. It was a huge success and it makes us extremely happy :-).</p>

<p>Since 2017, <a href="https://t2bot.io/">t2bot.io</a> has provided communities on Matrix bots and bridges to use for free, and while there‚Äôs no plan to charge for access, the cost of running the service is about $12k USD/year just to exist.</p>
<p>Since August 2020, t2bot.io‚Äôs primary source of funding has been from the Matrix.org Foundation, though with the Foundation‚Äôs latest focus on raising funds for itself, it feels like the right thing to do is get t2bot.io independently funded.</p>
<p><strong>If you are able, please donate to t2bot.io <a href="https://t2bot.io/donations/">here</a>.</strong> All donations go towards the cost of operation, with any excess (if t2bot.io is so lucky‚Ä¶) going towards hiring developers to work on/build bridges as well as into the Foundation to thank them for keeping t2bot.io online all these years.</p>
<p>Currently, t2bot.io serves <em>86 thousand</em> Discord and Telegram communities, bridging 325 thousand users <em>each month</em>, and <em>11.3 million</em> users since 2017. There‚Äôs also 962 thousand rooms with a t2bot.io user in them, leaving only about 94 thousand rooms as archived, across 25 thousand different homeservers.</p>
<p>Operating at this scale requires, well, $12k USD per year: if you‚Äôre able, please consider donating. There‚Äôs also a question of whether t2bot.io should even be operating at this scale in the first place: Matrix is all about decentralization and owning your own conversations, which naturally means there should be many smaller bridges for communities or even a discord.com-provided bridge for everyone to use. For the time being though, t2bot.io is offered as a convenience and aims to adapt itself as needed to keep providing value.</p>
<p>Questions, concerns, etc are best discussed in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#help:t2bot.io">#help:t2bot.io</a> on Matrix. Nearly every detail of how t2bot.io works is intended to be shared openly, which includes the financial aspect of running the service, so ask away üôÇ</p>

<h4 id="fosdem23-community-meetup-matrix-org"><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org">#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org</a></h4>
<p>Exactly one week ago, a good chunk of the community gathered in Brussels for the <strong>Matrix Community Meetup/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a></strong> in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/fringe/">fringe</a> of FOSDEM.</p>
<p>While we expected the need for everyone to just meet and exchange their ideas, we still wanted to provide a framework for things to get going.
After a &quot;quick&quot; introductory round of everyone presenting themselves and their connection to Matrix, constantly expanding the circle around the table as more people kept pouring through the <a href="https://hsbxl.be/enter">pink gate</a>, we built a timetable of topics from the introduction using the <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-barcamp/tree/nic/env/fosdem-2023">BarCamp Widget</a> developed and slightly modified for the physical BarCamp use case by Nordeck.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/hFUNxEWMiTLgMXRzZzWKfyRt.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Having this way to find people to discuss a topic was a great way to get started, and the discussions quickly took their own directions from there. Highlights included discussions about topics very dear to some people and finding others who are also interested, deep dives into the protocol, brainstorming, or even meeting random strangers on the (notoriously packed) tram to have technical discussions with. A lot of online friends connected, a lot of new friends were made, and even some old friends got to reconnect. It felt very familiar very quickly and leaving Ananace feeling &quot;I've spoken to more friendly and passionate people this last week than I've done for the last six months, that's for certain.&quot; DMs were opened and master keys were cross signed thanks to IRL QR code scanning. Drinks were drunk, Pizza was eaten, and Swedish candy was appreciated to the fullest extent. The scenery only added to the real REAL hackerspace experience, having to <del>make a call</del> ping on Matrix to have someone open the gate to the &quot;desolated courtyard, surrounded by crumbling buildings with broken windows&quot; and a door literally labeled &quot;A&quot;.</p>

<p>As the organisers, Yan and I (HarHarLinks) want to express our gratitude to the incredibly hospitable people from Hackerspace Brussels (<a href="https://hsbxl.be">HSBXL</a>), especially <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jurgen_g:matrix.org">Jurgen</a> who helped a lot with prep in advance and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@beachy:50m4.eu">BeachyHead</a> who spent the whole day accommodating the sudden wave of arriving Matrix enthusiasts. Further, we would like to thank <a href="https://famedly.com">Famedly</a> and <a href="https://nordeck.net">Nordeck</a> who's generosity enabled us to provide free-as-in-beer food üçï and drinks üçª to everyone at the event through their financial support.</p>
<p>We are overjoyed by the incredible response by the community. Most of the people came there for a reason, and that was Matrix. And then they used the time to have some good time together. It was nice that we could help satisfy the huge demand for a get-together in the meat-space with this event.
We look forward to more physical meetups in the future (watch this space!).
Personally I had the best FOSDEM ever, and not just because it was my first one! üòâ</p>

                <p>For the past two years, FOSDEM couldn‚Äôt happen in-person. Fortunately we could
help, and Matrix hosted the world's largest free &amp; open source software
conference online! This year we were finally back in-person‚Ä¶ but not only.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/15/how-we-hosted-fosdem-2021-on-matrix">The set-up we have arranged in 2021</a>
and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/07/hosting-fosdem-2022-on-matrix">polished in 2022</a>
has proved to be robust and served us well during the pandemic. Returning to an
in-person conference didn‚Äôt mean we had to throw it all away‚Ä¶ quite the
opposite!</p>
<p>This year the OSS community could gather in-person, go see each other‚Äôs stands,
and attend all too few of all the fascinating talks the speakers had prepared
for us‚Ä¶ but the conference was yet more.. Some of us couldn‚Äôt make it in person
but could attend FOSDEM online from its Matrix Space. Devrooms were broadcasted
live into the Matrix rooms where devroom managers and speakers could interact
with the online audience.</p>
<p>In total, thousands of users joined us online, both locally and remotely as 
seen from the FOSDEM homeserver: an amazing audience given the possibility to be
on site.</p>
<p>For us, it was also an opportunity to announce Matrix 2.0 to a live audience!
Matrix 2.0 doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre making breaking changes in the spec. It‚Äôs more of
a nickname we gave to the milestone <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/08/15/the-matrix-summer-special-2022#matrix-20">we had promised in summer to deliver by the
end of the year</a>
and had far too much giving the mother of all demos to a packed room of nearly
1500 people.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-ever-in-person-matrix-devroom">The first ever in-person Matrix devroom</h2>
<p>This year was also the first ever in-person devroom for the Matrix Foundation
and Community. We had many proposals and could have used the whole day, but we
had to share with many other deserving communities. We‚Äôre extremely grateful to
FOSDEM organisers for the devroom‚Ä¶ and it was a huge success! At many points the
room was completely packed, with no seats left at all.</p>
<p>We could <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/matrix/">shoehorn 8 talks</a> in
the in-person devroom. Picking them was really difficult! When one of the
speakers unfortunately called in sick, the devroom healed the wound and filled
the gap very quickly.</p>
<p>The devroom started with a quick intro to Matrix from Matthew &amp; Amandine.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dPgYy-Y4f7w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Florian followed with a talk about MatrixRTC to explore what Matrix can do
beyond instant messaging</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P--LwIB3deA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Then Matthew did an awesome demo of Third Room and ‚Äú3D widgets‚Äù (user generated
content) that can be embedded into its worlds. Of course with a nice ‚ÄúThe Matrix
in Matrix‚Äù scene.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nG8qJ4on00Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Stunning 3D worlds are great, but the most popular use case for Matrix today is
instant messaging. And we did a lot as the Matrix Foundation to significantly
improve the performance with Sliding Sync, using matrix-rust-sdk as the showcase
implementation. Kegan and Ben covered Sliding Sync and matrix-rust-sdk
respectively, while Mauro showed us how Element X, the first client to use it,
doesn‚Äôt stop here and goes way beyond to provide a snappy, sturdy, polished
client.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5iIs1zWuVOU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Kim and Oliver from Nordeck made an interesting presentation about how widgets
can make Matrix a rich app creation environment.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hhEUe414scU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The Trixnity project then introduced their fast, multi-purpose, well-tested SDK.
A talk you don‚Äôt want to miss, particularly if you‚Äôre into Kotlin.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zDftIZm-DZ0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Pierre from Technostructures introduced us to <a href="https://technostructures.org/projects/kazarma/">Kazarma</a>
a bridge between Matrix and ActivityPub. In Pierre‚Äôs own words: ‚Äúwe talked a lot
about interoperability, and we found it sad that we talked about
interoperability for proprietary platforms, not with alternative decentralised
networks, so we tried doing that‚Äù. And they did. Bravo Pierre and the team!</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3olH1aUCkQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Finally Yan concluded the in-person devroom with a speedrun of all the Matrix
projects he could find around. The video is not out yet, so we‚Äôll add it to the
second follow-up blog post: the one with the online devroom conferences!</p>
<h2 id="matrix-for-more-than-remote-attendance">Matrix for more than remote attendance</h2>
<p>FOSDEM staff used the Matrix rooms for on-site support. Whether the camera was
blurry, microphones didn‚Äôt work, or there was a missing power plug: staff could
be notified and answer very quickly before sending someone to actually solve the
issue. But it also allowed staff to notify devroom managers for small
adjustments, if speakers ever disappeared from the scene.</p>
<p>Staff also told us Matrix worked much more reliably than anything other than
walkie talkies from a coordination perspective and was more versatile. They
consider narrowing down their use of walkies next year in favour of a deeper
integration with Matrix. We‚Äôre excited to see that Matrix was yet again a great
solution in the stressful, high paced context of a conference that gathered
several thousand people in-person and several thousand more online.</p>
<h2 id="attending-in-person">Attending in-person</h2>
<p>Finally, a large part of the joy of attending FOSDEM comes from the people you
meet there. The least we can say is that our stand was busy. We ran out of
stickers and medium size t-shirts early on Sunday morning, but above all we had
plenty of interesting discussions.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/fosdem2023_stand_blurred.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>A few people discovered Matrix during FOSDEM and were blown away by messages
making it from Slack to Discord before their eyes, all thanks to Matrix and
bridges. The overwhelming majority of people who came to us were already happy
users willing to discuss architecture, our plans for the future, or even to
verify each other with QR Codes or emoji.</p>
<p>We want to thank the FOSDEM staff for organising this edition and using Matrix
again: a successful return to the in-person format that builds on the online
experience of the past two years. See you next year folks!</p>

as of this release, faster joins are on by default! This means that when joining a room for 
the first time, Synapse 1.76.0rc2 will request a partial join from the other server by default. 
Previously, server admins had to opt-in to this using an experimental config flag.</p>
<p>If you'd rather opt out of this feature for the time being you can use this setting</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-yaml "><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="background-color:#282828;color:#569cd6;">experimental</span><span>:

</span></code></pre>
<p>in your server config. Take it for a spin and let us know how it goes -- please file an issue <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=BUG_REPORT.yml">here</a> if you find anything out of the ordinary after joining a room.</p>
<p>In addition, this release updates the default room version to v10, adds support for push rules for Polls, and so much more.

<p>The last week i worked on getting Dendrite to work on the I2P Network. It makes use of the existing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone">Pinecone</a> infrastructure which gets enabled to dial on I2P with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone/compare/main...BieHDC:pinecone:main">a small patch</a>. This has the main advantage that servers will automatically discover each other if they share a node and you don't have to seek out others in the distributed network. I host a 24/7 Seednode for I2P right now. I have also put the work in to enable a landing page just like a monolith deployment would have and you can just <a href="http://3do33c5purkmidtcdxkqindjplcm3l6uv6qysc5a3pfa7fd7lv6q.b32.i2p/">browse to it</a>. This hopefully increases the visibility too!
However, it can also dial into the Clearnet too. It is hardcoded to the Seednode run by the matrix and dendrite developers themselves and it is disabled by default, but can be enabled with a command line switch. It effectively is making a bridge between the I2P Network and Clearnet. In order to bridge the gap between Pinecone based servers and normal matrix servers as well, I have also made a very simple <a href="https://github.com/BieHDC/go-matrix2matrix-noobbridge">matrix2matrix bridge</a> which just connects to 2 (or more) Homeservers and exchanges the messages between 2 (or more) rooms. It also supports bridging and not-bridging files of any kind.
You could add other networks too as long as you can tie them together with Pinecone. For example, the <a href="https://github.com/eyedeekay/onramp">library</a> i use to connect to I2P also supports Tor and it can be added to function just like the I2P implementation. All you need is something that exposes a HTTP Client and a listener.
My personal goal is to make matrix independent from domain registrars, open ports, static IP addresses and anything that makes self hosting harder than it should be and thankfully all the software we need is already written, it just takes someone to tie it together.</p>

<p>This week, <a href="https://github.com/ahal">ahal</a> contributed the <em>linkify</em> module, which implements a generic way to create substitutions based on regular expressions and their matches in Matrix messages.</p>
<p>For instance, it's possible to create a substitution so that when someone writes &quot;issue #21&quot; in the room, the bot will answer with &quot;https://github.com/bnjbvr/trinity/issues/21&quot;. And since it's configurable at runtime, you can create such substitutions with any format you want, create automated links as you'd like, and configure it per Matrix channel. This opens up a new world of possibilities! Also this generalizes what this bot's predecessor, <em>botzilla</em>, did with 3 different commands for expanding Github / Gitlab / Bugzilla links, so Trinity has now reached feature parity with it!

<h3 id="performance-improvements-and-fosdem-23">performance improvements and FOSDEM 23</h3>
<p>The most exciting change regarding more performance are asynchronous database transactions. This means that the cache stores values not only for reading from, but also for writing to the database. So every database transaction is executed asynchronously to the caller who changes values. This allows really fast sync processing even on slow systems like smartphones. This also removes delays in the UI, because changes are immediately applied (on the cache level). This was a problem with databases which don't allow parallel write transactions (like realm). This problem also seems to appear in Element Android and its realm database (at least with my huge account). Despite that, I've made some other improvements regarding the cache and sync processing.</p>
<p>I also added a simple benchmark to see how good the improvements are. The test creates 50 encrypted rooms and sends 10 messages to each room. The database is in-memory, but writing is simulated with a 10ms and reading with 5ms delay. Before the optimizations the sync needed 20s to be processed. After the optimizations it needed 5s. So 400% faster. In practice, with my relatively huge matrix account (200+ rooms) the initial sync took 2.5s (after waiting 30s for the server response) on the desktop. But this is just a teaser. If you want to know more, you'll have to wait another week for my Trixnity talk on FOSDEM 23. Contact me if you have topics that should definitely be included in the talk. 30 min are unfortunately filled quickly.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>There were no new MSCs this week.</em></li>

<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>This week and the week afterwards, the Spec Core Team are mostly focused on improvements to Matrix that we'd like to show off at FOSDEM 2023 this year! That consists of MSCs related to Faster Room Joins (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3943">MSC3943</a> among others) and Extensible Events (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>).</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3230">MSC3230: Spaces top level order</a>!</p>
<p>This defines an algorithm and a data structure that can be used to order one's top-level list of Spaces and have that order sync across all of their clients. Rooms and spaces within a Space continue to have their order <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#ordering-of-children-within-a-space">defined</a> by an <code>order</code> key (and failing that, the <code>origin_server_ts</code> field) in the corresponding <code>m.space.child</code> event of their parent's Space's state.</p>
<p>I won't get into the details of the algorithm here (or its criticisms), but feel free to jump into the MSC and take a look!</p>

<h3 id="synapse-website">Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week the Synapse team has been finishing a sprint on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3902">faster joins</a> project.
As a reminder, this is a year-long project to make Synapse quickly join a new room by lazily loading some of its state history in the background.
It is particularly needed when joining large rooms with lots of members: joining such rooms is bottlenecked on fetching, serialising, deserialising and validating a <em>huge</em> list of <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#mroommember">room member events</a>.
While the core logic and machinery has been in place for some time now, this sprint has concentrated on two pain points:</p>
<ul>
<li>making faster joins to work on Synapse installations <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/workers.html">using workers</a>, and</li>
<li>remaining edge cases needed for a good client UX.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="call-for-testers">Call for testers</h2>
<p>We hope to ship the first iteration of faster joins support in Synapse 1.76.0.
The release candidate <code>1.76.0rc1</code> will be released on Tuesday 24th Jan.
<strong>We'd like to encourage homeserver administrators to try it out</strong> before the release proper.
Once you've upgraded, try joining rooms which no-one else on your server is joined to.
We graciously welcome any bug reports---please file <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=BUG_REPORT.yml">GitHub issues</a> if you find anything out of the ordinary after joining a room.</p>
<h2 id="synapse-1-75">Synapse 1.75</h2>
<p>We released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.75.0">Synapse 1.75</a> (see <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/01/19/synapse-1-75-released">blog</a>) this week. Its highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>performance fixes for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14786">/sync</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14263">/hierarchy</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14750">support</a> for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636">RFC7636</a> when using OAuth 2.0 (which enables <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9389">SSO via Twitter</a>); and</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="fixes-1">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Push rules have seen several tweaks and fixes, which should, for example, fix notifications for <code>m.receipt</code></li>
<li>Outgoing presence will now correctly be sent to newly joined hosts</li>
<li>Fixes the <code>/_dendrite/admin/resetPassword/{userID}</code> admin endpoint to use the correct variable</li>
<li>Federated backfilling for medium/large rooms has been fixed</li>
<li><code>/login</code> causing wrong device list updates has been resolved</li>

<li>The default config options for <code>recaptcha_sitekey_class</code> and <code>recaptcha_form_field</code> are now set correctly </li>
<li><code>/messages</code> now omits empty <code>state</code> to be more spec compliant (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/handlerug">handlerug</a>)</li>
<li><code>/sync</code> has been optimised to only query state events for history visibility if they are really needed</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a Dendrite homeserver, staying up-to-date is highly recommended so please upgrade when you can. Otherwise, if you want to play with Dendrite without having to set up your own infrastructure, the dendrite.matrix.org homeserver is open for registration (upon completion of a CAPTCHA, so you may need to register using Element Web).</p>

<p>Howdy! This release features one change, but an important change: We've finally fixed the poor UX around adding new connections in rooms via widgets. Up until today, the project selector input was quite poor and flaked out a lot. Missing search results, clipping dropdowns or duplicated entries were a common occurrence.</p>
<p>The new input field features a much improved look, so now you see the project name, description and avatar when searching across GitHub, GitLab and JIRA. The search time and accuracy should be much improved too.</p>
<p>If you've updated to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/2.6.1">previous releases, 2.6.0,1</a>, then now is a good time to do so because those releases contained a whole range of cool new stuff!</p>

<p>Where there is light, there is shadow: When trying to integrate the community sqlite db backend we ran into a terrible bug in the underlying library that led to eventually having to abandon that port and go with a fresh implementation based on a different library - we are confident to show something, at least for crypto-db, fairly soon.

It‚Äôs a painstaking process with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1372">plenty of small fixes</a> and improvements on all parts.

<p>Greetings, fellow music lovers (and matrix enjoyers)! I had a brilliant idea whilst lounging on my couch, stuffing my face with pizza, and realized that I was too darn lazy to keep opening Spotify every time I want to skip a song. And lo and behold, I discovered that there was no way to command my Spotify account from the comfort of my Matrix room. So, I decided to create a bot to do the job for me (how convenient, right?). </p>
<p>It's currently in its alpha state, but any contributions are welcome, especially if you're a coding wizard.</p>
<p>To use it, all you need is a bot account on your favorite homeserver and a bit of setup magic. Check out the GitHub link for more information: https://github.com/VaiTon/matrixfy</p>

<p>Back in July I started a discussion on wikidata for adding a matrix space property, after much discussion in the wikidata community (lead mostly by tgr) we instead landed on a <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P11478">Matrix room property</a>. This now enables slightly more accurate semantics when describing matrix rooms belonging to organizations, projects, and people on wikidata.</p>
<p>Wikidata is a knowledge base available under a free license and using standard machine-parsable data to add information to what is known as the &quot;semantic web&quot;, this allows querying for information like for example: <a href="https://query.wikidata.org/#%23%20Organizations%20with%20matrix%20rooms%0ASELECT%20DISTINCT%20%3Forg%20%3ForgLabel%20%3Froom%20%3FtypeLabel%0AWHERE%20%0A%7B%0A%20%20%3Forg%20wdt%3AP31%2Fwdt%3AP279%2a%20wd%3AQ43229.%20%23%20Find%20items%20which%20are%20some%20kind%20of%20organization%0A%20%20%3Forg%20p%3AP11478%20%3Fs.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20Which%20have%20some%20statement%20%3Fs%20about%20having%20a%20matrix%20room%0A%20%20%3Fs%20ps%3AP11478%20%3Froom.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20the%20statements%27s%20matrix%20room%20value%20is%20%3Froom%0A%20%20OPTIONAL%20%7B%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20And%20which%20optionally%0A%20%20%20%20%3Fs%20pq%3AP31%20%3Ftype.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20is%20of%20type%20%3Ftype%0A%20%20%7D%0A%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20%7B%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22%5BAUTO_LANGUAGE%5D%2Cen%22.%20%7D%20%23%20Helps%20get%20the%20label%20in%20your%20language%2C%20if%20not%2C%20then%20en%20language%0A%7D%20ORDER%20BY%20%3ForgLabel">Organizations with matrix rooms</a></p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>As you can tell from the above MSC list, Extensible Events continues to charge forwards, with Travis working busily away at replicating all of the existing event functionality (plus new functionality - image albums anyone?) in a world containing Extensible Events. As always, take a look at the core MSC (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) for a background on what Extensible Events is, and why it's so exciting.</p>
<p>This week has also seen <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/rooms/v10/">room version 10</a> become the default recommended room version in the spec! As a reminder, v10 brings the ability to have a room that's both <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#knocking-on-rooms">knockable</a> and <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms">restricted</a> at once, as well as more strictly enforces the types of power level values.</p>
<p>Otherwise we've seen lots of movement in other areas of the spec. Expect to see some work done around push rules (which have historically been rather complicated and fiddly...) and notifications in the days to come.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3779">MSC3779: &quot;Owned&quot; State Events</a>!</p>
<p>I remember this MSC fondly. It was originally born out of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3489">MSC3489</a>'s need to allow any user in the room to send <code>m.beacon_info</code> state events. This can easily be achieved today by lowering the required power level of <code>m.beacon_info</code> to the default user level. However, you then run into the issue of any user being able to edit any other user's <code>m.beacon_info</code> event!</p>
<p>Thus this MSC attempts to modify the state events permission model so that users can &quot;own&quot; certain state events that they send. We already somewhat have this functionality - if you put your Matrix ID as the state ID for any state event, only you or users with a power level higher than you can edit it.</p>
<p>Sadly this little trick (which we use for <code>m.room.member</code> events) doesn't work in the case of live location sharing, as the feature demands the ability to share location from multiple devices at once. Hence, trying to send two <code>m.beacon_info</code> events with the same state key would overwrite each other.</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to expand the functionality by modifying the definition so that a user &quot;owns&quot; a state event if the state key <em>starts</em> with their Matrix ID. Problem solved... for the most part!</p>
<p>Do check out the MSC if you have some use cases in mind that would benefit from something like this.</p>

<h3 id="hookshot-2-6-0">Hookshot 2.6.0</h3>
<p>Evenings greetings! It's been a while since we've done a Hookshot release, so this one is pretty large. We've got two major features this time around, <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/encryption.html"><strong>Encrypted Room Support</strong></a> and <strong>Service Bots</strong>. The former now allows you to invite the hookshot bot to encrypted rooms and issue commands to it as normal, it should work entirely transparently. It currently requires a homeserver with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3202">MSC3202</a> support, such as Synapse. One final note is that it's extremely experimental and beta-y, so please do not run this on your production instances or it might format your cats. However, plaese do report all your findings to us. We love fan mail üìß</p>
<p>Service bots is another great feature that now allows you to split hookshot into several different bots, so you can have a GitHub bot, a GitLab bot, a JIRA bot and so on. It's <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/service_bots.html">extremely flexible</a>, so please have a go and let us know what you think.</p>
<p>You can find this release at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/2.6.0, or by doing <code>docker pull halfshot/matrix-hookshot:2.6.0</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, the highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add support for end-to-bridge encryption via MSC3202. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/299">#299</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add support for additional bot users called &quot;service bots&quot; which handle a particular connection type, so that different services can be used through different bot users. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/573">#573</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add new GitHubRepo connection config setting <code>workflowRun.workflows</code> to filter run reports by workflow name. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/588">#588</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parent projects are now taken into account when calculating a user's access level to a GitLab project. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/539">#539</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure bridge treats published and drafted GitHub releases as different events. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/582">#582</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove support for Pantalaimon-based encryption. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/299">#299</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase maximum size of incoming webhook payload from <code>100kb</code> to <code>10mb</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/606">#606</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even though the end of the year is usually a quiet time, big steps forward have been made in the last couple of weeks on many important areas of the rust SDK.</p>
<p>With Sliding Sync being tried out in Element-X a few more bugs and edge-case scenarios have been uncovered, where it doesn‚Äôt play well yet. For example resending the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1307">correct extension settings on session restart</a> including <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1321">to-device-tokens</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1333">invalidation indexes</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1340">incorrectly skipping to-device processing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1335">various other smaller fixes</a>. The latter PR also contains a first set of integration-tests running testing the SDK against synapse and the sliding-sync-proxy. We intend to expand on that and include it in the CI as soon as github actions are unblocked for it.</p>
<p>Similar has been done on the Timeline feature, with a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1327">better more flexible timeline pagination implementation</a>, a new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1324">virtual loading indicator item</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1344">improved logging</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1287">date dividers and read markers</a>. All good stuff, making it easier to implement a useful chat UI on top of it.</p>
<p>On async UniFFI we see the same picture: with Swift, Kotlin and Python now executing rust futures as well as handling their error results properly. And time couldn‚Äôt be any better as we can hear the creaking of the blocking-runtime we currently have under the hood in Element-X and it is starting to show the limits of what we can implement in a useful manner. We are confident we can start experimenting with it in live apps fairly soon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the last few official Matrix holiday updates didn't mention as many of the cool community projects as I would have liked, I tried to work with the community to publish a community side review of 2022 as well as possibly some small teasers of what 2023 will bring. There are a lot of very varied updates, since everyone seems to have tackled the challenge differently, but I hope you you enjoy the result as much as I did: https://blog.neko.dev/posts/matrix-year-in-review-2022.html</p>
<p>A few days later we also published the same blog post on matrix.org, with a few typo fixes and cleanups: https://matrix.org/blog/2023/01/03/matrix-community-year-in-review-2022</p>
<p>This was a bit shot notice, so I would like to extend my gratitude to everyone who contributed and took some time in probably one of the busiest periods in a year! For the same reason, I hope you can excuse if one of your favourite projects is missing. If you have anything that is sorely missing, feel free to reach out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#year-in-2022:neko.dev">#year-in-2022:neko.dev</a> and maybe I can amend the blog post.</p>
<p>Have a great 2023 everyone!</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>After a lull from the holiday period, work has continued on different parts of the spec. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706">MSC3706</a> has merged, which furthers the spec side of the work to make joining rooms faster in Matrix (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3902">MSC3902</a> for the overview).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3938">MSC3938</a> has also been merged to the spec. The proposal removes a deprecated <code>keyId</code> field and cleans up the endpoint by disallowing trailing slashes.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3885">MSC3885: Sliding Sync Extension: To-Device messages</a>!</p>
<p>Sliding Sync (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575">MSC3575</a>) is the next generation of sync - how Matrix clients receive new data from their homeserver. The spec side of the feature has been designed to be modular, with different extensions of spec provided different functionality. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3885">MSC3885</a> is one of those extensions, and defines how <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#send-to-device-messaging">To-Device Messages</a> (how different user devices talk directly to each other) would be requested by a Matrix client from the homeserver.</p>
<p>This proposal doesn't appear to have had too much review from the community yet - so feel free to check it out if faster Matrix clients appeal to you!</p>

<p>Element-web client on IPFS</p>
<p>It has been a while since last time anyone announced their effort to host (and keep up to date) Element-web on IPFS.
Since Element-web is a client-side static web application, it works just fine when accessed through local IPFS gateway (like kubo/go-ipfs, ipfs-companion browser addon makes it almost seamless).</p>
<p>Latest version (updated within 2 days of the release):
/ipns/element.sibnsk.net  (/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dj43aqkofq4ggbd7nnpvg8j1ia79deab41bfe4zrp86xoht5w2j)</p>

/ipns/elements.sibnsk.net (/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dmc2sqzfh36v85ucddrw3vbd21erk77wc1pot16j5mqqjmwjyc3)</p>
<p>Note: those are unpacked release archives from github with <code>config.json</code> being a copy of <code>config.sample.json</code>.</p>
<p>Files stored on IPFS benefit greatly from more people accessing, storing and sharing them, so everyone is invited to use and pin (periodically, as new versions are released).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week, we merged the core API for <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/413">Tasks / ToDoList and Todos</a> using matrix events into <code>main</code>. <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/issues/424">While connecting the flutter UI</a> is ongoing (which has reverently been <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/418">revamped to be more streamline and intuitive to use</a>) this marks a major milestone in getting the proof of concept done. It shows that using stateful objects inside matrix spaces that can be collaborated upon with simple matrix events is feasible for regular end-user-style applications. The <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/413">PR</a> also brings with it integration tests and a TUI app show-casing live-updating tasks lists and tasks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile many issues have been fixed around chat, the code has been updated to latest matrix-sdk and <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/419">we are working hard on reactivating the integration test suite</a> for better quality assurance. Which is increasingly important as we are sketching out the other generic stateful objects - like the <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/428">comments system</a>, news, pins and reactions.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have received a lot of positive feedback about <a href="https://effektio.org/whitepaper/">the whitepaper we launched last month</a> outlining what we are after when building this and how we intend this all to move forward. If you haven't read it yet, we are still curious to know what you think of it.</p>

The officially allotted time <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/matrix/">for the Matrix devroom</a> at FOSDEM however is only half a day.
Some friends and matrix enthusiasts who met at the first Matrix Community Summit Berlin in 2022 feel there is more to discuss and want more time to meet more of this amazing community we are part of, without taking away from the FOSDEM experience itself.</p>
<p><strong>We are happy to announce the FOSDEM23 Matrix Community Meetup at <a href="https://hsbxl.be/">Hackerspace Brussels</a> (HSBXL)!</strong>
The meetup is set to begin on Friday 03 February around 13:00 local time (CET) and will go into the evening. See https://hsbxl.be/contact/ for multiple well documented ways how to find us. Thank you HSBXL for providing a location for this!
There is no definite schedule, instead we want to give the space for discussions to develop organically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a> style. If you have a certain interest to learn about something or you want to present something in particular, we want to hear about it!
Furthermore, be aware that HSBXL is hosting more events in the FOSDEM &quot;fringe&quot;, such as a <a href="https://hsbxl.be/events/byteweek/2023/hsbxl-beer-event/">beer tasting</a> on Friday right after our Matrix Meetup, and also the <a href="https://hsbxl.be/events/byteweek/2023/bytenight/">bytenight</a> party on Saturday.
Find us at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org">#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org</a> for more info, program suggestions, to follow the process, and general discussion.</p>
<p>See you in Brussels!</p>

<p>Yes, you are reading correct. This is about Matrix Art ^^</p>
<p>After quite some while, I started to work on it again. I merged the new design into main, updated the UI, and it is available at https://art.midnightthoughts.space/ again.</p>
<p>Current goals are to add the User and Post pages again and implement of the new storage system. The new system uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/travis/msc/trees/proposals/3089-file-tree-structures.md">Spaces as FS</a> at its core for the timeline.</p>
<p>Specifically, Matrix Art is basically a big Space containing a Folder for each User, similar to a Room Directory. In that, there are Timeline spaces which act as the Public Feed. This allows Matrix Art to provide a way of having invite only feeds as well, using normal room permissions.</p>
<p>In practice, the tree is like this (thanks to Travis for designing this many months ago): </p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>+ üìÇ Matrix Art User Dir (public, m.space)
</span><span>    + üìÇ User A (public, m.space)
</span><span>        + üìÇ Timeline (m.space)
</span><span>            - üìÑ Image A
</span><span>            = Room A (invite protected, &lt;no type&gt;)
</span><span>                - üìÑ Image B (counted as under the timeline)
</span><span>    + üìÇ User B (public, m.space)
</span><span>        + üìÇ Timeline (m.space)
</span><span>            - üìÑ Image C

<p>Quick update on the <a href="https://matrix.directory/">matrix.directory</a> website: we've added the custom event type <code>io.element.functional_members</code>. As you may know, many projects within Matrix don't use any custom event types at all. This can make it difficult to find custom event types, which is (ironically) why I created the matrix.directory website in the first place.</p>
<p>You can find the source code for the website on <a href="https://github.com/BramvdnHeuvel/Matrix-Events-Directory">GitHub</a>. I encourage you to check it out and contribute any custom event types you may have. Your contributions will help make the website a valuable resource for the Matrix community.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3917">MSC3917: Cryptographically Constrained Room Membership</a> is rather interesting. It aims to make room membership in a room cryptographically verifiable via a &quot;Master Signing Key&quot; that's controlled by users. This is in addition to the homeserver signatures typically placed on events in Matrix. The purpose is to prevent a homeserver from being able to lie about your membership in a room. While not the end-all-be-all solution to this particular problem, it's certainly a well-reasoned take.</p>
<h4 id="matrix-ietf-115">Matrix @ IETF 115</h4>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a> explains</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A soon-to-be working group within the IETF called &quot;More Instant Messaging Interoperability&quot; (MIMI) is aiming to solve, well, messaging interoperability for primarily reasons of the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA). The DMA requires &quot;gatekeepers&quot; to interop with other platforms while maintaining the same level of encryption, and we think Matrix is the perfect fit for this use-case. While we'd likely be saying goodbye to Olm and Megolm in the process, we'd be saying hello to Messaging Layer Security (MLS) and its decentralized counterpart DMLS - a good thing in our books, at the moment. </p>
<p>In terms of what we've done this week in publishing our drafts (and soon to be real Internet-Drafts under the IETF process), we're formally proposing that Matrix's Federation API and event schema be used for messaging interoperability. Our very own Matrix spec process will be impacted by this sort of direction as it makes it (theoretically) &quot;harder&quot; to change details of the spec. To avoid it being extraordinarily difficult, we'll be nailing down some of the edge cases of the Federation API and event format ( üëÄ extensible events) naturally as we work closer and closer to an RFC series. We'll also be making some architectural changes to our specification itself to better support half of it being in the IETF domain, like defining room versions more clearly and splitting non-core spec out of the way. It's worth noting that this is a relatively slow process as we work towards the deadline of DMA a few years from now, but the changes might be felt by the ecosystem on a more rapid scale.</p>
<p>At the moment, we're planning to attend IETF 115 to help keep Matrix on the map for MIMI and raise our feedback about the proposed working group charter. Discussions about whether Matrix is the correct fit are already ongoing, but expected to increase as we get closer to IETF 116 next quarter. We were also already at IETF 114 a few months ago where many of these conversations started.</p>
<p>Future work is currently expected to come through under my name, as have the current drafts (both with obvious input from Matthew as project lead). Watching this space and the spec process for updates is best üôÇ</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jordan:bancino.net">Jordan Bancino</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone, I'm working on a little Matrix project called Telodendria.</p>
<p>Telodendria is eventually going to be another homeserver implementation.  It isn't one yet; I'm still in the <em>very</em> early stages of prototyping it, and writing some boilerplate code, but I've been encouraged to throw the project out there for more exposure, so here we are!</p>
<p>Telodendria is written in ANSI C, will use a custom flat-file database, and relies <em>only</em> on a POSIX system to be built and run. It won't pull in any dependencies; as much as possible will be written from scratch, including the HTTP stack, JSON parser, and any other baseline stuff a Matrix homeserver needs.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>One of the goals is simply to build a useful homeserver, but also just to learn about the inner workings of Matrix and the technology that supports it, as well as to have a bit of fun in the process.</p>
<p>At this point we've got Synapse, Dendrite, Conduit, Construct, and a few other great projects. So you're probably asking, What <em>practical</em> reasons are there to build another homeserver? The best answer to that is in <a href="https://telodendria.io/man/man7/telodendria.7.html">Telodendria's manual</a>, but what it really comes down to is being portable and lightweight.  It'd be cool to have a Matrix homeserver server that can run <em>anywhere</em>, but specifically targets the more obscure operating systems like the BSDs. Additionally, it should be light enough to perform well on Raspberry Pis, routers, cheap VPSs, and other low-power and low-storage devices that might not be as capable of running a full database plus a hefty Matrix homeserver.</p>
<p>For me personally, I just want a homeserver that feels like it belongs on OpenBSD and is capable of handling my use case without having to install any third-party packages. I'm a digital minimalist that wants to cut down on his software requirements, and Telodendria is one of the ways I've set out to do that.</p>
<h2 id="want-to-get-involved">Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>There's definitely plenty of code and documentation to be written, so if you're looking for a challenge and believe in the project's philosophy, you're highly encouraged to get involved in whatever way you're able.</p>
<p>The development discussion happens entirely on Matrix. If you're unsure where to start, start by joining the project rooms <a href="https://telodendria.io/man/man7/telodendria.7.html#DESCRIPTION">listed in the manual</a>. Do be sure to also check out main <a href="https://telodendria.io">project website</a>, which has a list of all the manual pages. The manual should contain much of the information you'll need to get started, but it's far from complete, so if you find the information to be insufficient, don't be afraid to ask questions in the rooms listed above.</p>

<ul>
<li>In order to enhance our ability to test before launch we‚Äôve now got Nightly builds on ElementX iOS. Our internal testers are able to use the app for longer before we prep for release to the App Store and that will increase the quality of our product.

<li>The composer has had a few upgrades recently - keep your eyes open for that and let us know what you think!</li>
<li>Work on voice broadcasting is moving ahead quickly</li>

<li>Renamed the app back to &quot;Circles&quot;.

<li>We're keeping the Circuli name for our online service.</li>
<li>Added QR-code-based device verification.</li>
<li>Made registration tokens optional, i.e. it's up to the server whether to require them or not.  Currently we do require registration tokens on our servers, and you can sign up with the token 0000-1111-2222-4444.</li>

<p>Long-awaited and with a bunch of final bug-fixes on the server side, this week eventually saw the merging of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1054">sliding sync extensions</a>, enabling e2ee and to-device message support via sliding-sync on main. With that, and some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1154">additional APIs on</a>, a new Element-x with e2ee support was made available. A release that also features the latest <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1138">work on the timeline API</a>, which, too, has seen its fair share of progress this week - mainly internal fixes and debugging helpers.</p>
<p>As a result of the sliding sync work, just earlier today, an important PR was opened for jack-in, the experimental debugging TUI client based on matrix-rust-sdk (which we use for debugging sliding sync): <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1156">now allowing you send (encrypted) messages</a>, too.</p>
<p>Following last weeks announcement we also made the Rust-Sec public, indicating why we recommend uprgading to 0.6.1, which we released shortly prior.</p>
<p>Other than that, work has been progressed in the background on the pretty complex problem of async in uniffi and system-specific runners, namely libdispatch on ios rather than tokio, as well as work on uniff proc-macros.</p>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2700">MSC2700: Thumbnail requirements for the media repo</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC has the goal of clarifying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">mimetypes</a> of media that a homeserver both MUST and SHOULD support thumbnailing for. The intention is to give clients a clearer picture of what file formats will receive a proper thumbnail before they are uploaded to the homeserver.</p>
<p>Comments on the MSC seem to suggest that the MSC as it stands does not completely solve the problem: while it does give clients an explicit list of supported mimetypes, the list is quite short. And the list of SHOULD mimetypes cannot be relied on.</p>
<p>The MSC also clarifies that encrypted media should always be uploaded with a mimetype of <code>application/octet-stream</code>, instead of the original media's mimetype, which seems like a welcome and uncontentious point. And finally, it defines <code>501 M_UNSUPPORTED</code> to be returned instead of an internal server error on thumbnailing failure.</p>
<p>I believe the next step for this MSC is for the current threads to be incorporated into the text; so don't miss the threads when reading it!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan Abolivier</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we've released Synapse 1.69! It comes with improved caching tools for third-party modules, and support for a bunch of experimental features, such as thread-aware read receipts (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3771">MSC3771</a>) and an approval flow for new registrations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3866">MSC3866</a>). As part of this release, we've also laid out the removal schedule for the long-deprecated legacy Prometheus metric names, and the <code>generate_short_term_login_token</code> module API method. Read all about it on the matrix.org blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/17/synapse-1-69-released</p>
<p>Another big thing in Synapse 1.69 is experimental support for faster remote room joins! You can read more about it on the blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/18/testing-faster-remote-room-joins but briefly, we are ready for server admins to begin testing, with some caveats. If you've read the post and feel confident, turn it on, give it a spin and let us know how it goes!</p>
<p>Alongside 1.69, we're also disclosing a moderate severity vulnerability that we fixed back in Synapse 1.62. If your deployment runs a Synapse version older than 1.62, and is openly federating, please update to a more recent version of Synapse at your earliest convenience. More info on this in advisory <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-jhjh-776m-4765">GHSA-jhjh-776m-4765</a> and <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31152">CVE-2022-31152</a>.</p>
<p>This week we've also released the first release candidate for Synapse 1.70 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.70.0rc1">1.70.0rc1</a>). This release will include experimental support for thread-aware notifications (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773">MSC3773</a>) and filtering (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3874">MSC3874</a>), improved validation, advertising support for Matrix 1.3 and 1.4, and the usual load of bugfixes and internal improvements.

<p>It's been a little while since our last update, but Populus development continues! In addition to the usual bugfixes, we've made a number of ergonomics improvements suggested by the experiences of other users at my university. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Buttons for message actions (react, redact, reply, and so on) are now displayed in a way that doesn't overlap with sender names</p>

<li>
<p>Avatar images for discussions can now up uploaded simultaneously with discussion creation.</p>

</ol>
<p>We've also made some minor graphical improvements: loading messages are now indicated with a nice low-contrast SVG hint, rather than the literal-minded &quot;loading message&quot; message. Some icons have been improved, and the bartab (lines in the margins) display logic has been improved. And, we're now on the latest JS-SDK version.</p>

<p>While the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1054">sliding sync extensions</a> are being tested and bugs found during the tests reported and fixed, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1106">FFI for the new timeline API</a> has been approved and merged this week. The third big chunk that was merged this week, was a refactoring to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1098">Replace QR with SAS verification</a> and the yet to be merged <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1124">signaling for SAS verification</a>. </p>

We will be providing a patch release and RustSec about this soon.</p>
<p>Other than that, this week has seen many smaller fixes, like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1131">making the store-setters on client-builder actually adhere to the builder pattern</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1119">removing string from storerrors</a>, and improvements like the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1126">API to set local trust</a>  or setting workspace wide dependencies for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1116">uniffi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1122">others</a>.</p>
