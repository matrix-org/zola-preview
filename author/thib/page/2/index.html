<h2 id="ietf-mimi-dma">IETF/MIMI/DMA</h2>
<p>With the Extensible Events Core (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) being accepted last week, the focus now turns to all the other extensible event MSCs for images, files, etc. How does extensible events relate to IETF/MIMI/DMA, you ask? In our mission for having Matrix be the standard for interoperability, we need a content format that works for everyone. Events prior to MSC1767 <em>could</em> work with enough effort, though MSC1767's system makes things <em>a lot</em> easier when representing arbitrarily complex messaging features.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to TWIM for progress in this area. It's a relatively slow process, but we're working through it.</p>

<p>This week's random MSC is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2785">MSC2785: Event notification attributes and actions</a>! This is effectively a replacement for the push rules system we have today, and a super interesting one (how do you even design a notifications system?). Focus has shifted a little bit since this MSC was first opened, though its ideas still comes up frequently when aiming to make smaller changes to push rules today.</p>

<p>We released another breaking change this week :p bump to v0.17.0</p>
<p>Introduced a couple of new features like upgrading voice calls to video calls, some neat helper functions for group calls. Fixes include cleaning group call state events, fixing the searchEvent function, a way to get own profile from server and then fallback to room profile and also fixes to the /markasdm command.</p>
<p>Complete changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>fix: ability to upgrade audio calls to video calls (td)</li>
<li>chore: add a fetchOwnProfileFromServer method which tries to get ownProfile from server first, disk then (td)</li>
<li>fix: clean expired member state events in group calls (td)</li>
<li>fix: hasActiveGroup call now checks all group calls (td)</li>
<li>fix: Check if argument is valid mxid in /maskasdm command (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>fix: Fake User object (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>fix: Request key in searchEvent method crashes because of wrong preconditions (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>refactor: Check config at file sending after placing fake event and add error handling (Krille)</li>
<li>chore: bump dart to 2.18 (Nicolas Werner)</li>
<li>fix: setMicrophoneMuted is now async to match setVideoMuted (td)</li>
<li>fix: implement activeGroupCallEvents to get all active group call state events in a room (td)</li>
<li>refactor: (BREAKING CHANGE) move staleCallChecker and expires_Ts stuff to an extension on Room, instead of Voip because it makes much more sense per room rather than on voip, also makes testing easier (td)</li>
<li>fix: populate local groupCalls list on instantiating VOIP() (td)</li>
<li>fix: starting stale call checker is now handled by the sdk itself because clients can forget to do so (td)</li>

<h3 id="ruma-website">Ruma (<a href="https://www.ruma.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>A set of Rust library crates for working with the Matrix protocol. Ruma’s approach to Matrix emphasizes correctness, security, stability and performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net">Kévin Commaille</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been a while since our last update in November, but it just means we have been busier than ever! A lot has happened to follow changes in the Matrix specification as well as fixing bugs in our codebase or making our API easier to use.</p>
<p>We have released Ruma 0.8.0 and 0.8.1 at the beginning of the month. It was long overdue with a lot of improvements, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stabilized support for all the changes and features of Matrix 1.4 and Matrix 1.5</li>
<li>Making our request types use owned instead of borrowed data</li>
<li>Replacing <code>ruma_api!</code> with more flexible macros</li>
<li>Fixing the serialization and deserialization of redacted events</li>
<li>Reorganizing our <code>*EventContent</code> traits to allow event content types to only implement what is really needed</li>
<li>Removing sensitive data from the <code>Debug</code>-format representation of our types </li>
</ul>
<p>And on the 15th we released Ruma 0.8.2 with a few bug fixes but also stabilized support for all the changes and features of Matrix 1.6!</p>
<p>Although it might be less visible in our changelogs, we also regularly add support for MSCs, and try to keep our implementations up-to-date. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sliding sync (MSC3575 and others, currently used by Element X via the matrix-rust-sdk)</li>
<li>Extensible events (MSC1767 and others)</li>
<li>Push rule condition for room version features (MSC3931 and MSC3932)</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have a bunch of issues opened if you feel like contributing, so come say hi!</p>

Earlier I did already try to transcribe Matrix Live <a href="https://en.miki.community/wiki/Draft:Matrix_Live_S0704">manually</a>. Today I combined the 2 things.</p>
<p>As a Result, I am trying to better/faster build small pages with Shownotes and a Text Transcription of Matrix Live episodes each week.</p>
<p>The first one can be found at https://en.miki.community/wiki/Matrix_Live_S08E17 for the last episode.</p>
<p>Feel free to raise critique, wishes and other ideas in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-live-transcriptions:midnightthoughts.space">#matrix-live-transcriptions:midnightthoughts.space</a>  :)</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>In keeping with our (roughly) quarterly release schedule of the Matrix Spec, v1.6 is due to be released on February 14th. That's only four days from now! The headline features are a new Jump-to-Date Client-Server API (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>) and initial work on speeding up room joins (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706">MSC3706</a>), along with many other fixes and clarifications to the spec text itself.</p>
<p>If you haven't yet seen it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPJ9zFV5IE">Matthew's Matrix 2.0 talk</a> at FOSDEM walks through some of the upcoming features in the spec. Each will land in subsequent, future releases of the spec. Once all have landed, we'll call that Matrix 2.0 (in name and in actual version number).</p>
<p>Extensible events is one such upcoming feature. While the core proposal outlining the feature (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) will land in v1.6, the smattering of MSCs which describe how various event types will work under extensible events will span multiple upcoming spec versions. Watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2974">MSC2974: Widgets: Capabilities re-exchange</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC is relatively simple; proposing a method for widgets to ask the client for additional capabilities after it has already been initialised. Doing so allows for increased security and privacy workflows, as the widget need only ask for access to certain pieces of data at the point that it needs it (rather than all up front).</p>
<p>A similar transition of permission granting happened in mobile devices and apps. Initially mobile apps would ask for all permissions they would need up front - which users would blindly accept. These days, mobile OS's have shifted to a model where individual permissions are requested upon attempting to complete an action in an app. This way, users have better context on the reason for the permissions request. (Oddly, browsers have yet to reach this stage with extensions - those still ask for all permissions up front.)</p>
<p>Do check out the proposal and its technical details if widgets are your thing!</p>

<p>The UK Online Safety Bill is shaping up to be a catastrophic piece of legislation, mandating clientside scanning of end-to-end-encrypted communication to attempt to intercept CSAM (child sexual abuse material). By adding the requirement for a scanner which executes ambiguous rulesets to submit encrypted content to the authorities, it would massively undermine the security of encryption: you simply wouldn't be able to trust whether content stays encrypted, or the rules used to scan it and submit it to the authorities. We wrote about it at https://element.io/blog/the-online-safety-bill-an-attack-on-encryption/ to try to sound the alarm before it's too late.</p>

<p>Although having lost a lot of popularity in the last few years, <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> has a great performance and tiny asset size, which means great Matrix support for tiny browsers like on <a href="https://www.kaiostech.com/">KaiOS</a> or for small-size projects and games that wish to use Matrix as a simple back-end.</p>
<p>I hope to release a version v1.0.0 in the near future, but I wanted to share my first breakthrough as I managed to write a simple program that sends message (and state) events in versions that the homeserver supports. See the image below!</p>
<p>Support will mostly be from spec version v1.2 and on, but some legacy endpoints will remain available. You can find the project on <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk">GitHub</a> for now. Hopefully I'll have more to show you in the next few weeks!

<p>Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org">Ivan, the Language Mangler</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in the Rust SDK team is a bit special. We are making our farewells to Ben, as he is leaving Element. He will continue to hang around as its new gig involves Matrix, feel free to take a glance at <a href="https://effektio.org/">Effektio</a>. Once our tears have dried, we carried on with our current main focus: Sliding Sync, and Crypto.
The Sliding Sync client has seen improvements in terms of documentation, along with some clean ups, and stabilisation patches (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1439">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1440">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1449">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1482">4</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1467">5</a>…). The team has decided it's time to write a small testing framework to improve the safety of this code specifically. Indeed, it's quite challenging to test it, and as it's a fundamental piece of the user experience in ElementX and other Matrix clients, there is no debate to have: the quality requirements are high.
The Crypto part now. The Crypto Store has been refactored a little bit (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1477">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1457">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1462">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1465">4</a>…). There is other patches to handle inconsistencies if they happen, and to always mark our own device as verified (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1452">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1456">2</a>).
Apart from that, they have been many work on setting and exposing OpenTelemetry logs for multiple clients and platforms. It will help the teams to coordinate on bugs when they happen.
Finally, a new release of the <code>matrix-sdk-crypto-js</code> has landed: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1444">v0.1.0-alpha.4</a>.
Outside Matrix itself, we have a merge window for <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">the uniffi-async project</a>, along with more contributions to improve errors (<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1468">1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1467">2</a>). It means that the bindings to Swift and Kotlin will soon support native Rust async functions. More contributions are in the pipe to generate documentations for the foreign languages (Swift, Kotlin etc.) directly from Rust documentations.
I will conclude by saying that we were also quite busy preparing the demos for FOSDEM. It was a huge success and it makes us extremely happy :-).</p>

<p>Since August 2020, t2bot.io’s primary source of funding has been from the Matrix.org Foundation, though with the Foundation’s latest focus on raising funds for itself, it feels like the right thing to do is get t2bot.io independently funded.</p>
<p><strong>If you are able, please donate to t2bot.io <a href="https://t2bot.io/donations/">here</a>.</strong> All donations go towards the cost of operation, with any excess (if t2bot.io is so lucky…) going towards hiring developers to work on/build bridges as well as into the Foundation to thank them for keeping t2bot.io online all these years.</p>
<p>Currently, t2bot.io serves <em>86 thousand</em> Discord and Telegram communities, bridging 325 thousand users <em>each month</em>, and <em>11.3 million</em> users since 2017. There’s also 962 thousand rooms with a t2bot.io user in them, leaving only about 94 thousand rooms as archived, across 25 thousand different homeservers.</p>
<p>Operating at this scale requires, well, $12k USD per year: if you’re able, please consider donating. There’s also a question of whether t2bot.io should even be operating at this scale in the first place: Matrix is all about decentralization and owning your own conversations, which naturally means there should be many smaller bridges for communities or even a discord.com-provided bridge for everyone to use. For the time being though, t2bot.io is offered as a convenience and aims to adapt itself as needed to keep providing value.</p>
<p>Questions, concerns, etc are best discussed in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#help:t2bot.io">#help:t2bot.io</a> on Matrix. Nearly every detail of how t2bot.io works is intended to be shared openly, which includes the financial aspect of running the service, so ask away 🙂</p>

<h4 id="fosdem23-community-meetup-matrix-org"><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org">#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org</a></h4>
<p>Exactly one week ago, a good chunk of the community gathered in Brussels for the <strong>Matrix Community Meetup/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a></strong> in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/fringe/">fringe</a> of FOSDEM.</p>
<p>While we expected the need for everyone to just meet and exchange their ideas, we still wanted to provide a framework for things to get going.
After a &quot;quick&quot; introductory round of everyone presenting themselves and their connection to Matrix, constantly expanding the circle around the table as more people kept pouring through the <a href="https://hsbxl.be/enter">pink gate</a>, we built a timetable of topics from the introduction using the <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-barcamp/tree/nic/env/fosdem-2023">BarCamp Widget</a> developed and slightly modified for the physical BarCamp use case by Nordeck.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/hFUNxEWMiTLgMXRzZzWKfyRt.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Having this way to find people to discuss a topic was a great way to get started, and the discussions quickly took their own directions from there. Highlights included discussions about topics very dear to some people and finding others who are also interested, deep dives into the protocol, brainstorming, or even meeting random strangers on the (notoriously packed) tram to have technical discussions with. A lot of online friends connected, a lot of new friends were made, and even some old friends got to reconnect. It felt very familiar very quickly and leaving Ananace feeling &quot;I've spoken to more friendly and passionate people this last week than I've done for the last six months, that's for certain.&quot; DMs were opened and master keys were cross signed thanks to IRL QR code scanning. Drinks were drunk, Pizza was eaten, and Swedish candy was appreciated to the fullest extent. The scenery only added to the real REAL hackerspace experience, having to <del>make a call</del> ping on Matrix to have someone open the gate to the &quot;desolated courtyard, surrounded by crumbling buildings with broken windows&quot; and a door literally labeled &quot;A&quot;.</p>

<p>As the organisers, Yan and I (HarHarLinks) want to express our gratitude to the incredibly hospitable people from Hackerspace Brussels (<a href="https://hsbxl.be">HSBXL</a>), especially <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jurgen_g:matrix.org">Jurgen</a> who helped a lot with prep in advance and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@beachy:50m4.eu">BeachyHead</a> who spent the whole day accommodating the sudden wave of arriving Matrix enthusiasts. Further, we would like to thank <a href="https://famedly.com">Famedly</a> and <a href="https://nordeck.net">Nordeck</a> who's generosity enabled us to provide free-as-in-beer food 🍕 and drinks 🍻 to everyone at the event through their financial support.</p>
<p>We are overjoyed by the incredible response by the community. Most of the people came there for a reason, and that was Matrix. And then they used the time to have some good time together. It was nice that we could help satisfy the huge demand for a get-together in the meat-space with this event.
We look forward to more physical meetups in the future (watch this space!).
Personally I had the best FOSDEM ever, and not just because it was my first one! 😉</p>

                <p>For the past two years, FOSDEM couldn’t happen in-person. Fortunately we could
help, and Matrix hosted the world's largest free &amp; open source software
conference online! This year we were finally back in-person… but not only.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/15/how-we-hosted-fosdem-2021-on-matrix">The set-up we have arranged in 2021</a>
and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/07/hosting-fosdem-2022-on-matrix">polished in 2022</a>
has proved to be robust and served us well during the pandemic. Returning to an
in-person conference didn’t mean we had to throw it all away… quite the
opposite!</p>
<p>This year the OSS community could gather in-person, go see each other’s stands,
and attend all too few of all the fascinating talks the speakers had prepared
for us… but the conference was yet more.. Some of us couldn’t make it in person
but could attend FOSDEM online from its Matrix Space. Devrooms were broadcasted
live into the Matrix rooms where devroom managers and speakers could interact
with the online audience.</p>
<p>In total, thousands of users joined us online, both locally and remotely as 
seen from the FOSDEM homeserver: an amazing audience given the possibility to be
on site.</p>
<p>For us, it was also an opportunity to announce Matrix 2.0 to a live audience!
Matrix 2.0 doesn’t mean we’re making breaking changes in the spec. It’s more of
a nickname we gave to the milestone <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/08/15/the-matrix-summer-special-2022#matrix-20">we had promised in summer to deliver by the
end of the year</a>
and had far too much giving the mother of all demos to a packed room of nearly
1500 people.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-ever-in-person-matrix-devroom">The first ever in-person Matrix devroom</h2>
<p>This year was also the first ever in-person devroom for the Matrix Foundation
and Community. We had many proposals and could have used the whole day, but we
had to share with many other deserving communities. We’re extremely grateful to
FOSDEM organisers for the devroom… and it was a huge success! At many points the
room was completely packed, with no seats left at all.</p>
<p>We could <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/matrix/">shoehorn 8 talks</a> in
the in-person devroom. Picking them was really difficult! When one of the
speakers unfortunately called in sick, the devroom healed the wound and filled
the gap very quickly.</p>
<p>The devroom started with a quick intro to Matrix from Matthew &amp; Amandine.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dPgYy-Y4f7w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Florian followed with a talk about MatrixRTC to explore what Matrix can do
beyond instant messaging</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P--LwIB3deA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Then Matthew did an awesome demo of Third Room and “3D widgets” (user generated
content) that can be embedded into its worlds. Of course with a nice “The Matrix
in Matrix” scene.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nG8qJ4on00Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Stunning 3D worlds are great, but the most popular use case for Matrix today is
instant messaging. And we did a lot as the Matrix Foundation to significantly
improve the performance with Sliding Sync, using matrix-rust-sdk as the showcase
implementation. Kegan and Ben covered Sliding Sync and matrix-rust-sdk
respectively, while Mauro showed us how Element X, the first client to use it,
doesn’t stop here and goes way beyond to provide a snappy, sturdy, polished
client.</p>

<p>Kim and Oliver from Nordeck made an interesting presentation about how widgets
can make Matrix a rich app creation environment.</p>

<p>The Trixnity project then introduced their fast, multi-purpose, well-tested SDK.
A talk you don’t want to miss, particularly if you’re into Kotlin.</p>

<p>Pierre from Technostructures introduced us to <a href="https://technostructures.org/projects/kazarma/">Kazarma</a>
a bridge between Matrix and ActivityPub. In Pierre’s own words: “we talked a lot
about interoperability, and we found it sad that we talked about
interoperability for proprietary platforms, not with alternative decentralised
networks, so we tried doing that”. And they did. Bravo Pierre and the team!</p>

<p>Finally Yan concluded the in-person devroom with a speedrun of all the Matrix
projects he could find around. The video is not out yet, so we’ll add it to the
second follow-up blog post: the one with the online devroom conferences!</p>
<h2 id="matrix-for-more-than-remote-attendance">Matrix for more than remote attendance</h2>
<p>FOSDEM staff used the Matrix rooms for on-site support. Whether the camera was
blurry, microphones didn’t work, or there was a missing power plug: staff could
be notified and answer very quickly before sending someone to actually solve the
issue. But it also allowed staff to notify devroom managers for small
adjustments, if speakers ever disappeared from the scene.</p>
<p>Staff also told us Matrix worked much more reliably than anything other than
walkie talkies from a coordination perspective and was more versatile. They
consider narrowing down their use of walkies next year in favour of a deeper
integration with Matrix. We’re excited to see that Matrix was yet again a great
solution in the stressful, high paced context of a conference that gathered
several thousand people in-person and several thousand more online.</p>
<h2 id="attending-in-person">Attending in-person</h2>
<p>Finally, a large part of the joy of attending FOSDEM comes from the people you
meet there. The least we can say is that our stand was busy. We ran out of
stickers and medium size t-shirts early on Sunday morning, but above all we had
plenty of interesting discussions.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/fosdem2023_stand_blurred.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>A few people discovered Matrix during FOSDEM and were blown away by messages
making it from Slack to Discord before their eyes, all thanks to Matrix and
bridges. The overwhelming majority of people who came to us were already happy
users willing to discuss architecture, our plans for the future, or even to
verify each other with QR Codes or emoji.</p>
<p>We want to thank the FOSDEM staff for organising this edition and using Matrix
again: a successful return to the in-person format that builds on the online
experience of the past two years. See you next year folks!</p>

<p>The last week i worked on getting Dendrite to work on the I2P Network. It makes use of the existing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone">Pinecone</a> infrastructure which gets enabled to dial on I2P with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone/compare/main...BieHDC:pinecone:main">a small patch</a>. This has the main advantage that servers will automatically discover each other if they share a node and you don't have to seek out others in the distributed network. I host a 24/7 Seednode for I2P right now. I have also put the work in to enable a landing page just like a monolith deployment would have and you can just <a href="http://3do33c5purkmidtcdxkqindjplcm3l6uv6qysc5a3pfa7fd7lv6q.b32.i2p/">browse to it</a>. This hopefully increases the visibility too!
However, it can also dial into the Clearnet too. It is hardcoded to the Seednode run by the matrix and dendrite developers themselves and it is disabled by default, but can be enabled with a command line switch. It effectively is making a bridge between the I2P Network and Clearnet. In order to bridge the gap between Pinecone based servers and normal matrix servers as well, I have also made a very simple <a href="https://github.com/BieHDC/go-matrix2matrix-noobbridge">matrix2matrix bridge</a> which just connects to 2 (or more) Homeservers and exchanges the messages between 2 (or more) rooms. It also supports bridging and not-bridging files of any kind.
You could add other networks too as long as you can tie them together with Pinecone. For example, the <a href="https://github.com/eyedeekay/onramp">library</a> i use to connect to I2P also supports Tor and it can be added to function just like the I2P implementation. All you need is something that exposes a HTTP Client and a listener.
My personal goal is to make matrix independent from domain registrars, open ports, static IP addresses and anything that makes self hosting harder than it should be and thankfully all the software we need is already written, it just takes someone to tie it together.</p>

<p>This week, <a href="https://github.com/ahal">ahal</a> contributed the <em>linkify</em> module, which implements a generic way to create substitutions based on regular expressions and their matches in Matrix messages.</p>
<p>For instance, it's possible to create a substitution so that when someone writes &quot;issue #21&quot; in the room, the bot will answer with &quot;https://github.com/bnjbvr/trinity/issues/21&quot;. And since it's configurable at runtime, you can create such substitutions with any format you want, create automated links as you'd like, and configure it per Matrix channel. This opens up a new world of possibilities! Also this generalizes what this bot's predecessor, <em>botzilla</em>, did with 3 different commands for expanding Github / Gitlab / Bugzilla links, so Trinity has now reached feature parity with it! Woohoo 🥳</p>

<h3 id="performance-improvements-and-fosdem-23">performance improvements and FOSDEM 23</h3>
<p>The most exciting change regarding more performance are asynchronous database transactions. This means that the cache stores values not only for reading from, but also for writing to the database. So every database transaction is executed asynchronously to the caller who changes values. This allows really fast sync processing even on slow systems like smartphones. This also removes delays in the UI, because changes are immediately applied (on the cache level). This was a problem with databases which don't allow parallel write transactions (like realm). This problem also seems to appear in Element Android and its realm database (at least with my huge account). Despite that, I've made some other improvements regarding the cache and sync processing.</p>
<p>I also added a simple benchmark to see how good the improvements are. The test creates 50 encrypted rooms and sends 10 messages to each room. The database is in-memory, but writing is simulated with a 10ms and reading with 5ms delay. Before the optimizations the sync needed 20s to be processed. After the optimizations it needed 5s. So 400% faster. In practice, with my relatively huge matrix account (200+ rooms) the initial sync took 2.5s (after waiting 30s for the server response) on the desktop. But this is just a teaser. If you want to know more, you'll have to wait another week for my Trixnity talk on FOSDEM 23. Contact me if you have topics that should definitely be included in the talk. 30 min are unfortunately filled quickly.</p>

That consists of MSCs related to Faster Room Joins (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3943">MSC3943</a> among others) and Extensible Events (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>).</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3230">MSC3230: Spaces top level order</a>!</p>
<p>This defines an algorithm and a data structure that can be used to order one's top-level list of Spaces and have that order sync across all of their clients. Rooms and spaces within a Space continue to have their order <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#ordering-of-children-within-a-space">defined</a> by an <code>order</code> key (and failing that, the <code>origin_server_ts</code> field) in the corresponding <code>m.space.child</code> event of their parent's Space's state.</p>
<p>I won't get into the details of the algorithm here (or its criticisms), but feel free to jump into the MSC and take a look!</p>

<h3 id="synapse-website">Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week the Synapse team has been finishing a sprint on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3902">faster joins</a> project.
As a reminder, this is a year-long project to make Synapse quickly join a new room by lazily loading some of its state history in the background.
It is particularly needed when joining large rooms with lots of members: joining such rooms is bottlenecked on fetching, serialising, deserialising and validating a <em>huge</em> list of <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#mroommember">room member events</a>.
While the core logic and machinery has been in place for some time now, this sprint has concentrated on two pain points:</p>
<ul>
<li>making faster joins to work on Synapse installations <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/workers.html">using workers</a>, and</li>
<li>remaining edge cases needed for a good client UX.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="call-for-testers">Call for testers</h2>
<p>We hope to ship the first iteration of faster joins support in Synapse 1.76.0.
The release candidate <code>1.76.0rc1</code> will be released on Tuesday 24th Jan.
<strong>We'd like to encourage homeserver administrators to try it out</strong> before the release proper.
Once you've upgraded, try joining rooms which no-one else on your server is joined to.
We graciously welcome any bug reports---please file <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=BUG_REPORT.yml">GitHub issues</a> if you find anything out of the ordinary after joining a room.</p>
<h2 id="synapse-1-75">Synapse 1.75</h2>
<p>We released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.75.0">Synapse 1.75</a> (see <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/01/19/synapse-1-75-released">blog</a>) this week. Its highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>performance fixes for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14786">/sync</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14263">/hierarchy</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14750">support</a> for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636">RFC7636</a> when using OAuth 2.0 (which enables <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9389">SSO via Twitter</a>); and</li>
<li>experimental <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14714">support</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3391">MSC3391, Removing account data</a>;</li>
</ul>
<p>plus the usual selection of bugfixes, internal improvements and work on the faster joins project.</p>
<p>Our continued thanks to our community of admins, testers, contributors and end-users.</p>

<p>This week we've released two versions of Dendrite, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.11.0">0.11.0</a> being the most recent one, and probably most exciting one, given we now reached <strong>100%</strong> server-server parity to Synapse, with client-server parity at <strong>93%</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="version-0-11-0-today"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.11.0">Version 0.11.0</a> today:</h2>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>/_dendrite/admin/purgeRoom/{roomID}</code> to clean up the database</li>
<li>The default room version was updated to 10 (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/FSG-Cat">FSG-Cat</a>)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The last three missing server-server Sytests - bringing us to <strong>100%</strong> server-server Synapse parity (<strong>93%</strong> for client-server) 🎉</li>
<li>An oversight in the <code>create-config</code> binary, which now correctly sets the media path if specified (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/BieHDC">BieHDC</a>)</li>
<li>The Helm chart now uses the <code>$.Chart.AppVersion</code> as the default image version to pull, with the possibility to override it (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/genofire">genofire</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="version-0-10-9-on-tuesday"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.10.9">Version 0.10.9</a> on Tuesday:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Stale device lists are now cleaned up on startup, removing entries for users the server doesn't share a room with anymore</li>
<li>Dendrite now has its own Helm chart</li>
<li>Guest access is now handled correctly (disallow joins, kick guests on revocation of guest access, as well as over federation)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixes-1">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Push rules have seen several tweaks and fixes, which should, for example, fix notifications for <code>m.receipt</code></li>
<li>Outgoing presence will now correctly be sent to newly joined hosts</li>
<li>Fixes the <code>/_dendrite/admin/resetPassword/{userID}</code> admin endpoint to use the correct variable</li>
<li>Federated backfilling for medium/large rooms has been fixed</li>
<li><code>/login</code> causing wrong device list updates has been resolved</li>
<li><code>/sync</code> should now return the correct room summary heroes</li>
<li>The default config options for <code>recaptcha_sitekey_class</code> and <code>recaptcha_form_field</code> are now set correctly </li>
<li><code>/messages</code> now omits empty <code>state</code> to be more spec compliant (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/handlerug">handlerug</a>)</li>
<li><code>/sync</code> has been optimised to only query state events for history visibility if they are really needed</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a Dendrite homeserver, staying up-to-date is highly recommended so please upgrade when you can. Otherwise, if you want to play with Dendrite without having to set up your own infrastructure, the dendrite.matrix.org homeserver is open for registration (upon completion of a CAPTCHA, so you may need to register using Element Web).</p>
<p>As always, please feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for related discussion.</p>

<p>Howdy! This release features one change, but an important change: We've finally fixed the poor UX around adding new connections in rooms via widgets. Up until today, the project selector input was quite poor and flaked out a lot. Missing search results, clipping dropdowns or duplicated entries were a common occurrence.</p>
<p>The new input field features a much improved look, so now you see the project name, description and avatar when searching across GitHub, GitLab and JIRA. The search time and accuracy should be much improved too.</p>
<p>If you've updated to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/2.6.1">previous releases, 2.6.0,1</a>, then now is a good time to do so because those releases contained a whole range of cool new stuff!</p>

<p>First and foremost: <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">UniFFI async is all done and submitted for review</a> 🎉 and first responses are pretty positive. Discussion has revealed some unlikely but possible undefined behavior that needs to be addressed and more review is needed. But overall, we are pretty confident that this will land soon. 🚀</p>
<p>Where there is light, there is shadow: When trying to integrate the community sqlite db backend we ran into a terrible bug in the underlying library that led to eventually having to abandon that port and go with a fresh implementation based on a different library - we are confident to show something, at least for crypto-db, fairly soon. Talking about crypto, aside from a few <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1348">smaller</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1365">improvements</a> the JS bindings on top have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1303">gotten some typing improvements</a> this week, too. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1347">Timeline has support for state events now</a>, too.</p>
<p>On Sliding sync we are looking at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1359">stabilization (tracking issue)</a> and optimizing for time-to-first-usage ahead of FOSDEM and getting a first iteration into the hands of people out there as part of Element-X. It’s a painstaking process with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1372">plenty of small fixes</a> and improvements on all parts. Through that and debugging on the interaction with the higher layers we were already able to shave off 900ms at cold-start-display-time, with more to come and other fixes, like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1358">logging improvements</a>, done along the way.</p>

<p>Greetings, fellow music lovers (and matrix enjoyers)! I had a brilliant idea whilst lounging on my couch, stuffing my face with pizza, and realized that I was too darn lazy to keep opening Spotify every time I want to skip a song. And lo and behold, I discovered that there was no way to command my Spotify account from the comfort of my Matrix room. So, I decided to create a bot to do the job for me (how convenient, right?). </p>
<p>It's currently in its alpha state, but any contributions are welcome, especially if you're a coding wizard.</p>
<p>To use it, all you need is a bot account on your favorite homeserver and a bit of setup magic. Check out the GitHub link for more information: https://github.com/VaiTon/matrixfy</p>

<p>Wikidata is a knowledge base available under a free license and using standard machine-parsable data to add information to what is known as the &quot;semantic web&quot;, this allows querying for information like for example: <a href="https://query.wikidata.org/#%23%20Organizations%20with%20matrix%20rooms%0ASELECT%20DISTINCT%20%3Forg%20%3ForgLabel%20%3Froom%20%3FtypeLabel%0AWHERE%20%0A%7B%0A%20%20%3Forg%20wdt%3AP31%2Fwdt%3AP279%2a%20wd%3AQ43229.%20%23%20Find%20items%20which%20are%20some%20kind%20of%20organization%0A%20%20%3Forg%20p%3AP11478%20%3Fs.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20Which%20have%20some%20statement%20%3Fs%20about%20having%20a%20matrix%20room%0A%20%20%3Fs%20ps%3AP11478%20%3Froom.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20the%20statements%27s%20matrix%20room%20value%20is%20%3Froom%0A%20%20OPTIONAL%20%7B%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20And%20which%20optionally%0A%20%20%20%20%3Fs%20pq%3AP31%20%3Ftype.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20is%20of%20type%20%3Ftype%0A%20%20%7D%0A%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20%7B%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22%5BAUTO_LANGUAGE%5D%2Cen%22.%20%7D%20%23%20Helps%20get%20the%20label%20in%20your%20language%2C%20if%20not%2C%20then%20en%20language%0A%7D%20ORDER%20BY%20%3ForgLabel">Organizations with matrix rooms</a></p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>As you can tell from the above MSC list, Extensible Events continues to charge forwards, with Travis working busily away at replicating all of the existing event functionality (plus new functionality - image albums anyone?) in a world containing Extensible Events. As always, take a look at the core MSC (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) for a background on what Extensible Events is, and why it's so exciting.</p>
<p>This week has also seen <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/rooms/v10/">room version 10</a> become the default recommended room version in the spec! As a reminder, v10 brings the ability to have a room that's both <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#knocking-on-rooms">knockable</a> and <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms">restricted</a> at once, as well as more strictly enforces the types of power level values.</p>
<p>Otherwise we've seen lots of movement in other areas of the spec. Expect to see some work done around push rules (which have historically been rather complicated and fiddly...) and notifications in the days to come.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3779">MSC3779: &quot;Owned&quot; State Events</a>!</p>
<p>I remember this MSC fondly. It was originally born out of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3489">MSC3489</a>'s need to allow any user in the room to send <code>m.beacon_info</code> state events. This can easily be achieved today by lowering the required power level of <code>m.beacon_info</code> to the default user level. However, you then run into the issue of any user being able to edit any other user's <code>m.beacon_info</code> event!</p>
<p>Thus this MSC attempts to modify the state events permission model so that users can &quot;own&quot; certain state events that they send. We already somewhat have this functionality - if you put your Matrix ID as the state ID for any state event, only you or users with a power level higher than you can edit it.</p>
<p>Sadly this little trick (which we use for <code>m.room.member</code> events) doesn't work in the case of live location sharing, as the feature demands the ability to share location from multiple devices at once. Hence, trying to send two <code>m.beacon_info</code> events with the same state key would overwrite each other.</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to expand the functionality by modifying the definition so that a user &quot;owns&quot; a state event if the state key <em>starts</em> with their Matrix ID. Problem solved... for the most part!</p>
<p>Do check out the MSC if you have some use cases in mind that would benefit from something like this.</p>

<h3 id="hookshot-2-6-0">Hookshot 2.6.0</h3>
<p>Evenings greetings! It's been a while since we've done a Hookshot release, so this one is pretty large. We've got two major features this time around, <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/encryption.html"><strong>Encrypted Room Support</strong></a> and <strong>Service Bots</strong>. The former now allows you to invite the hookshot bot to encrypted rooms and issue commands to it as normal, it should work entirely transparently. It currently requires a homeserver with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3202">MSC3202</a> support, such as Synapse. One final note is that it's extremely experimental and beta-y, so please do not run this on your production instances or it might format your cats. However, plaese do report all your findings to us. We love fan mail 📧</p>
<p>Service bots is another great feature that now allows you to split hookshot into several different bots, so you can have a GitHub bot, a GitLab bot, a JIRA bot and so on. It's <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/service_bots.html">extremely flexible</a>, so please have a go and let us know what you think.</p>
<p>You can find this release at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/2.6.0, or by doing <code>docker pull halfshot/matrix-hookshot:2.6.0</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, the highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add support for end-to-bridge encryption via MSC3202. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/299">#299</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add support for additional bot users called &quot;service bots&quot; which handle a particular connection type, so that different services can be used through different bot users. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/573">#573</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add new GitHubRepo connection config setting <code>workflowRun.workflows</code> to filter run reports by workflow name. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/588">#588</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parent projects are now taken into account when calculating a user's access level to a GitLab project. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/539">#539</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure bridge treats published and drafted GitHub releases as different events. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/582">#582</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove support for Pantalaimon-based encryption. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/299">#299</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase maximum size of incoming webhook payload from <code>100kb</code> to <code>10mb</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/606">#606</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even though the end of the year is usually a quiet time, big steps forward have been made in the last couple of weeks on many important areas of the rust SDK.</p>
<p>With Sliding Sync being tried out in Element-X a few more bugs and edge-case scenarios have been uncovered, where it doesn’t play well yet. For example resending the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1307">correct extension settings on session restart</a> including <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1321">to-device-tokens</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1333">invalidation indexes</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1340">incorrectly skipping to-device processing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1335">various other smaller fixes</a>. The latter PR also contains a first set of integration-tests running testing the SDK against synapse and the sliding-sync-proxy. We intend to expand on that and include it in the CI as soon as github actions are unblocked for it.</p>
<p>Similar has been done on the Timeline feature, with a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1327">better more flexible timeline pagination implementation</a>, a new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1324">virtual loading indicator item</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1344">improved logging</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1287">date dividers and read markers</a>. All good stuff, making it easier to implement a useful chat UI on top of it.</p>
<p>On async UniFFI we see the same picture: with Swift, Kotlin and Python now executing rust futures as well as handling their error results properly. And time couldn’t be any better as we can hear the creaking of the blocking-runtime we currently have under the hood in Element-X and it is starting to show the limits of what we can implement in a useful manner. We are confident we can start experimenting with it in live apps fairly soon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the last few official Matrix holiday updates didn't mention as many of the cool community projects as I would have liked, I tried to work with the community to publish a community side review of 2022 as well as possibly some small teasers of what 2023 will bring. There are a lot of very varied updates, since everyone seems to have tackled the challenge differently, but I hope you you enjoy the result as much as I did: https://blog.neko.dev/posts/matrix-year-in-review-2022.html</p>
<p>A few days later we also published the same blog post on matrix.org, with a few typo fixes and cleanups: https://matrix.org/blog/2023/01/03/matrix-community-year-in-review-2022</p>
<p>This was a bit shot notice, so I would like to extend my gratitude to everyone who contributed and took some time in probably one of the busiest periods in a year! For the same reason, I hope you can excuse if one of your favourite projects is missing. If you have anything that is sorely missing, feel free to reach out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#year-in-2022:neko.dev">#year-in-2022:neko.dev</a> and maybe I can amend the blog post.</p>
<p>Have a great 2023 everyone!</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>After a lull from the holiday period, work has continued on different parts of the spec. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706">MSC3706</a> has merged, which furthers the spec side of the work to make joining rooms faster in Matrix (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3902">MSC3902</a> for the overview).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3938">MSC3938</a> has also been merged to the spec. The proposal removes a deprecated <code>keyId</code> field and cleans up the endpoint by disallowing trailing slashes.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3885">MSC3885: Sliding Sync Extension: To-Device messages</a>!</p>
<p>Sliding Sync (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575">MSC3575</a>) is the next generation of sync - how Matrix clients receive new data from their homeserver. The spec side of the feature has been designed to be modular, with different extensions of spec provided different functionality. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3885">MSC3885</a> is one of those extensions, and defines how <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#send-to-device-messaging">To-Device Messages</a> (how different user devices talk directly to each other) would be requested by a Matrix client from the homeserver.</p>
<p>This proposal doesn't appear to have had too much review from the community yet - so feel free to check it out if faster Matrix clients appeal to you!</p>

<p>Element-web client on IPFS</p>
<p>It has been a while since last time anyone announced their effort to host (and keep up to date) Element-web on IPFS.
Since Element-web is a client-side static web application, it works just fine when accessed through local IPFS gateway (like kubo/go-ipfs, ipfs-companion browser addon makes it almost seamless).</p>
<p>Latest version (updated within 2 days of the release):
/ipns/element.sibnsk.net  (/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dj43aqkofq4ggbd7nnpvg8j1ia79deab41bfe4zrp86xoht5w2j)</p>

/ipns/elements.sibnsk.net (/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dmc2sqzfh36v85ucddrw3vbd21erk77wc1pot16j5mqqjmwjyc3)</p>
<p>Note: those are unpacked release archives from github with <code>config.json</code> being a copy of <code>config.sample.json</code>.</p>
<p>Files stored on IPFS benefit greatly from more people accessing, storing and sharing them, so everyone is invited to use and pin (periodically, as new versions are released).</p>

<p>Note: Fеnикs's efforts to host Element-web on IPFS are community efforts, this is not an official deployment of Element.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week, we merged the core API for <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/413">Tasks / ToDoList and Todos</a> using matrix events into <code>main</code>. <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/issues/424">While connecting the flutter UI</a> is ongoing (which has reverently been <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/418">revamped to be more streamline and intuitive to use</a>) this marks a major milestone in getting the proof of concept done. It shows that using stateful objects inside matrix spaces that can be collaborated upon with simple matrix events is feasible for regular end-user-style applications. The <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/413">PR</a> also brings with it integration tests and a TUI app show-casing live-updating tasks lists and tasks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile many issues have been fixed around chat, the code has been updated to latest matrix-sdk and <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/419">we are working hard on reactivating the integration test suite</a> for better quality assurance. Which is increasingly important as we are sketching out the other generic stateful objects - like the <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/428">comments system</a>, news, pins and reactions.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have received a lot of positive feedback about <a href="https://effektio.org/whitepaper/">the whitepaper we launched last month</a> outlining what we are after when building this and how we intend this all to move forward. If you haven't read it yet, we are still curious to know what you think of it.</p>

<p>There is a large interest in FOSDEM from the Matrix community, and we are very excited to see not just a stand, not just an online track, but the first ever in person Matrix devroom happening this year! The officially allotted time <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/matrix/">for the Matrix devroom</a> at FOSDEM however is only half a day.
Some friends and matrix enthusiasts who met at the first Matrix Community Summit Berlin in 2022 feel there is more to discuss and want more time to meet more of this amazing community we are part of, without taking away from the FOSDEM experience itself.</p>
<p><strong>We are happy to announce the FOSDEM23 Matrix Community Meetup at <a href="https://hsbxl.be/">Hackerspace Brussels</a> (HSBXL)!</strong>
The meetup is set to begin on Friday 03 February around 13:00 local time (CET) and will go into the evening. See https://hsbxl.be/contact/ for multiple well documented ways how to find us. Thank you HSBXL for providing a location for this!
There is no definite schedule, instead we want to give the space for discussions to develop organically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a> style.

<p>Yes, you are reading correct. This is about Matrix Art ^^</p>
<p>After quite some while, I started to work on it again. I merged the new design into main, updated the UI, and it is available at https://art.midnightthoughts.space/ again.</p>
<p>Current goals are to add the User and Post pages again and implement of the new storage system. The new system uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/travis/msc/trees/proposals/3089-file-tree-structures.md">Spaces as FS</a> at its core for the timeline.</p>
<p>Specifically, Matrix Art is basically a big Space containing a Folder for each User, similar to a Room Directory. In that, there are Timeline spaces which act as the Public Feed. This allows Matrix Art to provide a way of having invite only feeds as well, using normal room permissions.</p>
<p>In practice, the tree is like this (thanks to Travis for designing this many months ago): </p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>+ 📂 Matrix Art User Dir (public, m.space)
</span><span>    + 📂 User A (public, m.space)
</span><span>        + 📂 Timeline (m.space)
</span><span>            - 📄 Image A
</span><span>            = Room A (invite protected, &lt;no type&gt;)
</span><span>                - 📄 Image B (counted as under the timeline)
</span><span>    + 📂 User B (public, m.space)
</span><span>        + 📂 Timeline (m.space)
</span><span>            - 📄 Image C
</span><span>            = Room B (invite protected, &lt;no type&gt;)
</span><span>                - 📄 Image D (counted as under the timeline)

<blockquote>
<p>Quick update on the <a href="https://matrix.directory/">matrix.directory</a> website: we've added the custom event type <code>io.element.functional_members</code>. As you may know, many projects within Matrix don't use any custom event types at all. This can make it difficult to find custom event types, which is (ironically) why I created the matrix.directory website in the first place.</p>
<p>You can find the source code for the website on <a href="https://github.com/BramvdnHeuvel/Matrix-Events-Directory">GitHub</a>. I encourage you to check it out and contribute any custom event types you may have. Your contributions will help make the website a valuable resource for the Matrix community.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3945">MSC3945: Private device names</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3944">MSC3944: Dropping stale send-to-device messages</a></li>

<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs are in FCP.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accepted MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Both new MSCs this week are from <a href="https://github.com/uhoreg/">@uhoreg</a>, and look pretty great from a spec polish perspective (I've been a fan with doing away of public device names for ages). Check them out!</p>
<p>Otherwise, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3898">MSC3898</a> (Native Matrix VoIP signalling) received some review and attention this week.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3391">MSC3391: API to delete account data</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC would allow users to actually delete account data they've set 🎉 Currently you cannot delete top-level keys from your account data, only remove their content.</p>
<p>Deleted account data items will come down <code>/sync</code> as having their content updated to <code>{}</code>, which clients that implement MSC3391 will take to mean that the account data item has been deleted. Clients that don't implement MSC3391 will store the content as <code>{}</code>, which commonly means an unused account data item anyhow. </p>
<p>Yours truly is currently writing an implementation for this in Synapse, and so far implementing the spec as written seems sound!</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org">Shay</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's Friday which means it's time to talk about the newest Synapse release, v1.73.0! A few details:</p>
<p>Please note that this version removes legacy Prometheus metric names entirely. This also means that the <code>enable_legacy_metrics</code> configuration option has been removed; it will no longer be possible to re-enable the legacy metric names.</p>
<p>If you use metrics and have not yet updated your Grafana dashboard(s), Prometheus console(s) or alerting rule(s), please consider doing so when upgrading to this version.</p>
<p>In addition, a few notable features and bugfixes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move MSC3030 <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> endpoints to stable <code>v1</code> location (<code>/_matrix/client/v1/rooms/&lt;roomID&gt;/timestamp_to_event?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;</code>, <code>/_matrix/federation/v1/timestamp_to_event/&lt;roomID&gt;?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;</code>).</li>
<li>Reduce database load of Client-Server endpoints which return bundled aggregations.</li>
<li>Fix a long-standing bug where paginating from the start of a room did not work. Contributed by @gnunicorn.</li>
<li>Fix a bug introduced in Synapse 0.9 where Synapse would fail to fetch server keys whose IDs contain a forward slash</li>
</ul>
<p>plus much more! You can read more about this release here: https://matrix.org/blog/posts.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So... some people are distracting me by asking me to play Valheim all the time since Mistlands was in public beta (it is released now). To make that easier to synchronize, especially if not everyone can be online all the time, I wrote a small bridge: https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/valheimmatrix</p>
<p>Your own messages are
bridged from Valheim to Matrix, while other peoples messages are bridged
(privately) from Matrix to Valheim. This prevents loops and does nice puppeting,
but it means everyone needs to run their own bridge. It also means you can see
other peoples messages on Matrix, as long as they have the mod enabled, even if
you are not signed in yourself.</p>
<p>It is a very hacky experiment, but it works, so... why not show it off? Definitely check out the game, it is great!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org">madlittlemods (Eric Eastwood)</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been a tiny while since I've given an update on the Gitter bridge because I've been focusing on other <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">feature parity</a> areas like the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive">Matrix Public Archive</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/13356">speeding up <code>/messages</code> in Synapse</a> but there have been a number of changes over this time 🔢</p>
<p>The first big exciting thing is that <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2309">Gitter now bridges threaded conversations as native threads on Matrix</a> (no more impedance mismatch)!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/bxtVGAtpdvMnLgJZGcabRgza.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We've also been plugging along on less visible changes during this time like bug-fixes for bridging DM's and fleshing out more of the bridge scenarios like <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2200">leaving</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2265">deleting a room</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2257">bans</a> to ensure things stay in sync. We also started <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#21460-2022-02-01-bridge-private-rooms-to-matrix">bridging private conversations</a> to Matrix behind the scenes back in February so we have a break-away point-in-time to import back from when we do the massive history import to backfill everything. Please note, that you still can't access these private rooms on Matrix but this will come later either in the form of <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/issues/2819">inviting MXID's from the Gitter side</a> or when we give access to the <code>gitter.im</code> homeserver itself to self-manage from that side.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apart from playing Valheim, I at least also did some productive things! (Apart from everyone else who has been helping squashing bugs and jugendhackt of course.)</p>
<p>Nheko now supports MSC3664. Support for this is automatically enabled if it is enabled server side. This allows you to get notifications for events that relate to another event. For example you might want to get notifications for a reply to one of your messages. So you need to check if the replied to event was sent by you. Similar things can be done for relations like &quot;notify me for reactions to my posts in rooms with less than 20 users&quot;.</p>
<p>By default only notifications for replies are enabled. You might not notice a difference, since by default you get notified for them because the fallback includes your username, but not all bridges implement that correctly and for me the reply fallback has been one of the biggest sources of bugs, so I'd like to get rid of it long term. (Also some users disable username mentions, because their name is too generic to be useful, in which case this can help as well since it actually checks the sender.)</p>
<p>Anyway, have fun playing around with this!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://effektio.org/2022/12/06/blockchain-is-dead-long-life-web5-the-effektio-white-paper/">we have release</a> the <a href="https://effektio.org/whitepaper">EFFEKTIO white paper</a>, outlining what we are working on, why we think this matters, where we intend to head with it and what perspective we come from. We’ve published this 30-pager as a Google Doc with comments activated (if you have any feedback on it) as well as with a 2-page executive summary for the busy. You can also join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#foyer:effektio.org">#foyer:effektio.org</a> if you’d like to discuss it with us.</p>
<p>For a couple of weeks now, we have a fresh <a href="https://effektio.org/nightly-build">nightly build</a> available whenever changes have been merged within the 24 hours prior. Unfortunately the Android package, with mobile being the main target the UI has been developed for, can’t be installed as is (you need to clone and build it yourself for now), the Desktop App for Linux, Windows and Mac do give you an impression what we are after. Mind you that a) other than the chat all sections are still mainly UI mocked and b) it is still in heavy development: things break sometimes.</p>
<p>On the app itself, we have spent a lot of time on getting the chat right. The app’s core was upgraded to matrix-sdk 0.6+ to get the latest timeline API in, which required quite some refactoring. But allowed us to implement reactions, edits and replies. Encrypted Messages are still somewhat unreliable though. Prior to the nightly builds we’ve also taken some time to clean up the UI to give it a more polished look and make clear which things are simply not enabled yet. On the non-chat side of things, we’ve mostly worked on UI things (check out the ToDo-Sections and Pins), while we were waiting for the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14149">synapse fix on reading the timeline from the beginning</a>, which is now released in 1.73. Happy to get back to implementing the state machines soon.</p>

<p>libolm 3.2.14 has been released. This is maintenance release. The main change was improvements in the TypeScript types. There were also some improvements in the Python packaging, which should mean that the pre-built Python package for Linux is compatible with more distributions. Unfortunately, there are some issues with the i686 and aarch64 Linux builds, meaning that those packages are not currently available for the current version. However, if the previous version works for you, there is no reason to upgrade. We are investigating the issue, and may provide new packages later.</p>

<p>If you write code in Elm, you can now send messages in a Matrix room using a webhook.</p>
<p>I built <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/noordstar/elm-matrix-webhooks/latest/">noordstar/elm-matrix-webhooks</a>, a small wrapper around the Webhook API of <a href="https://github.com/nim65s/matrix-webhook">nim65s/matrix-webhook</a>.</p>
<p>I am building an Matrix SDK in Elm but I've never created or published a library before. This is a practice library to see what I can expect. You can install the library using</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span>elm install noordstar/elm-matrix-webhooks
</span></code></pre>
<p>And you can send a webhook message using a function like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="elm" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-elm "><code class="language-elm" data-lang="elm"><span style="color:#569cd6;">import </span><span>Matrix.Webhooks </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">as </span><span>Hook
</span><span>
</span><span>send </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">: String -&gt; Cmd </span><span>msg
</span><span>send </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">= </span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">Hook</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">.</span><span>sendMessage toMsg webhook
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#608b4e;">-- send &quot;Hi TWIM!&quot;
</span><span style="color:#608b4e;">-- send &quot;I support **Markdown!**&quot;
</span><span style="color:#608b4e;">-- send &quot;That&#39;s cool, isn&#39;t it?&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>There is currently no room for this library. Just contact me @bram:noordstar.me for the library or visit <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-webhook:tetaneutral.net">#matrix-webhook:tetaneutral.net</a> for questions about the Webhook API.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After porting the remaining fixes over from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1255">demo branch for element-x as PRs to <code>main</code></a>, we've spent a significant time debugging the two biggest know pain points: double echos for sending messages, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1260">for which we've merged a fix</a>, and unable to decrypt, which appears to be caused by a broken to-device message exchange (with an incomplete <code>sender_key</code>), which we are still investigating. Furthermore we've exposed the ability to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1257">send reactions over FFI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1261"><code>LoginBuilder</code> and <code>SsoLoginBuilder</code> can now be used with <code>.await</code></a> and merged <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1259">some smaller sled crypto store improvements</a>.</p>
<p>The latter came up when investigating, whether we could use <a href="https://docs.rs/sanakirja/latest/sanakirja/">sanakirja</a>, the <a href="https://pijul.org/">pijul</a> database backend, as a multi-process crypto store backend for mobile. This investigation is still on-going.</p>
<p>Further than an investigation is the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">uniffi async support</a>. After completing the Python backend, Swift is also passing all tests now. Additional Docs should clarify most questions. We are as excited about this as the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409#issuecomment-1331959797">Mozillians</a> seem to be. Next up: Kotlin backend.</p>

<p>I built a ChatGPT bot for Matrix! It does exactly what you think it does: you send a message, and ChatGPT will respond. It's very cool being able to talk to ChatGPT while on a mobile device.</p>
<p>It sends read receipts when messages are received by the bot, and the bot sends a typing indicator as ChatGPT is &quot;thinking&quot; 😀</p>
<p>It currently only works in unencrypted chats. I haven't managed to get encryption using <code>matrix-bot-sdk</code> working reliably yet. If it's meant to be working, tips or PRs are very welcome! I've really enjoyed tinkering with<code>matrix-bot-sdk</code> on a few projects so far.</p>
<p>Keep in mind any text you send it will go to the closed source servers of OpenAI, and it is unlikely to stay free forever.</p>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3890">MSC3890: Remotely silence local notifications</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC aims to provide a solution to remotely toggling do-not-disturb across your various Matrix clients without needing to set it on each device manually. It does so by using account data which is synced to each client. Upon a client seeing data intended for them, they will silence notifications locally until told to do so otherwise (either remotely or by the user interacting with the client directly).</p>
<p>Quite a neat idea, and adds more powerful functionality to the &quot;device manager&quot; of a client. Also handy if your other clients are things like embedded systems!

<p>This week we bring you the very last (all fingers being crossed) hookshot release not to support e2ee encryption. Our resident expert is busy working away on supporting it and is a couple of bugfixes away from providing it to you all (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/pull/299#issuecomment-1327124799).</p>
<p>In the meantime, this release was so good we couldn't keep it from you any longer. This release is packed with quality of life improvements, and general bugfixes / stability. Deploy away!</p>
<p>The highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub <code>assign</code> command now automatically chooses the top issue and/or authenticated user if not provided.</li>
<li>The RSS feed connection no longer feels the need to spam you when GitHub fails to respond within 10s. It now waits for 30s.</li>
<li>Hookshot now supports creating GitLab connections without automatically provisioning a webhook. When this happens, the bot will tell you to talk to your admin to setup the webhook manually.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@spiritcroc:spiritcroc.de">SpiritCroc</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Version 1.5.8.sc62 of SchildiChat-Android got released this week, which adds a few new interesting features on top of Element:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reworked reply rendering, to follow the rich replies specification. This improves the following:
<ul>
<li>Update the replied-to message in case the original message gets edited or deleted</li>
<li>Fix replies edited on desktop not being shown as replies on Android</li>
<li>Fix replies edited on Android being shown on Desktop with the replied-to event twice</li>
<li>Fix some weird rendering issues, like lists in a reply being completely broken</li>
<li>Nicer design, using the original sender's color, and a maximum height for the replied-to event</li>
<li>Render the replied-to event also for media replies, for example when the mautrix-telegram bridge sends an image reply</li>
<li>In the future, this will also allow us to render replied-to images instead of just writing &quot;Image&quot; in there, but this one is still on the TODO-list since I didn't want to delay a release further.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Render captions as per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2530">MSC2530</a>.</li>
<li>We now allow sending all kinds of room-specific or account-specific global custom emotes as per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2545">MSC2545</a> (but you still need to configure them with a different client before sending).</li>
</ul>

<p>Announcing <a href="https://github.com/FSG-Cat/Cats-PS-Collection/releases/tag/FMA_v1.0">Feline Matrix Assistant</a>. This is a PowerShell 7 cross platform script that aims to gather a few somewhat common matrix tasks in one place with a somewhat user friendly interface. </p>
<p>It was designed to enable users on Windows to easily access things like custom powerlevel rooms and manual room upgrades that normally require using Linux to run bash scripts if one does not want to figure out how to make the web requests using their preferred method themselves. </p>
<p>One of the other reasons i made this is just because i wanted to get more familiar the CS API and because i needed it my self because im currently a Windows user.</p>

<p>Why? As an alternative to matrix-bot-sdk, this library will be strongly typed with simplicity in mind to make sure there is no overhead to writing the perfect Matrix bot.</p>
<ul>
<li>This library also focuses on having browser support and no dependencies around NodeJS (and least amount of dependencies in general)</li>
<li>AppService functionality will be shipped in a separate package as an extension of this base package.</li>
<li>There is plenty of dependency injection for: Logging, how HTTP comms are done, and caching (come ask about the Redis cache layer!)</li>
</ul>

<p>The last few weeks of Sliding Sync in the various mobile clients is showing its fruits: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1193">Sliding Sync offline caching and session recovery</a> was merged this week, giving you the latest state of your sliding sync in milliseconds without ever having touched the network now. You need to activate it via a setting on the SlidingSyncBuilder - FFI is exposed as well. This PR also adds recovery when the server rejected our request upon a failing position, indicating our session was reset. Previously, you needed to reconstruct the entire sliding-sync with all its state yourself, now this does it internally and transparently for the API user. Additionally, we merged <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1249">a fix for invited rooms</a>, which caused a panic on FFI usage, and have one other <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1248">fix to the sliding-sync state post cache coming up</a>.</p>
<p>Talking about fixes, the retry code path had a bug, which caused retries even when the API clearly stated we needed to change request, which <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1237">is fixed now</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1247">memory store won't continue to keep all media cached anymore</a>. More fixes are being pulled out of the demo branch and coming up as PRs next week.</p>

<h3 id="synapse-operator-for-kubernetes-website">Synapse Operator for Kubernetes (<a href="https://github.com/opdev/synapse-operator">website</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mgoerens:matrix.org">mgoerens</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introducing a new way to run Synapse on top of Kubernetes ! </p>
<p>The current capabilities of the Synapse Operator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy Synapse: the operator can generate a default homeserver.yaml, or it can work with a custom homeserver.yaml, provided by the user.</li>
<li>Deploy the Heisenbridge and the mautrix-signal bridge: the operator automatically (re)configures Synapse to add the corresponding app_services.</li>
<li>Deploy a PostgreSQL database for Synapse (depends on the postgres-operator).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the operator is deployed, the <code>Synapse</code> resource becomes available. Deploying a basic instance goes as simple as:</p>
<pre data-lang="shell" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-shell "><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span>$ cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; synapse.yaml
</span><span>apiVersion: synapse.opdev.io/v1alpha1
</span><span>kind: Synapse
</span><span>metadata:
</span><span>  name: my-synapse
</span><span>spec:
</span><span>  homeserver:
</span><span>    values:
</span><span>      serverName: example.com
</span><span>      reportStats: true
</span><span>EOF
</span><span>$ kubectl apply -f synapse.yaml 
</span><span>synapse.synapse.opdev.io/my-synapse created
</span><span>$ kubectl get pods
</span><span>NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
</span><span>my-synapse-84d56d54df-c699k   1/1     Running   0          63s
</span></code></pre>
<p>The operator takes care of the deployment and lifecycle management of the Synapse instance. Similarly, the <code>Heisenbridge</code> and <code>MautrixSignal</code> resources can also be deployed alongside Synapse and are managed by the operator.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">operator</a> is written in Go. To know more about the project, please visit https://github.com/opdev/synapse-operator, there are explanations on how to deploy the operator, and examples demonstrating the main features. Or ping me on Matrix if you want to have a chat about it ! I'd love to collect some feedbacks !</p>

<p>Continued review on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706">MSC3706</a> (extensions to <code>/send_join</code> for partial state) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3852">MSC3852</a> (user agent information on /devices) by the SCT was seen. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3743">MSC3743</a> (standard error responses for unknown endpoints) was also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1347">merged</a> to the unstable spec!</p>

<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3896">MSC3896: Appservice media</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC calls out the issue that today application services, especially those that bridge third-party networks, need to re-upload all bridged media to the homeserver in order for users to view it. This can create a large strain on disk resources for homeservers that bridge third-party networks and is a problem that is worth considering.</p>
<p>The approach the MSC takes to solving this is to allow application services to reserve an exclusive namespace for MXC URL's, such as <code>mxc://example.com/_discord_.*</code>. When a user's client attempted to request a media item that falls within the exclusive namespace, the homeserver would request the media from the application service (which in turn could pull it from the third-party network's CDN) rather than the homeserver's local media repo.</p>
<p>Seems like a cool idea! Check out the MSC and leave your thoughts if you're interested or have suggestions.</p>

<p>Postmoogle v0.9.9 is here!</p>
<p>The biggest release so far. Hmm... let me try again</p>
<p><strong>THE</strong> Biggest Release (so far)!</p>
<p>The last few weeks we at <a href="https://etke.cc">etke.cc</a> enhanced and optimized Postmoogle to make it as close to common email services as possible (it's not a full Gmail/Outlook/%You-name-it% replacement for a regular user yet, some features are missing, but we're pushing it towards that goal!)</p>
<p>The most notable changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>automatic ban list (can be enabled by postmoogle admin) - no more nasty spammers will ever bother your host and if they will - Postmoogle will <del>cut the wires</del> drop TCP connections before even talking with them</li>
<li>automatic greylisting (can be configured by postmoogle admin) - good SMTP software must resend emails (and 99.99% of them do), RFC said.</li>
<li>internal email queue to re-send failed emails (with 45x errors) automatically - because Postmoogle is good SMTP software and it follows RFC</li>
<li>bridging email threads ⇿ matrix threads/reply-tos (for new emails) - that's a hard one. TL;DR: reply to email in matrix room (either by matrix thread or matrix reply-to) = email reply on email side, works both ways</li>
<li>multi-domain mode with the ability to select a domain for sending emails per room/per mailbox (all other domains will act as aliases)</li>
<li><code>!pm send</code> and thread replies send multipart emails by default (both HTML from formatted markdown and plaintext in the same email)</li>
<li>lots of other enhancements and fixes under the moogle</li>

<p>You may have noticed it has been a bit quiet from our side lately. Partially that is because I was just busy fixing issues in our new features on the Synapse side (or implementing MSCs in Synapse). But we also just have been fixing boring old issues in our project, that have been not annoying enough to get attention. For example there was a warning when configuring the project with CMake, which now shouldn't happen anymore, but also is just really boring to talk about.</p>
<p>So maybe some more exciting stuff, in theory, if your distribution builds curl with the correct flags, Nheko now supports connecting to servers over HTTP/3. This in itself is not that useful, but it might improve how Nheko behaves when switching connections or when using mobile data.</p>
<p>Nheko now also shows a completer for /commands (stuff like /me, /react or /sovietflip).</p>
<p>You can also now invert the Enter setting, so that you can send using Shift+Enter (thanks to LordMZTE) and you can update your status message over D-Bus (thanks LorenDB), which allows you to show what song you are listening to or what project you are working on, if you enable the D-Bus API and implement that as an addon in your music player or IDE.</p>
<p>Also lots of boring cleanups going on behind the scenes still, so expect cool stuff to be slower for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>This week, a tritiny update:</p>
<ul>
<li>we have experimental support for using Trinity as a library, thanks to @gnunicorn! So experimental that the public API may break at any point without warnings, and it hasn't even been published, but if you feel adventurous, take a look.</li>
<li>Flaki from Suborbital and Yours Truly have had a small and cozy chat about Trinity, where we talk about WebAssembly and Matrix, try to set up a new instance of the bot (!), find a bug (!!) but at the end it works (!!!). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIbBLs1q99w">Youtube link</a> if you're teased!</li>

<blockquote>
<p>It's been a busy week for the matrix-sdk team. As the week before, a lot of time was (well) spent on fixes and smaller improvements for mobile integration, during which a few bugs and problems where discovered and squashed. While this is ongoing, some of them already found their way back into mainline or at least have PRs pending for it: Like the bug in the read marker tracking which sometimes caused a crash <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1231">1</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1233">2</a>, a problem with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1235">timeline construction being async</a> or some minor fixes on the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1225">xtask for swift</a>. We've also noticed a significant regression in the automatic retry mechanism, which would just continue to spin for ever if the server gave a fully warranted error code back - if you experienced this, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1237">this PR should be solving it for you</a>.</p>
<p>A significant milestone was achieved this week on Async UniFFI. After getting a first PoC ready the week before, Ivan packaged it all up and sent <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">a draft PR upstream</a> with async python code calling an async rust code over FFI and interpreting the rusty result. So cool! Swift and kotlin targets are next.</p>

<p>A Qt5 library to write cross-platform clients for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As that <a href="https://tobiasfella.de/posts/neochat-e2ee/">blog post</a> by Tobias mentions, releasing libQuotient 0.7 is the immediate next step - and in line with that, 0.7 RC has been published! Not much has changed since two betas; despite a very big piece of E2EE introduced in 0.7 release cycle, things have been mostly ironed out earlier in the year. Packagers are welcome to try their tools on the new release. Be mindful though that E2EE has just been introduced and wasn't widely tested; besides, a few pieces are still missing (read the blog post!); so while it's probably reasonable to switch E2EE on for packaging libQuotient, it's NOT recommended to do the same in client applications, unless accompanied by warnings and disclaimers all over the place. The <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.7-rc">release notes</a> are still shallow and boring - the longer text will come with the final release.</p>

<p>Matrix server setup using Ansible and Docker</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> has received lots of optimizations to cut down playbook runtime, sponsored by the <a href="https://etke.cc">etke.cc managed Matrix hosting service</a>. The <a href="https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/ansible">etke.cc Ansible playbook</a> (which is an extension of <code>matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</code>) is growing to support more and more services (besides just Matrix), so the Matrix playbook being leaner prevents runtimes from becoming too slow and improves the customer experience.</p>
<p>The playbook now runs about 2x-5x faster, thanks to:</p>
<ul>
<li>various optimizations (using <code>include_tasks</code> instead of <code>import_tasks</code> in all Ansible roles)</li>
<li>the introduction of additional install-only tags (<code>--tags=install-all</code> or <code>--tags=install-COMPONENT</code>) which skip slow and often unnecessary to run uninstall tasks</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnuxie:matrix.org">Gnuxie</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone, we have released Mjolnir <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/releases/tag/v1.6.1">v1.6.1</a> (via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/releases/tag/v1.6.0">v1.6.0</a>)</p>
<p>Which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Always echo policy list changes. List changes are now always enabled, whereas before they where only shown with <code>config.verboseLogging</code>. Mjolnir now no longer hides changes made by the same mjolnir account, providing the user with feedback for changes they have made to policy lists after using the ban/unban commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy lists created by mjolnir will now be done so with support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3784">MSC3784</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mjolnir now supports specifying the config file with the argument <code>--mjolnir-config</code>. It is highly recommended that you do this as opposed to relying on the environment variable <code>NODE_ENV</code>. The documentation for running with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/blob/v1.6.1/docs/setup_docker.md">docker</a> and from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/blob/v1.6.1/docs/setup_selfbuild.md">source</a> have been updated accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix the WordList protection which was matching every message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rework the banning and unbanning of entities in PolicyLists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unbanning no longer searches for rules by <code>state_key</code> but by entity.</li>
<li>Users with longer mxids can now be banned.</li>
<li>Mjolnir no longer waits for the next client sync before applying server ACL and member bans after using the ban command</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve the clarity of the unban command. Users marked as banned by the <code>Flooding</code> and <code>FirstMessageIsMedia</code> protections can now be unbanned with the ban command. Using the unban command without <code>true</code> will now warn the user that room level bans will not be overridden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replaced <code>acceptInvitesFromGroup</code> with <code>acceptInvitesFromSpace</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <code>config.protectAllJoinedRooms</code> leaking into explicitly protected rooms and mjolnir trying to protect watched lists in some circumstances. You would only have been impacted by this if you ran <code>latest</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
