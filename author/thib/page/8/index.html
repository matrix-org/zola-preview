<h3 id="the-latest-in-appservice-proposals-synthetic-events">The latest in appservice proposals: Synthetic events</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, I've been let loose on more spec things: This time I'm looking at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">synthetic events</a>. The goal with this proposal is to give appservices more visibility over the innards and actions of a homeserver. When a user registers, we want an appservice to know (perhaps to send them a little greeting, or to provision some resources) or perhaps you want to clear up bridge resources when the user deactivates their account.</p>
<p>The hope with this proposal is that it's going to set the foundations for services to be able to hook into and provide richer functionality based upon user actions outside of rooms. It might sound a little dry right now, but eventually I'm hoping this can be extended in lots of ways and potentially do away with per-implementation modules, instead writing services that work with all homeservers.</p>
<p>Please give the proposal some love/feedback :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When asked if that was a specification change he drafted because of limitations faced when trying to implement a bridge, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, so it's something I've been plotting for a while, but internally we wanted the ability to &quot;act&quot; based upon signups to a homeserver i.e. sending a welcome. In the past this has been implemented client-side in Element, but that has obvious caveats.</p>
<p>The traditional response has usually been to write a Synapse module, but I wanted to do something that could be used on other homeserver implementations and also not have to have it co-located with the homeserver, so the natural home for this kind of logic was appservices. </p>
<p>There are other things there too like logouts / deactivations which are good for erasing data on a service too. Generally I'm hoping it can be extended further once it's stable, for other use cases too</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3401">MSC3401</a> (Native Group Voip Signalling) has been receiving positive feedback over the course of the week. The MSC spells out how one would go about implementing native, decentralised group voice and video calls over Matrix without the need for a third-party service. This is the next step forward after the full-mesh group signalling work, as demoed in previous editions of TWIM, lands. Quite exciting stuff!</p>
<p>Otherwise there was another Spec Core Team retro this week. Discussion focused mainly on how to handle event types that not every implementation using Matrix may need (think pinned messages and how that might not be very useful for IoT networks...). Watch this space!</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2666">MSC2666: Get rooms in common with another user</a>!</p>
<p>This is actually already implemented and enabled by default in Synapse, believe it or not. But no clients have support for it yet (there is an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/4897">outstanding matrix-react-sdk PR</a>...).</p>
<p>This is a pretty cool feature in my opinion, any client want to be the first?</p>

<p>This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/09/21/synapse-1-43-0-released">released Synapse 1.43</a>! This mainly contains internal changes, including those in preparation for Spaces leaving beta, but it's worth calling out that this version of Synapse now uses the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: room version capabilities</a> API to ask clients to prefer <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">room version 9</a> when creating restricted rooms.</p>
<p>Support for room version 9 was introduced in Synapse 1.42, so we'd strongly encourage administrators to upgrade.</p>
<p>Perhaps more notably for Synapse developers, we've spent quite a lot of time over the past few weeks improving the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/">SyTest</a> suite of integration tests. Several of the tests had race conditions which would cause them to occasionally fail when testing a multi-worker deployment of Synapse. These flakey tests have plagued our continuous integration pipelines, and are finally being fixed.</p>
<p>The long term plan is still to transition to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a> (written in Go) and away from SyTest (written in Perl), but we still need to ensure that SyTest is reliable in the meantime.</p>

<p>Hi there,
Didn't post updates about the etke.cc service for a while. If somebody not familiar - we setup and maintain matrix servers (based on awesome <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>)... and setup VPN... and DNS recursive resolver, and... AND!!!! Provide hosting, yes. So, starting today that's available for everyone (we offer it for some time in &quot;well, you know, we don't provide hosting, but if you want it so hard...&quot; way and it works good)</p>
<p>Even with that update (literally the most requested thing, was in every third order we got), provided hosting considered as your own server, the only difference that you don't pay hosting provider directly, but through us. So, you get root access to the server and we treat it as any other customer's infrastructure</p>

<p>What improvements did hifi bring to the formatting you may ask? I asked, and hifi answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the fallbacks are inconsistent and usually are markdown which is a lie üòÖ
replies and mentions are completely all over the place in the fallback in addition to being markdown 
the unformatted html is now something in between and doesn't do code blocks at all because those ticks are just noise on irc 
it tries to look like more that you pasted long text rather than sending markdown </p>

<p>That's very considerate for IRC user, thanks hifi!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3394">MSC3394: New auth rule that only allows someone to post a message in relation to another message</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs are in FCP.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>If MSC2918 above is giving you feelings of d√©j√† vu, don't worry. It already had FCP proposed, but due to a resolved concern being incorrectly processed by mscbot on github, a new FCP proposal was carried out.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> (Polls - mk II) receive a fair amount of attention this week. It implements inline polls via a new <code>m.poll</code> type and makes use of the concept of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">extensible events</a>. Do check it out if you're interested in voting through means other than message reactions!</p>
<p>Otherwise Alexandre Franke and myself will be looking at cleaning up the CI of the matrix-org/matrix-doc repo next week, as well as continue to move the infrastructure for the new spec release forwards.</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1235">MSC1235: Proposal for Calendar Events</a>.</p>
<p>This one is entirely new to me, and has some slight overlap with some work for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2762">MSC2762: Allowing widgets to send/receive events</a>, where we were thinking about how a widget could act as a calendar using Matrix rooms and events as a calendar backend.</p>

<p>The Synapse team is busy gearing up for 1.43.0 next week, which will make room version 9 the default for newly created <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>We've also been doing quite a lot of work on Sydent. Notably, last week's 2.4.0 release introduced a few regressions which have been resolved in subsequent point releases. The one-shot <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/v2.4.3/docs/casefold_migration.md">case folding migration script</a> for Sydent is still performing unexpectedly slowly; look for that to be resolved soon.</p>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, now is a good time to ensure you're ready for the deprecation of PostgreSQL 9.6 (November) and Python 3.6 (December). Do you have plans to upgrade to Pg 10 and Py 3.7 or newer? If not, there's no time like the present! üóì</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko got a lot more colorful this week. red_sky (nheko.im) and LorenDB finished up the jdenticon support. This means instead of the first character of a users display name, you now have the option to see a colorful avatar for users without an explicit avatar. You may have seen something similar on Github and other platforms. Currently this needs the <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/qt-jdenticon">qt-jdenticon</a> plugin, which is a bit troublesome to install correctly, but we should improve that in the near future.</p>
<p>Prezu added a homeserver entry field to the room directory, making it much more useful (no history yet though). Thulinma added a /goto command to navigate to specific events or room and fixed scrolling to a specific event (in the past it only approximately scrolled to the right location). Symphorien added the Alt+A shortcut to navigate between rooms with active mentions and notifications. Additionally Priit completed the Estonian translation.</p>
<p>Additionally we released a security fix on Monday (together with a few other clients). We only released a fix for the master branch in Nheko instead of also the latest stable release. This confused a few people, but I hope my explanations made sense. The gist of it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the master branch the local homeserver admin could force Nheko to forget which identity keys it saw for a user and as such insert a new device with the same device id, but attacker controlled identity keys and request old encryption keys from Nheko. In Nheko's case we had some protections against that, but if the server sent a device_list.left event for that user, Nheko would delete those protections. From our understanding this could not be abused over federation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 0.8.2 this can also be abused, but 0.8.2 does not implement key sharing completely. It can only forward the currently in use encryption key, not historical ones. As such the impact in our opinion was too limited to release a security fix. 0.8.2 does not allow you to send encrypted messages only to verified devices as such the homeserver admin could always insert just a different device to get access to new encrypted messages. Because of that we have a big warning in the README and when enabling encryption in 0.8.2, that one should not rely on the security of the E2EE implementation in it. We are aiming to have stable and secure E2EE in the next release (and so far it is looking good), but if you are using 0.8.2 I can only repeat, that it won't protect you from an attacker even without the disclosed security issue.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca">uhoreg</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week saw two releases of libolm, a library that implements olm, megolm, and some other Matrix-related encryption functions.  The main changes in version 3.2.5 are new functions for getting error codes rather than error strings so that implementations don't need to rely on string parsing to decode errors, and added support for fallback keys in the Android and iOS bindings.  There were also improvements in error handling in the  unpickling functions, and the shared library no longer exports certain private symbols, which caused problems when those same symbols were exported by other libraries.  The initial implementation of this last change caused build failures in some environments, so version 3.2.6 was released to fix this.</p>

<p>A few from the wizarding world this week.</p>
<p>The Polyjuice project wades further into bad pun territory with a new project: <a href="https://gitlab.com/polyjuice/polyjuice_draughts">Polyjuice Draughts</a>, a set of checkers to verify that a homeserver is set up correctly and is accessible for clients and federation.  It is similar in goal to the Matrix Federation Tester, but also checks client connections.  It can either be run from the command line, or it can be used in a Matrix room, thanks to <a href="https://gitlab.com/uhoreg/igor">Igor</a>, by sending a message of the form <code>!servertest &lt;servername&gt;</code> in a room that has an appropriately-configured bot in it.  There is currently a bot in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a> that can be used.</p>

<p><a href="https://hex.pm/packages/polyjuice_client">Polyjuice Client</a> 0.4.3 has been released.  This release adds functions for getting room membership (thanks to multi prise) and checking the server spec versions, along with some bug fixes.</p>
<p>Finally, the Polyjuice libraries have moved their git repositories from https://gitlab.com/uhoreg to https://gitlab.com/polyjuice.  The old locations should automatically redirect to the new locations.</p>

<p>I have converted the script for auto updating the Element-web instance to latest version from <a href="https://gist.github.com/MurzNN/ee64f98ab2e71b886c41d55594e5dd9e">Gist</a> to the full Git repo <a href="https://github.com/MurzNN/element-web-update">MurzNN/element-web-update</a> and added support for <code>.env</code> file to set desired variables.</p>
<p>This is a bash script that checks the new released version of Element from official Github repo and if it differs from installed - updates the local files with deleting old version (to cleanup old files) and unpacking new one, but with keeping the config files by mask <code>config*.json</code>.</p>
<p>You can put it to your <code>crontab.daily</code> and got an always fresh Element with forgetting about manual update routine.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am super happy to finally give you another update on TheBoard, due to holidays during the last weeks I had less time to work on TheBoard. But now there still accumulated enough changes for a little Update:</p>
<p>I experimented what technologies I could use for the still required GUI elements. A new User List was implemented using Vue.js. Vue seemed to be a little overkill for the kind of GUI required in the case of TheBoard. So I re-implemented the user list with react-no-js.
I am happy with <strong>react-no-js</strong> and it is used for a <strong>user list plus a tool settings menu</strong> on the right hand side of the canvas.</p>
<p>The tool panel in particular opens up a lot of possibilities. The eraser already makes use of it by giving the option to only delete specific item types (Image, stroke or text). This can be very handy if you want to delete strokes drawn on top of an image without deleting the image as well. What can be deleted is highlighted by a new <strong>filter system</strong> which allows to make any modification to objects selected by a filter function (see the attached image)</p>
<p>Other small changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Animated camera movement (for a upcoming &quot;follow other user&quot; feature) currently used for the Go Home Button</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opening a board now loads at the last edited location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The touchscreen navigation (zoom/pan) was re-implemented and should now work much better</p>

<p>The Board is very exciting! I could see in <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard#planned-use-cases">the planned use cases</a> that Timo already intends to make a widget out of it. It would be very useful for real-time collaboration, but that's not all! When asked if a standalone app will come, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo</a> confirmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed. I wasn't thinking about a builtin home-server yet. But a standalone app is still planned because I want the app to be able to manage different boards. Therefore I need to be able to control room creation and listing rooms. It should basically feel like onenote if you intend to use it like that.</p>

<p>@s7evink The game is called AAGRINDER, hosted at <a href="https://aagrinder.xyz">aagrinder.xyz</a>, the code is <a href="https://gitlab.com/MRAAGH/aagrinder">here</a>, the bridge implementation is <a href="https://gitlab.com/MRAAGH/aagrinder/-/blob/main/server/matrixappservice.js">here</a>, wiki is <a href="https://wiki.aagrinder.xyz/index.php?title=Main_Page">here</a>. The game is a text-based sandbox multiplayer browser game that I (Maze) have been building for the past 3 years. Built from nothing, no game engine. It generates an infinite procedural terrain to venture in. The integrated chatbox is nothing special but it's really nice to have it bridged to Matrix now, it's less lonely when playing alone. The appservice bridge creates users matching player name and color. Display names from Matrix are presented in the same color as in Element.</p>
<p>Hopefully you're able to extract some useful information out of this ^^</p>
