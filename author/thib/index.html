<p>A supercharged episode this week with five super exciting demos!</p>
<h2 id="dept-of-spec-scroll">Dept of Spec 📜</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey all, it's me again, not-anoa, with your spec update. I don't have a graph for you this week, but I do have curated content which hopefully holds you over until next week 🙂 </p>
<p>This week we've seen a few new MSCs get opened up:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3567">MSC3567 - Allow requesting events from the start/end of the room history</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3570">MSC3570 - Room history visibility changes for relations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3571">MSC3571 - Relation aggregation pagination</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3572">MSC3572 - Relation aggregation cleanup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As demonstrated, a few of them are follow-on work from aggregations. A lot of the work is an effort to get <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675 - Serverside aggregations of message relationships</a> through FCP - it's changed quite a bit in the last week, so if you reviewed it before then please give it a quick read! </p>
<p>We're also gearing up for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767 - Extensible event types &amp; fallback in Matrix</a> receiving attention early next year. This is currently being evaluated by features like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3245">MSC3245 - Voice messages</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381 - Polls</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3488">MSC3488 - Static location sharing</a>. If all goes according to plan, the first pieces of Extensible Events will land soon.</p>
<p>Thib has caught me quite close to the deadline on TWIM, so while I don't have a random MSC for you this week I do recommend some light reading around aggregations and extensible events - these are both major features for Matrix and help shape the future for other, even more exciting, features.</p>

<h2 id="random-msc">Random MSC</h2>
<p>Since the script didn't run, I manually generated random numbers until I actually got one, that matches an MSC and is not a draft!</p>
<p>So the random MSC is: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2461">MSC2461: Proposal for Authenticated Content Repository API</a></p>
<p>The goal of this MSC is to restrict who can access files in your content repository, which is used to share files, images, voice messages and more on Matrix. Currently this is secured by using random identifiers, but this MSC wants to add a few more restrictions: A signed-in user can still access everything, but if you don't provide an access token, when downloading media, you either can access no media, only media that was sent from that server, only media which the server already downloaded or everything. The level of access can be set by the server admin.</p>
<p>I think this would be really nice to have, but it has various challenges when implementing it in clients and when it needs to work across federation. It could limit how much random users can fill up your disk though, which is especially important for small server admins!</p>

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy holidays! This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/14/synapse-1-49-0-released">released Synapse 1.49.0</a>, our last planned release of the year. This is the last release that supports Python 3.6 or PostgreSQL 9.6; if you've not upgraded, now is the time!</p>
<p>Most notably, this release includes stable support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a>. This is a more secure alternative to long-lived access tokens, and we'd encourage clients to implement support for refresh tokens as described in the MSC.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/releases/">Sygnal 0.11</a>, which includes <em>loads</em> of bugfixes. For the Element-managed Sygnal instances, this release has reduced our daily Sentry error rate by over 99%, dramatically improving the signal-to-noise ratio of our monitoring.</p>
<p>See you in January with Synapse 1.50! 🎄</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are planning to have a small release next week, that fixes a few issues with the 0.9.0 release. It would be lovely if some of you could test one of our <a href="https://matrix-static.neko.dev/room/!TshDrgpBNBDmfDeEGN:neko.dev/">nightlies</a> or could check if the translations for a language you speak are up to date in <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/#translations">our weblate</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the fixes this week include another crash fix for handling matrix links from your browser, notification bubbles that can show values over 9000(!), better preview images for sticker and emote packs created in Nheko, allowing you to click links in replies, a few layout and click area fixes. Nheko now also keeps track of your latest reactions and gives you easy access to them in the hover menu.</p>
<p>Nheko now also finally supports pinned messages! Most of you probably don't know, but that feature has pretty much always been in the matrix spec, but very few clients expose it. Today Nheko joins that rank! It's part of our goal to provide better support for building communities. Topics can be quite limiting, because they can only contain plain text. Pinned messages allow for much more creative freedom! They can also be encrypted, while state events currently never are, but the key for that isn't reshared, so currently experience in encrypted rooms is a tradeoff. Maybe we'll go for an encrypted description event in the future, but for now this seems to be a good solution to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Let's hope the current master branch is good and we'll have a release with ALL THE FIXES next week! And thank you everyone, who already translated and reported issues! It took less than 10 hours to have 5 languages updated to 100%! Last year we didn't even have that many languages at 100%! You guys are AMAZING! &lt;3</p>

<p>A decentralized and federated way of annotating the web based on Matrix.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@daniel:matrix.danilafe.com">Daniel</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a matrix-based tool for highlighting and annotating websites. By building on top of matrix, we can effectively have a decentralized, federated and collaborative way to leave notes and highlights on pages. I wrote a <a href="https://danilafe.com/blog/introducing_highlight/">brief introduction on my blog</a>, as well as made a little bit of a simple <a href="https://youtu.be/Q3h5A0DsE1s">demo video</a>. Here's a copy-pasted list of planned and existing features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Create and send website annotations over Matrix.</li>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Store data in a decentralized and federated manner.</li>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Share highlights with other users, including those on other servers.</li>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Group annotations together and create multiple annotation groups</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong>: Use Matrix's End-to-End encryption to ensure the secure transmission and storage of highlight data.</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong>: Leverage the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/gsouquet/threading-via-relations/proposals/3440-threading-via-relations.md">m.thread MSC</a> to allow users to comment on and discuss
highlights.</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong>: Use something like <a href="https://archivebox.io/">ArchiveBox</a> to cache the current version of a website and prevent annotations from breaking.</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong> Highlight PDFs in addition to web pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Come join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-highlight:matrix.danilafe">#matrix-highlight:matrix.danilafe</a>.com to receive updates about the project!</p>
<p>I haven't published the code just yet, but I'm going to as soon as the tool is in better shape.

<p>A Social Annotation Tool Powered by Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gleachkr:matrix.org">gleachkr</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been teaching a class this semester using a tool built on the matrix-js-sdk and tentatively entitled <a href="https://github.com/opentower/populus-viewer">populus-viewer</a>. Populus-viewer uses Matrix as a backend for the social annotation of PDFs, with the goal of helping matrix become a platform for teaching and scholarly collaboration. If you're interested in learning more, or adopting populus-viewer in your teaching, come visit <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opentower:matrix.org">#opentower:matrix.org</a>! </p>
<p>Populus-Viewer currently supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotation of PDFs with highlights and pin-drops</li>
<li>Matrix conversations based on annotations</li>
<li>Audio and video messages</li>
<li>Replies, reactions, and redactions</li>
<li>Markdown for rich text</li>
<li>LaTeX for mathematical notation</li>
<li>Typing notifications</li>
<li>Synchronized reading position across devices</li>
<li>SSO, with single-click links for embedding in an LMS like Canvas or Blackboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the project develops, I'm hoping to continue to polish the reading experience, and to add support for other mime types (audio and video especially).</p>

For now refactoring a bunch of things first before adding more flashy things, but who knows, you might see me do it live on https://stream.pixie.town</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension">Dimension</a>, an integration manager alternative for Element, has received a bunch of updates over the last couple weeks:</p>

<p>A Matrix appservice for relaying messages.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/mrjohnson22/matrix-imposter-bot">matrix-imposter-bot</a></strong> - A bot that uses your account to repeat other people's messages. This gives relay-bot capabilities to puppet-only bridges.</p>
<p>I made this project a while ago to hack in a relay mode to the <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/facebook">mautrix Facebook bridge</a>. But as of this week, that bridge supports relaying natively! 🎉 Thus, my main motivation for maintaining imposter-bot is obsolete, and the project will be on indefinite hiatus.</p>
<p>With that said, it can (mostly) still be used to add relay support to any bridges that don't yet support a relay mode themselves--but native relay support is always better!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who's shown interest in the project, and to tulir  for making such great bridges!</p>

<p>An R package To Gather Stats From Chat Platforms</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A project has started to re-implement the venerable mIRCstats for Matrix! It's in very early stages, right now it only does &quot;getting a data-frame of events for a list of rooms&quot; and has no <em>actual</em> visualisations baked in <strong>yet</strong>. However, we're moving quickly, and I hope to have some initial easy-to-use viz in place over the Christmas break.</p>
<p>The project is written in R (because I am an R user, and its good for data and viz work :P) and you can find it <a href="https://github.com/GregSutcliffe/ChatStat/">here</a>. If you're new to R and want to give it a go, check out the <em>extremely</em> brief howto I just wrote <a href="https://github.com/GregSutcliffe/ChatStat/wiki/A-non-R-user&#x27;s-guide-to-ChatStat">here</a>.

<h3 id="saint-petersburg-widget-a-board-game-build-on-matrix">Saint Petersburg Widget <a href="https://github.com/toger5/st-petersburg-widget">(A Board Game build on Matrix)</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo K.</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Board games are great. And Matrix and its widget api turned out to be an excellent environment to create collaborative board games. With some really impressive conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't have to maintain a server with a database.</li>
<li>I don't have to create a custom account systems user need to register. They play with their matrix account, which also makes accessibility great. Someone invites you in a room with the game and you can play!</li>
<li>I just need to host one static file and ppl will be able to play as long as that static site exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project tries to be two things. A tech demo and inspiration to what is possible with widgets (Especially, with the changes on how widgets can be displayed in element (Check the &quot;matrix live&quot; Demos! 😊) )
Second it should serve as source and resource. For ideas and solutions on how no trust games can be executed without server (third party) side logic. And, for the ones interested, also as a resource on how widgets are implemented.</p>
<p>Last but not least the game Saint Petersburg is really fun. It takes a couple of minutes to grasp the rules but it is one of those games where there are so many things that can be considered with simple rules that it becomes more and more exciting with each round. So I really invite you to check out the <a href="https://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/rules4/Saint%20Petersburg%20-%20rules.pdf">rules</a> and give it a try. Its best to start in the <a href="https://github.com/toger5/st-petersburg-widget">Git Repo</a> or join the this room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#st-petersburg-auth:matrix.org">#st-petersburg-auth:matrix.org</a></p>
<p>To put it simple, the widget works like this: The game state is stored in the room state and is updated through the widget directly.
This of course raises <strong>questions</strong>: How is it still possible to prohibit users from cheating and manually changing parameters like, how much money they own. Everyone (who has the permission) is always able to send whatever state events they want?
How is it possible to draw random cards if there is no third party involved. Could I not just send a state event with the cards that I hope are going to be drawn and are beneficial for me. Can we make card drawing deterministic? Not really since then everyone know what is going to happen. Which kind of breaks the game...</p>
<p>I would be super happy, if someone is interested and wants to find answer to the questions above by checking out the <a href="https://github.com/toger5/st-petersburg-widget/blob/main/README.md">README</a>.

<p>Last week the Matrix Scientists had turned this room into a portal to TWIM bot's ship tank so we could all fuel it with news about our work. The spec and hookshot news were reported late when the tank was already full, sending TWIM bot's ship into hyperspeed mode 🚀</p>
<p>We lost contact with the bot for a few days but managed to restore a connection with it. It appeared to have crashed on the green planet of Fuj'ehr. Its ship shattered in pieces at impact! 💥</p>
<p>The bot managed to find most of them, but some critical pieces of the engine were missing. We needed to find those pieces quickly before the mushy ground of Fuj'ehr swallows them forever! 😱</p>
<p>The Editor has asked the Matrix Scientists to reconfigure the room and bridge it to TWIM bot's navigation tools. Each news report highlighted the position of a piece of engine on its map. 🗺️</p>

<p>Extensible events are coming! With lots of potential usecases to be built on top of the concept (such as threading, polls, and any type of data one would like to through on top of existing room events), extensible events are finally getting some love. New MSCs are available above, which detail some of these usecases. Exciting times!</p>
<p>A small correction from last week's issue: the next aggregations MSC to be focused on (after <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (serverside aggregations) is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2677">MSC2677</a> (annotations and reactions), as it's a more pressing blocker for usecases such as threading and polls.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Spec Core Team is continuing to wind down in preparation for the holidays ☃️</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3015">MSC3015: Room state personal overrides</a>.</p>
<p>Quite a novel concept, and one that would enable many usecases, such as the ones described in the MSC itself.

And as ever, there's a bunch of internal type hinting to keep the Synapse team's blood pressure at healthy levels.</p>
<p>The formal release of Synapse 1.49.0 is scheduled for the coming Tuesday. This will be the last Synapse release of 2021 as the Synapse team prepare for a break over the Christmas period. Releases will continue at the usual pace in the new year, with 1.50.0rc1 slated for 2022/01/04 and 1.50.0 for 2022/01/11.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Synapse 1.49 will be the last version to support Python 3.6, PostrgreSQL 9.6, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic): by our next release, these will have reached their upstream end-of-life. If you're reliant on any of these platforms, please ensure you have plans to upgrade.</p>

<li>Spell checking while writing a message</li>
<li>Improved markdown to html conversion when sending a message</li>

<p>From the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/03/this-week-in-matrix-2021-12-03#gitter">experimental MSC3030 implementation merge to Synapse update</a> in TWIM last week, we now also have the start of some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/7317">client usage in Element</a> to make featureful jump to date headers!</p>
<p>If you've ever tried to find a message back in the past, you've experienced the burdensome task of having to scroll back manually for days, even months! With the jump to date headers, that will be a thing of the past 😌. Clicking any date separator in the room timeline, will give shortcuts to jump to last week, last month, jump to any date using the date picker, or even the beginning of the room to follow a room upgrade chain.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-12-10-jumptodate.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is currently still in a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/7317">draft pull request state</a> but will give another update when it lands in Element Labs for everyone to use.</p>

<p>The members of the Federation have been very active and helped TWIM bot to find all the pieces of its ship! TWIM bot assembled everything together and put the engine back in its place... but at the last moment, as it was ready to take off, another bright spot appeared on the map following madlittlemods late report!</p>
<p>How could this happen? All the pieces of the engine were already there! Unsure of what to do, the bot asked Earth for directions. Earth confirmed: it was worth going to that new bright spot on the map.</p>
<p>The bot welded back the plate of the engine casing, made sure nothing could get into the ship in its absence, and started heading to the mysterious spot. The signal of our communication tools with TWIM bot weakens as it enters in the thick forest of Fuj'ehr…</p>

<p>One thing you might not know is that TWIM bot is a space traveler, sent by the Matrix scientists to explore that zone called &quot;The Possibilities&quot;. The <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> room is a portal to its energy tank, and we had received a distress signal!</p>
<p>To help the TWIM explorer fulfil its mission, we asked the Matrix community to fuel it with news before it crashed into space debris made of aggregated ignorance!</p>

<p>Goooood evening TWIM readers!</p>
<p>I want to start by drawing attention to a blog post which we published today: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/03/type-coverage-for-sydent-motivation">Type coverage for Sydent: motivation</a>. This the first in a series of three articles discussing what we've learned from making Sydent pass the <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/">mypy</a> type checker in strict mode. Improving type coverage across Synapse, Sygnal, and Sydent has been a major focus of the backend team at Element for the past few months, and we think we've learned a few useful things in the process.</p>
<p>This week we also <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/30/synapse-1-48-0-released">released Synapse 1.48</a> with loads of internal improvements, new Admin APIs, better alignment with the Matrix 1.1 spec, and more. We're planning one more release for the year, 1.49 on December 14th, and then we're taking a break until Synapse 1.50 on January 11th.</p>
<p>Importantly: Synapse 1.49 will be the last release to support Python 3.6, PostrgreSQL 9.6, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) — if you're reliant on any of these platforms, please ensure you have plans to upgrade.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think of the article (and the Synapse release!), and we'll see you next week!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the vein of <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Gitter feature parity</a> on Matrix, we've made the first steps towards a better public static archive. We merged an experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> into <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> which lets you use the unstable <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> client API endpoint go from a given timestamp to the closest event ID. This will allow us to implement a calendar jump to date interface to be able to navigate to any day in the rooms history. Our first target to add the jump to date UI in is <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen</a> since we plan to server-side render Hydrogen for the actual public static archive as well.</p>
<p>To enable the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> unstable API endpoints in Synapse, add <code>experimental_features</code> -&gt; <code>msc3030_enabled: true</code> to your <code>homeserver.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/client/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/rooms/&lt;roomID&gt;/timestamp_to_event?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;

<p>Also as part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>, when you use the client API endpoint, if your homeserver sees that the closest event it has locally in the database is next to a gap in the history, it will go out and ask other federated homeservers what they have as the closest event instead.</p>

<p>Stop the press. This is a last minute TWIM. We've been beavering away on <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot</a>. It's gained many features in the last week, but the big thing is that hookshot has gained the ability to provision connections over a provisioning API, which means it should hook nicely into Dimension (and other integration managers, in the future)!</p>
<p>Other notable features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple webhooks per room</li>
<li>Support for the username/text fields on an incoming webhook (slack style)</li>
<li>Named webhooks, so each hook now has a sensible displayname</li>
<li>The ability to spawn GitHub actions from rooms using the <code>!gh workflow run</code> command</li>
<li>Lots of new supported events from GitLab, such as reviews and tag pushes</li>
<li>Hosted documentation (so all of the above is easy to setup), it's a bit in progress atm.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're aiming for a release very very soon, hopefully in the next week or so!

<p>We finally figured out what caused the issues with the flatpak on GNOME, especially on Arm. It should now work properly, if you use Flathub. On the Pinephone (and other systems, that don't set a locale/use the C locale), timestamps should now not be needlessly long anymore. Redactions got a face-lift to distinguish them better from normal messages. We added a workaround for Synapse not allowing you to leave a banned room. We now delete the room from the room list permanently if Synapse returns &quot;unknown room&quot; when trying to leave it. Spaces can now show the entire hierarchy in the sidebar (if you pull it out) and you can navigate to subspaces by clicking on them in the roomlist, even if you collapsed the space hierarchy in the sidebar.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">Krille Fear</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we have released FluffyChat 1.0.0 with a whole new design, a lot of bug fixes and huge performance improvements.</p>
<h3 id="new-design">New design</h3>
<p>The new design has bigger message bubbles with fancy shadows and bigger fonts. The contrast has been improved and some elements, like the time on every single message bubble, are now hidden by default. But they are not gone! Detailed message information are now accessible in the new message info page, where we not also can see the message type and the timestamp, but also the whole JSON source code of each timeline event.</p>
<h3 id="spaces">Spaces</h3>
<p>Spaces have got a lot improvements and bug fixes. They have moved to the bottom bar of the chat list (while this bottom bar is still hidden if you have not joined any space yet). The multi account switcher have instead been moved to a top left drop-down menu. So we finally got rid of the drawer, which seems to be a deprecated material design feature anyway. This new UX makes spaces much easier to use. You can long press on them to go to the space settings and long press on any chat in the chat list, to add or remove a chat to (or from) a space.
We still have no support for the spaces summary API though so we don't have yet the ability to discover new rooms inside of a space but this feature might land soon in the Matrix Dart SDK.</p>
<h3 id="multi-account">Multi Account</h3>
<p>FluffyChats multi account is still in beta but got a lot of bug fixes as well. You are now able to sort your accounts in &quot;bundles&quot; which can be very handy. The new account switcher button gives you a much better overview over your connected Matrix accounts now.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>We did a lot refactoring under the hood in our Matrix Dart SDK and have improved our in-app database a lot. On the web it now uses IndexedDB natively while it tunes all database transactions on all platforms. This leads to the fastest FluffyChat experience we ever had and makes the app finally kinda usable with bigger accounts on all platforms. The room list is now lazy loaded which speeds up the app start (especially with multi account enabled) a lot.
Choose your own primary color
This was a long requested feature. You can now choose your favorite color to style your FluffyChat for your needs:</p>
<p>What will you choose? Let me know in the comments. I mostly like blue on my Ubuntu desktop.</p>
<h3 id="new-major-version">New major version?</h3>
<p>Ahhh by the way... What does it mean that we now have FluffyChat 1.0.0? It does NOT mean that the previous versions were not yet stable or ready for daily use. It just means that we make so many changes at once that we thought, bumping the first digit of our pseudo-semver version string might make sense. We totally messed up our versioning and are now going to do it better. Promised!!
What's next?
We are often asked: What is the roadmap of FluffyChat?
Well... we still don't have a clear roadmap and might never have. FluffyChat is completely driven by volunteers. But what I can say that we would like to do in the next months is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better QA -&gt; We would like to write some integration tests, push release candidates before new releases and involve everyone in testing them to offer the best stability possible.</li>
<li>Native video calls -&gt; Yes! There will soon land support for native video calls in the Matrix Dart SDK and we are going to implement this in FluffyChat.</li>
<li>Stories -&gt; Like you might know from SnapChat, WhatsApp or Instagram, stories are little messages you can send to all of your contacts and which will disappear after 24 hours. I would really like to implement this in FluffyChat!</li>
<li>Better notifications for iOS</li>
<li>Deeper support for spaces</li>
<li>Knocking feature</li>
<li>Drag&amp;Drop for web</li>
</ul>
<p>But as I said this is what we would like to do. We can't give any warranties on anything. We can only do our best. But you can help us if you like (You don't have to).</p>

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a>, a multiplatform Matrix SDK written in Kotlin, has grown up since the last release 6 month ago! It has it first release candidate for v1.0.0!</p>
<p>If you don't heard about Trixnity: Trixnity aims to be strongly typed, customizable and easy to use. You can register custom events and Trixnity will take care, that you can send and receive that type.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing is the new trixnity-client module. It provides a high level client implementation and allows you to easily implement clients for Desktop, Mobile and Web. You just need to render data from and passing user interactions to Trixnity. The key features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
exchangeable database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
fast cache on top of the database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
E2E (olm, megolm)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
verification</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
room list</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
timelines</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
user and room display name calculation</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
asynchronous message sending without caring about E2E stuff or online status</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
media support (thumbnail generation, offline &quot;upload&quot;, etc.)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
redactions</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, Trixnity only supports JVM in all modules, but JS and Native will follow soon (to be exact: when Kotlin 1.6.10 and ktor 2.0.0 is released). I also implemented the module trixnity-olm, which implements the wrappers of libolm for Kotlin JVM/JS/Native.</p>
<p>Cross signing is one of the next big features, I want to implement.</p>

                <h2 id="a-full-day-of-matrix-talks">A full day of Matrix talks</h2>
<p>This year, the Matrix.org Foundation is excited to host the first ever <em>Matrix.org Foundation and Community</em> devroom at FOSDEM. A full day of talks, demos and workshops around Matrix itself and projects built on top of Matrix.</p>
<p>Matrix is the open source project that publishes the Matrix open standard for secure, decentralised, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed reference implementations.</p>
<p>We encourage people working on the Matrix protocol or building on it in an open source project to submit a proposal! Note that companies are welcome to talk about the Matrix details of their open source projects, but marketing talks are not welcome.</p>
<p>We want this devroom to be a space where the Matrix community can show its work, where developers can talk about the challenges they faced and how they overcame them, and where people can get a glimpse of the future of the Matrix protocol and ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="talk-details">Talk Details</h2>
<p>The talks will be pre-recorded in January. They will be played during FOSDEM, followed by a session of live Q&amp;A depending on the format. During the playback of the talk, people will be able to comment and ask questions in the chat (via Matrix!).</p>
<p>The talks can follow one of three formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 min lightning talk, ideal to showcase your project and make people want to have a look at it</li>
<li>20 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A, for topics that can be covered briefly</li>
<li>50 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A for more complex subjects which need more focus</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly encourage you to prepare a demo when it makes sense, so people can actually see what your work looks like in practice!</p>
<p>Of course, the proposal must respect the FOSDEM terms as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conference language is English. All content must relate to Free and Open Source Software. By participating in the event you agree to the publication of your recordings, slides and other content provided under the same licence as all FOSDEM content (CC-BY).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="submitting-a-proposal">Submitting a Proposal</h2>
<p>Proposals must be <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22">submitted on FOSDEM's conference management system Pentabarf</a> before December 17th 2021. If you are not used to Pentabarf, you can follow this <a href="https://eyskens.me/beginners-guide-to-pentabarf/">beginners guide to Pentabarf</a>.</p>
<p>We expect to receive more requests than we have slots available. The devroom organisers (two community members and one core team rep) will be reviewing the proposals and accepting them based on the potential positive impact the project has on Matrix (as defined in by the Mission section of https://matrix.org/foundation).</p>
<p>If a project proposal has been turned down, it doesn't mean we don't believe it has good potential. Maintainers are invited to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> Matrix room to give it some visibility.</p>

<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (serverside aggregations) is getting lots of updates from Bruno in order to align the proposal with what is currently implemented in the wild (as it's easier to iterate on incremental improvements from a starting point grounded in reality). This MSC is a bit of a special case though, as it was implemented with stable prefixes before the MSC landed (in the before times...).</p>
<p>Regardless, thank you very much to Bruno for going through and finally untangling and help land aggregations in the spec! This MSC is one of four which describe how aggregations should work in Matrix, and it's great to see them finally being properly spec'd, especially as further features start to be built on top of them (such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440/">threading</a>!).</p>
<p>And finally, a further thank you to community members <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3509">an OpenAPI schema fix</a>!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a>!</p>
<p>This proposal aims to allow appservices to get ever greater visibility into what is happening on the homeserver, while still maintaining full process separation.</p>
<p>A lot of the time solutions to complex problems require knowing when a user has registered or logged in, with what name/3pids etc, when users change their emails, etc. Hooking into these non-room-based actions can help with developing useful features. Maybe you want an appservice that plays a sound effect whenever a user signs up to your homeserver!</p>
<p>These days, that is often achieved by homeserver implementation-specific solutions, such as <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/">modules</a> in Synapse. Being able to notify of these events using a standard API shape would be hugely beneficial to generalisation of projects.</p>
<p>So give the proposal a look over and review if that interests you!

<blockquote>
<p>As predicted last week, we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/23/synapse-1-47-1-released">released Synapse 1.47.1</a> on Tuesday. This is a security release which fixes an issue with Synapse's built-in media repository. Admins are strongly encouraged to upgrade.</p>
<p>Otherwise, relatively slow week: a handful of of the team have been away (Happy Thanksgiving, Americans!), but we <em>did</em> release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.48.0rc1">Synapse 1.48.0rc1</a>. Most importantly, this release candidate includes changes to improve the efficiency of large background updates from past releases, which should significantly reduce database load when upgrading. It also adds support for the <code>/v3</code> APIs defined in version 1.1 of the Matrix specification.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about 1.48 when it's formally released next week, but as always, we appreciate folks trying out the release candidates and letting us know how they behave.</p>

<li>Bridging typing notifications and any types of files from Matrix to Google Chat</li>
<li>Bridging Google Meet links from Google Chat to Matrix</li>
<li>Syncing group members from Google Chat</li>
</ul>
<p>(edits and deletions are only available on Google Workspace accounts, not normal accounts. I have no idea why they did that, but that's just how Google Chat works 🤷)</p>
<p>There's still a bug where it sometimes silently stops receiving messages, which I'm currently trying to solve (or work around). After that I'll make a v0.3.0 release. Backfilling history may also happen in the near future</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver">Matrix Webhook Receiver</a></p>
<p>Do you like to receive notifications in matrix?
Matrix Webhook Receiver (MWR) is an add-on for the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-webhooks">matrix-appservice-webhooks</a> bridge. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">Webhooks</a> are essentially web interfaces for applications to &quot;push&quot; data to.
The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.</p>
<p>This is where MWR comes in:
It can receive any (JSON) content, optionally reformat it nicely (customizable!), and forward it to the webhooks bridge which will post it to a room for you. If you are running any software service, there is a good chance it can notify you via webhooks!</p>
<p>Right now, several example configurations exist, ready for you to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>GitLab (including Community Edition/self hosted)</li>
<li>Ansible Tower/AWX</li>
<li>Grafana Alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here is the GitHub webhook as seen in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org">#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org</a>:
<img src="/blog/img/webhook_receiver.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>More examples of apps currently in development: Prometheus Alertmanager, Jellyfin</p>
<p>It is also easy to use to send messages from the commandline with standard tools (<code>curl</code>), e.g. for your cron jobs! See the README for an example.</p>
<p>Some other webhook matrix things exist, but often require</p>
<ul>
<li>➖ admin access to server (appservices)</li>
<li>➖ installing and running and maintaining a specific bot per service</li>
<li>➖ create and set up accounts and passwords for each bot to use</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, MWR requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>➖ matrix-appservice-webhooks set up on your server by your admin</li>
<li>➖ some knowledge of how to send POST requests for one time setup. I want to improve that, suggestions are welcome!</li>
<li>➕ MWR can be installed and run by anyone who can access the bridge</li>
<li>➕ one single MWR supports any amount of notifying apps!</li>
<li>➕ you don't need admin access to the server to add more apps</li>
<li>➕ no need to develop a bot/plugin to support new apps, just write a quick jinja template</li>
<li>➕ multiple people can use a single MWR instance by sharing HTTP basic auth credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>Other features:</p>
<ul>
<li>can post into encrypted rooms (see readme)</li>
<li>automatically generated API docs</li>
<li>message formatting presets including html markup or m.notice</li>
<li>arbitrarily customizable webhook URLs</li>
<li>list and manage currently installed webhooks in your browser (<a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver/blob/main/examples/GUI_screenshot.png">screenshot</a>)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks! Some exciting new news on the bridge front: I've renamed <code>matrix-github</code> to <code>matrix-hookshot</code> to better reflect it's not-just-GitHub-ness. That's not all though, as there are new features too:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridge now supports <strong>Rust</strong> as a companion language (we're aiming to rewrite critical sections in rust). Some parts of the formatting code have already been rewritten.</li>
<li>The bridge now supports JIRA (full puppeting!)</li>
<li>The bridge now supports generic webhooks too, with the ability to write <strong>custom handling code</strong> inside the state event to process these hooks into pretty messages.</li>
<li>Basic support for GitHub discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the works:</p>
<ul>
<li>A provisioning API to hook into integration managers</li>
<li>More GitLab support</li>
<li>Better GitHub discussions support</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the 0.9.0 release last week, we have of course been busy fixing all the bugs different people reported. Messing around with the sticker pack editor and then leaving room should not make Nheko crash anymore. The problems where the flatpak has issues starting on Gnome systems are still under investigation. We thought we had a solution, but that seems to have broken other stuff! 💥</p>
<p>Apart from that we have been doing some after release party cleanup. Apart from some refactorings, you can now filter your rooms on whether they are a direct chat or not in the sidebar. This is in addition to the filters we already had for favourites, spaces and your other personal tags. User colors should also now be much less biased towards blue and jdenticons should have more variance. Expect the next release to be a much more colorful experience!</p>
<p>Speaking of colors, Twily made this awesome ZX Spectrum inspired logo after we changed our Gitlab bot to be more colorful! Check it out:

<h3 id="maubot">maubot <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">↗</a></h3>
<p>A plugin-based Matrix bot system.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>maubot <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> was released last weekend. Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling encryption should be much easier: the device ID can be entered in the web UI or you can just do <code>mbc auth --update-client</code> to automatically log in and store the access token and device ID in maubot.</li>
<li><code>mbc auth</code> can now log in with SSO.</li>
<li>The standalone mode for running a single plugin with a static config is now mostly functional and <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/maubot/usage/standalone.html">somewhat documented</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I finally took a day to figure out Sphinx/autodoc and made some decent-looking autogenerated <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/python/latest/">docs for mautrix-python</a>. I'll probably extend that to generate maubot-specific API references too eventually.</p>

<h3 id="server-stats">Server_Stats</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev">MTRNord</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today is a good day for those calling me a spy, someone not wanting to care about privacy and for those who did publicly harass me for server_stats.</p>
<p>People using the API likely already noticed it wasn't reachable for a while. Effective immediately I am currently leaving all rooms  the bot is part of. This will take days or even months considering this are 6397 rooms at the time of writing. I am not going into the motives of why I am shutting it down. It comes down to personal reasons.</p>
<p>There won't be any dump of the data. The source will be kept public. Note though if anyone ever tries to run it that you need about 600GB of space for synapse, a lot of CPU, a lot of RAM and plenty of workers as this can easily crash synapse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Server_Stats was an incredibly useful project. It pains me a lot to see it go, but it pains me even further that its author got harassed. This is not an acceptable behaviour, and we are better than that as a community. Thanks for this incredible project MTRNord, it's been both exciting and useful.</p>
