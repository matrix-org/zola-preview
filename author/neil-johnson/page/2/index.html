<h2 id="matrix-1-0">Matrix 1.0</h2>
<p>The big news this week is that we declared ourselves to be out of beta. You'll want the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation">full post</a> for all details, but here's a taste:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are very excited to announce the first fully stable release of the Matrix protocol and specification across all APIs - as well as the Synapse 1.0 reference implementation which implements the full Matrix 1.0 API surface.</p>
<p>This means that after just over 5 years since the initial work on Matrix began, we are proud to have finally exited beta!! This is the conclusion of the work which we announced at <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019">FOSDEM 2019</a> when we cut the first stable release of the Server-Server API and began the Synapse 0.99 release series in anticipation of releasing a 1.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of the 1.0 we also announced the Matrix.org Foundation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the full update on the Foundation, please check out the new website content at <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">https://matrix.org/foundation</a> which should tell you everything you could possibly want to know about the Foundation, the Guardians, the Foundation’s legal Articles of Association, and the day-to-day Rules which define the Open Governance process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has stuck with us along the way to make this possible.</p>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>We released Synapse 1.0.0 this week to coincide with Matrix 1.0. As a release Synapse 1.0.0 focuses on security and stability which in turn builds a firm foundation for the performance improvements that you can expect to see over the Summer. Read all about it <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/synapse-1-0-0-released">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="crypto">Crypto</h2>
<p>We have not one but two working end to end demos of device cross signing! This is going to be huge and is key step towards being able to make Matrix e2ee by default.</p>
<p>Cross Signing Demo</p>
<iframe width="480" height="315" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" src="https://scitech.video/videos/embed/1c8a0262-dee9-4927-b9e9-9856a7f4d8bf" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Additional Treats</p>

<p>But wait there's more! Pantalaimon not only provides a way for clients and bots to participate in e2ee rooms, it now provides the ability to search. Checkout this (relgious themed) <a href="http://s1.webmshare.com/1ZOvM.webm">demo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pattle">Pattle</h2>
<p>Pattle is going great guns at the moment. Here's <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:pattle.im">Wilko</a>:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version of Pattle has been pushed to F-droid!</p>
<ul>
<li>Add ability to create group chats!</li>
<li>Show chat creation events ('Wilko has created this group')!</li>
<li>Show emote messages correctly!</li>
<li>Handle display name changes! Display names of messages will now be as they were at time of sending.</li>
<li>Don't show invite and join events in direct chats This is only happens for the two initial users in the direct chat. If someone invites someone else to the direct chat (trough another client), the invitation will show up in the timeline.</li>
<li>Use the timeout parameter while syncing. This means that receiving new messages should be way quicker! (Thanks Mathieu!)</li>
<li>Store messages retrieved remotely (thanks Mathieu!) This means that scrolling up in a chat will be faster now, because the messages are cached.</li>
<li>Always show a date header above the oldest event</li>
<li>Show replies correctly in chat overview</li>
<li>Show sent state icon next to own message in chat overview</li>
<li>Show newly joined rooms at the top in the chat overview</li>
<li>Use a bit bolder font for chat names in overview
To install this release, add the following repo in F-droid:</li>
</ul>

                <p>Well here it is: Synapse 1.0.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.0 is the reference implementation of the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec">Matrix 1.0 spec</a>. The goal of the release overall has been to focus on security and stability, such that we can officially declare Synapse (and Matrix) out of beta and recommended for production use. This means changing the default room protocol version used for new rooms to be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/37871106c6fc6013c17b5711fb93853fff140267/proposals/2002-rooms-v4.md">v4</a>, which includes the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/f714aaadd011ac736d779f8460202a8d95799123/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">state resolution algorithm</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/event_id_hashes/proposals/1659-event-id-as-hashes.md">collision-resistant event IDs</a>, which are now formatted to be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/proposal/no_slash_in_event_id/proposals/1884-replace-slashes-in-event_ids.md">URL safe</a>.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.0 also ships with support for the upcoming <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v5.html">v5 room protocol</a> (which enforces honouring server key validity periods), but this will not be used as the default for new rooms until a sufficient number of servers support it.</p>
<p>Please note that Synapse 1.0 does <strong>not</strong> include significant performance work or new features - our focus has been almost exclusively on providing a reference implementation of the Matrix 1.0 protocol. But having cleared our backlog on security/stability issues we will finally be now unblocked to pursue work around reducing RAM footprint, eliminating forward-extremity build up, and shipping new features like Edits, Reactions &amp; E2E cross-signing support.</p>
<p>As part of the security work, Synapse 1.0 contains a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md#it-used-to-work-just-fine-why-are-you-breaking-everything">breaking change</a> that requires a valid TLS certificate on the federation API endpoint. <strong>Servers that do not configure their certificate will no longer be able to federate post 1.0.</strong></p>
<p>It is also worth noting that Synapse 1.0.0 is the last release that will support Python 2.x and Postgres 9.4. For more information see <a href="/blog/2019/04/08/synapse-deprecating-postgres-9-4-and-python-2-x">here</a> but the TL;DR is that you should upgrade asap.</p>
<p>This release has been a long time coming. Many thanks indeed to everyone who helped test the release candidates and provided feedback along the way.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.0 is just one component of a larger Matrix 1.0 release, which you can <a href="/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation">read all about here</a>.</p>
<p>As ever, you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.0.0">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.

                <p>0.99.5.2 contains a critical performance fix following a regression that was introduced in 0.99.5. Affected servers will have experienced increased CPU and RAM usage with a knock on effect of generally sluggish performance.</p>
<p>Separately, we are also looking into reports relating to further performance degradations that may have been introduced as part of 0.99.5, though consider the 0.99.5.2 fix to be a significant improvement on previous 0.99.5.x releases.</p>
<p>Please upgrade asap.</p>

                <p>Okay folks, this is an important one. v0.99.5.1 will be the last release before we ship Synapse v1.0. <strong>It is really important that you upgrade to v0.99.5.1 because it implements rooms <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/room_v4/proposals/2002-rooms-v4.md">version 4</a> - which is the room version that Synapse 1.0 will default to.</strong></p>
<p>This means that Synapse 1.0 servers will create new rooms as version 4 by default and servers that have not upgraded to at least v0.99.5.1 will not be able to join those rooms.</p>
<p>Over the coming days we will announce a release day for Synapse v1.0, the idea is to give admins 2 weeks notice so that anyone yet to configure their federation SSL certificate has time to do so. <strong>This is important, failure to configure your certs will mean not being able to federate with v1.0 servers.</strong> If you are not sure if you certs are valid, you can test <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/">here</a> and read <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">here</a> for more info on what to do.</p>
<p>Aside from room v4, this release also includes the ability to blacklist specific IPs from federating as well as experimental support for edits and reactions. We are not quite ready to mark the feature 'done done', but it is very close. Watch out for news as the feature lands properly.</p>
<p>We're really close to v1.0 now, give us a few more days and we'll announce an official release date.</p>
<p>As ever, you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.5.1">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.

                <p><strong>TL;DR DON'T PANIC - Synapse 1.0 will support Postgres 9.4 and Python 2.7</strong></p>
<p>Folks, this is an update to explain that we will be shortly deprecating Synapse support for Postgres 9.4 and Python 2.x.</p>
<h2>What are we doing?</h2>
From the dates described below, we will no longer guarantee support for deprecated versions. This means that Synapse <em>may </em>continue to work with these versions but we will not make any attempt to ensure compatibility and will remove old library versions from our CI.
<h2>When is this happening?</h2>
<strong>Synapse 1.0 will continue to support both technologies, but subsequent releases may not:-</strong>
<p>For Python, we shared that we would discontinue to Python 2.x support from<a href="/blog/2018/12/21/porting-synapse-to-python-3/"> April 1st 2019</a>, so for the first release that follows 1.0 we do not guarantee Python 2.x support.</p>
<p>For Postgres, will give server admins 6 weeks to upgrade to a newer version, and will guarantee support <strong>up until 20th May 2019.</strong></p>
<h2>Why would you do this to us?</h2>
We have multiple reasons, but broadly:-
<ul>
 	<li>We want to make use of new language features not supported in old versions. This will enable us to continue to improve the performance and maintainability of Synapse.</li>
 	<li>Python 2.x overall will be <a href="https://pythonclock.org/">end of life'd at the end of the year</a>. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/">Postgres 9.4's final release</a> will follow 2 months later on 13th February 2020.</li>
 	<li>Since very few server admins still use these technologies on the wild, providing support is costly and we want to reduce our overall maintenance load.</li>
</ul>
<h2>La la la I am ignoring you - what will happen?</h2>
You will be able to upgrade to Synapse 1.0, but will likely experience incompatibilities that prevent you upgrading further. Seriously, you really need to upgrade.
<h2>Okay, but I have questions, where should I go?</h2>
Come and say Hi in #synapse:matrix.org and we'll do our best to help you.

                <p>Hey hey, a Synapse release for you today.</p>
<p>The big news in 0.99.3 is that the user directory has been completely re-written and should now be much more performant - this will benefit all installations, but especially those housing larger servers.</p>
<p>Aside from that we continue our 1.0 preparations and relatedly we've improved our docs, in particular to explain how .well-known works. On the perf side we've added rate limiting to login and register endpoints as well as now batching up read receipts to send over federation.</p>
<p>I've said it before, and I'll say it again:-</p>
<blockquote>The most important thing that admins should know is that prior to 1.0 landing later this month, <strong>it is essential that the federation API has a valid TLS certificate - self signed certificates will no longer be accepted.</strong> For more details see our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">handy guide</a>. Failure to do this will result in being unable to federate with other 1.0 servers.</blockquote>

                <p>TL;DR </p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">If you run a Synapse ensure that your federation certificates are valid <a href="/federationtester/">here</a>. 
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">If they are not valid check out the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">FAQ</a>.

Folks, as you know we are now very close to achieving Matrix 1.0 and finally being in a position to shed our ‘beta' tag. It has been a long time coming and speaks to the huge effort from hundreds of people over the past 5 years.
<p>A critical step towards this goal is the release of Synapse 1.0. We want to ship Synapse 1.0 as soon as possible but can't do so without your help! </p>
<p>We'd like to introduce <a href="http://arewereadyyet.com/"> AreWeReadyYet.com</a> - a quick and easy way for everyone to track the progress and check if their federation is ready for Matrix 1.0!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4110 size-medium" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-15-at-10.05.19-300x214.png" alt="Are we ready yet?" width="300" height="214" /></a></p>
Synapse 1.0 is good news for anyone running a Synapse installation - it contains critical bug fixes, security patches, a new room algorithm version and dramatically improved user and room search. However, as part of the security work it also 
<b>contains a breaking change from previous Synapse versions. From 1.0 onwards it will necessary to ensure a valid TLS certificate on the federation API. Self signed certificates will no longer be accepted</b>. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md#it-used-to-work-just-fine-why-are-you-breaking-everything">Why would we do such a thing?</a>
<p>In anticipation for this, everyone currently running a homeserver must ensure that they have checked their federation certificate (check yours <a href="/federationtester/">here</a>). Failure to do so will mean being unable to federate with any Matrix 1.0 compliant server. If your server fails the check, our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">FAQ</a> has all the details on what you need to do. </p>
<p>This post is a call to arms to try and get as many admins to upgrade their certificates as possible. We are tracking adoption at <a href="https://arewereadyyet.com">https://arewereadyyet.com</a> - currently this sits at about 55% - we need this figure to be higher before we can pull the lever.  </p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Check that your server has valid certs - then tell all your admin pals to do the same. 
<b>Friends don't let friends miss out on Synapse 1.0, send them to</b><a href="http://arewereadyyet.com/"><b> arewereadyyet.com</b></a><b> (or tweet </b><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Are%20you%20running%20a%20Matrix%20server%3F%20Are%20you%20ready%20for%20Matrix%201.0%3F%20Find%20out%20at%20https%3A%2F%2Farewereadyyet.com!"><b>here</b></a><b> to remind them!)</b> We really need the community to help us here because at some point soon, we will need to pull the lever and release.</p>
<p>Once we make more progress on adoption, we will announce an official release date and finally get Synapse out of beta!</p>

                <p>Well now, what have we here? Synapse 0.99.2 is the latest in the 0.99.x series as we step ever closer to 1.0.</p>
<p>0.99.2 is an incremental release including a bunch of performance improvements, enhancements to room upgrades and generally a plethora of bug fixes.</p>
<p>The most important thing that admins should know is that prior to 1.0 landing later this month, <strong>it is essential that the federation API has a valid TLS certificate - self signed certificates will no longer be accepted.</strong> For more details see our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">handy guide</a>. Failure to do this will result in being unable to federate with other 1.0 servers.</p>
<p>As ever, you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.2">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aaron:raim.ist" rel="nofollow">Aaron Raimist</a> has made some updates to Riotic, which was a good chance for me to revisit it. It works nicely and is a great alternative to the Electron version of Riot. I also like being able to use <a href="https://riot.im/develop" rel="nofollow">https://riot.im/develop</a> as an app.
<blockquote>I've slightly tweaked Joakim Ahlen's Riot wrapper for macOS, riotic, which uses the native WKWebView instead of Electron. I updated the app to be sandboxed so it has very limited access to your system. I also updated the interface to follow macOS conventions and updated it to use the latest version of Swift.<br /><br />riotic does have some limitations though. Riot doesn't support VoIP on Safari so riotic can't support VoIP either and WKWebView doesn't support notifications as far as I can tell. Right now it uses a really old Riot icon, maybe I'll ask about using one of these community made icons <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/4474">https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/4474</a>.<br /><br />It does have some advantages over the official Riot Electron app though. The app is only ~12 MB compared to Riot which is ~180 MB, it also uses significantly less RAM. riotic also allows you to pick what Riot URL to use so you can run /develop as a desktop app.<br /><br />You can download riotic from <a href="https://github.com/aaronraimist/riotic/releases/tag/v1.1">https://github.com/aaronraimist/riotic/releases/tag/v1.1</a>.</blockquote>

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aaron:raim.ist" rel="nofollow">Aaron Raimist</a> has created a new room for Formula 1 fans:
<blockquote>Now that the Formula 1 season is getting underway it's probably a good time to announce <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@CIA:matrix.org">@CIA:matrix.org</a>'s new(ish) room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#f1:matrix.org" rel="nofollow">#f1:matrix.org</a> When this blog post is released there will be 16 days left before the first race of the 2019 season<br />There was previously a Formula 1 room but it was merged with Snoonet's IRC channel which tends to be extremely busy. This is a matrix only room.</blockquote>
That's it folks, your normal Ben orientated programming will continue next week. Bring back Ben, bring back Ben.
