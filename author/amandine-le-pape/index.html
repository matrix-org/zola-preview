                <p style="text-align: left;"><em>We'd like to share a guest post from Dmitriy Volkov (who's been using Matrix almost since day 1!) - announcing the Goto::Hack event at the Tor Onionspace in Berlin in January.  The Onionspace will be on fire as folks attack the New Year by tackling the critical problem of internet decentralisation. A week long brainstorm and hack feels like the right way to go after the Christmas break! GNUnet, Tor, Matrix, pick your topic, or mix them all, and join the gang!  Hopefully we'll have someone there from the Matrix core team too (although it depends on funding and timings).</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>-- Amandine</em></p>
We'd like to invite you to discuss and hack all things decentralized internet: from conceptual issues like identity and foundational tech like network stack to most practical questions, e.g. "What do I advise people at Cryptoparty in lieu of WhatsApp?" or "How do I make a GNUnet app?".
<p>Broadly, we'll do networks, distributed systems, infosec and telecom - with GNUnet / secushare and Matrix developers, find out more <a href="https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipns/QmSgwwdejjsizQnKffKo6e84vfvBWCH5tnGpAwLPJVvhby/">here</a>.</p>

<p>It's well known Big Brother has been listening to our phone calls, reading texts and partnering with companies like Amazon or Google for a while now; more and more countries start censoring Internet - it's not just China. Most &quot;secure&quot; communications solutions like Threema or Telegram suffer conceptual issues, like being unsecure-by-default or controlled by single commercial entity.
Decentralized systems - the proposed technical part of the solution - bring forth their own challenges: how do we conveniently identify an entity (considering revocation and squatting), and why do blockchains as innovative as Bitcoin and Ethereum churn through gigawatts of energy while handling miserable tens of transactions per second? What can serve as practical, scalable infrastructure for a decentralized network alternative to current Internet: on physical and channel levels, in terms of routing, etc.? How do we forge convenient XMPP, free Signal, a WhatsApp that can be both used universally and trusted?</p>
<p>How do we make the Internet less centralized and what can be done to make existing distributed technologies more popular? Why is Tor not enough and how long are we going to continue communicating in plaintext? How do we cook identity, and can we better consensus?</p>
<p>During the event we will discuss, hack, code, debug and develop - both systems (GNUnet, Tor, Matrix, etc.) and applications based on them, fix UX and write docs. The goal is to make a measurable contribution to solving some of the described problems through the course of the week, meet in person with the people tackling the issues you care about and return home with the desire to continue hacking.</p>
<p>Please register at our <a href="https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipns/QmSgwwdejjsizQnKffKo6e84vfvBWCH5tnGpAwLPJVvhby/">website</a> if you'd like to come - also, if you're not local, we are doing a group booking at a hostel and will be having some Berlin hacker community tours! (Use <a href="https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSSmmDueDSGYparbzPuibQUnTmji3CTJX5MgvttBRbqUn/">this</a> if the first link didn't work for you - that's an IPNS issue and one thing in scope for the event.)</p>

                <p>Some updates on the conferences Matrix attended over the last 3 weeks: WebRTC Summit in Santa Clara, TAD Summit in Istanbul, WebRTC World West in San José and fOSSa in Rennes. Great shows, ending in lots of interesting discussions and new excitement in Matrix!</p>
<h2>WebRTC Summit (Santa Clara, November 4-6)</h2>
Matrix was a <a href="http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/3242708">sponsor</a> at the Santa Clara <a href="http://webrtcsummit.net/">WebRTC Summit</a> at CloudExpo, and opened the WebRTC track alongside our friends at <a href="http://www.openpeer.org">Open Peer / Hookflash</a>. Matthew presented Matrix as the missing signalling layer for WebRTC and as a good federated complement to MQTT and COAP for IoT use cases: you can find his presentation <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-03-Matrix_Missing-Link_IOT.pdf">here</a>.
<p>Great techie discussions and debates down there, the stand was flooded with interested people and John had a hardtime answering everyone by himself on day 2!</p>
<p>But he still found a few minutes to do a TV interview for SYSCon TV on Tuesday evening! :)</p>

<h2>TAD Summit (Istanbul, November 12-13)</h2>
Matrix was a partner at <a href="http://tadsummit.com/2014/">TAD Summit</a> in Istanbul this year, a great opportunity to meet a very good mix of developers, industry players and mobile networks! TAD mixes conferences and technical workshops where everyone gets involved to create a vibrant ecosystem for Telecom Application Developers. Again really productive discussions and meetings as we continue our search for partners to help support the uptake of Matrix.
<p>Matthew's talk was fully recorded so just watch the video to get the real pitch!</p>

<h2>WebRTC World (San Jose, November 18-20)</h2>
Matrix's attendance at <a href="http://www.webrtcworld.com/conference/west/default.aspx">WebRTC World</a> in San Jose was more rewarding than expected! The team was ready to be part of the expo and give a talk on FOSS WebRTC options... but didn't hesitate to jump at the opportunity when a demo slot opened up! And that was a worthwhile decision as Matrix ended up winning not one but<strong> TWO awards from the demo:</strong> The <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Audience Choice Award</strong></span>
 as the audience's favourite demo of the 10 shown on Tuesday, and also the overall <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Best Social Integration Award</strong> </span>
from the Jury! So a big congrats to the dev team who were rushing to get the fine details ready in time and to Matthew for getting the audience's attention! And of course a even bigger thank you to everyone who voted for us, including in the Jury!

<p>Of course this drew lots of interest, and WebRTC Expo ended up the busiest show ever for the team who pitched solidly at the booth for 2 days in a row!</p>

<h2>fOSSa (Rennes, November 20)</h2>
And eventually, while Matthew and John were celebrating in San José (or flying home, more accurately), Amandine was also evangelising at home in Rennes (France), where <a href="https://fossa.inria.fr/">fOSSa </a>was gathering experts from the opensource world for 3 days. Matrix was presented within the Serendipity section on the conférence, "Le Carrefour des Possibles": 6 minutes to pitch an open project that making dreams possible.
<p>So if you speak French or are not afraid to only read from <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-17.2-Matrix.pdf">the slides</a>, check out the video the team made of the pitch. The official one should be available soon!</p>

                <p>Matrix has been showing off in various places these last months. But whilst drowning in the launch we haven't managed to keep the blog updated with what's been going on! We are now much more back on track and able to catch up at last, as well as start on new ground for upcoming events!</p>
<p>So you'll find here a summary of the 4 events Matrix attended in September and October as well as all the presentations we gave!</p>
<h5>Disrupt San Francisco (September 6-10)</h5>
<a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/6am.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-191" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_48491-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_4849[1]" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/6am.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-138 size-medium" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/6am-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2014/event-home/">Disrupt SF</a> was the launchpad of Matrix! We participated in the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-hackathon-2014/">Hackathon </a>as both a sponsor and a competitor (see our live <a title="Techcrunch Update!" href="http://matrix.org/blog/2014/09/09/techcrunch-update/">update</a>!), and exhibited at the conference as a Product Sponsor.</p>
<p>Three teams announced that they were using Matrix to build their hack but eventually only <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/go-social">Go Social</a> presented their project: a social network for travelers with a very nice UI! Go Social used Matrix APIs to add chat to their platform. The video of Go Social's presentation is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/video/go-social-presents-disrupt-sf-2014-hackathon/518404022/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Matrix team worked on <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/animatrix">Animatrix</a>: a chat app allowing you to build your own 3D animated cartoon and share it with any other friend using Matrix-compliant app using Unify. We had to hack together a basic Matrix Android client in order to do the demo .... You can see our project's presentation <a href="http://techcrunch.com/video/animatrix-presents-disrupt-sf-2014-hackathon/518404216/">here</a>!</p>

<p>The three days conference was great in terms of reaching out to devs and getting good feedback on Matrix! We love seeing people's eyes lighting up and people saying &quot;Eventually someone is doing it!&quot; when we explain what Matrix is about :) So thank you all for your support!</p>

<h5>Disrupt Europe (London, UK - October 18-21)</h5>
After getting public in SF, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-eu/event-home/">Disrupt London </a>was the next steps to release a more stable version of Matrix and encourage even more people to build on Matrix. Again we sponsored both the Hackathon and the Conference and we brought with us a very cool <a href="http://www.trossenrobotics.com/phantomx-ax-hexapod.aspx" target="_blank">PhantomX robot from Trossen Robotics</a> which was also the price we gave away during the hackathon.
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_50191.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-193 aligncenter" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_50191-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_5019[1]" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Two teams pitched a Matrix project at the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-europe-hackathon-2014-london/">Hackathon </a>this time:</p>
<p><a href="http://hujambo.co">Hujambo</a> is a very cool chat app allowing you to chat in your native language to someone who is going to read you in their own native language.</p>
<p>Movidiam did a very ambitious hack, modelling the trends of conversation in the Matrix ecosystem and displaying them a force-directed graph visualisation using D3.</p>
<p>Matrix team worked on a MIDI to Matrix bridge allowing to share and display music you play in a chatroom and jam together even if in different places. Here is the demo video:</p>

<p>Another great time to meet a lot of interesting people and build partnerships!</p>
<h5>WebRTC Summit Europe and Rich Communication Conference (Berlin - October 27-29)</h5>
Matrix was a Silver sponsor at <a href="http://rich-communication.com/webrtc-summit-europe/">WebRTC Summit</a> and the <a href="http://rich-communication.com/">Rich Communication</a> events and it was a great opportunity to show the multiple ways that Matrix can be considered.
<p>The first day was the WebRTC Summit where the focus was on the challenges and next steps of the standard. Matthew presented Matrix explained how it can be used as the missing signaling layer to WebRTC raising lots of questions and interest. You can see the presentation <a title="Matrix, the missing link to WebRTC" href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-03-Matrix_Missing-Link_IOT.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-201 aligncenter" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="photo" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>The two next days were focusing more on <a href="http://www.gsma.com/network2020/rcs/" target="_blank">Rich Communication Services </a>(RCS) and again Matrix didn't go unnoticed, and not only because of the lightspeed presentation from Matthew waking everyone up on Wednesday morning! This time Matthew addressed Telcos and RCS vendors with the compelling proposition of using Matrix as the bridge between RCS/IMS/PSTN and the world of over-the-top applications.  The presentation is downloadable <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-10-29-OTT-Federation-Strategies.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Again some great feedback and lots of animated discussions over the future of the IP communication world!</p>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/apex.png"><img class="wp-image-202 aligncenter" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/apex-300x176.png" alt="apex" width="406" height="238" /></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sebastian_2.png"><img class="wp-image-203 aligncenter" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sebastian_2-300x53.png" alt="Sebastian_2" width="425" height="75" /></a></p>
<p> </p>
<h5>WebRTC Summit (Santa Clara - November 4-5)</h5>
Beginning of November Matrix was back on the West Coast  to sponsor the <a href="http://webrtcsummit.net/">WebRTC Summit</a>, collocated with the CloudExpo. Matthew opened the WebRTC track with another presentation again raising a lot of interest and question, and greatly supported by <a href="http://hookflash.com" target="_blank">Hookflash</a> in their following session. The presentation is available <a title="Matrix, the missing link to WebRTC" href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-03-Matrix_Missing-Link_IOT.pdf">here</a>.
<p>And the tour continues: this week Matrix sponsored the <a href="http://tadsummit.com/2014/">TADSummit</a> in Istanbul and next week we will be in San José at the <a href="http://www.webrtcworld.com/conference/west/">WebRTC World Conference &amp; Expo</a>: meet us there and watch out for the upcoming TADSummit news!</p>

<p>We realized we're missing a high level overview highlighting the key points of the specifications and architecture of Matrix, which could be useful for those who don't feel like going straight into the specs. So here is a <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Introducing-matrix.pdf">quick presentation</a> to fill in some of the gaps!</p>
<p>Please fire away with any questions :)</p>

                <h1>Why Matrix?</h1>
Hi, I'm Amandine and I look after the businessy bits of Matrix.org. I have a technical background and have always had the need to see the bigger picture. My motivation in starting Matrix has mainly been to make my dream of ubiquitous real-time communications come true and fix what felt broken in the industry. Here is the story.
<p>When studying telecoms I was fascinated by converging networks, the “Next Generation Network” as we called it. Wow, imagine! Having fixed lines, mobiles and computers able to communicate with each other? Call a number and have the ability to answer seamlessly on any device? And the capability to do video calls and share files? <i>That </i>was definitely Next Generation at the time! Especially given the best we could do with a mobile was bad GSM, MMS and WAP if you were lucky.... A decade later video calling is possible on any device; I can share anything I want with my contacts (pictures, videos, files, random stickers) thanks to hundreds of different apps; sometimes my history is even synced across several devices! And if I choose my mobile provider carefully I can even have a “One Number” service! :)</p>
<p>But still, we're far away from the ubiquitous dream of 10 years ago. None of my apps are talking to each other. One number is more often “one login per app”. My conversation history is scattered across all the apps (who never experienced the “Did you tell me on Facebook, Whatsapp, Skype or SMS???” question followed by 10 minutes of intense fiddling with your phone which of course is running out of battery?). My address book and profile data is stored everywhere by companies like Facebook, Google and random startups, but who knows how much they really value your privacy...</p>
<p>Is the tech not good enough yet? Only partially: most of the features, typically IM, video, VoIP,  are already available and widely used. However it is a reality that no tech has really imposed itself as an interoperability standard. What about economic blockers then? A better bet: what are the incentives for big companies and small startups to share their communities? Most of these corporations choose a business model that locks their users into walled gardens, directly linking their valuation to this user base. But ultimately this is bad for competition and bad for the users.</p>
<p>What about phone networks then? Why don't they do anything? Well, they have tried. It's called RCS (Rich Communication Services), or joyn. It's a good initiative designed by committee and implemented as a functionality deeply embedded in the network rather than a light over-the-top deployment and consequently very expensive and time-consuming to put in place. Similarly as per telco's historical positioning, RCS is more focused on quality of service than quality of user experience. But RCS is facing a few challenges: communications over IP must be free for the user to compete with the Skype &amp; WhatsApp of this world, which limits a lot the return on investment of the deployment of an expensive network update, limiting the adoption of RCS by mobile networks. Besides quality of service is not necessarily what will trigger a success when competing with over the top apps which are 100% focused on providing the best user experience... And despite the GSMA's best efforts implementing interoperability between networks is proving very painful, limiting the growth of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>But ultimately we all know that today success is driven by users. This multitude of minds which decides the exact split of fun and usefulness that will define the value of a product and make it crazily successful overnight. So why are users not pushing for this ubiquity? I see two reasons: first they often don't realize how useful it could be and second: there is nothing to push! Indeed it can easily be considered as handy to have one app per group of people I want to communicate with: Facebook messenger with my school friends, Whatsapp with international friends, Skype with my family, Snapchat with my boyfriend, Voxer with my best friend... But why can't I have only one app, the one <i>I</i> prefer, to get in touch with everyone, whatever they are using? And if I want a fancy Tango-like video experience then I couldstill launch Tango for this scenario and have the whole chat history there. I truly believe that once fragmentation will be over everyone will wonder how we could ever live with it.</p>
<p>And what about privacy? Isn't it bad enough that the second I send an email to my friend asking if he's booked his flights to Madrid I get a flurry of airline adverts for flights to Spain? Even without going into the debate of whether governments should file every citizen, it's a question of principles - I'd rather have my communication history and my contacts stored by someone I trust and avoid useless adverts.  Some of you will say “Oh but you're French. ‘Vive la Révolution!' is your default motto...” - but think about it for a minute:</p>
<p>Imagine: only install the apps <i>you</i> want on your phone for communication. Use the ones you prefer because the UX is great or you love their smileys. Your whole address book is there, correctly merged. All the conversation history with your friends and family is there. And you don't care what app they're using. Or how they logged in: your app discovers them based on any ID (email, phone number, Facebook): you just need to have them in your address book. You know where your data is - perhaps stored by a new startup using renewable energy for their data center, just because you want to save the planet. Or by your geeky brother running his own server under his bed (using end-to-end encryption if you think he might be nosy!). You can still have many apps but each allows you to do different fun stuff: fancy video, crazy pictures, drawings, imaginative stickers. You control your communication.  You decide what to you want to use, who you want to trust. Welcome to Matrix.</p>
