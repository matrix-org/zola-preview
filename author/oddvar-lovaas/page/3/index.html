                <p>This week, Matrix is visiting San Francisco for <a href="http://fluentconf.com/" title="Fluent">Fluent</a>, a web development conference over three days, with events ranging from 2-day training sessions to 10-min showcase presentations.</p>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/fluent1.png"><img src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/fluent1.png" alt="fluent" width="1328" height="540" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-894" /></a></p>
<p>I had the opportunity to participate in the latter: Tuesday's Solutions Showcase in the Community Lounge. The presentation was recorded, here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhZ1D_DFQAY" title="video">video</a> and <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-20_Fluent_10min.pdf">slides</a>.</p>
<p>I also had a 30-min in-depth <a href="http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015/public/schedule/detail/42666" title="talk">talk</a> earlier today, where I went through a case study of adding Matrix to your existing app (<a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-20_Fluent_30min.pdf">slides</a>). After evaluating options, we decided to use the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/chat.html" title="flux-chat">flux-chat</a> example by Facebook - it's a basic chat application that uses their internal message dispatcher and showcases how a React/Flux app works.</p>
<p>The code for the original example can be found <a href="https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-chat/" title="here">here</a>, and the complete diff of changes necessary to integrate it with Matrix - using the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk" title="matrix-js-sdk">matrix-js-sdk</a> - can be found <a href="https://github.com/facebook/flux/compare/master...ara4n:mxstore" title="here">here</a> (thanks to Matthew for yet another late-night hack!). I think it's very cool to see how easily their chat example can be turned into a Matrix client, albeit a fairly basic one! <a href="http://arasphere.net/flux/examples/flux-chat/" title="Here">Here</a> is an online version if you want to try it out!</p>

<tr style="border:0">
<td style="border:0" colspan="2"><em><center>The original flux-chat and the Matrix-enabled flux-chat</center></em>

<p>If you have any questions or comments, we are still at Fluent - you can catch us in the exhibition hall in booth #208 - or virtually, as always, in <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a>!</p>

                <p>This week, Matthew and myself went to the <a href="http://webrtc-conference.com/" title="WebRTC conference">WebRTC conference</a> and its related <a href="http://webrtc-conference.com/kranky-geek/" title="Kranky Geek">Kranky Geek</a> event in sunny London.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ipcortex/status/588261705144262656" title="picture credit: twitter.com/ipcortex"><img src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/matrix1.jpg" alt="Matrix at WebRTC conference London 2015" width="1024" height="579" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-799" /></a></p>
<p>Matrix had a speaker slot in both events; the first talk was &quot;Proposing an open interoperable signalling layer for WebRTC&quot; (<a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-15-Matrix-WebRTC-London.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>As I was talking to people in the tea-breaks between sessions, I was actually surprised at the amount of people who not only knew about Matrix, but who had been following eagerly since the early days, and had questions about specific features and recent developments!</p>
<p>Later in the day it was time for the Kranky Geek, and the talk then was a bit more technical: &quot;Interoperable HTTP Signalling with Matrix&quot; (<a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-15-Matrix-WebRTC-Kranky-Geek.pdf">slides</a>). The talk included a &quot;dangerous demo&quot; where we made a WebRTC call from our Matrix iOS App to our webclient for the first time - thanks to the <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenWebRTC/status/588784386440593408" title="OpenWebRTC">OpenWebRTC</a> team for helping us make the demo!</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/webrtcHacks/status/588341443363786752" title="picture credit: twitter.com/webrtcHacks"><img src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/matrix-krankygeek.jpg" alt="matrix-krankygeek" width="1024" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800" /></a></p>
<p>What's great about these kind of events is the feedback and discussion following talks; lots of people have relevant experiences and opinions that they are happy to share, and of course questions on how exactly different features actually work. </p>
<p>It's always great to meet new people and have lots of various discussions. Hopefully we have got a few more people interested in Matrix - we have already seen some new joiners in the <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a> room! </p>
<p>Next up is <a href="http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015/">Fluent</a> in San Francisco next week, where I will be <a href="http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015/public/schedule/detail/42666" title="speaking">speaking</a>.</p>

<p>This release contains a whole lot of fixes, new features, and nicer UI - see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#changes-in-matrix-android-sdk-in-030-2015-04-10" title="changes">changes</a> file for details, but in summary:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The UI has been switched to Android's Material Design</li>
	<li>Android Lollipop is now fully supported</li>
	<li>We have added support for contacts</li>
	<li>Various accessibility and usability fixes have been contributed by Nolan Darilek (thanks!)</li>
	<li>We also have clientside GCM support thanks to Leon Handreke! We need to make some changes server-side before GCM can be used, but that's on the current ToDo-list!</li>
	<li>Lots of bugs fixed, as usual, thanks to everyone who reported an issue.</li>
</ul>

                <p>This weekend was spent at <a href="http://www.idea-london.co.uk/" title="IDEA-London">IDEA-London</a> where the <a href="tadhack.com/2015/tadhack-mini-london" title="TADHack-mini London">TADHack-mini London</a> hackathon was going on. In total, there were around 18 different projects being hacked on all day Saturday and Sunday morning, before a 5-minute presentation on Sunday afternoon. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/telestax/status/586835787892842496" title="picture credit: twitter.com/telestax"><img src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tadhack.jpg" alt="tadhack" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-720" /></a></p>
<p>Four different projects used Matrix in one way or another: Matrixbot - a robot controlled through standard messages in a Matrix room - done by Scott Barstow and Anders Brownworth (project <a href="https://github.com/scottbarstow/tadhackLondon2015" title="code">code</a> and presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDIkqyxnac" title="video">video</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/587253016463564801" title="picture">picture</a>). Neil Stratford's hack included lighting up his roll of LEDs whenever a push-notification hit his Matrix webclient (<a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/587262829390123009" title="picture">picture</a> from the presentation). </p>
<p>The Co-Browsify hack by Žilvinas Račyla and Augustinas Bacvinka allows two people to browse the same webpage, with scrolling events being collected and duplicated to the other browser via Matrix (<a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/587272083106848768" title="picture">picture</a> from the presentation). Finally, Matt Williams of Metaswitch created a Project Clearwater/Matrix Gateway which enables Project Clearwater/IMS to set up WebRTC calls with any matrix user (project <a href="https://github.com/matt-williams/sprout/tree/matrix" title="code">code</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/587269326899654656" title="pictures">pictures</a> from the presentation) - this is the first time we have had a SIP-to-Matrix call (let alone IMS-to-Matrix) set up!</p>
<p>As TADHack sponsors, Matrix had two Parrot Drones to hand out as prizes, and the winners for best Matrix-related hacks are Matt Williams for the Clearwater/Matrix Gateway -  and Scott Barstow and Anders Brownworth for Matrixbot! We are also happy that the other two Matrix-related projects were rewarded with prizes from the other sponsors (<a href="http://blog.tadhack.com/2015/04/12/tadhack-mini-london-winners/" title="full list of winners">full list of winners</a>).</p>

<p>Both the recording equipment and the video team volunteers were new this year, so some problems were encountered, which means that our lightning talk video unfortunately was lost. However, our talk in the IoT-devroom is now available:</p>

                <p>It's competition time! Matrix is sponsoring <a href="http://tadhack.com/2015/tadhack-mini-london/" title="TADHack-mini London">TADHack-mini London</a>, which is a two-day hackathon with focus on WebRTC technology, happening on April 11 and 12 at <a href="http://www.idea-london.co.uk/" title="IDEA London">IDEA London</a>. We will award a <a href="http://www.parrot.com/uk/products/bebop-drone/" title="Parrot Bebop Drone">Parrot Bebop Drone</a> (which itself can be hacked via the <a href="https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3/ARSDKBuildUtils" title="ARDroneSDK3">ARDroneSDK3</a>) to the two best hacks using Matrix, and we can't wait to see what kind of ideas people will come up with!
<img src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/parrot.png" alt="Parrot Bebop Drone" width="552" height="244" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-482" />
We strongly encourage anyone to get involved - have a look at our <a href="http://tadhack.com/2015/tadhack-mini-london/" title="Development Resources">Development Resources</a> (scroll down a bit) and have a think of what you can create within the 16-hour timeframe. The reference Matrix web client already supports WebRTC - you can play with this by registering a user via the matrix.org <a href="/beta/" title="web client">web client</a> (or you can check out the reference <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-angular-sdk" title="web client">web client</a> and run it on your own box), inviting a user to a 1-1 chat (click on their avatar and &quot;start chat&quot;) and then clicking the microphone or video camera icon in the top right to start a voice/video call. </p>
<p>We brainstormed some ideas for further WebRTC/Matrix work in our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/IDEAS.md#implementing-webrtc-support-in-mobile-apps" title="GSoC">GSoC</a> (Google Summer of Code) project proposals, for example &quot;Implementing WebRTC support in Mobile apps&quot; and &quot;Multi-way voice and video conferencing&quot;. These are very probably too extensive for the 16-hour hackathon, but might provide some ideas for smaller hacks.</p>
<p>We will be at the event to offer mentoring and help, but you can already start thinking about potential hacks - come talk to us in the <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a> room!</p>

            <div>
                
                <p>Last week, we mentioned that we released part of a first implementation of the long awaited <a title="Application Service (AS) API" href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api">Application Service (AS) API</a> as part of the <a title="Synapse 0.7.1 released – with Application Service API" href="http://matrix.org/blog/2015/02/19/synapse-0-7-1-released-with-application-service-api/">0.7.1 release</a>. The AS API makes it dead simple to connect your service into the Matrix ecosystem using an existing standard Matrix server.</p>
<p>And today we're very excited that the first implementation using this API has gone live! <a title="OpenMarket" href="http://openmarket.com">OpenMarket</a> just announced the <a title="OpenMarket Matrix Gateway" href="http://www.openmarket.com/matrix/">OpenMarket Matrix Gateway</a> which lets you chat with non-Matrix users via their phone number: as you send and receive instant messages from your Matrix chat room, they'll receive and send SMSes back to you, which will appear in your Matrix room as IM, extending your reach to any non-Matrix user.</p>
<p>To use the new OpenMarket service just login to the matrix.org <a title="webclient" href="/beta/">webclient</a> and start a chat with your target mobile phone user by identifying him/her with a Matrix ID in the format <em>@+&lt;msisdn&gt;:matrix.openmarket.com</em> (msisdn being the internationally formatted phone number of your contact) - any messages to them will be sent via OpenMarket's SMS service. The SMSes will be sent from dynamically assigned numbers so that the recipient is able to respond to your message(s) - and the user will first receive an &quot;opt-in&quot; message from the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway to invite them to the conversation (just as they would if you invited them to a conversation in Matrix). Note that there are a finite set of these dynamically assigned numbers: OpenMarket reserves the right to recycle contact numbers if they have not been used to send or receive traffic for more than 2 months.</p>
<p>Sending SMS through the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway will be free during the introductory beta testing period, and users will be warned when that changes - although usage is subject to a per-user fair-usage policy. Despite the free service today, you'll have to associate a valid PayPal account to your account in order to send messages for security purposes. OpenMarket will not (and cannot) charge this account without your consent. You can associate your PayPal account via the settings page of any reference Matrix web client which has been configured to be aware of the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway - for example, the matrix.org <a title="webclient" href="/beta/#/settings">webclient</a>.</p>
<p>You'll also have to accept the OpenMarket Matrix API End User License Agreement to use the service.</p>
<p>The OpenMarket Matrix Gateway is a great example of how the Application Service API can be used to extend Matrix, we're really happy to see it live and hope it's going to give our community lots of ideas! There are a lot of services that could mutually benefit from being integrated with Matrix, and the AS API makes this much easier to accomplish!</p>
<p>Thus, we strongly urge you to have a look at the <a title="AS API" href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api">AS API</a> - and as always we are happy to answer any questions at <a title="#matrix:matrix.org" href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a>!</p>

                <p><a href="http://fosdem.org" title="FOSDEM">FOSDEM</a> was great fun! Two days full of conferences and demos; lots of interesting technologies and interested people - and most of all: talking to so many new faces about Matrix and potential uses and integration ideas. </p>
<p>Both our lightning talk and IoT-devroom talk were completely filled up with huge queues outside (sorry folks), and our demos seemed to go down fairly well.  In fact several people <a href="/code">set up their own homeserver</a> and joined the federated network of Matrix servers during FOSDEM itself!</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/561535884567130112" title="view from our stand">view from our stand</a>, from our <a href="http://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/561543011662696448" title="lightning talk">lightning talk</a> and from our <a href="http://twitter.com/thierrymarianne/status/561828001231695872" title="IoT-devroom talk">IoT-devroom talk</a>.</p>
<p>If you missed the talks, recordings will (soon) be available from the FOSDEM site (links will be added here once available) - in the meantime you can check out the slides here: <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-31-Matrix_FOSDEM.pdf" title="lightning talk">lightning talk</a> and <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-01-Matrix-IoT-FOSDEM.pdf" title="IoT-devroom talk">IoT-devroom talk</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who came to have a chat about Matrix and/or help with setting up their own homeserver (or to play with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyIw2AkYpeo">Sentinel, our mascot</a>) - please do reach out to us via our <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="Matrix HQ room">Matrix HQ room</a> or IRC (<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/matrix">#matrix on freenode</a>) if you have any problems - or want to help us fix our python packaging ;)  Now is a great time to get involved as we are currently landing new APIs and soon will be offering an Application Server API to ease bridging to other services.</p>

                <p>This weekend, Matrix is heading to FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting) in Brussels, Belgium. We will be hosting two events: a <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/matrix/" title="lightning talk">lightning talk</a> on Saturday at 16:30 in room H.2215 (Ferrer), and an <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/deviot04/" title="IoT devroom talk">IoT devroom talk</a> on Sunday morning at 11:00 in room H.2213.</p>
<p>FOSDEM's <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/" title="schedule">schedule</a> is looking very interesting and varied, and we hope we can learn about interesting projects - and of course show how and where Matrix can be used to lots of FOSDEM-attendees. Please come over and have a chat if you are interested; we have a stand on the second floor in the K building - just take a right after coming up the stairs and say hi! </p>
<p>We have also set up a Matrix &lt;-&gt; IRC bridge on the #fosdem channel on freenode, which means that any conversation happening there will be copied over to <a href="/beta/#/room/#fosdem:matrix.org" title="#fosdem:matrix.org">#fosdem:matrix.org</a> - and vice versa. Making bridges to other services is currently being worked on as part of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/application-services/drafts/application_services.rst" title="Application Services API">Application Services API</a> - we want to be able to connect different services together via Matrix.</p>
<p>Finally, we are always available in the official <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="Matrix HQ room">Matrix HQ room</a> - please join and say hi!</p>
