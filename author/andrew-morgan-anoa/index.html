<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>The Spec Core Team had another retro this week, and part of what we talked about was how most of the spec PR writing falls to just a few people. Starting this week, we're going to try and diversify that work across the Spec Core Team, both for reducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> and increasing bandwidth of spec PRs. Hopefully the results of that will be noticeable!</p>
<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3783">MSC3783: Fixed base64 for SAS verification</a>!</p>
<p>For those that don't know, &quot;SAS verification&quot; refers to the act of two devices verifying each other through the use of Short Authentication Strings (SAS). This is the backbone of emoji verification when you verify with another user or one of your own devices.</p>
<p>It turns out that libolm, the olm and megolm encryption library, originally incorrectly encoded the base64 output of the message authentication code (MAC) calculation, which is a values that's passed between devices. Due to trying to maintain backwards-compatibility with older clients, this has not been fixed in newer clients yet.</p>
<p>This MSC proposes bumping the MAC algorithm identifier (which is agreed upon between devices when verifying) to a something new, which allows newer clients to know when to use the new or old (and incorrect) method of calculating the base64 encoding of MAC values.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this has no security implications. It's just unfortunate to have incorrect base64 encoding when interfacing with other, non-libolm, implementations of olm and megolm.

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org">Shay</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Synapse team is hard at work making Synapse faster and leaner. Work continues
apace on faster room joins over federation, and it seems that the work might land
sooner rather than later, although there are no solid dates yet.
In other news, profiling work is being done to determine ways to hopefully increase
the speed of local room joins and DM creation. Stay tuned for more information in the future on that.
Finally, it was an RC release week. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.65.0rc2">Synapse 1.65.0rc2</a> was released, and it contains some fun features and bugfixes. Check it out!</p>

<p>Dendrite is a second-generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.2">Dendrite 0.9.2</a> which contains the following updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite now supports history visibility on the <code>/sync</code>, <code>/messages</code> and <code>/context</code> endpoints
<ul>
<li>It should now be possible to view the history of a room in more cases (as opposed to limiting scrollback to the join event or defaulting to the restrictive <code>&quot;join&quot;</code> visibility rule as before)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The default room version for newly created rooms is now room version 9</li>
<li>New admin endpoint <code>/_dendrite/admin/resetPassword/{userID}</code> has been added, which replaces the <code>-reset-password</code> flag in <code>create-account</code></li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> binary now uses shared secret registration over HTTP to create new accounts, which fixes a number of problems with account data and push rules not being configured correctly for new accounts</li>
<li>The internal HTTP APIs for polylith deployments have been refactored for correctness and consistency</li>
<li>The federation API will now automatically clean up some EDUs that have failed to send within a certain period of time</li>
<li>The <code>/hierarchy</code> endpoint will now return potentially joinable rooms (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/texuf">texuf</a>)</li>
<li>The user directory will now show or hide users correctly</li>
<li>Send-to-device messages should no longer be incorrectly duplicated in <code>/sync</code></li>
<li>The federation sender will no longer create unnecessary destination queues as a result of a logic error</li>
<li>A bug where database migrations may not execute properly when upgrading from older versions has been fixed</li>
<li>A crash when failing to update user account data has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition when generating notification counts has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition when setting up NATS has been fixed (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/brianathere">brianathere</a>)</li>
<li>Stale cache data for membership lazy-loading is now correctly invalidated when doing a complete sync</li>
<li>Data races within user-interactive authentication have been fixed (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/tak-hntlabs">tak-hntlabs</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This brings our current test compliance figures to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 90%</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 95%</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, please feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for Dendrite-related discussion.</p>

<p>Announcing <code>matrix-appservice-discord</code> 3.0.0!</p>
<p>What? Another week, another major release?
Yes, we want to make breaking changes obvious, and the bridge now requires Node.js 16+.</p>
<p>The release fixes the outdated <code>yarn.lock</code> file. Thanks to the package maintainers of NixOS to point this out! üëã
Furthermore, mentioning Matrix users in Discord got fixed.</p>
<p>And, for the fans of containers, we've re-added the release of Docker images. üê≥
The URL changed and we don't plan to update <code>halfshot/matrix-appservice-discord</code> on Docker Hub.
The image can be pulled from <code>ghcr.io/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-discord:v3.0.0</code>.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now shows you a pretty preview for rooms you are trying to join. This uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3266">MSC3266</a>, which you might need to enable in your synapse config, if you want to see more than the roomid of the room you are trying to join. It tries to fall back to the /hierarchy endpoint, but that won't work over federation.</p>
<p>Similarly you can now somewhat edit what rooms are in a space. I grew up with Windows 98, so this is a very nested right click menu. We are still discussing some of the wording choices for the options there, so if you have any opinions about it, feel free to give feedback about it! This is part of the bigger goal to be able to manage your communities from within Nheko, so stay tuned for more features coming in that area.</p>
<p>red_sky (nheko.im) also improved our notifications code on macOS. You can now disable the notification sound in the system settings, which for some reason requires badge permissions to show that option... macOS will always remain a mystery to us! Similarly we fixed the source text for notifications on Windows, which should now not show a stray %1 anymore as well as a few other cleanups.

<li>Ever started a DM with someone, only to get distracted and leave them staring into an empty timeline wondering who you are and what you want. Well, it is no more! In this update new DMs will only notify the person you‚Äôre messaging once you‚Äôve sent your first message.</li>
<li>That‚Äôs not the only exciting update in EleWeb/Desktop this week, including the newly extended voice messages! Instead of voice messages capped at 2 minutes, users are now able to send a voice note of up to 15 minutes long. Go forth and record üé§</li>
<li>In upcoming releases we‚Äôre also looking at how to improve a user‚Äôs first few days in Element. We know that it can be daunting to stare at an empty screen and wonder how to get going, which is why we‚Äôve designed and built a checklist for new users. This checklist will help them to get off the ground and messaging friends in no time.</li>
</ul>
<p>In labs (you can enable labs features in settings on develop.element.io or on Nightly):</p>

<li>Threads improvements are still very much underway. We have a proof of concept (PoC) for improving notifications that we‚Äôre testing to ensure scalability and performance.</li>

<li>Our release this week was rejected by Apple. Their feedback? Our info.plist comments do not provide enough context as to why we‚Äôre asking for access to things like the camera, photos, or contacts. Never fear! We‚Äôve updated our copy and we‚Äôre confident that it‚Äôs clearer than ever.</li>
<li>Also in the upcoming release:
<ul>
<li>Fixing the crashes that some users were running into when switching space.</li>
<li>The new in-app notifications now also appear in the notification centre</li>
<li>And a bug fix for the rare issue of sending duplicate images to a timeline when sending multiple photos</li>

<li>In the upcoming Android release we‚Äôve fixed some crashes; including where the app would crash if a user attempted putting non-ASCII characters in their MXID during account creation.</li>
<li>Biometric login is now disabled if the device you‚Äôre on does not support biometrics.</li>
<li>We‚Äôve also been working hard on adding unit tests to increase coverage.</li>
<li>There‚Äôs work being done on the modularisation of languages that may help decrease the complexity of translation and move us towards a set of common strings between platforms.</li>
<li>Join us over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#element-community-testing:matrix.org">#element-community-testing:matrix.org</a> on Tuesday 16th August at 15:00 BST to try out the new app layout on Android!

<h4 id="v2-1-custom-emojis-and-stickers-birthday-edition">v2.1: Custom emojis and stickers (Birthday edition)</h4>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>On July 28 project marked its one-year milestone. During this time it has grown at an unexpected rate, both in terms of development as well as popularity. This is great news, so let's celebrate that with this birthday edition.</p>
<p>In this update, we have added <strong>Custom emoji and sticker support</strong> to Cinny. Custom emoji and stickers were not in our roadmap but that's the surprise. Aren't they cool?
Apart from the emoji and stickers, there are tons of other features such as Blurhash, Mark entire space as read, user pills, and bug fixes. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny/releases/tag/v2.1.0">release</a> <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny/releases/tag/v2.1.1">page</a> for a <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny/releases/tag/v2.1.2">detailed changelog</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of the roadmap, we are still on that, work on the &quot;Rich input editor&quot; is in progress and will come as the next release. Stay tuned for that!</p>
<p>The update is live on <a href="https://app.cinny.in/">https://app.cinny.in</a> and the desktop app can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny-desktop/releases/tag/v2.1.2">Github</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Tip</strong>: Join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#cinny-space:matrix.org">#cinny-space:matrix.org</a>  to check out some cool sticker packs. There are some great packs in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#stickers-and-emojis:pixie.town">#stickers-and-emojis:pixie.town</a> too.</p>

<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.0">Dendrite 0.9.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.1">Dendrite 0.9.1</a>. There are quite a few big changes, including an all-new caching model and several optimisations. This release also moves our baseline supported Go version up to Go 1.18.</p>
<p>The following changes are included across both releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite now uses Ristretto for managing in-memory caches
<ul>
<li>Should improve cache utilisation considerably over time by more intelligently selecting and managing cache entries compared to the previous LRU-based cache</li>
<li>Defaults to a 1GB cache size if not configured otherwise</li>
<li>The estimated cache size in memory and maximum age can now be configured with new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/e94ef84aaba30e12baf7f524c4e7a36d2fdeb189/dendrite-sample.monolith.yaml#L44-L61">configuration options</a> to prevent unbounded cache growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for serving the <code>/.well-known/matrix/client</code> hint directly from Dendrite
<ul>
<li>Configurable with the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/e94ef84aaba30e12baf7f524c4e7a36d2fdeb189/dendrite-sample.monolith.yaml#L67-L69">configuration option</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refactored membership updater, which should eliminate some bugs caused by the membership table getting out of sync with the room state</li>
<li>The User API is now responsible for sending account data updates to other components, which may fix some races and duplicate account data events</li>
<li>Optimised database query for checking whether a remote server is allowed to request an event over federation without using anywhere near as much CPU time (PostgreSQL only)</li>
<li>Database migrations have been refactored to eliminate some problems that were present with <code>goose</code> and upgrading from older Dendrite versions</li>
<li>Media fetching will now use the <code>/v3</code> endpoints for downloading media from remote homeservers</li>
<li>HTTP 404 and HTTP 405 errors from the client-facing APIs should now be returned with CORS headers so that web-based clients do not produce incorrect access control warnings for unknown endpoints</li>
<li>Some preparation work for full history visibility support</li>
<li>Upgrades a dependency which caused issues building Dendrite with Go 1.19</li>
<li>The roomserver will no longer give up prematurely after failing to call <code>/state_ids</code></li>
<li>Removes the faulty room info cache, which caused of a number of race conditions and occasional bugs (including when creating and joining rooms)</li>
<li>The media endpoint now sets the <code>Cache-Control</code> header correctly to prevent web-based clients from hitting media endpoints excessively</li>
<li>The sync API will now advance the PDU stream position correctly in all cases (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/sergekh2">sergekh2</a>)</li>
<li>The sync API will now delete the correct range of send-to-device messages when advancing the stream position</li>
<li>The device list <code>changed</code> key in the <code>/sync</code> response should now return the correct users</li>
<li>A data race when looking up missing state has been fixed</li>
<li>The <code>/send_join</code> API is now applying stronger validation to the received membership event</li>
<li>Fixes a crash that could occur during event redaction</li>
<li>The <code>/members</code> endpoint will no longer incorrectly return HTTP 500 as a result of some invite events</li>
<li>Send-to-device messages should now be ordered more reliably and the last position in the stream updated correctly</li>
<li>Parsing of appservice configuration files is now less strict (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/Kab1r">Kab1r</a>)</li>
<li>The sync API should now identify shared users correctly when waking up for E2EE key changes</li>
<li>The federation <code>/state</code> endpoint will now return a HTTP 403 when the state before an event isn't known instead of a HTTP 500</li>
<li>Presence timestamps should now be calculated with the correct precision</li>
<li>A race condition in the roomserver's room info has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition in the sync API has been fixed</li>
</ul>

<p>A Social Annotation Tool Powered by Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gleachkr:matrix.org">gleachkr</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a short vacation, I've done some new work on populus-viewer. Most of this has been UX and bugfixes, but I've added one new feature that I wanted to share. <a href="https://github.com/opentower/matrix-doc/blob/audio-markup/proposals/3775-markup-locations-for-audiovisual-media.md">MSC3775: Markup Locations for Audiovisual Media</a> gives a spec for annotating audio and video on matrix, but it also allows you to annotate images. So, for completeness sake, I've added support for annotating image files in Populus! This might be useful for discussing publication layouts, product designs, or for teaching art history. So populus can now annotate: video, audio, images and pdfs.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@robin:robin.town">Robin</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api/">matrix-widget-api</a> v1.0.0 was released yesterday, reflecting the fact that we're not expecting any big changes to the library's architecture for the foreseeable future, and that it's more or less ready for wider use.</p>
<p>It also comes with a couple of new features ‚ú® for widget authors: Sending and receiving to-device messages with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3819">MSC3819</a>, and getting TURN servers from the client with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3846/">MSC3846</a>. Together, these features enable some new complex use-cases, such as doing VoIP from inside a widget. See Matrix Live for a preview of what that looks like with Element Call! üìπÔ∏è</p>
<p>This is as good a time as any to mention that matrix-widget-api doesn't have to just be for web-based apps. If you're building mobile apps with Matrix and want to make use of widgets, running matrix-widget-api inside a web view to liaison with the actual widget can make it a lot simpler to start supporting widget API features. If you're curious, watch Element iOS+Android for upcoming examples of this.</p>

<li>This week we've been building on the initial work on the pion call server (SFU) from Sean, and have made our very first call through it with Element Call! It's still very early and there's still lots of work to do, but this will allow Element Call to scale up to much higher numbers of people.</li>
<li>The VoIP team are also looking after widgets now, and in our quest to embed Element Call into the Element apps, we've hit the milestone of releasing matrix-widget-api 1.0.0. We're also making great progress towards embedding into Element Web.

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week saw a few major improvements on the dev-ex of the Rust SDK (among others): <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/892">support for refresh tokens</a> landed; we have a setup for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/855">integration tests against an actual synapse instance now</a> (and started writing tests); our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/897">docs for <code>main</code> now contain the js bindings, too</a>; <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/889">event handlers can now be unregistered</a> and we've added an API for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/899">room specific event handlers</a>. Further more, we've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/903">refactored the examples</a> (now to be found in <code>/examples</code> rather than some sub-sub-directory no one finds) and created two more: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/dfec17e6afbf6c1ea35e9ee968c7668eb4a46a04/examples/getting_started/src/main.rs"><code>getting-started</code></a> combines the autojoin and command-example with a lot more additional inline comment to explain what is going on and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/dfec17e6afbf6c1ea35e9ee968c7668eb4a46a04/examples/custom_events/src/main.rs"><code>custom-events</code></a> showcases how to use the sdk and ruma types to send any custom events (in that case a ping-ack example) over matrix!</p>
<p>This was also a week of fighting the ci. After the integration tests landed, coverage reporting broke and an investigation was kicked off to check whether llvm-cov is in a usable state for us by now (it is not), but a fix was found. We've also started regretting adding <code>npm</code>-based workflows in our repo, as we've found ourselves at the end of an upgrade bug and the saw CI failing without us changing anything :shakes_fist_at_sky: . A fix was found quickly by pinning a sub-dependency. On a similar note, we've postponed merging the kotlin bindings until the android team is back on it and available to answer some questions we have, and the wasm-js bindings showed build failures on CI, which the original author will have to take a look at after coming back from vacation - thus delaying <code>crypto-js</code> a bit further.</p>

<li>I've also improved the documentation, done some refactoring, and added some helper/utility modules to make things clearer.  My goal is to make it easier for people who don't know Elixir to be able to read and write tests without running away screaming.</li>
<li>compatibility with some Matrix clients has been improved</li>
<li>added some functions to make it easy for tests to completely override Matrix endpoints</li>

<p>This week I'm showing off an early look at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive">Matrix public archive</a>. As the name suggests, it acts as an archive of history for your world-readable Matrix rooms. This allows you to view historical content day-by-day and jump back years ago to see what your Matrix room was up to.</p>
<p>More importantly, it also allows Google to do the same thing so you‚Äôll probably start finding Matrix content from your favorite search engine and be able to harness the massive knowledge base stored in Matrix. Imagine seeing Matrix logs instead of Stack Overflow answers when googling questions! The new portal into the Matrix ecosystem üåå</p>
<p>You can also see this demoed in <a href="https://youtu.be/6KHQSeJTXm0?t=583">this week's Matrix Live video</a> (at the top of the page).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/zFISGvYfCIhdqunsrPZMhOF.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Under the hood, we use the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3030">MSC3030 <code>/timestamp_to_event</code></a> endpoint to fetch the messages for a given day and then we sever-side render the events with the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen SDK</a>. Re-using Hydrogen gets us pretty and native(to Element) looking UI and keeps the maintenance burden of supporting new event types in Hydrogen.</p>

<p>I was able to to host a matrix-synapse server on termux app on an android device. I documented the process on <a href="https://github.com/medanisjbara/synapse-termux/">termux-synapse</a> github repo And started working on a script that automates the process (final commit is being currently tested before pushing).
It was a &quot;for fun&quot; type of thing. But I can see it being useful for people who do not have access to a raspberry pi (such as myself at the moment) to use as a small homeserver. It can hold up in 1 to 1 Direct Messages and in small rooms.
