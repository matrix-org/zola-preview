                <p>One of the goals on the core team is to reduce friction for new users joining Matrix. A challenge we regularly face is all the factors which make Matrix flexible and powerful as an open, secure decentralised protocol also increase the difficulty of getting started.</p>
<p>As one example— to create a healthy, vibrant ecosystem and put power back into the hands of end users, it’s critical multiple clients exist, and that users ultimately have control over which one to use. However, needing to choose a client before getting going is counter-intuitive, and adds cognitive load which proprietary services simply don’t have.</p>
<p>Striking this balance is tricky, and one we’re aiming to improve with the latest version of <a href="https://www.matrix.to">Matrix.to</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-matrix-to">What's Matrix.to?</h2>
<p>Matrix.to is a simple URL redirection service which lets users share links to rooms, users and communities. It isn’t tied to any client, and for end users it serves as a landing page for many as their first touch to Matrix. And until the matrix:// URI scheme is deployed commonplace (we finally <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/matrix">registered it with IANA</a> a few months ago!) it is the only client-agnostic way to link to content in Matrix.</p>
<p>It’s privacy preserving, with no information stored server side, with all calculation done in client-side JavaScript. It started life years ago as a temporary minimum viable hack by Matthew which then hung around untouched for years being… minimally viable. But we’ve recently given it a huge upgrade in usability and functionality at last!</p>
<h2 id="what-s-new">What's new?</h2>
<p><img src="https://matrix.org/blog/img/2020-12-17-matrix_to.png" alt="The matrix.to room, on the new matrix.to!" /></p>
<p>We’ve re-written matrix.to from scratch, giving it a visual upgrade and refocused the experience around:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Helping new users find the best client for them to easily get going.</strong> By default, links will prioritise showing clients which are compatible with the platform the link is being viewed from, including mobile platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optionally, remembering your preferred client for future visits.</strong> This also includes deeplinking into native apps for Element Desktop &amp; Element Mobile (and in future, other clients too, of course).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fetching useful previews.</strong> One of our main observations when testing with new users is a lack of confidence trying out a new service without personalised, contextual information on the rooms or people they’re heading to. Matrix.to now displays room metadata like avatars, names and topics directly (fetched via matrix.org by default, asking for permission).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>We’ve baked in the ability to specify clients and deployments within links, allowing sharing to give the option of a specific destination to guarantee a predictable experience. For instance, Mozilla might share matrix.to links which recommend using chat.mozilla.org, if you don’t already have a preferred Matrix client configured. We’ve yet to implement this feature in Element, but we’ll be researching and experimenting with different implementations soon and will recommend best practises when we have them.</p>
<p>We plan to evolve matrix.to over time, including eventually evolving it to better support the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2312">Matrix URI scheme</a>. As before, you can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to">on GitHub</a> and please go ahead and submit pull requests to get your Matrix client listed.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think over in the matrix.to room, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix.to:matrix.org">linked to via matrix.to</a>!</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400">It's been a long-standing goal to enable end-to-end encryption by default for private communication in Matrix. The technical effort so far has included </span>
<a href="/docs/guides/e2e_implementation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">our libolm library</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span>
<a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/matrix-olm-cryptographic-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400">an independent cryptographic review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span>
<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/6779"><span style="font-weight: 400">a massive backlog of feature development and bug fixes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Today, instead I'd like to focus on some of the User Experience challenges and goals we're facing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should also introduce myself—I'm Nad Chishtie (</span>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nadonomy:matrix.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">@nadonomy:matrix.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">) and I recently joined the Matrix core team (at New Vector) as Lead Designer, most recently focusing on end-to-end encryption.</span></p>
<p>When using encrypted messages, most existing services fall short in one or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">They don't allow you to use multiple devices independently. For example, a web session might be locally tethered to a mobile device.</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">They don't support a way to restore or temporarily access message history. For example, if you don't have physical access to your main device because it's broken or has been stolen.</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">They don't allow you to verify that devices are controlled by their owners rather than eavesdroppers, and persist that trust across multiple devices, sessions or rooms.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Modern users, even those we talk to at security and privacy-led organisations, expect these features to 'just work' by default out of the box. Before enabling end-to-end encryption by default, we've been hard at work figuring out how we can deliver these features without compromising security or usability.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(For some users, restrictions such as limiting the number of places encryption keys reside, and not having a synchronised message history may be desirable </span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400">security features.</span>
</i><span style="font-weight: 400"> We'll support these cases, but just not as the default behaviour.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let's dive in to some of the fundamental concepts we'll be putting forward to deliver a default end-to-end encryption experience that makes sense for most modern users. In this post we'll look at an overview of</span>
<b> work-in-progress wireframes</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, in the spirit of designing in the open and gathering feedback from the wider Matrix community. Please note that these don't represent the actual interface design.</span></p>
<h2 id="cross-signing-personal-devices">Cross-signing personal devices</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Cross-signing.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3708 size-large" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Cross-signing-1024x576.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When logging in to a new device, you'll be able to use an existing device to verify your new one. Verification is done by </span>
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1543"><span style="font-weight: 400">scanning a QR code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on whichever device has the most convenient camera to use, or by </span>
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1267"><span style="font-weight: 400">comparing a short text string</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. You only have to complete this process once to mutually verify both devices.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1680"><span style="font-weight: 400">Verifying your new device by cross-signing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> transfers encryption keys, giving it access to your encrypted messages, and also signals to other users that the new device is trustworthy.</span></p>
<h2 id="secure-message-recovery">Secure Message Recovery</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Secure-Message-Recovery.gif.gif"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3725" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Secure-Message-Recovery.gif.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To the end user, Secure Message Recovery works a lot like setting up disk encryption or a password manager. A user can optionally secure their message history using a recovery passphrase and/or key. If logged out, or using another device, the user can use the recovery passphrase or key to access their encrypted message history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In practise, this </span>
<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/5675"><span style="font-weight: 400">incrementally encrypts and backs up encryption keys to a user's homeserver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, kept secure by the homeserver never having access to the passphrase or key. Like cross-signing, using a recovery passphrase or key will also signal to other users that a device is trustworthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We think that in most cases users will cross-sign personal devices, but as a safety net (for example, if a user's devices are broken or lost) Secure Message Recovery is an invaluable tool for users to minimise the chance of them losing their encrypted message history.
</span></p>
<h2 id="people-should-trust-people">People should trust people</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Verification.gif"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3726" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Verification.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With both cross-signing and Secure Message Recovery in place, we think that people should trust people, instead of individual devices. Now, when you verify a device, it'll mark all of that users trusted devices as trusted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gone are the days of every person you talk to having to independently verify your new device upgrade. Like cross-signing, you can verify a device by scanning a QR code or comparing a short text string.</span></p>
<h2 id="sensible-and-extensible">Sensible and extensible</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Settings.gif"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3727" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Settings.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Riot, we're implementing these features with a sensible default experience that strikes a balance between usability and security. We think most people would prefer to trust cross-signed devices, and that user trust shouldn't block encryption. However, if you aren't most people, you'll be free to configure whatever level of security you need.
</span></p>
<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With all of the above in place, and after resolving any remaining technical issues, users will be able to:</span></p>
<ul>
 	<li>Use end-to-end encryption by default in private rooms.</li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Use an existing device or Secure Message Recovery to access their encrypted message history on multiple devices, and to signal device trust to other users.</span>
</li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Access their encrypted message history using Secure Message Recovery, by storing encrypted message keys on their homeserver.</span>
</li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Mark a user as trusted by verifying one of their devices, persisting across all rooms and devices.</span>
</li>
 	<li>Keep their encrypted messages out of the hands of eavesdroppers.</li>
 	<li>Opt out, or further configure if they have more specific security requirements.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400">There's more nuance to making all this work than we can cover in this overview post; things like recovery key management and immutable security notifications are all important pieces of the puzzle. For further reading, we're filling up more detail in </span>
