                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Today is one of those pivotal days for the Matrix ecosystem: we're incredibly excited to announce that the world's first ever dedicated homeserver hosting service is now fully available over at <a href="https://modular.im">https://modular.im</a>!  This really is a massive step for Matrix towards being a mature ecosystem, and we look forward to Modular being the first of many hosting providers in the years to come :D</p>
<p>Modular lets anyone spin up a dedicated homeserver and Riot via a super-simple web interface, rather than having to run and admin their own server.  It's built by New Vector (the startup who makes Riot and hires many of the Matrix core team), and comes from taking the various custom homeserver deployments for people like Status and TADHack and turning them into a paid service available to everyone.  You can even point your own DNS at it to get a fully branded dedicated homeserver for your own domain!</p>
<p><a href="https://modular.im"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3662 size-full" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/181022-Modular-featured.png" alt="" width="800" height="241" /></a></p>
<p>Anyway, for full details, check out the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/introducing-modular-awesome-hosting-for-riot-matrix-665a7a0c616">announcement over at the Riot blog</a>.  We're particularly excited that Modular helps increase Matrix's decentralisation, and is really forcing us to ensure that the Federation API is getting the attention it deserves.  Hopefully it'll also reduce some load from the Matrix.org homeserver! Modular will also help Matrix by directly funding Matrix development by the folks working at New Vector, which should in turn of course benefit the whole ecosystem.</p>
<p>Many people reading this likely already run their own servers, and obviously they aren't the target audience for Modular.  But for organisations who don't have a sysadmin or don't want to spend the time to run their own server, hopefully Modular gives a very cost-effective way of running your own dedicated reliable Matrix server without having to pay for a sysadmin :)</p>
<p>We're looking forward to see more of these kind of services popping up in the future from everywhere in the ecosystem, and have started a <a href="/hosting/">Matrix Hosting page</a> on the Matrix website so that everyone can advertise their own: don't hesitate to get in touch if you have a service to be featured!</p>
<p>If you're interested, please swing by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#modular:matrix.org">#modular:matrix.org</a> or feel free to shoot questions to <a href="mailto:support@modular.im">support@modular.im</a>.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Ben's away today, so this TWIM is brought to you mainly in association with Cadair's TWIMbot!</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-xmpp" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/benparsons/matrix-notes/blob/master/twim/twim-2018-09-07.md#xmpp" aria-hidden="true"></a>Spec Activity</h2>
Since <a href="/blog/2018/09/03/matrix-spec-update-august-2018/">last week's sprint to get the new spec releases</a> out, focus on the core team has shifted exclusively to the remaining stuff needed to cut the first stable release for the Server-Server API.  In practice this means fleshing out the MSCs in flight and implementing them - work has progressed on both improving auth rules, switching event IDs to be hashes and others.  Whilst implementing this in Synapse we're also doing a complete audit and overhaul of the current federation code, hence the <a href="/blog/2018/09/06/critical-security-update-synapse-0-33-3-1/">0.33.3.1</a> security release this week.
<p>Meanwhile, in the community, ma1uta reports:</p>
<blockquote><span class="mx_MTextBody mx_EventTile_content"><span class="mx_EventTile_body markdown-body" dir="auto">I am working on the <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon">jeon</a> (java matrix api) to update it to the latest stable release. Also I changed versions of api to form <code>rX.Y.Z-N</code> where <code>rX.Y.Z</code> is a API version and <code>N</code> is a library version within API. So, I have prepared Push API (r0.1.0-1), Identity API (r0.1.0-1) and Appservice API (r0.1.0-1) for the first release and current updating the C2S API to the r0.4.0 version.</span>

<h2>XMPP Bridging</h2>
Are you in the market for a Matrix-XMPP bridge? When I say "market", I mean it because this week we have <em>two </em>announcements for bridging to XMPP! You can choose whether you'd prefer your bridge to be implemented as a puppet, or a bot.
<p>Ma1uta has a new version of <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-jabber-java-bridge">his Matrix-Xmpp bridge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>It is a double-puppet bridge which can connects the Matrix and XMPP ecosystems. Just invite the <code>@_xmpp_master:ru-matrix.org</code> and tell him: <code>@_xmpp_master: connect test@conference.jabber.org</code> to connect current room with the specified conference.<br />You can ask about this bridge in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-jabber-java-bridge:ru-matrix.org">#matrix-jabber-java-bridge:ru-matrix.org</a> room.<br />Currently supports only conferences and only <code>m.text</code> messages. 1:1 conversations and other message types will be later.</blockquote><br />maze appeared this week and announced <a href="https://github.com/djmaze/mxbridge">MxBridge</a>, a new Matrix-XMPP bridge:<br /><blockquote>It works as a bot, so it is non-puppeting. Rooms can be mapped dynamically by the bot administrator(s). There is no support for 1-1 chats (yet). MxBridge is written as a multi-process application in Elixir and it should scale quite well (but don't tie me down on it ;)). <a href="https://github.com/djmaze/mxbridge">https://github.com/djmaze/mxbridge</a></blockquote>
<h2>Seaglass</h2>

<h2>Matrique</h2>
Blackhat announces that <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/matrique">Matrique's</a> new design is almost done, along with GNU/Linux, MacOS and Windows nightly build!

<h2>Fractal</h2>
Alexandre Franke says:
<blockquote>Fractal 3.30 got release alongside the rest of GNOME. It includes a bunch of new and updated translations, and redacted messages are now hidden.</blockquote>
Meanwhile, hidden in this screenshot, uhoreg noted that E2E plans are progressing...

<h2>Riot</h2>
Bruno has been hacking away on Riot/Web squashing the remaining Lazy Loading Members defects and various related optimisations and fixes. We also released Riot/Web 0.16.3 as a fairly minor point release (which unfortunately has a regression with DM avatars, which is fixed in 0.16.4, for which a first RC was cut a few hours ago and should be released on Monday).  Meanwhile the first cut of Lazy Loading also got implemented on Android as well. Both are hidden behind labs flags, but we're almost at a point where we can turn it on now!  Otherwise, the Riot team has got sucked into working on commercial Matrix stuff, for better or worse (all shall be revealed shortly though!)

Jason has been working heavily on Construct, and has new test users.  Construct is able to federate with Synapse and the rest of the Matrix ecosystem.  mujx has created a docker for Construct which streamlines its deployment.
<blockquote>Construct development is still occurring here <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis</a> but we are now significantly closer to pushing the first release to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct">https://github.com/matrix-construct</a>. Also feel free to stop by in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net" rel="nofollow">#test:zemos.net</a> / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#zemos-test:matrix.org" rel="nofollow">#zemos-test:matrix.org</a> as well -- a room hosted by Construct, of course.<br /><br />tulir has now deployed using the standalone install instructions on a very small LXC VM using ZFS. Unfortunately ZFS does not support O_DIRECT (direct disk IO) which is how Construct achieves maximum performance using concurrent reads. This is not a problem though when using an SSD or for personal deployments. I'll be posting more about how Construct hacked RocksDB to use direct IO, which can get the most out of your hardware with multiple requests in-flight (even with an SSD).</blockquote>
<h2>Synapse</h2>
Work was split this week into spec/security work, with the critical update for <a href="/blog/2018/09/06/critical-security-update-synapse-0-33-3-1/">0.33.3.1</a> - if you haven't upgraded, please do so immediately.
<p>Otherwise, Hawkowl has been on a mission to finish the Python 3 port, which is now almost merged.  Testers should probably wait until it fully merges to the develop branch and we'll yell about it then, but impatient adrenaline enthusiasts may want to check out the hawkowl/py3-3 branch (although it may explode in your face, mangle your DB and format your cat, and probably misses lots of recent important PRs like the 0.33.3.1 stuff).  However, i've been running a variant on some servers for the last few days without problems - and it seems (placebo effect notwithstanding) incredibly snappy...</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Lazy Loaded Member implementation got sped up by 2-3x, which makes /sync roughly 2-3x faster than it would be without Lazy Loading.  This hasn't merged yet, but was the main final blocker behind Lazy Loading going live!</p>
<h2>matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</h2>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>During the ongoing work to finalise a stable release of Matrix's Server-Server federation API, we've been doing a full audit of Synapse's implementation and have identified a serious vulnerability which we are going to release a security update to address (Synapse 0.33.3.1) on 
<b>Thursday Sept 6th 2018 at 12:00 UTC</b>.</p>
<p>We are coordinating with package maintainers to ensure that patched versions of packages will be available at that time - meanwhile, if you run your own Synapse, <strong>please be prepared to upgrade as soon as the patched versions are released</strong>.  All previous versions of Synapse are affected, so everyone will want to upgrade.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, patience and understanding while we resolve the issue,</p>

                <h2>Introducing Client Server API 0.4, and the first ever stable IS, AS and Push APIs spec releases!
</h2>
Hi folks,
<p>As many know, we've been on a massive sprint to improve the spec - both fixing omissions where features have been implemented in the reference servers but were never formalised in the spec, and fixing bugs where the spec has thinkos which stop us from being able to ratify it as stable and thus fit for purpose .</p>
<p>In practice, our target has been to cut stable releases of all the primary Matrix APIs by the end of August - effectively declaring Matrix out of beta, at least at the specification level.  For context: historically only one API has ever been released as stable - the Client Server API, which was the result of a similar sprint back in Jan 2016. This means that the Server Server (SS) API, Identity Service (IS) API, Application Service (AS) API and Push Gateway API have never had an official stable release - which has obviously been problematic for those implementing them.</p>
<p>However, as of the end of Friday Aug 31, we're proud to announce the first ever stable releases of the <a href="/docs/spec">IS, AS and Push APIs</a>!</p>
<p><a href="/docs/spec"><img src="/_matrix/media/v1/download/t2l.io/587a1a86905b1e0e8f9342d76e57ffbe" /></a>
To the best of our knowledge, these API specs are now complete and accurately describe all the current behaviour implemented in the reference implementations (sydent, synapse and sygnal) and are fit for purpose. Any deviation from the spec in the reference implementations should probably be considered a bug in the impl. All changes take the form of filling in spec omissions and adding clarifications to the existing behaviour in order to get things to the point that an independent party can implement these APIs without having to refer to anything other than the spec.</p>
<p>This is the result of a lot of work which spans the whole Spec Core Team, but has been particularly driven by TravisR, who has taken the lead on this whole mission to improve the spec.  Huge thanks are due to Travis for his work here, and also massive thanks to everyone who has 
<del>suffered
</del> <del>endured
</del> reviewed his PRs and contributed to the releases.  The spec is looking unrecognisably better for it - and Matrix 1.0 is feeling closer than ever!</p>
<p>Alongside the work on the IS/AS/Push APIs, there has also been a massive attempt to plug all the spec omissions in the Client Server API.  Historically the CS API releases have missed some of the newer APIs (and of course always miss the ones which postdate a given release), but we've released the APIs which /have/ been specified as stable in order to declare them stable.  However, in this release we've tried to go through and fill in as many remaining gaps as possible.</p>
<p>The result is the release of <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html">Client Server API version 0.4</a>. This is a huge update - increasing the size of the CS API by ~40%. The biggest new stuff includes fully formalising support for end-to-end encryption (thanks to Zil0!), versioning for rooms (so we can upgrade rooms to new versions of the protocol), synchronised read markers, user directories, server ACLs, MSISDN 3rd party ids, and .well-known server discovery (not that it's widely used yet), but for the full picture, best bet is to look at <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#changelog">the changelog</a> (now managed by <a href="https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/">towncrier</a>!).  It's probably fair to say that the CS API is growing alarmingly large at this point - Chrome says that it'd be 223 A4 pages if printed. Our solution to this will be to refactor it somehow (and perhaps switch to a more compact representation of the contents).</p>
<p>Some things got deliberately missed from the CS 0.4 release: particularly membership Lazy Loading (because we're still testing it out and haven't released it properly in the wild yet), the various GDPR-specific APIs (because they may evolve a bit as we refine them since the original launch), finalising ID grammars in the overall spec (because this is surprisingly hard and subtle and we don't want to rush it) and finally Communities (aka Groups), as they are still somewhat in flux.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the Server to Server API, there has also been a massive amount of work.  Since the beginning of July it's 
<b>tripled</b> in size as we've filled in the gaps, over the course of &gt;200 commits (&gt;150 of which from Travis).  If you take a look at the <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/unstable.html">current snapshot</a> it's pretty unrecognisable from the historical draft; with the main changes being:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adding the new State Resolution algorithm to address flaws in the original one.  This has been where much of our time has gone - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1441">MSC1442</a> for full details.  Adopting the new algorithm requires rooms to be recreated; we'll write more about this in the near future when we actually roll it out.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adding room versioning so we can upgrade to the new State Resolution algorithm.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Everything is now properly expressed as Swagger (OpenAPI), just like the CS API
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adding all the details for E2E encryption (including dependencies like to-device messaging and device-list synchronisation)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Improvements in specifying how to authorize inbound events over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document federation APIs such as /event_auth and /query_auth and /get_missing_events
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document 3rd party invites over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document the /user/* federation endpoints
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document Server ACLs
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document read receipts over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document presence over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document typing notifications over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document content repository over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document room directory over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">...and many many other minor bug fixes, omission fixes, and restructuring for coherency - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1464">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1464</a> for an even longer list :)
</li>
</ul>
However, we haven't finished it all: despite our best efforts we're running slightly past the original target of Aug 31.  The current state of play for the r0 release overall (in terms of pending issues) is:
<a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-16.56.18.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3525" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-16.56.18.png" alt="" width="576" height="214" /></a>...and you can see the full breakdown over at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/1">public Github project dashboard</a>.
<p>The main stuff we still have remaining on the Server/Server API at this point is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Better specifying how we validate inbound events. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1646">MSC1646</a> for details &amp; progress.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Switching event IDs to be hashes. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1640">MSC1640</a> for details and progress.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Various other remaining security considerations (e.g. how to handle malicious auth events in the DAG; how to better handle DoS situations).
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Merging in the changes to authoring m.room.power_levels (as per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1304">MSC1304</a>)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Formally specifying the remaining identifiers which lack a formal grammar - <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1598">MSC1597</a> and particularly room aliases (
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1607">MSC1608</a>)
</li>
</ul>
The plan here is to continue speccing and implementing these at top priority (with Travis continuing to work fulltime on spec work), and we'll obviously keep you up-to-date on progress.  Some of the changes here (e.g. event IDs) are quite major and we definitely want to implement them before speccing them, so we're just going to have to keep going as fast as we can. Needless to say we want to cut an r0 of the S2S API alongside the others asap and declare Matrix out of beta (at least at the spec level :)
<p>In terms of visualising progress on this spec mission it's interesting to look at the rate at which we've been closing PRs: this graph shows the total number of PRs which are in state ‘open' or ‘closed' on any given day:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-00.56.38.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3526" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-00.56.38-1024x722.png" alt="" width="1024" height="722" /></a></p>
<p>...which clearly shows the original sprint to get the r0 of the CS API out the door at the end 2015, and then a more leisurely pace until the beginning of July 2018 since which the pace has picked up massively.  Other ways of looking at include the number of open issues...</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3527" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-1-1024x691.png" alt="" width="1024" height="691" /></a>
...or indeed the number of commits per week…</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.02.27.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3528" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.02.27-1024x195.png" alt="" width="710" height="135" /></a>
...or the overall Github Project activity for August.  (It's impressive to see Zil0 sneaking in there on second place on the commit count, thanks to all his GSoC work documenting E2E encryption in the spec as part of implementing it in matrix-python-sdk!)</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.03.57.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3529" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.03.57-1024x925.png" alt="" width="744" height="672" /></a>
Anyway, enough numerology.  It's worth noting that all of the dev for r0 has generally followed the proposed <a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">Open Governance Model for Matrix</a>, with the core spec team made up of both historical core team folk (erik, richvdh, dave &amp; matthew), new core team folk (uhoreg &amp; travis) and community folk (kitsune, anoa &amp; mujx) working together to review and approve the changes - and we've been doing MSCs (albeit with an accelerated pace) for anything which we feel requires input from the wider community.  Once the Server/Server r0 release is out the door we'll be finalising the open governance model and switching to a slightly more measured (but productive!) model of spec development as outlined there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Matrix 1.0 gets ever closer.  With (almost) all this spec mission done, our plan is to focus more on improving the reference implementations - particularly performance in Synapse, 
UX in matrix-{'{'}react,ios,android{'}'}-sdk as used by Riot (especially for E2E encryption), and then declare a 1.0 and get back to implementing new features (particularly Editable Messages and Reactions) at last.</p>
<p>We'd like to thank everyone for your patience whilst we've been playing catch up on the spec, and hope you agree it's been worth the effort :)</p>
<p>Matthew &amp; the core spec team.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We've just released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.0">Synapse 0.33.0</a>!  This is a <strong>major performance upgrade</strong> which speeds up /sync (i.e. receiving messages) by a factor of almost 2x!  This has already made a massive difference to the CPU usage and snappiness of the matrix.org homeserver since we rolled it out a few days ago - you can see the drop in sync worker CPU just before midday on July 17th; previously we were regularly hitting the CPU ceiling (at which point everything grinds to a halt) - now we're back down hovering between 40% and 60% CPU (at the current load).  This is actually fixing a bug which crept in around Synapse 0.31, so please upgrade - especially if Synapse has been feeling slower than usual recently, and especially if you are still on Synapse 0.31.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-19-at-13.00.01-1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3406" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-19-at-13.00.01-1-1024x639.png" alt="" width="813" height="507" /></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile we have a <strong>lot</strong> of new stuff coming on the horizon - a whole new algorithm for state resolution (watch this space for details); incremental state resolution (at last!) to massively speed up state resolution and mitigate extremities build up (and speed up the synapse master process, which is now the bottleneck again on the matrix.org homeserver); better admin tools for managing resource usage, and all the Python3 porting work (with associated speedups and RAM &amp; GC improvements).  Fun times ahead!</p>
<p>The full changelog follows below; as always you can grab Synapse from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.   Thanks for flying Matrix!</p>

New to me, <a href="https://github.com/ChristianPauly/fluffychat">fluffychat</a> is a "Simple Matrix Messenger for <a href="https://ubports.com">Ubuntu Touch</a>". The design philosophy for this app is focused on simplicity, and the hope is for it to complement <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a>, another Ubuntu Touch client.
<blockquote>Why are you not just contributing to uMatriks?
uMatriks is great and it's superb, that someone has created a Matrix Client for Ubuntu Touch. But sometimes you have a so detailed vision of a user interface, which you want to implement, that you can not just contribute to an existing project. However, I would like to work with the uMatriks developers together. We could use the same push gateway for example.</blockquote>

It is currently under heavy development, and API breaking changes are frequent.

<h3>Terraform Provider</h3>
TravisR writes:
<blockquote>I've been working on a Terraform provider for matrix. It is still a work in progress, however I plan to have the basics completed in the coming days. The provider gives you the opportunity to create users, rooms, and other objects on your homeserver, making your homeserver part of your infrastructure. This could be useful for people who want to set up a monitoring room, or for setting up default rooms on a homeserver instance. In particular, this provider will be used by the monitor bot (see last week's post) to set up the test homeservers for seeing how the bot scales with increased server counts.

 	<li>show threads;</li>
 	<li>show notification, public and federated lines (and optionally merge them with the home timeline);</li>
 	<li>show account info by id.</li>
</ul>
Also I think to implement a bridge Matrix-ActivityPub as S2S. For example, a room - is a ActivityPub's actor. Room participants is a bot corresponds to actors you follow to. Room timeline is a Inbox+Outbox. Reactions is a likes/favorites. Pinning message is a boost. Replies will be very useful.</blockquote>

<h3>And finally...</h3>
On the core team it's been an irregular week; as mentioned in last TWIM we spent most of it in workshops working through spec issues as part of the mission to finally get to an 'r0' stable release of the spec across all APIs - not just the Client/Server API.  The majority of this was spent making up for lost time on the S2S API, analysing its various holes and designing solutions to them.  Things are looking promising - we're keeping the work under wraps though given the potential for abuse, although we should see more gaps being fixed in the coming days.  Meanwhile we're aiming to get the r0 stable release out by the end of August.  We also unblocked a few longstanding MSCs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/433">.well-known</a> URIs and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1232">media limits</a>), although in the end the S2S stuff took priority.  On the client side we did a lot of design sessions on Riot/Mobile (working out how the new app design should work on Mobile - watch this space for details!) and also how to speed up app launch (the concept of Hybrid Sync; somewhere between an initial sync and an incremental sync - basically an initial sync which can be interrupted in order to let the user use the app whilst the initial sync is still ongoing) - we'll write up the notes and publish these asap.
<p>We also announced the <a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">Open Governance</a> work which we've been doing in order to extend control of the Matrix spec to properly include the wider Matrix community - the plan is to get the Matrix.org Foundation legal entity set up roughly around the same time as the r0 release of the spec in August, and formally decouple control of the Matrix spec from New Vector (the company we set up last year to hire the core team).</p>
<p>We'd also like to welcome mujx (developer of nheko) and kitsune (developer of Quaternion and libQMatrixClient) to the new core team as we start trialling the new governance structure (which mainly amounts at this point to getting review approvals on spec proposals and changes from the relevant domain experts on the new team).  This brings us to a full complement for the team: Erik (servers), richvdh (servers, crypto &amp; clients), Dave (clients &amp; push/identity) and uhoreg (crypto, general) from the current core team; and Anoa (servers, AS API), TravisR (integrations, AS API; acting with Dimension hat on), mujx &amp; kitsune from the community.</p>
<p>Otherwise, spec work has taken priority over writing software, with the exception of: APwhitehat doing as much federation work in Dendrite as part of GSoC as the current unstable state of the API allows; Michael (t3chguy) has been blitzing through P1 Riot/Web issues.  Next week should be back on the normal (if not better!) trajectory however.  No Matrix Live this week however, as we're all exhausted.</p>

            <div>
                
                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Since we created Matrix.org back in 2014, the majority of the Matrix core team has worked for the same company - originally subsidiaries of Amdocs, and then since August 2017 for New Vector; the startup we incorporated to rehire the core team and support Matrix after we parted ways from Amdocs.</p>
<p>Despite working for a for-profit company, our prime directive has <b>always</b> been the long term mission to successfully run Matrix as a non-profit initiative for the benefit of the whole internet: to create a ubiquitous secure open network which gives users control back over their communication and avoids them ever being locked into silos again.  And even though Matrix.org hasn't been a formal non-profit foundation, we've treated it as such in all respects (e.g. gathering donations to support development on Matrix)</p>
<p>Running Matrix.org as a non-profit means prioritising to neutrally support all players in the whole ecosystem without ever giving unfair advantage to any individual participant (particularly New Vector) - where that ecosystem includes end-users, client devs, testers, spec devs, server admins, companies building products on Matrix, bridge devs, bot devs, widget devs, server devs, distro maintainers, moderators, even end-users who are using Matrix indirectly via bridges.</p>
<p>That being said, having the core team work for the same startup is still a somewhat unorthodox model for an open source project building an open standard, so we'd like to explain the main reasons for doing it up to this point:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure that Matrix is fit for real-world usage and to force us to dogfood it. To ensure that it is a protocol that works well enough that you can build a commercial startup around it if you so wanted, and to motivate us to build Matrix as something more than an academic or nerdy exercise in protocol design - rather one which can be commercially viable.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To help ensure the core team is aligned and pulling towards the same goal, especially during the process of actually designing and “giving birth” to the initial protocol and getting it to an ‘r0' release across all APIs.  We strongly believe that when a project is in the design phase you get faster and better design from a bunch of people who are collaborating together towards the same goal, rather than independent factions who might pursue their own agendas at the expense of the overall project.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Because we believe the value of Matrix lies in the size of the ecosystem, and if Matrix realises its full potential (i.e. it grows as big as the web), it only makes it more useful and valuable for *everyone*. We realise that it might be a leap of faith to believe that we don't have any incentive to sabotage Matrix by privileging specific players (after all, there are so many companies out there in it just for the cash), but the fact is that this is where we stand, and we're doing our best to prove it. To spell it out: it is in New Vector's interest (and also in the interests of other Matrix-focused companies) to grow Matrix to be as big, open, unfragmented and as neutral as possible.  Matrix should be big enough for a multitude of wildly successful companies and projects to benefit from it, and everyone wins - just like the web.</li>
</ul>
<b>However</b>, this approach is not perfect and comes with some major problems:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Without clear separation of responsibilities and incentives, we have to ask the community to take it on faith that our efforts are never intended to privilege New Vector ahead of the wider ecosystem. This leaves room for doubt, especially when our reasoning is unclear or our conclusions controversial.<br />A good example of a controversial decision is the lack of investment by the core team in the Server-Server API.  For the last ~2 years (since Mar 2016) we made the judgement call to prioritise user-facing features and experience.  The rationale was that to grow Matrix we need to provide a viable alternative to Slack/Discord/WhatsApp etc, and doing that means providing a Client-Server API which lets clients do just that, and server implementations capable of running at scale. This is why the CS API has had a stable release since Dec 2015 (currently at r0.3.0) and why we've put so much effort into server scaling/perf... but the SS API itself still has bugs and has still not yet made it to a stable release.<br />This is obviously incredibly frustrating to server devs who tried to implement the SS API despite it being unstable and unreleased. In retrospect it might have been a mistake and we could probably have turned off signup on matrix.org and diverted the resources to the SS API work instead.  However, this is a case of making the judgement call to prioritising the overall ecosystem over one class of stakeholders (server devs) by focusing on providing users usable and featureful decentralised communication apps. Indeed we strongly believe that users are the main means to grow the ecosystem (others have failed without them): no one joins a network with no friends, however popular it is among devs.  Nonetheless, we are finally in a position to <a href="/blog/2018/06/15/this-week-in-matrix-2018-06-15/">hire spec maintainers and get to a stable S2S</a> as fast as we possibly can, and frankly feel relieved to be able to unblock this situation.<br />Another good example is the recent <a href="/blog/2018/06/14/security-update-synapse-0-31-2/">0.31.2 security update</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Synapse: this was a defensive patch to the protocol that we added to ensure that even if bugs occur when authing events over federation, it should be impossible for a random user to ever hijack a room again.  We specced this out as a formal proposal and are gathering feedback, but expedited implementation in Synapse to protect the overall ecosystem. However, it turns out that the change breaks a small number of highly custom rooms, and so we find ourselves accused of privileging NV.  The reality is that we made a judgement call to protect the vast majority of today's ecosystem (and hope to provide a longer-term fix in the relatively near future which /will/ be compatible with more custom room use cases).
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another problem is some companies find it a turn-off to participate in Matrix unless they have a well-defined process for influencing the direction of the protocol.  Now, sometimes this could be seen as a feature rather than a bug; the last thing the ecosystem needs is a greedy corp trying to subvert the protocol to its own competitive advantage, and we don't want to be locked in that kind of battle either.  However, there are also lots of well-meaning and constructive companies who want to participate too, and there's an argument that they want a well-defined process for doing so.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The other main problem is simply one of checks &amp; balances.  Even though NV may be a good guardian today, what if something changed in future? e.g. if NV got bought by Microsoft, or if someone on the team had some crisis and changed priorities?  Whilst one could always fork, such things are incredibly disruptive and fragmenting and it'd be good to engineer Matrix.org's governance to be resilient to such eventualities as much as is possible.
</li>
</ul>
To address these problems, in March of this year we started work on a long term proposal to establish an open governance model for Matrix which ensures the neutrality of the protocol, lets the community contribute as widely as possible, and incorporates a dedicated neutral non-profit Matrix.org Foundation separate to New Vector.
<p>As work progressed on the proposal, it became clear that actually transitioning to a new governance model would seriously slow down the sprint towards a stable r0 release. We therefore decided to put completing the governance model on hold until after the r0 release (scheduled for the end of August).</p>
<p>With the end of r0 now in sight, completing work on the governance model is back on the agenda. We obviously want to ensure that the proposed governance model is going to work for everyone, so we'd like to introduce the first draft of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vASIt2v0UwKnUKHNEjA_P3SFCM0kcIUl1LQyM--ax04/edit#">Matrix Spec Change 1318: a proposal for open governance of the Matrix.org Spec</a>. This is quite an early draft; the idea is to gather feedback over the next few months and we'll then incorporate the Foundation and deploy the new governance model to coincide with the long-awaited stable release of all APIs of the Matrix Spec (assuming the release doesn't slip).</p>
<p>The main points in the proposal are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To adopt the new governance model once all APIs have had a stable r0 release.  For S2S API, this means fixing the remaining flaws in the federation protocol and closing the spec omissions such that compliant independent implementations can be written purely based on the spec.  For the AS and IS and Push API it means just closing spec omissions (if any) and doing a final review.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To define the mission of Matrix: to return control of communication to users by building a standards-based open secure decentralised communication network.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To define the mandate of the core team to act as a neutral custodian of the Matrix Spec, prioritising the long-term success and growth of the overall network over individual commercial concerns.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To define the guiding principles of the core team, e.g. collaboration rather than competition and contrarianism.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To restructure the core team to incorporate members of the community as well as the founding core team.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To propose succession logistics for the core team
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To propose the role and governance structure of the Matrix.org Foundation legal entity.
</li>
</ul>
Feedback would be much appreciated on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vASIt2v0UwKnUKHNEjA_P3SFCM0kcIUl1LQyM--ax04/edit#">MSC1318 Google Doc</a> - or come talk about it on 
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org</a> (which we might as well use for governance too).
<p>It's exciting times as we finally move towards an initial stable release of Matrix across all APIs - we are firmly on the road to a 1.0, and improving our governance model is a massive part of that process.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the core team.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>On Monday (2018-06-11) we had an incident where #matrix:matrix.org was hijacked by a malicious user pretending to join the room immediately after its creation in 2014 and then setting an m.room.power_levels event ‘before' the correct initial power_level for the room.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances this should be impossible because the initial m.room.power_levels for a room should be set before its m.room.join_rules event, meaning users who join the room are subject to its power levels. However, back before we'd even released Synapse, the first two rooms ever created in Matrix (#test:matrix.org and #matrix:matrix.org) were manually created and set the join_rules before the power_levels event, letting users join before the room's power_levels were defined, and so were vulnerable to this attack. We've since re-created #matrix:matrix.org - please re-/join the room if you haven't already!</p>
<p>As a defensive measure, we are releasing a security update of Synapse (0.31.2) today which changes the rules used to authenticate power_level events, such that we fail-safe rather than fail-deadly if the existing auth mechanisms fail. In practice this means changing the default power level required to set state to be 50 rather than 0 if there is no power_levels event present, thus meaning that only the room creator can set the initial power_levels event.</p>
<p>We are not aware of anyone abusing this (other than the old #matrix:matrix.org room) but we'd rather be safe than sorry, so would recommend that everyone upgrade as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This of course constitutes a change to the spec, so full technical details and ongoing discussion around the Matrix Spec Change proposal can be followed over at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1304">MSC1304</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: if you are aware of your server participating in rooms whose first power_levels event is deliberately set by a different user to their creator, please let us know asap (and don't upgrade!)</p>
<p>This work is all part of a general push to finalise and harden and fully specify the Server-Server API as we push towards a long-awaited stable release of Matrix!</p>
<p>As always, you can get the new update from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.31.2">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.31.2</a> or from any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.</p>
<p>thanks, and apologies for the inconvenience.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We've been able to start investing more time in advancing the Matrix Specification itself over the last month or so thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">Ben</a> joining the core team (and should be able to accelerate even more with <a href="https://www.uhoreg.ca/blog/20180507-1019">uhoreg joining in a few weeks</a>!)  The first step in the new wave of work has been to provide much better infrastructure for the process of actually evolving the spec - whether that's from changes proposed by the core team or the wider Matrix Community.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, we'd like to introduce <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a> - a dashboard for all the spec change proposals we've accumulated so far (ignoring most of the ones which have already been merged), as well as a clearer workflow for how everyone can help improve the Matrix spec itself.  Part of this is introducing a formal numbering system - e.g. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1228">MSC1228</a> stands for Matrix Spec Change 1228 (where 1228 is the ID of the Github issue on the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues">github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues</a> repository that tracks the proposal).</p>
<p>Please note that these are <em>NOT</em> like XEPs or RFCs - i.e. optional proposals or add-ons to the protocol; instead they are literally proposals for changes to the Matrix Spec itself.  Once merged into the spec, they are only of historical interest.</p>
<p>We've also created a new room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> to discuss specific spec proposal changes - please join if you want to track how proposals are evolving! (Conversation is likely to fork off into per-proposal rooms or overflow into <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev:matrix.org</a> or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-architecture:matrix.org">#matrix-architecture:matrix.org</a> depending on traffic levels, however).</p>
<p>Feedback would be much appreciated on this - so please head over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> and let us know how it feels and how it could do better.</p>
<p>This is also a major step towards properly formalising Matrix.org's governance model - hopefully the changes above are sufficient to improve the health of the evolution of the Spec as we work towards an initial stable release later this year, and then you should expect to see a spec proposal for formal governance once we've (at last!) exited beta :)</p>
<p>Huge thanks to Ben for putting this together, and thanks to everyone who's contributed so far to the spec - we're looking forward to working through the backlog of proposals and turning them all into merged spec PRs!!</p>
<p>Matthew</p>
