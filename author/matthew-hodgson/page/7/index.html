Aside from bugfixes and using the latest libQMatrixClient, it features an entirely new timeline layout similar to that of Riot (the old one is still around too).

<blockquote>I am currently writing a high-level API on top of gomatrix. As gomatrix is suitable for bots but not for clients, I decided to write a layer above it.

It will have similar API as libqmatrixclient, but in Golang.
It is currently under heavy development, and API breaking changes are frequent.
Sources are available in Gitlab: <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/gomatrixclient">https://gitlab.com/b0/gomatrixclient</a>P.s. It is a library for writing clients in Golang. But it also provides useful APIs for basic functions, e.g. getting avatars.</blockquote>

<h3 id="terraform-provider">Terraform Provider</h3>
<p>TravisR writes:</p>
<blockquote>I've been working on a Terraform provider for matrix. It is still a work in progress, however I plan to have the basics completed in the coming days. The provider gives you the opportunity to create users, rooms, and other objects on your homeserver, making your homeserver part of your infrastructure. This could be useful for people who want to set up a monitoring room, or for setting up default rooms on a homeserver instance. In particular, this provider will be used by the monitor bot (see last week's post) to set up the test homeservers for seeing how the bot scales with increased server counts.

<a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/mxtoot">mxtoot 0.4.3</a> (Matrix-Mastodon bridge) can send public, private, unlisted and direct messages.

 	<li>show threads;</li>
 	<li>show notification, public and federated lines (and optionally merge them with the home timeline);</li>
 	<li>show account info by id.</li>
</ul>
Also I think to implement a bridge Matrix-ActivityPub as S2S. For example, a room - is a ActivityPub's actor. Room participants is a bot corresponds to actors you follow to. Room timeline is a Inbox+Outbox. Reactions is a likes/favorites. Pinning message is a boost. Replies will be very useful.</blockquote>

<h3 id="and-finally">And finally...</h3>
<p>On the core team it's been an irregular week; as mentioned in last TWIM we spent most of it in workshops working through spec issues as part of the mission to finally get to an 'r0' stable release of the spec across all APIs - not just the Client/Server API.  The majority of this was spent making up for lost time on the S2S API, analysing its various holes and designing solutions to them.  Things are looking promising - we're keeping the work under wraps though given the potential for abuse, although we should see more gaps being fixed in the coming days.  Meanwhile we're aiming to get the r0 stable release out by the end of August.  We also unblocked a few longstanding MSCs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/433">.well-known</a> URIs and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1232">media limits</a>), although in the end the S2S stuff took priority.  On the client side we did a lot of design sessions on Riot/Mobile (working out how the new app design should work on Mobile - watch this space for details!) and also how to speed up app launch (the concept of Hybrid Sync; somewhere between an initial sync and an incremental sync - basically an initial sync which can be interrupted in order to let the user use the app whilst the initial sync is still ongoing) - we'll write up the notes and publish these asap.</p>
<p>We also announced the <a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">Open Governance</a> work which we've been doing in order to extend control of the Matrix spec to properly include the wider Matrix community - the plan is to get the Matrix.org Foundation legal entity set up roughly around the same time as the r0 release of the spec in August, and formally decouple control of the Matrix spec from New Vector (the company we set up last year to hire the core team).</p>
<p>We'd also like to welcome mujx (developer of nheko) and kitsune (developer of Quaternion and libQMatrixClient) to the new core team as we start trialling the new governance structure (which mainly amounts at this point to getting review approvals on spec proposals and changes from the relevant domain experts on the new team).  This brings us to a full complement for the team: Erik (servers), richvdh (servers, crypto &amp; clients), Dave (clients &amp; push/identity) and uhoreg (crypto, general) from the current core team; and Anoa (servers, AS API), TravisR (integrations, AS API; acting with Dimension hat on), mujx &amp; kitsune from the community.</p>
<p>Otherwise, spec work has taken priority over writing software, with the exception of: APwhitehat doing as much federation work in Dendrite as part of GSoC as the current unstable state of the API allows; Michael (t3chguy) has been blitzing through P1 Riot/Web issues.  Next week should be back on the normal (if not better!) trajectory however.  No Matrix Live this week however, as we're all exhausted.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Since we created Matrix.org back in 2014, the majority of the Matrix core team has worked for the same company - originally subsidiaries of Amdocs, and then since August 2017 for New Vector; the startup we incorporated to rehire the core team and support Matrix after we parted ways from Amdocs.</p>
<p>Despite working for a for-profit company, our prime directive has <b>always</b> been the long term mission to successfully run Matrix as a non-profit initiative for the benefit of the whole internet: to create a ubiquitous secure open network which gives users control back over their communication and avoids them ever being locked into silos again.  And even though Matrix.org hasn't been a formal non-profit foundation, we've treated it as such in all respects (e.g. gathering donations to support development on Matrix)</p>
<p>Running Matrix.org as a non-profit means prioritising to neutrally support all players in the whole ecosystem without ever giving unfair advantage to any individual participant (particularly New Vector) - where that ecosystem includes end-users, client devs, testers, spec devs, server admins, companies building products on Matrix, bridge devs, bot devs, widget devs, server devs, distro maintainers, moderators, even end-users who are using Matrix indirectly via bridges.</p>
<p>That being said, having the core team work for the same startup is still a somewhat unorthodox model for an open source project building an open standard, so we'd like to explain the main reasons for doing it up to this point:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure that Matrix is fit for real-world usage and to force us to dogfood it. To ensure that it is a protocol that works well enough that you can build a commercial startup around it if you so wanted, and to motivate us to build Matrix as something more than an academic or nerdy exercise in protocol design - rather one which can be commercially viable.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To help ensure the core team is aligned and pulling towards the same goal, especially during the process of actually designing and “giving birth” to the initial protocol and getting it to an ‘r0' release across all APIs.  We strongly believe that when a project is in the design phase you get faster and better design from a bunch of people who are collaborating together towards the same goal, rather than independent factions who might pursue their own agendas at the expense of the overall project.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Because we believe the value of Matrix lies in the size of the ecosystem, and if Matrix realises its full potential (i.e. it grows as big as the web), it only makes it more useful and valuable for *everyone*. We realise that it might be a leap of faith to believe that we don't have any incentive to sabotage Matrix by privileging specific players (after all, there are so many companies out there in it just for the cash), but the fact is that this is where we stand, and we're doing our best to prove it. To spell it out: it is in New Vector's interest (and also in the interests of other Matrix-focused companies) to grow Matrix to be as big, open, unfragmented and as neutral as possible.  Matrix should be big enough for a multitude of wildly successful companies and projects to benefit from it, and everyone wins - just like the web.</li>
</ul>
<b>However</b>, this approach is not perfect and comes with some major problems:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Without clear separation of responsibilities and incentives, we have to ask the community to take it on faith that our efforts are never intended to privilege New Vector ahead of the wider ecosystem. This leaves room for doubt, especially when our reasoning is unclear or our conclusions controversial.<br />A good example of a controversial decision is the lack of investment by the core team in the Server-Server API.  For the last ~2 years (since Mar 2016) we made the judgement call to prioritise user-facing features and experience.  The rationale was that to grow Matrix we need to provide a viable alternative to Slack/Discord/WhatsApp etc, and doing that means providing a Client-Server API which lets clients do just that, and server implementations capable of running at scale. This is why the CS API has had a stable release since Dec 2015 (currently at r0.3.0) and why we've put so much effort into server scaling/perf... but the SS API itself still has bugs and has still not yet made it to a stable release.<br />This is obviously incredibly frustrating to server devs who tried to implement the SS API despite it being unstable and unreleased. In retrospect it might have been a mistake and we could probably have turned off signup on matrix.org and diverted the resources to the SS API work instead.  However, this is a case of making the judgement call to prioritising the overall ecosystem over one class of stakeholders (server devs) by focusing on providing users usable and featureful decentralised communication apps. Indeed we strongly believe that users are the main means to grow the ecosystem (others have failed without them): no one joins a network with no friends, however popular it is among devs.  Nonetheless, we are finally in a position to <a href="/blog/2018/06/15/this-week-in-matrix-2018-06-15/">hire spec maintainers and get to a stable S2S</a> as fast as we possibly can, and frankly feel relieved to be able to unblock this situation.<br />Another good example is the recent <a href="/blog/2018/06/14/security-update-synapse-0-31-2/">0.31.2 security update</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Synapse: this was a defensive patch to the protocol that we added to ensure that even if bugs occur when authing events over federation, it should be impossible for a random user to ever hijack a room again.  We specced this out as a formal proposal and are gathering feedback, but expedited implementation in Synapse to protect the overall ecosystem. However, it turns out that the change breaks a small number of highly custom rooms, and so we find ourselves accused of privileging NV.  The reality is that we made a judgement call to protect the vast majority of today's ecosystem (and hope to provide a longer-term fix in the relatively near future which /will/ be compatible with more custom room use cases).
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another problem is some companies find it a turn-off to participate in Matrix unless they have a well-defined process for influencing the direction of the protocol.  Now, sometimes this could be seen as a feature rather than a bug; the last thing the ecosystem needs is a greedy corp trying to subvert the protocol to its own competitive advantage, and we don't want to be locked in that kind of battle either.  However, there are also lots of well-meaning and constructive companies who want to participate too, and there's an argument that they want a well-defined process for doing so.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The other main problem is simply one of checks &amp; balances.  Even though NV may be a good guardian today, what if something changed in future? e.g. if NV got bought by Microsoft, or if someone on the team had some crisis and changed priorities?  Whilst one could always fork, such things are incredibly disruptive and fragmenting and it'd be good to engineer Matrix.org's governance to be resilient to such eventualities as much as is possible.
</li>
</ul>
To address these problems, in March of this year we started work on a long term proposal to establish an open governance model for Matrix which ensures the neutrality of the protocol, lets the community contribute as widely as possible, and incorporates a dedicated neutral non-profit Matrix.org Foundation separate to New Vector.
<p>As work progressed on the proposal, it became clear that actually transitioning to a new governance model would seriously slow down the sprint towards a stable r0 release. We therefore decided to put completing the governance model on hold until after the r0 release (scheduled for the end of August).</p>
<p>With the end of r0 now in sight, completing work on the governance model is back on the agenda. We obviously want to ensure that the proposed governance model is going to work for everyone, so we'd like to introduce the first draft of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vASIt2v0UwKnUKHNEjA_P3SFCM0kcIUl1LQyM--ax04/edit#">Matrix Spec Change 1318: a proposal for open governance of the Matrix.org Spec</a>. This is quite an early draft; the idea is to gather feedback over the next few months and we'll then incorporate the Foundation and deploy the new governance model to coincide with the long-awaited stable release of all APIs of the Matrix Spec (assuming the release doesn't slip).</p>
<p>The main points in the proposal are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To adopt the new governance model once all APIs have had a stable r0 release.  For S2S API, this means fixing the remaining flaws in the federation protocol and closing the spec omissions such that compliant independent implementations can be written purely based on the spec.  For the AS and IS and Push API it means just closing spec omissions (if any) and doing a final review.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To define the mission of Matrix: to return control of communication to users by building a standards-based open secure decentralised communication network.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To define the mandate of the core team to act as a neutral custodian of the Matrix Spec, prioritising the long-term success and growth of the overall network over individual commercial concerns.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To define the guiding principles of the core team, e.g. collaboration rather than competition and contrarianism.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To restructure the core team to incorporate members of the community as well as the founding core team.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To propose succession logistics for the core team
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To propose the role and governance structure of the Matrix.org Foundation legal entity.
</li>
</ul>
Feedback would be much appreciated on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vASIt2v0UwKnUKHNEjA_P3SFCM0kcIUl1LQyM--ax04/edit#">MSC1318 Google Doc</a> - or come talk about it on 
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org</a> (which we might as well use for governance too).
<p>It's exciting times as we finally move towards an initial stable release of Matrix across all APIs - we are firmly on the road to a 1.0, and improving our governance model is a massive part of that process.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the core team.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>On Monday (2018-06-11) we had an incident where #matrix:matrix.org was hijacked by a malicious user pretending to join the room immediately after its creation in 2014 and then setting an m.room.power_levels event ‘before' the correct initial power_level for the room.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances this should be impossible because the initial m.room.power_levels for a room should be set before its m.room.join_rules event, meaning users who join the room are subject to its power levels. However, back before we'd even released Synapse, the first two rooms ever created in Matrix (#test:matrix.org and #matrix:matrix.org) were manually created and set the join_rules before the power_levels event, letting users join before the room's power_levels were defined, and so were vulnerable to this attack. We've since re-created #matrix:matrix.org - please re-/join the room if you haven't already!</p>
<p>As a defensive measure, we are releasing a security update of Synapse (0.31.2) today which changes the rules used to authenticate power_level events, such that we fail-safe rather than fail-deadly if the existing auth mechanisms fail. In practice this means changing the default power level required to set state to be 50 rather than 0 if there is no power_levels event present, thus meaning that only the room creator can set the initial power_levels event.</p>
<p>We are not aware of anyone abusing this (other than the old #matrix:matrix.org room) but we'd rather be safe than sorry, so would recommend that everyone upgrade as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This of course constitutes a change to the spec, so full technical details and ongoing discussion around the Matrix Spec Change proposal can be followed over at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1304">MSC1304</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: if you are aware of your server participating in rooms whose first power_levels event is deliberately set by a different user to their creator, please let us know asap (and don't upgrade!)</p>
<p>This work is all part of a general push to finalise and harden and fully specify the Server-Server API as we push towards a long-awaited stable release of Matrix!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We've been able to start investing more time in advancing the Matrix Specification itself over the last month or so thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">Ben</a> joining the core team (and should be able to accelerate even more with <a href="https://www.uhoreg.ca/blog/20180507-1019">uhoreg joining in a few weeks</a>!)  The first step in the new wave of work has been to provide much better infrastructure for the process of actually evolving the spec - whether that's from changes proposed by the core team or the wider Matrix Community.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, we'd like to introduce <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a> - a dashboard for all the spec change proposals we've accumulated so far (ignoring most of the ones which have already been merged), as well as a clearer workflow for how everyone can help improve the Matrix spec itself.  Part of this is introducing a formal numbering system - e.g. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1228">MSC1228</a> stands for Matrix Spec Change 1228 (where 1228 is the ID of the Github issue on the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues">github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues</a> repository that tracks the proposal).</p>
<p>Please note that these are <em>NOT</em> like XEPs or RFCs - i.e. optional proposals or add-ons to the protocol; instead they are literally proposals for changes to the Matrix Spec itself.  Once merged into the spec, they are only of historical interest.</p>
<p>We've also created a new room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> to discuss specific spec proposal changes - please join if you want to track how proposals are evolving! (Conversation is likely to fork off into per-proposal rooms or overflow into <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev:matrix.org</a> or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-architecture:matrix.org">#matrix-architecture:matrix.org</a> depending on traffic levels, however).</p>
<p>Feedback would be much appreciated on this - so please head over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> and let us know how it feels and how it could do better.</p>
<p>This is also a major step towards properly formalising Matrix.org's governance model - hopefully the changes above are sufficient to improve the health of the evolution of the Spec as we work towards an initial stable release later this year, and then you should expect to see a spec proposal for formal governance once we've (at last!) exited beta :)</p>
<p>Huge thanks to Ben for putting this together, and thanks to everyone who's contributed so far to the spec - we're looking forward to working through the backlog of proposals and turning them all into merged spec PRs!!</p>
<p>Matthew</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>As the May 25th deadline looms, we've had lots and lots of questions about how GDPR (the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation legislation) applies to Matrix and to folks running Matrix servers - and so we've written this blog post to try to spell out what we're doing as part of maintaining the Matrix.org server (and bridges and hosted integrations etc), in case it helps folks running their own servers.</p>
<p>The main controversial point is how to handle Article 17 of the GDPR: ‘
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/">Right to Erasure</a>' (aka Right to be Forgotten).  The question is particularly interesting for Matrix, because as a relatively new protocol with somewhat distinctive semantics it's not always clear how the rules apply - and there's no case law to seek inspiration from.</p>
<p>The key question boils down to whether Matrix should be considered more like email (where people would be horrified if senders could erase their messages from your mail spool), or should it be considered more like Facebook (where people would be horrified if their posts were visible <em>anywhere</em> after they avail themselves of their right to erasure).</p>
<p>Solving this requires making a judgement call, which we've approached from two directions: firstly, considering what the spirit of the GDPR is actually trying to achieve (in terms of empowering users to control their data and have the right to be forgotten if they regret saying something in a public setting) - and secondly, considering the concrete legal obligations which exist.  </p>
<p>The conclusion we've ended up with is to (obviously) prioritise that Matrix can support all the core concrete legal obligations that GDPR imposes on it - whilst also having a detailed plan for the full ‘spirit of the GDPR' where the legal obligations are ambiguous.  The idea is to get as much of the longer term plan into place as soon as possible, but ensure that the core stuff is in place for May 25th.</p>
<p>Please note that we are still talking to GDPR lawyers, and we'd also very much appreciate feedback from the wider Matrix community - i.e. this plan is very much subject to change.  We're sharing it now to ensure everyone sees where our understanding stands today.</p>
<p>The current todo list breaks down into the following categories. Most of these issues have matching github IDs, which we'll track in a progress dashboard.</p>
<h3 id="right-to-erasure">Right to Erasure</h3>
<p>We're opting to follow the email model, where the act of sending an event (i.e. message) into a room shares a copy of that message to everyone who is <strong><em>currently</em></strong> in that room.  This means that in the privacy policy (see Consent below) users will have to consent to agreeing that a copy of their messages will be transferred to whoever they are addressing.  This is also the model followed by IM systems such as WhatsApp, Twitter DMs or (
<a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3029749/facebook-zuckerberg-can-delete-old-messenger-conversations-you-cant">almost</a>) Facebook Messenger.</p>
<p>This means that if a user invokes their right to erasure, we will need to ensure that their events will only ever be visible to users who already have a copy - and must 
<b>never</b> be served to new users or the general public.  Meanwhile, data which is no longer accessible by any user must of course be deleted entirely.</p>
<p>In the email analogy: this is like saying that you cannot erase emails that you have sent other people; you cannot try to rewrite history as witnessed by others... but you can erase your emails from a public mail archive or search engine and stop them from being visible to anyone else. </p>
<p>It is important to note that GDPR Erasure is <em>completely separate</em> from the existing Matrix functionality of “redactions” which let users remove events from the room. A “redaction” today represents a request for the human-facing details of an event (message, join/leave, avatar change etc) to be removed.  Technically, there is no way to enforce a redaction over federation, but there is a “gentlemen's agreement” that this request will be honoured.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
The alternative to the ‘email-analogue' approach would have been to facilitate users' automatically applying the existing redact function to 
<i>all
</i> of the events they have ever submitted to a public room. The problem here is that defining a ‘public room' is subtle, especially to uninformed users: for instance, if a message was sent in a private room (and so didn't get erased), what happens if that room is later made public? Conversely, if right-to-erasure removed messages from 
<i>all
</i> rooms, it will end up destroying the history integrity of 1:1 conversations, which pretty much everyone agrees is abhorrent.  Hence our conclusion to protect erased users from being visible to the general public (or anyone who comes snooping around after the fact) - but preserving their history from the perspective of the people they were talking to at the time.</p>
<p>In practice, our core to-do list for Right to Erasure is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">As a first cut,  provide Article 17 right-to-erasure at a per-account granularity.  The simplest UX for this will be an option when calling the account deactivation API to request erasure as well as deactivation.  There will be a 30 day grace period, and (ideally) a 2FA confirmation (if available) to avoid the feature being abused. 
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Homeservers must delete events that nobody has access to any more (i.e. if all the users in a room have GDPR-erased themselves).  If users have deactivated their accounts without GDPR-erasure, then the data will persist in case they reactivate in future.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Homeservers must delete media that nobody has access to any more.  This is hard, as media is referenced by mxc:// URLs which may be shared across multiple events (e.g. stickers or forwarded events, including E2E encrypted events), and moreover mxc:// URLs aren't currently authorized.  As a first cut, we track which user uploaded the mxc:// content, and if they erase themselves then the content will also be erased.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Homeservers must not serve up unredacted events over federation to users who were not in the room at the time.  This poses some interesting problems in terms of the privacy implications of sharing MXIDs of erased users over federation - see “GDPR erasure of MXIDs” below.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" id="mxid_erasure">Matrix must specify a way of informing both servers and clients (especially bots and bridges) of GDPR erasures (as distinct from redactions), so that they can apply the appropriate erasure semantics.
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gdpr-erasure-of-matrix-ids">GDPR erasure of Matrix IDs</h4>
<p>One interesting edge case that comes out of GDPR erasure is that we need a way to stop GDPR-erased events from leaking out over federation - when in practice they are cryptographically signed into the event Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of a given room.  Today, we can remove the message contents (and preserve the integrity of the room's DAG) via redaction - but this still leaves personally identifying information in the form of the Matrix IDs (MXIDs) of the sender of these events.</p>
<p>In practice, this could be quite serious: imagine that you join a public chatroom for some sensitive subject (e.g. #hiv:example.com) and then later on decide that you want to erase yourself from the room.  It would be very undesirable if any new homeserver joining that room received a copy of the DAG showing that your MXID had sent thousands of events into the room - especially if your MXID was clearly identifying (i.e. your real name).</p>
<p>Mitigating this is a hard problem, as MXIDs are baked into the DAG for a room in many places - not least to identify which servers are participating in a room.  The problem is made even worse by the fact that in Matrix, server hostnames themselves are often personally identifying (for one-person homeservers sitting on a personal domain).</p>
<p>We've spent quite a lot time reasoning through how to fix this situation, and a full technical spec proposal for removing MXIDs from events can be found at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ni4LnC_vafX4h4K4sYNpmccS7QeHEFpAcYcbLS-J21Q">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ni4LnC_vafX4h4K4sYNpmccS7QeHEFpAcYcbLS-J21Q</a>.  The high level proposal is to switch to giving each user a different ID in the form of a cryptographic public key for every room it participates in, and maintaining a mapping of today's MXIDs to these per-user-per-room keys.  In the event of a GDPR erasure, these mappings can be discarded, pseudonymising the user and avoiding correlation across different rooms. We'd also switch to using cryptographic public keys as the identifiers for Rooms, Events and Users (for cross-room APIs like presence).</p>
<p>This is obviously a significant protocol change, and we're not going to do it lightly - we're still waiting for legal confirmation on whether we need it for May 25th (it may be covered as an intrinsic technical limitation of the system).  However, the good news is that it paves the way towards many other desirable features: the ability to migrate accounts between homeservers; the ability to solve the problem of how to handle domain names being reused (or hijacked); the ability to decouple homeservers from DNS so that they can run clientside (for p2p matrix); etc.  The chances are high that this proposal will land in the relatively near future (especially if mandated by GDPR), so input is very appreciated at this point!</p>
<h3 id="consent">Consent</h3>
<p>GDPR describes <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">six lawful bases for processing</a> personal data.  For those running Matrix servers, it seems the best route to compliance is the most explicit and active one: 
<i>consent
</i>.</p>
<p><i>Consent
</i> requires that our users are
<b> fully informed</b> as to exactly how their data will be used, where it will be stored, and (in our case) the specific caveats associated with a decentralised, federated communication system. They are then asked to provide their explicit approval before using (or continuing to use) the service.</p>
<p>In order to gather consent in a way that doesn't break all of the assorted Matrix clients connecting to matrix.org today, we have identified both an immediate- and a long-term approach.</p>
<p>The (immediate-term) todo list for gathering consent is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Modify Synapse to serve up a simple ‘consent tool' static webapp to display the privacy notice/terms and conditions and gather consent to this API.
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Add a ‘consent API' to the CS API which lets a server track whether a given user has consented to the server's privacy policy or not.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Send emails and push notifications to advise users of the upcoming change (and link through to the consent tool)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Develop a bot that automatically connects to all users (new and existing), posting a link to the consent tool.  This bot can also be used in the future as a general ‘server notice channel' for letting server admins inform users of privacy policy changes; planned downtime; security notices etc.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Modify synapse to reject message send requests for all users who have not yet provided consent
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">return a useful error message which contains a link to the consent tool
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Making our anonymised user analytics for Riot.im ‘opt in' rather than ‘opt out' - this isn't a requirement of GDPR (since our analytics are <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-26/">fully anonymised</a>) but reflects our commitment to user data sovereignty
</li>
</ul>
Long-term:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Add a User Interactive Auth flow for the /register API to gather consent at register
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">As an alternative to the bot:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fix user authentication in general to distinguish between ‘need to reauthorize without destroying user data' and ‘destroy user data and login again', so we can use the re-authorize API to gather consent via /login without destroying user data on the client.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">port the /login API to use User Interactive Auth and also use it to gather consent for existing users when logging in
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deactivation">Deactivation</h3>
<p>Account deactivation (the ability to terminate your account on your homeserver) intersects with GDPR in a number of places.</p>
<p>Todo list for account deactivation:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Remove deactivated users from all rooms - this finally solves the problem where deactivated users leave zombie users around on bridged networks.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Remove deactivated users from the homeserver's user directory
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Remove all 3PID bindings associated with a deactivated user from the identity servers
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Improve the account deactivation UX to make sure users understand the full consequences of account deactivation
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="portability">Portability</h3>
<p>GDPR states that users have a right to extract their data in a 
<i>structured, commonly used and machine-readable format
</i>.</p>
<p>In the medium term we would like to develop this as a core feature of Matrix (i.e. an API for exporting your logs and other data, or for that matter account portability between Matrix servers), but in the immediate term we'll be meeting our obligations by providing a manual service.</p>
<p>The immediate todo list for data portability is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Expose a simple interface for people to request their data
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Implement the necessary tooling to provide full message logs (as a csv) upon request.  As a first cut this would be the result of manually running something like <code>select * from events where user=?</code>.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<p>GDPR mandates rules for all the personal data stored by a business, so there are some broader areas to bear in mind which aren't really Matrix specific, including:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Making a clear statement as to how data is processed if you apply for a job
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring you are seeking appropriate consent for cookies
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Making sure all the appropriate documentation, processes and training materials are in place to meet GDPR obligations.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>So, there you have it.  We'll be tracking progress in github issues and an associated dashboard over the coming weeks; for now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1941">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1941</a> (for Right to Erasure) or <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-meta/issues/149">https://github.com/vector-im/riot-meta/issues/149</a> (GDPR in general) is as good as place as any to gather feedback.  Alternatively, feel free to comment on the original text of this blog post: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JTEI6RENnOlnCwcU2hwpg3P6LmTWuNS9S-ZYDdjqgzA">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JTEI6RENnOlnCwcU2hwpg3P6LmTWuNS9S-ZYDdjqgzA</a>.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that we feel that GDPR is an excellent piece of legislation from the perspective of forcing us to think more seriously about our privacy - it has forced us to re-prioritise all sorts of long-term deficiencies in Matrix (e.g. dependence on DNS; improving User Interactive authentication; improving logout semantics etc).  There's obviously a lot of work to be done here, but hopefully it should all be worth it!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Many people will have noticed disruption in #matrix:matrix.org and #matrix-dev:matrix.org on Sunday, when a validation bug in Synapse was exploited which allowed a malicious event to be inserted into the room with 'depth' value that made the rooms temporarily unusable. Whilst a transient workaround was found at the time (thanks to /dev/ponies, kythyria and Po Shamil for the workaround and to Half-Shot for working on a proposed fix), we're doing an urgent release of Synapse 0.28.1 to provide a temporary solution which will mitigate the attack across all rooms in upgraded servers and un-break affected ones.  Meanwhile we have a full long-term fix on the horizon (hopefully) later this week.</p>
<p><strong>This vulnerability has already been exploited in the wild; please upgrade as soon as possible.</strong></p>
<p>Synapse 0.28.1 is available from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.28.1">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.28.1</a> as normal.</p>
<p>The 'depth' parameter is used primarily as a way for servers to signal the intended cosmetic order of their events within a room (particularly when the room's message graph has gaps in it due to the server being offline, or due to users backfilling old disconnected chunks of conversation). This means that affected rooms may experience message ordering problems until a full long-term fix is provided, which we're working on currently (and tentatively involves no longer trusting 'depth' information from servers).  For full details you can see the proposal documents for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3fi2S-XnpO45qrpCsowZv8P8dHcNZ4fsBsbOW7KABI/edit#">temporary fix in 0.28.1</a> and the options for the<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ofbjluy8ZKYL6nt7WLHG4GqSodJUWLUxHhI6xPEjr4/edit#"> imminent long-term fix</a>.</p>
<p>We'd like to acknowledge jzk for identifying the vulnerability, and Max Dor for providing feedback on the fixes.</p>
<p>As a general reminder, Synapse is still beta (as is the Matrix spec) and the federation API particularly is still being debugged and refined and is pre-r0.0.0. For the benefit of the whole community, please disclose vulnerabilities and exploits responsibly by emailing security@ or DMing someone from +matrix:matrix.org. Thanks.</p>
<h2 id="changes-in-synapse-v0-28-1-2018-05-01">Changes in synapse v0.28.1 (2018-05-01)</h2>
<p><strong>SECURITY UPDATE</strong></p>
<ul>
 	<li>Clamp the allowed values of event depth received over federation to be [0, 2^63 - 1]. This mitigates an attack where malicious events injected with depth = 2^63 - 1 render rooms unusable. Depth is used to determine the cosmetic ordering of events within a room, and so the ordering of events in such a room will default to using stream_ordering rather than depth (topological_ordering). This is a temporary solution to mitigate abuse in the wild, whilst a long solution is being implemented to improve how the depth parameter is used.Full details at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3fi2S-XnpO45qrpCsowZv8P8dHcNZ4fsBsbOW7KABI" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3fi2S-XnpO45qrpCsowZv8P8dHcNZ4fsBsbOW7KABI</a></li>
 	<li>Pin Twisted to &lt;18.4 until we stop using the private _OpenSSLECCurve API.</li>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>We're incredibly excited that the Government of France has confirmed it is in the process of deploying a huge private federation of Matrix homeservers spanning the whole government, and developing a fork of Riot.im for use as their official secure communications client! The goal is to replace usage of WhatsApp or Telegram for official purposes.</p>
<p>It's a unbelievably wonderful situation that we're living in a world where governments genuinely care about openness, open source and open-standard based communications - and Matrix's decentralisation and end-to-end encryption is a perfect fit for intra- and inter-governmental communication.  Congratulations to France for going decentralised and supporting FOSS! We understand the whole project is going to be released entirely open source (other than the operational bits) - development is well under way and an early proof of concept is already circulating within various government entities.</p>
<p>I'm sure there will be more details from their side as the project progresses, but meanwhile here's the official press release, and an English translation too. We expect this will drive a lot of effort into maturing Synapse/Dendrite, E2E encryption and matrix-{'{'}react,ios,android{'}'}-sdk, which is great news for the whole Matrix ecosystem! The deployment is going to be speaking pure Matrix and should be fully compatible with other Matrix clients and projects in addition to the official client.</p>
<p>So: exciting times for Matrix.  Needless to say, if you work on Open Government projects in other countries, please get in touch - we're seeing that Matrix really is a sweet spot for these sort of use cases and we'd love to help get other deployments up and running.  We're also hoping it's going to help iron out many of the UX kinks we have in Riot.im today as we merge stuff back. We'd like to thank DINSIC (the Department responsible for the project) for choosing Matrix, and can't wait to see how the project progresses!</p>

<p>English Translation:</p>
<h3 id="the-french-state-creates-its-own-secure-instant-messenger">The French State creates its own secure instant messenger</h3>
<p>By the summer of 2018, the French State will have its own instant messenger, an alternative to WhatsApp and Telegram.</p>
<p>It will guarantee <b>secure, end-to-end encrypted conversations</b> without degradation of the user experience. It will be compatible with any mobile device or desktop, state or personal. In fact until now the installation of applications like WhatsApp or Telegram was not possible on professional mobile phones, which hindered easy sharing of information and documents.</p>
<p>Led by the <b>Interministerial Department of State Digital, Information and Communication Systems</b> (DINSIC), the project is receiving contributions from the <b>National Agency for Information System Security</b> (ANSSI), the IT Directorship (DSI) of the <b>Armed Forces</b> and the <b>Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs</b>.</p>
<p>The tool developed is based on <b>open source software</b> (Riot) that implements an <b>open standard</b> (Matrix). Powered by a Franco-British startup (New Vector), and benefiting from many contributions, this communication standard has already caught the attention of other states such as the <b>Netherlands</b> and <b>Canada</b>, with whom DINSIC collaborates closely.</p>
<p>The Matrix standard and its open source software are also used by private companies such as Thales, which has driven the teams to come together to ensure the interoperability of their tools and cooperate in the development of free and open source software.</p>
<p>After 3 months of development for a very limited cost, this tool is currently being tested in the State Secretary for Digital, DINSIC and in the IT departments of different ministries. It should be rolled out during the summer in administrations and cabinets.</p>
<p><b><i>&quot;With this new French solution, the state is demonstrating its ability to work in an agile manner to meet concrete needs by using open source tools and very low development costs. Sharing information in a secure way is essential not only for companies but also for a more fluid dialogue within administrations.&quot;</i> - Mounir Mahjoubi, Secretary of State to the Prime Minister, in charge of Digital.</b></p>

<p>Heads up that we made an emergency release of Riot/Web 0.13.5 a few hours ago to fix a XSS vulnerability found and reported by walle303 - many thanks for disclosing it responsibly.</p>
<p><strong>Please upgrade to Riot/Web 0.13.5 asap. If you're using <a href="https://riot.im/app">riot.im/app</a> or <a href="https://riot.im/develop">riot.im/develop</a> this simply means hitting Refresh; otherwise please upgrade your Riot deployment as soon as possible. </strong><a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=riot-web&amp;branch=edge">Alpine</a>, <a href="https://riot.im/desktop">Debian</a> and <a href="https://github.com/taw00/riot-rpm">Fedora/RPM</a> packages are already updated - huge thanks to the maintainers for the fast turnaround.</p>
<p>The issue lies in the relatively obscure external_url feature, which lets bridges specify a URL for bridged events, letting Riot/Web users link through to the 'original' event (e.g. a twitter URL on a bridged tweet).  The option is hidden in a context menu and labelled &quot;Source URL&quot;, and is only visible on events which have the external_url field set.  Unfortunately Riot/Web didn't sanitise the URL correctly, allowing a malicious URL to be injected - and this has been the case since the feature landed in Riot 0.9.0 (Nov 2016).</p>
<p>If you're not able to upgrade to Riot/Web 0.13.5 for some reason, then please do not click on the 'Source URL' feature on the event context menu:</p>

<strong>TL;DR: We built a proof-of-concept for <a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/matrix_webvr/">FOSDEM</a> of the world's first(?) 3D video calling using Matrix and the iPhone X... and it looks like this!!</strong>
</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-04-at-16.18.09.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2990" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-04-at-16.18.09-1024x672.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="672" /></a>

<p>Last year we spent a few weeks putting together a <a href="/blog/2017/04/04/opening-up-cyberspace-with-matrix-and-webvr/">proof of concept of using Matrix as an open, interoperable communication layer for VR/AR</a> - showing how you can use it as an open signalling protocol to connect users within (and between) virtual worlds, with full-mesh E2E encrypted video conferencing in VR; WebRTC calls overlaid on 360 degree video, and other fun stuff. The reasons for building the demo were quite eclectic:</p>
<ol>
 	<li>Try to highlight that Matrix is about much more than just about instant messaging or team chat</li>
 	<li>Try to encourage the community to jump in and build out more interesting use cases</li>
 	<li>Learn where the state of the art in WebVR + WebGL is</li>
 	<li>Kick off the process of encouraging folks to think about storing world geometry and physics in Matrix</li>
 	<li>Have a fun visual demo we could show to excite potential investors in New Vector (which comically backfired when the investment community spontaneously decided that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/26/this-vr-cycle-is-dead/">VR is still too early</a>).</li>
</ol>
In the end it succeeded on some points (highlighting exotic uses of Matrix; learning all about WebVR) and failed on others (a surge in Matrix-for-VR) - although we did have a lot of fun showing it off at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0-j4Q77KXM">ETHLDN meetup</a> back in October. (Eagle eyed viewers may be amused to spot team <a href="https://status.im">Status</a> &amp; Matrix sitting together in the audience ;)
<p>However, we still believe that Matrix is the missing link for decentralised communication within VR/AR, and we were lucky enough to get a <a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/matrix_webvr/">talk about Matrix+WebRTC+WebVR</a> accepted to the Real-Time Communications Devroom at FOSDEM 2018! So, given a new chance to show the world how cool Matrix-powered comms could be in VR/AR, myself and Dave Baker went on a (very) quick detour to update the demo a little...</p>
<p>One of the issues of the original demo is that the video calling bits were just putting plain old video planes into the scene - floating television screens of 2D video content, if you will. This is better than nothing, but it's sort of missing the whole point of VR/AR: surely you want to see who you're talking to in 3D? Ideally they should have the same presence as if they were physically in your virtual space. This could also be a big step towards fixing one of the oldest problems of video calling: gaze correction. We've been obsessed about gaze correction since our early days (pre-Matrix) building mobile video calling stacks: gaze correction tries to fix the fact that the break in eye contact caused by staring at the screen (rather than the camera) has a terrible impact on the emotional connection of a video call. <em>But</em> if the person you are talking to is 3D, you can always rotate them in 3D space (or reposition yourself) to correct their line of sight - to re-align their gaze so they're actually looking (in VR) at the thing they're looking at in real life!</p>
<p>Back in early 2017 it would have been wildly ambitious to build an off-the-shelf 3D video calling app - but this changed overnight in late 2017 with the introduction of the iPhone X and its TrueDepth infrared-dot-projector based depth camera; effectively a mini-Kinect. Suddenly we have a mainstream high quality depth+video camera perfectly optimised for 3D video calling, with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/507/">excellent API support</a> from Apple. So we decided to see if we could be first in the world (as far as we know) to do 3D video calling using the iPhone X, using Matrix to signal the WebRTC media and using our WebVR demo as the viewing environment!</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Hack on WebRTC to add support for the iPhone X depth camera as a capture device. This is pretty easy, at least if you're just swapping WebRTC's AVFoundationVideoCapturer to request the depth camera instead of the video camera: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/webrtc/commit/c3044670d87c305d8f8ee72751939e281bf5223f">https://github.com/matrix-org/webrtc/commit/c3044670d87c305d8f8ee72751939e281bf5223f</a> is the starting point.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 2</strong>: Build a custom Riot/iOS with the right WebRTC SDK.  This is relatively easy thanks to Riot/iOS using CocoaPods and Google shipping a pod for WebRTC these days - it was a matter of tweaking Google's pod so it could be referred to directly as a local project by Riot/iOS (and so that it provided debug symbols in the form CocoaPods expects). Brief notes are at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/webrtc/blob/matthew/depth/matrix/build_instructions.txt">https://github.com/matrix-org/webrtc/blob/matthew/depth/matrix/build_instructions.txt</a> - many thanks to Manu for helping on this :)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Decide how to encode the depth buffer. Now, the official WebRTC working group quite correctly insists that depth data should be treated as a first class citizen which is modelled and compressed in its own right. However, it looks like nobody has added first-class depth support to official WebRTC yet - and if we want to be able to easily display 3D calls on generic browsers capable of running WebVR+WebRTC+Matrix, we have no choice but do the ugly thing and encode the depth into a video signal which can be compressed with VP8/VP8/H.264 etc.
</p>
<p>A quick search showed that some folks had already proposed a method for encoding depth data into a video signal, back in the days of the Kinect: <a href="https://reality.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/depth-streaming/depth-streaming.pdf">https://reality.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/depth-streaming/depth-streaming.pdf</a>. The paper outlines a fairly simple approach: you encode the 16-bit depth data into the three 8-bit colour channels; putting the coarse depth data into Blue, and then finer-grained depth data into Red and Green, encoding it as a periodic triangle wave:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-04-at-00.43.53.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2992" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-04-at-00.43.53-1024x484.png" alt="" width="1024" height="484" /></a></p>
<p>In practice this means that as an object gets closer towards you, it gets gradually more blue - and meanwhile it pulses through a sequence of red and green so you can refine the precise depth more easily. So we went and implemented this, building a 16-bit lookup-table to encode the half-precision floating point 16-bit depth measurements the camera yields into video: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/webrtc/compare/c3044670d87c305d8f8ee72751939e281bf5223f...0258a4ef14c11a0161f078c970c64574629761c2.">https://github.com/matrix-org/webrtc/compare/c3044670d87c305d8f8ee72751939e281bf5223f...0258a4ef14c11a0161f078c970c64574629761c2.</a></p>
<p>Placing a video call through to another Matrix client then coughed up a video stream that looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/depth-encoded.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2982" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/depth-encoded-956x1024.jpg" alt="" width="956" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, closer things (my head) are bluer than further things (the wall), and everything's covered with trippy red &amp; green stripes to refine the fine detail.  For the record, the iPhone TrueDepth camera emits 640x480 depth frames at around 24Hz.</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 4</strong>: extend matrix-vr-demo to view a dot cloud, displaced using a WebGL vertex shader based on the encoded depth info.  Dave kindly did the honours: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-vr-demo/commit/b14cdda605d3807080049e84181b46706cec553e">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-vr-demo/commit/b14cdda605d3807080049e84181b46706cec553e</a>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it showed that the depth encoding really wasn't working very well... you can just about make out my head, but there are dots flying around all over the place, and when you view it in profile the 3D effect was almost entirely missing.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bad.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2983" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bad-1024x744.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="744" /></a></p>
<p>The main problems seem to be:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Whenever there's a big jump in depth, the stripes get incredibly noisy and don't compress at all well, generating completely corrupt data at edges of objects (e.g. the sides of my head)</li>
 	<li>The complexity of the pattern as a whole isn't particularly compression-friendly</li>
 	<li>The contrast of the red/green stripes tends to dominate, causing the arguably more important blue to get overpowered during compression.</li>
 	<li>Converting from 4:4:4 RGB to 4:2:0 YUV (NV12) as required by WebRTC and then back to RGB inevitably entangles the colours - meaning that the extreme contrast of the red/green stripes is very visible on the blue channel after round-tripping due to sampling artefacts.</li>
 	<li>I probably made a mistake by bitwise casting the 16-bit half-precision floating point depth values directly onto the 16-bit unsigned int lookup index, rather than interpreting the float as a number and building a new index into the lookup table based on its numeric value.  As a result, depth values being encoded ended up having a much lower range than they should.</li>
 	<li>There are probably other bugs too.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Step 5: </strong>Give up on the fancy depth encoding (for now): <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/webrtc/commit/2f5d29352ce5d80727639991b1480f610cbdd54c">https://github.com/matrix-org/webrtc/commit/2f5d29352ce5d80727639991b1480f610cbdd54c</a>.  In practice, simply picking a range of the 16-bit half-precision floats to fit in the integer range [0,255] turns out to be good enough for a quick demo (i.e. 8-bit depth buffer, but over a small subset of the 16-bit depth space) - the dot cloud suddenly looked a lot more 3D and recognisable:
</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fixed.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2984" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fixed-1024x832.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="832" /></a></p>
<p>
<strong>Step 6</strong>: Clearly this needs colour as well as depth.  This means asking WebRTC to add VideoTracks for both video and depth to your call's MediaStream.  Firstly, we added a simple 'matrixDepth' constraint to WebRTC to tell a video source whether to capture depth or not.  (Yes, I know there's a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-depth/">specced way to do this</a>, but given nothing else here is on spec, we went for the simplest approach).  However, it turns out that only one WebRTC's AVFoundationVideoCapturer can run at a time, because it manages its own AVCaptureSession and you can only have one of those at a time in a given app.  As a result, the two capturers (one per video track) collided, with the second session killing the first session.  As a quick fix, we modified RTCAVFoundationVideoSource to accept an existing AVCaptureSession (and AVCaptureDeviceInput) so that the application itself can handle the capture session and select the device, which can then be shared between multiple capturers: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/webrtc/commit/9c58465ada08018b1238fb8c5d784b5570f9246b">https://github.com/matrix-org/webrtc/commit/9c58465ada08018b1238fb8c5d784b5570f9246b</a>.  Finally, just needed a few lines to matrix-ios-sdk to set the constraint and send the depth as well as video... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/compare/fa9a24a6914b207389bacdd9ad08d5386fd0644a...5947d634ae8d722133ecdbde94cccf60bb88f11d">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/compare/fa9a24a6914b207389bacdd9ad08d5386fd0644a...5947d634ae8d722133ecdbde94cccf60bb88f11d</a>, and adding playback of both channels to the vrdemo (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-vr-demo/commit/4059ab671d13bb4d4eb19dd2f534d9a387e47b81">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-vr-demo/commit/4059ab671d13bb4d4eb19dd2f534d9a387e47b81</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/commit/f3f1524fcd46d2e772fd5cd022364018c8889364">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/commit/f3f1524fcd46d2e772fd5cd022364018c8889364</a>) ...and it worked!
</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dots.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2985" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dots-1024x967.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="967" /></a></p>
<p>However, the dot cloud obviously has some limitations - especially when you zoom in like this.</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 7</strong>: Replace the dot cloud with a displacement-mapped mesh so that it's solid.  So as a final tweak for the demo, Dave switched out the dot cloud for a simple A-Frame plane with 640x480 vertices, keeping the same vertex shader.  Ironically this is where we hit some nasty problems, as for some reason the video texture started being applied to the depth texture (albeit flickering a bit) - eventually we realised that the flickering was the vertex shader inexplicably flapping between using the depth and the video texture for the displacement map.  At this point we compared it between laptops, and it turns out that for some reason the integrated Intel graphics on Dave's Macbook Pro was choking on the two video textures, whereas a AMD Radeon R9 M370X got it right.  It's unclear if this was actually a GPU bug or an A-Frame or Three.js or WebGL or Chrome bug.  Eitherway, on switching laptop to one with discrete graphics it started working perfectly!  Finally, we tweaked the shader to try to reduce smearing, by discarding vertices where there are big discontinuities in depth (through looking at the partial derivatives of the depth texture).  This isn't perfect yet but it's better than nothing.  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-vr-demo/compare/bbd460e81ff1336cd63468e707d858d47261ea42...06abe34957732ba8c728b99f198d987fe48d0420">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-vr-demo/compare/bbd460e81ff1336cd63468e707d858d47261ea42...06abe34957732ba8c728b99f198d987fe48d0420</a>
</p>
<p>And here's the end result! (complete with trancey soundtrack as the audio we recorded at FOSDEM was unusable)</p>

<strong>Conclusion:</strong>
