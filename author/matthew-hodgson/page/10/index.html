                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>FOSDEM this year was even more crazy and incredible than ever - with attendance up from 6,000 to 9,000 folks, it's almost impossible to describe the atmosphere. Matt Jordan from Asterisk describes it as <a href="https://twitter.com/mattcjordan/status/827562586119958528">DisneyWorld for OSS Geeks</a>, but it's even more than that: it's basically a corporeal representation of the whole FOSS movement.  There is no entrance fee; there is no intrusive sponsorship; there is no corporate presence: it's just a venue for huge numbers of FOSS projects and their users and communities to come together in one place (the Université Libre de Bruxelles) and talk and learn.  Imagine if someone built a virtual world with storefronts for every open source project imaginable, where you could chat to the core team, geek out with other users, or gather in auditoriums to hear updates on the latest projects &amp; ideas.  Well, this is FOSDEM... except even better, it's in real life.  With copious amounts of Belgian beer.</p>
<p>Anyway: this year we had our normal stand on the 2nd floor of K building, sharing the Realtime Lounge chill-out space with the XMPP Standards Foundation.  This year we had a larger representation than ever before with Matthew, Erik and Luke from the London team as well as Manu &amp; Yannick from Rennes - which is just as well given all 5 of us ended up speaking literally non-stop from 10am to 6pm on both Saturday &amp; Sunday (and then into the night as proceedings deteriorated/evolved into an impromptu Matrix meetup with Coffee, uhoreg, tadzik, realitygaps and others!).  The level of interest at the Matrix booth was frankly phenomenal: a major change from the last two FOSDEMs in that this year pretty much everyone had already heard of Matrix, and were most likely to want to enthuse about features and bugs in Synapse or Riot, or geek out about writing new bridges/bots/clients, or trying to work out a way to incorporate Matrix into their own projects or companies.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2017/02/04/synapse-0-19-is-here-just-in-time-for-fosdem">Synapse 0.19</a> and Riot 0.9.7 were also released on Saturday to try to ensure that anyone joining Matrix for the best time at FOSDEM were on the latest &amp; greatest code - especially given the performance and E2E fixes present in both.  Amazingly the last-minute release didn't backfire: if you haven't upgraded to Synapse 0.19 we recommend going so asap.  And if you're a Riot user, make sure you're on the latest version :)</p>
<p>We were very lucky to have two talks accepted this year: the main one in the Security Track on the Jansen main stage telling the tale of <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/encrypting_matrix/">how we added end-to-end encryption to Matrix</a>  via <a href="/docs/spec/olm.html">Olm</a> &amp; <a href="/docs/spec/megolm.html">Megolm</a> - and the other in the Decentralised Internet room (AW1.125), focusing on the unsolved <a href="http://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/matrix_future">future problems of decentralised accounts, identity, reputation in Matrix</a>.  Both talks were well attended, with huge queues for the Decentralised Internet room: we can only apologise to everyone who queued for 20+ minutes only to still not be able to get in.  Hopefully next year FOSDEM will allocate a larger room for decentralisation!  On the plus side, this year FOSDEM did an amazing job of videoing the sessions - livestreaming every talk, and automatically publishing the recordings (via a fantastic 'publish your own talk' web interface) - so many of the people who couldn't get into the room (as well as the rest of the world) were able to watch it live anyway by the stream.</p>

<p>You can watch the video of the talks from the FOSDEM website <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/encrypting_matrix/">here</a> and <a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/matrix_future/">here</a>.  Both talks necessarily include the similar exposition for folks unfamiliar with Matrix, so apologies for the duplication - also, the &quot;future of decentralised communication&quot; talk ended up a bit rushed; 20 minutes is not a lot of time to both explain Matrix and give an overview of the challenges we face in fixing spam, identity, moderation etc.  But if you like hearing overenthusiastic people talking too fast about how amazing Matrix is, you may wish to check out the videos :)  You can also get at the slides as PDF <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-02-03.1-FOSDEM-Encrypting-Matrix.pdf">here (E2E Encryption)</a> and <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-02-04-FOSDEM-Future.pdf">here (Future of Decentralisation)</a>.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to evevryone who came to the talks or came and spoke to us at the stand or around the campus.  We had an amazing time, and are already looking forward to next year!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We're happy to announce the release of Synapse 0.19.0 (same as 0.19.0-rc4) today, just in time for anyone discovering Matrix for the first time at FOSDEM 2017!  In fact, here's Erik doing the release right now (with moral support from Luke):</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1900" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/release-1024x768.jpg" alt="release" width="1024" height="768" />
<p>This is a pretty big release, with a bunch of new features and lots and lots of debugging and optimisation work following on some of the dramas that we had with 0.18 over the Christmas break.  The biggest things are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>IPv6 Support (unless you have an IPv6 only resolver), thanks to contributions from Glyph from Twisted and Kyrias!</li>
 	<li>A new API for tracking the E2E devices present in a room (required for fixing many of the remaining E2E bugs...)</li>
 	<li>Rewrite the 'state resolution' algorithm to be orders of magnitude more performant</li>
 	<li>Lots of tuning to the caching logic.</li>
</ul>
If you're already running a server, please upgrade!  And if you're not, go grab yourself a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">brand new Synapse</a> from Github. Debian packages will follow shortly (as soon as Erik can figure out the necessary backporting required for Twisted 16.6.0)
<p>And here's the full changelog...</p>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>As many will have noticed there was a major outage on the Matrix homeserver for matrix.org last night (UK-time).  This impacted anyone with an account on the matrix.org server, as well as anyone using matrix.org-hosted bots &amp; bridges.  As Matrix rooms are shared over all participants, rooms with participants on other servers were unaffected (for users on those servers). Here's a quick explanation of what went wrong (times are UTC):</p>
<ul>
<li>2017-01-24 16:00 - We notice that we're badly running out of diskspace on the matrix.org backup postgres replica.  (Turns out the backup box, whilst identical hardware to the master, had been built out as RAID-10 rather than RAID-5 and so has less disk space).
</li><li>2017-01-24 17:00 - We decide to drop a large DB index: <code>event_push_actions(room_id, event_id, user_id, profile_tag)</code>, which was taking up a disproportionate amount of disk space, on the basis that it didn't appear to be being used according to the postgres stats.  All seems good.
</li><li>2017-01-24 ~23:00 - The core matrix.org team go to bed.
</li><li>2017-01-24 23:33 - Someone redacts an event in a very active room (probably #matrix:matrix.org) which necessitates redacting the associated push notification from the event_push_actions table.  This takes out a lock within persist_event, which is then blocked on deleting the push notification.  It turns out that this deletion requires the missing DB constraint, causing the query to run for hours whilst holding the transaction lock.  The symptoms are that anything reading events from the DB was blocked on the transaction, causing messages not to be relayed to other clients or servers despite appearing to send correctly.  Meanwhile, the fact that events are being received by the server fine (including over federation) makes the monitoring graphs look largely healthy.
</li><li>2017-01-24 23:35 - End-to-end monitoring detects problems, and sends alerts into pagerduty and various Matrix rooms.  Unfortunately we'd failed to upgrade the pageduty trial into a paid account a few months ago, however, so the alerts are lost.
</li><li>2017-01-25 08:00 - Matrix team starts to wake up and spot problems, but confusion over the right escalation process (especially with Matthew on holiday) means folks assume that other members of the team must already be investigating.
</li><li>2017-01-25 09:00 - Server gets restarted, service starts to resume, although box suffers from load problems as traffic tries to catch up.
</li><li>2017-01-25 09:45 - Normal service on the homeserver itself is largely resumed (other than bridges; see below)
</li><li>2017-01-25 10:41 - Root cause established and the redaction path is patched on matrix.org to stop a recurrence.
</li><li>2017-01-25 11:15 - Bridges are seen to be lagging and taking much longer to recover than expected.   Decision made to let them continue to catch up normally rather than risk further disruption (e.g. IRC join/part spam) by restarting them.
</li><li>2017-01-25 13:00 - All hosted bridges returned to normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously this is rather embarrassing, and a huge pain for everyone using the matrix.org homeserver - many apologies indeed for the outage. On the plus side, all the other Matrix homeservers out there carried on without noticing any problems (which actually complicated spotting that things had broken, given many of the core team primarily use their personal homeservers).</p>
<p>In some ways the root cause here is that the core team has been focusing all its energy recently on improving the overall Matrix codebase rather than operational issues on matrix.org itself, and as a result our ops practices have fallen behind (especially as the health of the Matrix ecosystem as a whole is arguably more important than the health of a single homeserver deployment).  However, we clearly need to improve things here given the number of people (&gt;750K at the last count) dependent on the Matrix.org homeserver and its bridges &amp; bots.</p>
<p>Lessons learnt on our side are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that even though we had monitoring graphs & thresholds set up on all the right things... monitoring alerts actually have to be routed somewhere useful - i.e. phone calls to the team's phones.  Pagerduty is now set up and running properly to this end.</li>
<li>Make sure that people know to wake up the right people anyway if the monitoring alerting system fails.</li>
<li>To be even more paranoid about hotfixes to production at 5pm, especially if they can wait 'til the next day (as this one could have).</li>
<li>To investigate ways to rapidly recover bridges without causing unnecessary disruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apologies again to everyone who was bitten by this - we're doing everything we can to ensure it doesn't happen again.</p>
<p>Matthew &amp; the team.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p><del>TL;DR: Please upgrade to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.18.6">Synapse 0.18.6</a>, especially if you are on 0.18.5 which is a bad release.</del></p>
<p>TL;DR: Please upgrade to <strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.18.7">Synapse 0.18.7</a> </strong>- especially if you are on 0.18.5 or 0.18.6 which both have serious federation bugs.</p>
<p>Synapse 0.18.5 contained a really nasty regression in the federation code which causes servers to echo transactions that they receive back out to the other servers participating in a room. This has effectively resulted in a gradual amplification of federation traffic as more people have installed 0.18.5, causing every transaction to be received N times over where N is the number of servers in the room.</p>
<p>We'll do a full write-up once we're happy we've tracked down all the root problems here, but the short story is that this hit critical mass around Dec 26, where typical Synapses started to fail to keep up with the traffic - especially when requests hit some of the more inefficient or buggy codepaths in Synapse.  As servers started to overload with inbound connections, this in turn started to slow down and consume resources on the connecting servers - especially due to an architectural mistake in Synapse which blocks inbound connections until the request has been fully processed (which could require the receiving server in turn to make outbound connections), rather than releasing the inbound connection asap.  This hit the point that servers were running out of file descriptors due to all the outbound and inbound connections, at which point they started to entirely tarpit inbound connections, resulting in a slow feedback loop making the whole situation even worse.</p>
<p>We've spent the last two weeks hunting all the individual inefficient requests which were mysteriously starting to cause more problems than they ever had before; then trying to understand the feedback misbehaviour; before finally discovering the regression in 0.18.5 as the plausible root cause of the problem.  Troubleshooting has been complicated by most of the team having unplugged for the holidays, and because this is the first (and hopefully last!) failure mode to be distributed across the whole network, making debugging something of a nightmare - especially when the overloading was triggering a plethora of different exotic failure modes.  Huge thanks to everyone who has shared their server logs with the team to help debug this.</p>
<p>Some of these failure modes are still happening (and we're working on fixing them), but we believe that if everyone upgrades away from the bad 0.18.5 release most of the symptoms will go away, or at least go back to being as bad as they were before.  Meanwhile, if you find your server suddenly grinding to a halt after upgrading to <del>0.18.6</del> 0.18.7 please come tell us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>We're enormously sorry if you've been bitten by the federation instability this has caused - and many many thanks for your patience whilst we've hunted it down.  On the plus side, it's given us a lot of <em>very</em> useful insight into how to implement federation in future homeservers to not suffer from any of these failure modes.  It's also revealed the root cause of why Synapse's RAM usage is quite so bad - it turns out that it actually idles at around 200MB with default caching, but there's a particular codepath which causes it to spike temporarily by 1GB or so - and that RAM is then not released back to the OS.  We're working on a fix for this too, but it'll come after 0.18.7.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the original release of 0.18.6 still exhibits the root bug, but 0.18.7 (originally released as 0.18.7-rc2) should finally fix this.  Sorry for all the upgrades :(</p>
<p>So <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.18.7">please upgrade as soon as possible</a> to 0.18.7.  <a href="/packages/debian">Debian packages</a> are available as normal.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Matthew</p>

                <p>We seem to have fallen into the pattern of giving seasonal 'state of the union' updates on the Matrix blog, despite best intentions to blog more frequently... although given the <a href="/blog/2016/11/12/the-matrix-autumn-special/">Autumn Update</a> ended up being posted in November this one is going to be a relatively incremental update.  Let's jump straight in:</p>
<h3>E2E Encryption</h3>
Unless you've been in a coma for the last month you'll have hopefully noticed that we <a href="/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last/">launched the formal beta for E2E Encryption</a> across matrix-{'{'}js,ios,android{'}'}-sdk (and thus Riot/{'{'}Web, iOS, Android{'}'}) in November, complete with the successful <a href="http://nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/matrix-olm-cryptographic-review">independent public security assessment</a> of our Olm and Megolm cryptography library from NCC Group.  So far the beta has gone well in parts: the core Olm/Megolm crypto library has held up well with no bugfixes at all required since the audit (yay!).  However, we've hit a lot of different edge cases in the wild where devices can fail to share their outbound session ratchet state to other devices present in the room.  This results in the infamous "Unknown Inbound Session ID" (UISI) errors which many folks will have seen (now renamed to the more meaningful "Unable to decrypt: The sender's device has not sent us the keys for this message" error).
<p>Unfortunately there's a bunch of entirely different causes for this, both platform-specific and cross-platform, and we've been running around untangling all the error reports and getting to the bottom of it.  The good news is that we think we now know the vast majority of the causes, and fixes are starting to land.  We've also just finished a fairly time-consuming formal crypto code-review on the three application SDK implementations (JS, iOS &amp; Android) to shake out any other issues.  Meanwhile some new features have also landed - e.g. the ability for guests to use E2E!  The remaining stuff at this point before we can consider declaring E2E out of beta is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Finish fixing the UISI errors (in progress)</li>
 	<li>Warn when unverified devices are added to a room</li>
 	<li>Implement passphrased backup &amp; restore for E2E state, so that folks can avoid losing their E2E history when they logout or switch to a new device</li>
 	<li>Improve device verification.</li>
</ul>
Thanks to everyone who's been using E2E and reporting issues - given the number of different UISI error causes out there, it's been really useful to go through the different bug reports that folks have submitted.  Please continue to submit them when you see unexpected problems (especially over the coming months as stability improves!)
<h3>New Projects!</h3>
There have been a tonne of new projects popping up from all over the place since the last update.  Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/commits/master/supporting-docs">git history</a> of the <a href="/docs/projects">projects page</a>, we've been adding one every few days!  Highlights include:
<h4>Bridges:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kfatehi/matrix-appservice-imessage">https://github.com/kfatehi/matrix-appservice-imessage</a> - A solid foundation for an iMessage bridge from kfatehi, built on top of the official matrix-appservice-bridge stack.  iMessage and FaceTime's crypto is tied into Apple's Fairplay DRM (famous for securing the iTunes Music Store and App Store) and is locked all the way down to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf">keypair baked into your Apple device's CPU</a> at fabrication time, so for now the bridge has to be run on a macOS device in order to bridge.  It's very promising indeed, and exciting to see bridges to relatively inhospitable environments like iMessage popping up!</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-fb-chat/">https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-fb-chat/</a> - A proof-of-concept bridge for Facebook Messenger written by Half-Shot in TypeScript on top of the matrix-js-sdk.  Currently you have to manually configure which conversations to bridge between FB and Matrix, but it works!</li>
 	<li><a href="http://github.com/exul/matrix-rocketchat">https://github.com/exul/matrix-rocketchat</a>  - A new Rocket.Chat bridge from exul, written in Rust.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/pztrn/matrix-xmpp-bridge">https://github.com/pztrn/matrix-xmpp-bridge</a> - A major fork from pztrn of jfred's matrix-xmpp-bridge, now using flask, regius, alembic, sleekxmpp and all sorts.  Currently in very active dev!</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/CyrusTheHedgehog/Hangouts-Bridge">https://github.com/CyrusTheHedgehog/Hangouts-Bridge</a> - A basic PoC of a Hangouts bridge, written in python3 asyncio</li>
</ul>
<h4>Clients</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/lukebarnard1/j">https://github.com/lukebarnard1/j</a> - A blogging and journalism platform built on Matrix from Luke (moonlighting from the core team!)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://live.hello-matrix.net/">https://live.hello-matrix.net/</a> - a live-blogging system powered by Matrix from @ar</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/pik/interlocutor">https://github.com/pik/interlocutor</a> - An experimental decentralized comment system powered by Matrix, written as a Polymer Webcomponent</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/tjgillies/freebird">https://github.com/tjgillies/freebird</a> - a basic twitter clone built on Matrix by tjgillies</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other projects</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/slp/matrix-pushgw">https://github.com/slp/matrix-pushgw</a> - A Matrix push gateway written in Golang which exposes a custom TCP push protocol to apps, letting them get push notifications directly from your own gateway rather than via GCM or APNS.  The intention is to use it for Sailfish and Fdroid.  The initial implementation looks very promising - just needs the clientside support, and then folks who don't trust Google with their notifications can run completely indie at last!</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kultsinuppeli/riotchat">https://github.com/kultsinuppeli/riotchat</a> - Ansible playbook for Riot/Web and Synapse</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/bismark/matrex">https://github.com/bismark/matrex</a> - Experimental beginnings of a Matrix homeserver written in Elixir!</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/mlopezr/node-red-contrib-matrixbot">https://github.com/mlopezr/node-red-contrib-matrixbot</a> - Matrix bot plugin for the <a href="https://nodered.org/">Node-RED</a> IOT platform</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bots and Bridges</h3>
There's been a bunch of work from the core team on bots &amp; bridges infrastructure over the last month:
<p>Rearchitecting the slack and gitter bridges to optionally support 'puppeting users'.  This is in some ways the ultimate flavour of bridging - where you authenticate with the remote service using your &quot;real&quot; gitter/slack/... credentials, and then the bridge has access to synchronise your full spectrum of data with Matrix.  This is in contrast to the current implementations where the bridge creates virtual users (e.g. Slack webhook bots or IRC virtual user bots) or uses a predefined bot (e.g. matrixbridge on gitter) to link the rooms.</p>
<p>This has some huge advantages: e.g. ability to bridge Slack and Gitter DMs through properly to Matrix; bridging presence and typing notifications correctly, not requiring any custom bots or integrations to be configured; not proxying via a crappy bridge bot as per gitter today; letting Matrixed users be completely indistinguishable from their native selves on the remote platform - so supporting tab complete in Slack, profiles, presence, etc.  The main disadvantage is that you have to have an account on the platform already (although you could argue this is a feature, especially from the remote network's perspective!) and that you are delegating access to that account through to the bridge, so you'd better trust it.  However, you can always run your own bridge if trust is an issue.</p>
<p>The work on this is mid-progress currently, but we're really looking forward to seeing the official Slack, Gitter and other bridges support this mode of operation in the new year!</p>
<p>We've also been spending some time working with bridges written by the wider community (e.g. Half-Shot's <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-twitter">twitter bridge</a>) to get them deployed on the matrix.org homeserver itself, to help folks who can't run their own.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there's been a lot of work going into supporting the IRC bridge. Main highlights there are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>The release of <a href="/blog/2016/12/19/matrix-appservice-irc-0-7-0-is-out/">matrix-appservice-irc 0.7</a>, with all sorts of major new features</li>
 	<li>Turning on bi-directional membership list syncing at last for all networks other than Freenode!  In theory, at least, you should finally see the same list of room members in both IRC and Matrix!!</li>
 	<li>Handling IRC PM botspam from Freenode and OFTC, which bridge through as invite spam into Matrix.  Sorry if you've been bitten by this.  We've worked around it for now by setting appropriate umodes on the IRC bots, and by implementing a 'bulk reject' button on Riot (under in Settings).  This caused a few nasty outages on Freenode and OFTC. On the plus side, at least it shows that Riot scales up to receiving 2000+ invites without exhibiting ill effects...</li>
 	<li>Considering how to improve history visibility on IRC to avoid scenarios where channel history is shared between users in the same room (even if their IRC bot has temporarily disconnected).  This was a major problem during the Freenode/OFTC outages mentioned earlier.</li>
</ul>
Last but not least, we've just released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrix">gomatrix - a new official Matrix client SDK for golang</a>!  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb">Go-neb</a> (the reference golang Matrix bot framework) has been entirely refactored to use gomatrix, which should keep it honest as a 1st class Matrix client SDK for those in the Golang community.  We highly recommend all Golang nuts to go <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/matrix-org/gomatrix">read the documentation</a> and give it a spin!
<h3>Riot Desktop</h3>
Riot development has been largely preoccupied with E2E debugging in the respective Matrix Client SDKs, but <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/introducing-riot-0-9-and-desktop-riot-3585d1027243">0.9.3 was released last week adding in Electron-based desktop app support</a>.  (Remember, if you hate Electron-style desktop apps which provide a desktop app by embedded a webbrowser, you can always use another Matrix client!).  If you've been missing having Riot as a proper desktop app, go get involved!

<h3>Next Generation Homeservers</h3>
<h4>Ruma</h4>
<a href="https://ruma.io">Ruma</a> is a project led by Jimmy Cuadra to build a Matrix homeserver in Rust - the project has been ploughing steadily onwards through 2016 with a bit of an acceleration during December.  You can follow progress at the excellent <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/">This Week in Ruma</a> blog, <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pulse/monthly">watching the project on Github</a>, and tracking the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/blob/master/STATUS.md">API status dashboard</a>.  Some of the latest PRs are looking very promising in terms of getting the core remaining CS APIs working, e.g:
<ul class="simple-conversation-list varied-states">
 	<li><span class="num">Merged #113</span>
 <a class="title" href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/113">Add implementation for the filter endpoint.</a> 4 days ago</li>
 	<li><span class="state state-merged">Merged</span>
<span class="num">#125</span>
 <a class="title" href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/125">Adding a Server header to API responses</a> 5 days ago</li>
 	<li><span class="state state-merged">Merged</span>
<span class="num">#105</span>
 <a class="title" href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/105">Add basic implementation for the tags endpoint.</a> 5 days ago</li>
 	<li><span class="num">Open #106</span>
 <a class="title" href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/106">Add basic implementation for the sync endpoint.</a> 2 days ago</li>
 	<li><span class="state state-open">Open</span>
<span class="num">#58</span>
 <a class="title" href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/issues/58">API: GET /events</a> 20 days ago</li>
</ul>
Needless to say, we've been keeping an eye on Ruma with extreme interest, not least as some of the Matrix core team are rabid Rustaceans too :)  We can't wait to see it exposing a usable CS API in the hopefully not-too-distant future!!
<h4>Dendrite</h4>
Meanwhile, in the core team, we've been doing some fairly serious experimentation on next-generation homeservers.  Synapse is in a relatively stable state currently, and we've implemented most of the horizontal scalability tricks available to us there (e.g. splitting out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/workers.rst">worker processes</a>).  Instead we're starting to hit some fundamental limitations of the architecture: the fact that the whole codebase effectively assumes that it's talking to a single consistent database instance; python's single-threadedness and memory inefficiency; twisted's lack of profiling; being limited to sqlite's featureset; the fact that the schema has grown organically and is difficulty to refactor aggressively; the fact the app papers over SQL problems by caching everything in RAM (resulting in synapse's high RAM requirements); the constant bugs caused by lack of type safety; etc.
<p>We started an experiment in Golang to fix some of this a year ago in the form of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendron">Dendron</a> - a &quot;<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html">strangler pattern</a>&quot; homeserver skeleton intended to sit in front of a synapse and slowly port endpoints over to Go.  In practice, Dendron ended up just being a rather dubious Matrix-aware loadbalancer, and meanwhile no endpoints got moved into it (other than /login, which then got moved out again due to the extreme confusion of having to maintain implementations in both Dendron &amp; Synapse).  The main reasons for Dendron's failure are a) we had enough on our hands supporting Synapse; b) there were easier scalability improvements (e.g. workers) to be had on Synapse; c) the gradual migration approach looked like it would end up sharing the same storage backend as Synapse anyway, and potentially end up inheriting a bunch of Synapse's woes.</p>
<p>So instead, a month or so ago we started a new project codenamed Dendrite (aka Dendron done right ;D) - this time an entirely fresh standalone Golang codebase for rapid development and iteration on the platonic ideal of a next-generation homeserver (and an excuse to audit and better document &amp; spec some of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KVTNIZIig1iyRBzK91L6B7tnsfmon7CIWh-DCFRd6k/edit">murkier</a> bits of Matrix).  The project is still very early and there's no doc or code to be seen yet, but it's looking cautiously optimistic (especially relative to Dendron!).  The project goals are broadly:</p>
<ol>
 	<li>To build a new HS capable of supporting the exponentially increasing load on matrix.org ASAP (which is currently at 600K accounts, 50K rooms, 5 messages/s and growing fast).</li>
 	<li>To architecturally support full horizontal scalability through clustering and sharding from the outset - i.e. no single DBs or DB writer processes.</li>
 	<li>To optimise for Postgres rather than be constrained by SQLite, whilst still aiming for a simple but optimal schema and storage layer.  Optimising for smaller resource footprints (e.g. environments where a Postgres is overkill) will happen later - but the good news is that the architecture will support it (unlike Synapse, which doesn't scale down nicely even with SQLite).</li>
</ol>
It's too early to share more at this stage, but thought we should give some visibility on where things are headed!  Needless to say, Synapse is here for the foreseeable - we think of it as being the Matrix equivalent of the role Apache httpd played for the Web.  It's not enormously efficient, but it's popular and relatively mature, and isn't going away.  Meanwhile, new generations of servers like Ruma and Dendrite will come along for those seeking a sleeker but more experimental beast, much as nginx and lighttpd etc have come along as alternatives to Apache.  Time will tell how the server ecosystem will evolve in the longer term, but it's obviously critical to the success of Matrix to have multiple active independent server implementations, and we look forward to seeing how Synapse, Ruma &amp; Dendrite progress!
<h3>2017</h3>
Looking back at where we were at <a href="/blog/2015/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-special/">this time last year</a>, 2016 has been a critical year for Matrix as the ecosystem has matured - rolling out E2E encryption; building out proper bot &amp; bridge infrastructure; stabilising and tuning Synapse to keep up with the exponential traffic growth; seeing the explosion of contributors and new projects; seeing Riot edging closer to becoming a viable mainstream communication app.
<p>2017 is going to be all about scaling Matrix - both the network, the ecosystem, and the project.  Whilst we've hopefully transitioned from being a niche decentralisation initiative to a relatively mainstream FOSS project, our ambition is unashamedly to become a mainstream communication (meta)network usable for the widest possible audience (whilst obviously still supporting our current community of FOSS &amp; privacy advocates!).  With this in mind, stuff on the menu for 2017 includes:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Getting E2E Encryption out of beta asap.</li>
 	<li>Ensuring we can scale beyond Synapse - see Dendrite, above.</li>
 	<li>Getting as many bots and bridges into Matrix as possible, and doing everything we can to support them, host them and help them be as high quality as possible - making the public federated Matrix network as useful and diverse as possible.</li>
 	<li>Supporting Riot's leap to the mainstream, ensuring Matrix has at least one killer app.</li>
 	<li>Adding the final major missing features:
<ul>
 	<li>Customisable User Profiles (this is almost done, actually)</li>
 	<li>Groups (i.e. ability to define groups of users, and perform invites, powerlevels etc per-group as well as per-user)</li>
 	<li>Threading</li>
 	<li>Editable events (and Reactions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Maturing and polishing the spec (we are way overdue a new release)</li>
 	<li>Improving VoIP - especially conferencing.</li>
 	<li>Reputation/Moderation management (i.e. spam/abuse filtering).</li>
 	<li>Much-needed SDK performance work on matrix-{'{'}react,ios,android{'}'}-sdk.</li>
 	<li>...and a few other things which would be premature to mention right now :D</li>
</ul>
This is going to be an incredibly exciting ride (right now, it feels a bit like being on a toboggan which has made its way onto a fairly steep ski slope...) and we can only thank you: the community, for getting the project to this point - whether you're hacking on Matrix, contributing pull requests, filing issues, testing apps, spreading the word, or just simply using it.
<p>See you in 2017, and thanks again for flying Matrix.</p>

                <p>Also, we've just released a major update to the IRC bridge codebase after trialling it on the matrix.org-hosted bridges for the last few days.</p>
<p>The big news is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>The bridge uses Synapse 0.18.5's new APIs for managing the public room list (improving performance a bunch)</li>
 	<li>Much faster startup using the new /joined_rooms and /joined_members APIs in Synapse 0.18.5</li>
 	<li>The bridge will now remember your NickServ password (encrypted at rest) if you want it to via the <code>!storepass</code> command</li>
 	<li>You can now set arbitrary user modes for IRC clients on connection (to mitigate PM spam etc)</li>
 	<li>After a split, the bridge will drop Matrix-&gt;IRC messages older than N seconds, rather than try to catch the IRC room up on everything they missed on Matrix :S</li>
 	<li>Operational metrics are now implemented using Prometheus rather than statsd</li>
 	<li>New <code>!quit</code> command to nuke your user from the remote IRC network</li>
 	<li>Membership list syncing for IRC-&gt;Matrix is enormously improved, and enabled for all matrix.org-hosted bridges apart from Freenode.  &lt;b&gt;At last, membership lists should be in sync between IRC and Matrix; please let us know if they're not&lt;/b&gt;.</li>
 	<li>Better error logging</li>
</ul>
For full details, please see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">the changelog</a>.
<p>With things like NickServ-pass storing, !quit support and full bi-directional membership list syncing, it's never been a better time to run your own IRC bridge.  Please install or upgrade today from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc</a>!</p>

                <p><i>As something completely different, we've invited Stefan Ålund and his team at Ericsson to write a guest blog
post about the really cool stuff Ericsson is doing with Matrix.  This is a fascinating glimpse into how major folks
are already launching commercial products on top of Matrix - whilst also making significant contributions back to
the projects and the community.  We'd like to thank Stefan and Ericsson for all their support and perseverance,
and we wish them the very best with the Ericsson Contextual Communication Cloud!
</i></p>
<p><i>-- Matthew
</i></p>
<p>At the end of 2014, my colleague Adam Bergkvist and I attended the WebRTC Expo in Paris, partly to promote our
Open Source project <a href="https://www.openwebrtc.org">OpenWebRTC</a>, but also to meet the rest of the European
WebRTC community and see what others were working on. </p>
<p>At Ericsson Research we had been working on WebRTC for quite some time. Not only on the client-side framework and
how those could enable some truly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nl0fuWzoGk">experimental stuff</a>, but
more importantly how this emerging technology could be used to build new kinds of communication services where
communication is not <em>the</em> service (A calling B), but is integrated as part of some other service or context. A simple
example would be a health care solution, where the starting point could be the patient records and communication
technologies are integrated to enable remote discussions between patients and their doctors.</p>
<p>Our research in this area, that we started calling “contextual communication”, pointed in a different direction from
Ericsson's traditional communication business, therefore making it hard for us to transfer our ideas and technologies
out from Ericsson Research. We increasingly had the feeling that we needed to build something new and start from a
clean slate, so to speak.</p>
<p>Some of our guiding principles:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility - the communication should be able to integrate anywhere
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fast iterations - browsers and WebRTC are moving targets
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Open - interoperability is important for communication systems
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Low cost - operations for the core communication should approach 0
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Trust - build on the Ericsson brand and technology leadership 
</li>
</ul>
We had a pretty good idea about what we wanted to build, but even though Ericsson is a big company, the team working in this area was relatively small and also had a number of other commitments that we couldn't abandon.
<p>I think that is enough of a background, let's circle back to the WebRTC Expo and the reason why I am writing this post on the Matrix blog.</p>
<p>Adam and I were pretty busy in <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenWebRTC/status/544781293838684161">our booth</a> talking
to people and giving demos, so we actually missed when Matrix won
the <a href="/blog/2014/12/24/matrix-wins-best-innovation-award-at-webrtc-paris/"> Best Innovation Award</a>.
Nonetheless we finally got some time to walk around and I started chatting with Matthew and Amandine who were manning
the Matrix booth. Needless to say, I was really impressed with their vision and what they wanted to build. The
comparison to email and how they wanted to make it possible to build an interoperable bridge between communication
“islands”, all in an open (source) manner, really appealed to me.</p>
<p>To be honest, the altruistic aspects of decentralising communication was not the most important part for us,
even if we were sympathetic to the cause, working for a company that was founded from
&quot;<a href="http://www.ericsson.hr/lars-magnus-ericsson-entrepreneur">the belief that communication is a basic human need</a>&quot;.
We ultimately wanted to build a new kind of communication offering from Ericsson, and it looked like Matrix might be able
to play a part in that.</p>
<p>I had recently hired a couple of <a href="http://teknikspranget.se">interns</a> and as soon as I came back from Paris, we
set them to work evaluating Matrix. They were quickly able to port an existing WebRTC service (developed and used in-house)
to use Matrix signalling and user management. We initially had some concerns about the maturity of the reference
Home Server <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">implementation</a> (remember, this was almost 2 years ago) and
we didn't want to start developing our own since we were still a small team. However, Matthew and the rest of the Matrix
team worked closely with us, helping to answer all our (dumb) questions and we finally got to a point where we had the
confidence to say “screw it, let's try this and see if it flies”. ?</p>
<p>Ericsson had recently launched the <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/innovation/ericsson-garage">Ericsson Garage</a> where
employees could pitch ideas for how to build new business. So we decided to give the process a try and presented an idea
on how Ericsson could start selling contextual communication as-a-Service, directly to enterprises that wanted help
integrating communication into their business processes, but didn't necessarily have the competence or business interest
to run their own communication services. We got accepted and moved (physically) out of Research to sit in the Garage for
the next 4 months, developing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>.</p>
<p>Since the primary interface to our offering would be through SDKs on various platforms, we decided early on to develop our
own. The SDKs were implementing the standard Matrix specification, but we put a lot of time in increasing the robustness
and flexibility in the WebRTC call handling and eventually with added peer-2-peer data and collaboration features, on top
of the secure WebRTC <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-data-channel-13">DataChannel</a>. On the
server side, our initialconcerns about Synapse were eventually removed completely as the Matrix team relentlessly kept
working on fixing performance issues, patching security holes and provided a story on how to scale. Over the years we
have contributed with several patches to Synapse (SAML auth and auth improvements; application service improvements) and
provided input to the Matrix specification. We have always found the Matrix team be very inclusive and easy to work with.</p>
<p>The project graduated successfully from the Ericsson Garage and moved in to Ericsson's Business Unit IT &amp; Cloud
Products, where we started to increase the size of the team and just last month signed a contract with our first
customer. We call the solution Ericsson Contextual Communication Cloud, or ECCC for short, and it can be summarised on a
high level by the following picture:</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1852" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Picture1.png" alt="ECCC in a nutshell" width="975" height="546" />
<p>If you are interested in ECCC, feel free to reach out at <a href="https://discuss.c3.ericsson.net">https://discuss.c3.ericsson.net</a></p>
<p>As with any project developed in the open, it is essential to have a healthy community around it. We have received
excellent support from the Matrix project and they have always been open for discussion, engaged our developers and
listened to our needs. We depend on Matrix now and we see great potential for the future. We hope that others will adopt the 
technology and help make the community grow even stronger.</p>

                <p>TL;DR: We're officially starting the cross-platform beta of end-to-end encryption in Matrix today, with matrix-js-sdk, matrix-android-sdk and matrix-ios-sdk all supporting e2e via the <a href="/docs/spec/olm.html">Olm</a> and <a href="/docs/spec/megolm.html">Megolm</a> cryptographic ratchets.  Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/matrix-olm-cryptographic-review">NCC Group have publicly released their security assessment</a> of the underlying libolm library, kindly funded by the <a href="https://www.opentech.fund/">Open Technology Fund</a>, giving a full and independent transparent report on where the core implementation is at. The assessment was incredibly useful, finding some interesting issues, which have all been solved either in libolm itself or at the Matrix client SDK level.</p>
<p>If you want to get experimenting with E2E, the flagship Matrix client <a href="https://riot.im">Riot</a> has been updated to use the new SDK on Web, Android and iOS… although the iOS App is currently stuck in “export compliance” review at Apple. However, iOS users can mail <a href="mailto:support@riot.im">support@riot.im</a> to request being added to the TestFlight beta to help us test!  <strong>Update: iOS is now live and approved by Apple (as of Thursday Nov 24.  You can still mail us if you want to get beta builds though!)</strong></p>
<p>We are ridiculously excited about adding an open decentralised e2e-encrypted pubsub data fabric to the internet, and we hope you are too! :D</p>
<hr />
<p>Ever since the beginning of the Matrix we've been promising end-to-end (E2E) encryption, which is rather vital given conversations in Matrix are replicated over every server participating in a room.  This is no different to SMTP and IMAP, where emails are typically stored unencrypted in the IMAP spools of all the participating mail servers, but we can and should do much better with Matrix: there is no reason to have to trust all the participating servers not to snoop on your conversations.  Meanwhile, the internet is screaming out for an open decentralised e2e-encrypted pubsub data store - which we're now finally able to provide :)</p>
<p>Today marks the start of a formal public beta for our <a href="/docs/spec/megolm.html">Megolm</a> and <a href="/docs/spec/olm.html">Olm</a>-based end-to-end encryption across Web, Android and iOS. New builds of the <a href="https://riot.im">Riot</a> matrix client have just been released on top of the newly 
Megolm
-capable <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">matrix-js-sdk</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">matrix-ios-sdk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">matrix-android-sdk</a> libraries
.  The stuff that ships today is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>E2E encryption, based on the <a href="/git/olm/about">Olm</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm">Double Ratchet</a> and Megolm ratchet, working in beta on all three platforms</b>.  We're still chasing a few nasty bugs which can cause ‘unknown inbound session IDs', but in general it should be stable: please report these via Github if you see them.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Encrypted attachments are here!</b> (limited to ~2MB on web, but as soon as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/562">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/562</a> lands this limit will go away)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Encrypted VoIP signalling</b> (and indeed any arbitrary Matrix events) are here!
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking whether the messages you receive are from <strong>‘verified' devices</strong> or not.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Letting you <strong>block specific target devices</strong> from being able to decrypt your messages or not.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The <a href=" http://matrix.org/docs/guides/e2e_implementation.html">Official Implementor's Guide</a></strong>.  If you're a developer wanting to add Olm into your Matrix client/bot/bridge etc, this is the place to start.
</li>
</ul>
Stuff which remains includes:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Speeding up sending the first message after adds/removes a device from a room (this can be <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues/2157"><em>very</em> slow</a> currently - e.g. 10s, but we can absolutely do better).
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Proper device verification.  Currently we compare out-of-band device fingerprints, which is a terrible UX.  Lots of work to be done here.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Turning on encryption for private rooms by default.  We're deliberately keeping E2E opt-in for now during beta given there is a small risk of undecryptable messages, and we don't want to lull folks into a false sense of security.  As soon as we're out of beta, we'll obviously be turning on E2E for any room with private history by default.  This also gives the rest of the Matrix ecosystem a chance to catch up, as we obviously don't want to lock out all the clients which aren't built on matrix-{'{'}js,ios,android{'}'}-sdk.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">We're also considering building a simple Matrix proxy to aid migration that you can run on localhost that E2Es your traffic as required (so desktop clients like WeeChat, NaChat, Quaternion etc would just connect to the proxy on localhost via pre-E2E Matrix, which would then manage all your keys &amp; sessions &amp; ratchets and talk E2E through to your actual homeserver.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Matrix clients which can't speak E2E won't show encrypted messages at all.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">...<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Atype%3Ae2e">lots and lots of bugs</a> :D
.  We'll be out of beta once these are all closed up.
</li>
</ul>
In practice the system is working very usably, especially for 1:1 chats.  Big group chats with lots of joining/parting devices are a bit more prone to weirdness, as are edge cases like running multiple Riot/Webs in adjacent tabs on the same account.  Obviously we don't recommend using the E2E for anything mission critical requiring 100% guaranteed privacy whilst we're still in beta, but we do thoroughly recommend everyone to give it a try and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues">file bugs</a>!
<p>In Riot you can turn it on a per-room basis if you're an administrator that room by flipping the little padlock button in Room Settings.  Warning: once enabled, you cannot turn it off again for that room (to avoid the race condition of people suddenly decrypting a room before someone says something sensitive):</p>

<p>The journey to end-to-end encryption has been a bit convoluted, with work beginning in Feb 2015 by the Matrix team on <a href="/git/olm"><b>Olm</b></a>: an independent Apache-licensed implementation in C/C++11 of the Double Ratchet algorithm designed by Trevor Perrin and Moxie Marlinspike (
<a href="https://github.com/trevp/double_ratchet/wiki">https://github.com/trevp/double_ratchet/wiki</a> - then called ‘axolotl').  We picked the Double Ratchet in its capacity as the most ubiquitous, respected and widely studied e2e algorithm out there - mainly thanks to Open Whisper Systems implementing it in Signal, and subsequently licensing it to Facebook for WhatsApp and Messenger, Google for Allo, etc.  And we reasoned that if we are ever to link huge networks like WhatsApp into Matrix whilst preserving end-to-end encrypted semantics, we'd better be using at least roughly the same technology :D</p>
<p>One of the first things we did was to write a <a href="/docs/spec/olm.html">terse but formal spec</a> for the Olm implementation of the Double Ratchet, fleshing out the original sketch from Trevor &amp; Moxie, especially as at the time there wasn't a formal spec from Open Whisper Systems (until yesterday! Congratulations to Trevor &amp; co for publishing their <a href="https://whispersystems.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/">super-comprehensive spec</a> :).  We wrote a first cut of the ratchet over the course of a few weeks, which looked pretty promising but then the team got pulled into improving Synapse performance and features as our traffic started to accelerate faster than we could have possibly hoped.  We then got back to it again in June-Aug 2015 and basically finished it off and added a basic implementation to matrix-react-sdk (and picked up by Vector, now Riot)… before getting side-tracked again.  After all, there wasn't any point in adding e2e to clients if the rest of the stack is on fire!</p>
<p>Work resumed again in May 2016 and has continued ever since - starting with the addition of a new ratchet to the mix.  The Double Ratchet (Olm) is great at encrypting conversations between pairs of devices, but it starts to get a bit unwieldy when you use it for a group conversation - especially the huge ones we have in Matrix.  Either each sender needs to encrypt each message N times for every device in the room (which doesn't scale), or you need some other mechanism.</p>
<p>For Matrix we also require the ability to explicitly decide how much conversation history may be shared with new devices.  In classic Double Ratchet implementations this is anathema: the very act of synchronising history to a new device is a huge potential privacy breach - as it's deliberately breaking perfect forward secrecy.  Who's to say that the device you're syncing your history onto is not an attacker?  However, in practice, this is a very common use case.  If a Matrix user switches to a new app or device, it's often very desirable that they can decrypt old conversation history on the new device.  So, we make it configurable per room.  (In today's implementation the ability to share history to new devices is still disabled, but it's coming shortly).</p>
<p>The end result is an entirely new ratchet that we've called <a href="/docs/spec/megolm.html"><b>Megolm</b></a> - which is included in the same <a href="/git/olm">libolm library</a> as Olm.  The way Megolm works is to give every sender in the room its own encrypted ratchet (‘outbound session'), so every device encrypts each message once based on the current key given by their ratchet (and then advances the ratchet to generate a new key).  Meanwhile, the device shares the state of their ‘outbound session' to every other device in the room via the normal Olm ratchet in a 1:1 exchange between the devices.  The other devices maintain an ‘inbound session' for each of the devices they know about, and so can decrypt their messages.  Meanwhile, when new devices join a room, senders can share their sessions according to taste to the new device - either giving access to old history or not depending on the configuration of the room.  You can read more in the <a href="/docs/spec/megolm.html">formal spec for Megolm</a>.</p>
<p>We finished the combination of Olm and Megolm back in September 2016, and shipped the very first implementation in the matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk as used in <a href="https://riot.im">Riot</a> with some major limitations (no encrypted attachments; no encrypted VoIP signalling; no history sharing to new devices).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we were incredibly lucky to receive a public security assessment of the Olm &amp; Megolm implementation in libolm from <a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-services/security-consulting/cryptography-services/">NCC Group Cryptography Services</a> - famous for assessing the likes of Signal, Tor, OpenSSL, etc and other Double Ratchet implementations. The assessment was very generously funded by the <a href="https://opentech.fund">Open Technology Fund</a> (who specialise in paying for security audits for open source projects like Matrix).  Unlike other Double Ratchet audits (e.g. Signal), we also insisted that the end report was publicly released for complete transparency and to show the whole world the status of the implementation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/matrix-olm-cryptographic-review/">NCC Group have released the public report today</a> - it's pretty hardcore, but if you're into the details please go check it out.  The version of libolm assessed was v1.3.0, and the report found 1 high risk issue, 1 medium risk, 6 low risk and 1 informational issues - of which 3 were in Olm and 6 in Megolm.  Two of these (‘Lack of Backward Secrecy in Group Chats' and ‘Weak Forward Secrecy in Group Chats') are actually features of the library which power the ‘configurable privacy per-room' behaviour mentioned a few paragraphs above - and it's up to the application (e.g. matrix-js-sdk) to correctly configure privacy-sensitive rooms with the appropriate level of backward or forward secrecy; the library doesn't enforce it however.  The most interesting findings were probably the fairly exotic Unknown Key Share attacks in both Megolm and Olm - check out NCC-Olm2016-009 and NCC-Olm2016-010 in the report for gory details!</p>
<p>Needless to say all of these issues have been solved with the release of libolm 2.0.0 on October 25th and included in today's releases of the client SDKs and Riot.  Most of the issues have been solved at the application layer (i.e. matrix-js-sdk, ios-sdk and android-sdk) rather than in libolm itself.  Given the assessment was specifically for libolm, this means that technically the risks still exist at libolm, but given the correct engineering choice was to fix them in the application layer we went and did it there. (This is explains why the report says that some of the issues are ‘not fixed' in libolm itself).</p>
<p>Huge thanks to Alex Balducci and Jake Meredith at NCC Group for all their work on the assessment - it was loads of fun to be working with them (over Matrix, of course) and we're really happy that they caught some nasty edge cases which otherwise we'd have missed.  And thanks again to Dan Meredith and Chad Hurley at OTF for funding it and making it possible!</p>
<p>Implementing decentralised E2E has been by far the hardest thing we've done yet in Matrix, ending up involving most of the core team.  Huge kudos go to: Mark Haines for writing the original Olm and matrix-js-sdk implementation and devising Megolm, designing attachment encryption and implementing it in matrix-{'{'}js,react{'}'}-sdk, Richard van der Hoff for taking over this year with implementing and speccing Megolm, finalising libolm, adding all the remaining server APIs (device management and to_device management for 1:1 device Olm sessions), writing the <a href=" http://matrix.org/docs/guides/e2e_implementation.html">Implementor's Guide</a>, handling the NCC assessment, and pulling together all the strands to land the final implementation in matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk.  Meanwhile on Mobile, iOS &amp; Android wouldn't have happened without Emmanuel Rohée, who led the development of E2E in matrix-ios-sdk and <a href="http://matrix.org/git/olm/log/?h=olmkit">OLMKit</a> (the iOS wrappers for libolm based on the <a href="https://github.com/chrisballinger/OLMKit">original work by Chris Ballinger</a> at <a href="https://chatsecure.org/">ChatSecure</a> - many thanks to Chris for starting the ball rolling there!), Pedro Contreiras and Yannick Le Collen for doing all the Android work, Guillaume Foret for all the application layer iOS work and helping coordinate all the mobile work, and Dave Baker who got pulled in at the last minute to rush through encrypted attachments on iOS (thanks Dave!).  Finally, eternal thanks to everyone in the wider community who's patiently helped us test the E2E whilst it's been in development in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#megolm:matrix.org">#megolm:matrix.org</a>; and to Moxie, Trevor and <a href="https://whispersystems.org">Open Whisper Systems</a> for inventing the Double Ratchet and for allowing us to write our own implementation in Olm.</p>
<p>It's literally the beginning for end-to-end encryption in Matrix, and we're unspeakably excited to see where it goes.  More now than ever before the world needs an open communication platform that combines the freedom of decentralisation with strong privacy guarantees, and we hope this is a major step in the right direction.</p>
<p>-- Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix team.</p>
