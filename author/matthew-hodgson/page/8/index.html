                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We're delighted to announce that our friends at <a href="https://status.im">Status</a> have made a major strategic investment ($5M) in New Vector: the company which currently employs most of the Matrix.org core team.  This means that we now have the financial backing to let us focus entirely on improving the Matrix ecosystem and getting the protocol out of beta… and beyond!!</p>
<p><a href="https://status.im"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2941" style="position: relative; right: 25px;" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/LOGO_status_v5_1020x290-300x85.png" alt="" width="300" height="85" /></a><a href="https://matrix.org"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2944" style="position: relative; left: 25px; top: 7px;" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/matrix-logo-1-300x128.png" alt="" width="225" height="96" /></a></p>
<p>First up - massive, massive thanks to everyone who has supported us over the last 6 months since our <a href="/blog/2017/07/07/a-call-to-arms-supporting-matrix/">funding situation changed</a>: as of the end of 2017 we had enough Patreon / Liberapay / IBAN / BTC / ETH donations and sponsorship (for Matrix.org) and enough paid consulting work (for New Vector) that we've been able to keep almost the whole core team working on Matrix as their day job.  Simply: the core Matrix team could not have continued in its current form without the support of the community - so we will be forever indebted to everyone who has supported us: especially all our donating supporters on Patreon/Liberapay/etc, our customers at New Vector, and our big $ sponsors, including <a href="https://www.upcloud.com/">UpCloud.com</a> (who provide <em>incredible</em> hosting for Matrix.org), <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">PrivateInternetAccess.com</a>, <a href="http://inblockchain.com/">INBlockchain.com</a>, <a href="http://omg.omise.co">OmiseGO</a> and <a href="https://tendermint.com">Tendermint</a>.</p>
<p>The investment from <a href="https://status.im">Status</a> that we're announcing today is a massive step change as it gives us the resources to grow the team and to focus fully on Matrix's key problem areas without distractions (whilst still supporting paid New Vector work). Please note that donations are still <b>very</b> appreciated however: we are in the process of setting up the Matrix.org Foundation (at last!) as the non-profit target for all future donations, such that Matrix itself has a financial means to support pure Matrix work independently of any other companies (including New Vector).</p>
<p>Many folks will be familiar with Status already as one of the leading projects in the <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> ecosystem: building a beautiful usability-focused browser for decentralised apps (DApps) which run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine - as well as providing cryptocurrency payments and chat functionality (via the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper">Whisper</a> protocol).  It effectively lets users access Ethereum as a usable meaningful operating system - a bit like how Riot attempts to be a flagship ‘browser' for the Matrix ecosystem.  The reason Status is investing in Matrix is primarily to accelerate decentralisation technology and open protocols in general - and also because there are some pretty obvious advantages to the collaboration, potentially including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bridging between Matrix and Whisper (Ethereum's own real-time communication protocol) - exposing all of the Matrix ecosystem into Ethereum and vice versa</li>
<li>Bundling up Status DApps as Matrix Widgets</li>
<li>Exposing Matrix Widgets into Status</li>
<li>Supporting Olm/Megolm such that it could be used for E2E encryption in Status</li>
<li>Collaboration on the decentralised reputation systems needed to combat abuse in both Matrix &amp; Ethereum</li>
<li>Utilize the <a href="https://status.im/whitepaper.pdf">Status Network token</a> within Riot.im by enabling crypto assets.</li>
<li>...and more!</li>
</ul>
<p>We've spent a lot of time working with Status over the last few months whilst arranging this partnership, and we've been really impressed by Jarrad and Carl and the team (they even have their own golang <a href="https://github.com/status-im/doubleratchet">Double Ratchet Implementation</a>!).  It's fair to say that Status are very much aligned with Matrix's vision, and the projects and can help each other a lot.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that Status and Matrix are really quite complementary: Whisper (as used by Status) is entirely p2p and focuses on protecting metadata and is tightly coupled to Ethereum, whereas Matrix is standalone and more feature rich but currently lacks metadata protection.  We both have fledgling app ecosystems; Matrix through Widgets and Status through Ethereum DApps. That said, Matrix and Status are going to continue on their own paths, and Matrix will of course remain controlled by Matrix.org - but we are looking forward to learning more about each other's tech and driving decentralisation forward in general!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the core Matrix side, the investment lets us focus immediately on the following priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Improving Riot's usability. As of today we are urgently hiring for a Lead Designer to join the team fulltime to revamp and address Riot's usability issues, as this is one of the single biggest things getting in the way of Matrix uptake today.  Hit up <a href="mailto:jobs@riot.im">jobs@riot.im</a> if you're interested!</b></li>
<li><b>At the same time, we're excited to ramp up our investment in Riot's performance and overall polish (as well as achieving feature parity with Slack/Discord and friends) - that means we're looking for React, Android &amp; iOS folks to join the core team full-time asap to take the apps to the next level.  Again, <a href="mailto:jobs@riot.im">jobs@riot.im</a> if this sounds like you!</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Getting End-to-end Encryption out of beta.</b> We know what we need to do to push E2E out of beta (incremental key backup; cross-signing devices; improved device verification) - Status' investment means we can build the team to get it done! Decentralised end-to-end encryption is not for the faint-hearted, but if you're up for the challenge please get in touch at <a href="mailto:jobs@matrix.org">jobs@matrix.org</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Finishing Dendrite.</b> Dendrite (our next-gen golang homeserver implementation) is a hugely ambitious project and right now the only folks working on it are Rich and Erik… who also happen to be supporting Synapse too.  The good news is that the community has been helping considerably with Dendrite, but it would be even better if we had more people supported to work on it full time.  If you love Go, and you love massively scalable decentralised systems, please hit up <a href="mailto:jobs@matrix.org">jobs@matrix.org</a>!
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Supporting Synapse.</b>There is massive scope for performance improvements to Synapse, and there are thousands of deployments out there today, so we really want to improve support for Synapse.  If you love Python and Twisted, and interesting performance/profiling and efficiency work, please hit up <a href="mailto:jobs@matrix.org">jobs@matrix.org</a> too!
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><b>Maintaining the Spec.</b> If Matrix is anything it is the spec, and maintenance of the spec is key to the project's success. In 2018 we intend to invest heavily in its maintenance and address outstanding API proposals, documenting APIs, not to mention updating the general technical documentation (guides, FAQ etc) on Matrix.org in general.  If you are a developer who loves spec work, we need you over at <a href="mailto:jobs@matrix.org">jobs@matrix.org</a> immediately! :)
</li>
</ul>
Beyond these immediate priorities, we have a long feature roadmap lined up too (highest priority first): Reactions, Message Editing, improved Widgets (e.g. Sticker Packs), Threading, Decentralised Accounts, Decentralised Identity, Decentralised Reputation, Peer-to-peer Matrix and more.  However, right now our focus has to be on improving the quality and stability of what we have today and getting it out of beta before we open yet more battlefronts.  In other words: we're not adding more features (modulo emergencies) until the current features are polished!
<p>So: exciting times ahead!  Never before has Matrix had the resources to fully realise its potential, and we'd like to say enormous thanks to Carl, Jarrad, Yessin and Nabil at Status for their patience and support while sorting out the investment.  We'd also like to say thanks to everyone else who offered us investment: in the end we had several viable offers on the table - and we owe sincere thanks to those who invested the time and faith to make an offer which we've ended up turning down.</p>
<p>For now, however, it's back to work: making Riot slicker than Slack; making Synapse go faster and use less RAM; making Dendrite federate; making E2E encryption transparent and indestructible; making sure that it's possible to implement Matrix purely by referring to the Spec.</p>
<p>2018 is going to be an interesting year indeed :)  Thank you all for supporting Matrix - and thanks, once again, to Status for helping to take us to the next level.</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole team.</p>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Since we began Matrix it's been a sort of tradition to do a huge update on Christmas Eve to reflect on the past year and tease the future - you can check out the <a href="/blog/2016/12/26/the-matrix-holiday-special-2016-edition/">2016 edition</a> or the <a href="/blog/2015/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-special/">2015 edition</a> and a sort of <a href="/blog/2015/01/07/synapse-0-6-1-released-and-other-news/">proto-update for 2014</a> too if you're feeling nostalgic.  This year I'm going to try to keep it short though, as I'm hoping to write a Very Big Update related to long-term-funding progress in the relatively near future.</p>
<p>2017 has been a weird year for us: progress in the core team has been relatively badly impacted by the mission to secure long-term funding, with myself (Matthew) &amp; Amandine spending the vast majority of our time handling the meta-problem of keeping the core team secure rather than actually working on the project itself.  Meanwhile we've lost a few of the original team during the disruption, which has particularly impacted Spec, E2E and Dendrite progress (such are the risks of running a very lean team in the first place!).  However, against the odds, we have (hopefully) prevailed - and this is almost <strong>entirely</strong> due to the massive support we've seen through donations via <a href="https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a>, <a href="https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg">Liberapay</a>, Ethereum, Bitcoin and <a href="https://paypal.me/matrixdotorg">PayPal</a>, and some much-appreciated paid consulting work.</p>
<p>Simply put, without the donation support we would have not been able to pay the core team over the last 3 months, and we would not be able to pay for the legal costs of setting up the team as an independent company, and we would be completely screwed for securing large-scale long-term funding if we couldn't point to the community's support as evidence that Matrix is worthy of funding.  So: we sincerely owe our thanks to those who heeded the <a href="/blog/2017/07/07/a-call-to-arms-supporting-matrix/">call to arms</a> and are supporting us.  We've also been pretty lucky in benefiting from the skyrocketing value of Ethereum and Bitcoin donations.  And even if/when long-term funding is secured for New Vector (the company we formed in July to hire the core team), donations will continue to be vital to support the Matrix.org Foundation itself as an independent non-profit entity - as it's obviously not in Matrix.org's interests to be entirely financially dependent on New Vector.  Hopefully this whole episode will end up being a bit like a <a href="http://www.startrek.com/article/john-trimbles-contribution-to-saving-star-trek">Save Star Trek</a> scenario - where something fun and amazing almost gets almost wiped out when it's only a few years old due to corporate factors... only for the community to band together to save it, and then for it to go from strength to strength for the next 50 years or more! :D</p>
<p>That said, we've made some major progress this year anyway: the addition of Widgets to Matrix; the addition of Communities (aka Groups) and Flair; major improvements to E2E encryption (even though it's not out of beta yet); lots of progress on Dendrite (the minimum-viable phase 1 is now about 75% complete); switching everything over to Jitsi for group video conferencing; rewriting onboarding for Riot/Web; Antiscam/spam support for cryptocommunities; the whole VR proof-of-concept of Matrix+WebVR+WebRTC video and voip calling; Version 0.3 of the Matrix spec; and a whole lot more which I'm probably forgetting right now.  And meanwhile the community has been more active than ever, with major new clients like <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">Nheko</a> hitting the scene with a large and loyal community of open source contributors (over the last few weeks I've literally seen more nheko PRs fly past than Riot ones!) - and we've also been <em>incredibly</em> glad of community contributions towards Dendrite.  Dendrite is already way ahead of Synapse in terms of % community contributed code - we have hope that it will end up being a model FOSS project :)</p>
<p>So what lies ahead?  It's hard to predict the level of progress we're going to make in the core team, as it really depends on long-term funding.  Whatever happens, one of our top priorities is to improve our governance so that everyone can better contribute in places that have historically been more blocked on the core team (i.e. the spec; synapse)... whilst still maintaining coherency across the project.  Ideally we'll end up with more folks pushing Matrix forwards from both the wider world and the core team however, and right now the main priorities are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Phase 2 of Communities: letting users filter their current view of Matrix to rooms associated with a given subset of communities (if desired), for Slack/Discord-style semantics</li>
 	<li>Fixing the remaining end-to-end encryption failures (although the majority of them have now been solved)</li>
 	<li>Finalising proper UI/UX for end-to-end encryption (at last), including the option to transparently back up your room keys if desired.</li>
 	<li>Dendrite Phase 1</li>
 	<li>Performance in Riot (on all platforms)</li>
 	<li>Editable messages</li>
 	<li>Reactions</li>
 	<li>Making widgets much more useful</li>
 	<li>Paid integrations and hosting options to help avoid further funding nightmares.</li>
</ul>
Looking at the bigger picture, what we'd really love for 2018 would be to finally get to a 1.0 release of the Matrix Spec (i.e. catching up on our massive backlog of merging unstable spec drafts & proposals into the spec) - and for Dendrite to start to replace Synapse as the reference home server from Matrix.org and become really ubiquitous, and for E2E encryption be turned on by default in private rooms.  Beyond the above list, we don't really have any other features urgently planned (threading, for instance, is on hold until we have the rest of the above sorted) - but we believe that if we stabilise everything we have today (plus that list), then there is no reason for Matrix to not fulfil its full potential as a true global open decentralised communications standard.  And then it's on to threading, P2P matrix, decentralised reputation and all that good stuff!
<p>It's going to be a crazy year ahead, either way: so thank you, once again, for supporting Matrix - whether that's financially, or by contributing code, or running a server, or just using the protocol as a user.  We literally wouldn't be here without you!! :)</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole core team.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Today is a crazy release day here - not only do we have Synapse 0.25, but we've also made a formal release of the Matrix Specification (CS API) for the first time in 16 months!</p>
<h3 id="matrix-cs-api-0-3">Matrix CS API 0.3</h3>
<p>Talking first about the spec update: the workflow of the Matrix spec is that new experimental features get added to an /unstable API prefix, and then whenever we release the Matrix spec, these get moved over to being part of the /r0 prefix (or whatever version we happen to be on).  We've been <strong>very</strong> constrained on manpower to work on the spec over the last ~18 months, but we've been keeping it up-to-date on a best effort basis, with a bit of help from the wider community.  <b> </b>As such, this latest release does not contain all the latest APIs (and certainly not experimental ones like Groups/Communities which are still evolving), but it does release all of the unstable ones which we've managed to document and which are considered stable enough to become part of the 'r0' prefix.  Going forwards, we're hoping that the wider community will help us fill in the remaining gaps (i.e. propose PRs against the matrix-org/matrix-doc repository to formalise the various spec drafts flying around the place) - and we're also hoping (if/when funding crisis is abated) to locate full-time folk to work on the spec.</p>
<p>The full changelog for 0.3 of the spec is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
 	<li>Breaking changes:
<ul>
 	<li>Change the rule kind of <cite>.m.rule.contains_display_name</cite> from <cite>underride</cite> to <cite>override</cite>. This works with all known clients which support push rules, but any other clients implementing the push rules API should be aware of this change. This makes it simple to mute rooms correctly in the API (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/373">#373</a>).</li>
 	<li>Remove <tt class="docutils literal">/tokenrefresh</tt> from the API (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/395">#395</a>).</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
...and you can read the spec itself of course over at <a href="/docs/spec">https://matrix.org/docs/spec</a>.  It's worth noting that we have slightly bent the rules by including three very minor 'breaking changes' in 0.3, but all for features which to our knowledge nobody is depending on in the wild.  Technically this should mean bumping the major version prefix (i.e. moving to r1), but given how minor and nonimpacting these are we're turning a blind eye this time.
<h3 id="meanwhile-synapse-0-25-is-out">Meanwhile, Synapse 0.25 is out!</h3>
<p>This is a medium-sized release; the main thing being to support configurable room visibility within groups (so that whenever you add a room to a group, you're not forced into sharing their existence with the general public, but can choose to just tell group members about them).  There's also a bunch of useful bug fixes and some performance improvements, including lots of contributions from the community this release (thank you!).  Full release notes are:</p>

<p>If you haven't noticed already, Riot/Web 0.13 is out today, as is Riot/iOS 0.6.2 and Riot/Android 0.7.4.  These contain massive improvements across the board - particularly mainstream Communities support at last on Riot/Web; CallKit/PushKit on Riot/iOS thanks to Denis Morozov (GSoC 2017 student for Matrix) and Share Extension on iOS thanks to Aram Sargsyan (also GSoC 2017 student!); and End-to-end Key Sharing on Riot/Android and a full rewrite of the VoIP calling subsystem on Android.</p>
<p>Rather than going on about it here, though, there's a <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/communities-aka-groups-are-here-announcing-riot-web-0-13-riot-ios-0-6-and-riot-android-0-7-4-933cb193a28e">full write-up over on the Riot Blog.</a></p>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Synapse 0.24 is out (currently at 0.24.1)! This is a pretty big release as it includes initial support for Groups, also known as Communities (UI for which is landing currently on Riot/Web and later Riot/Mobile). Groups let you associate together a set of users and rooms, letting you define a community - e.g. <a href="https://riot.im/develop/#/group/+matrix:matrix.org">+matrix:matrix.org</a> is the community of the core Matrix project itself (whose users are the core Matrix.org team, and whose public rooms are the rooms we officially manage/moderate as Matrix.org).  We'll yell more about Groups once the UI is ready for action in the near future, but the good news is that Synapse should be ready to go (although the API is still fairly experimental and very much evolving).</p>
<p>Other stuff worth calling out in this release includes: massive performance improvements on receiving federation traffic (we now process federation traffic for different rooms in parallel); fixing a major cause of performance issues (caused when processing spurious events for rooms you've actually left); modularising and improving the the spamchecker; @room notification support; backup media repository support; and finally the ability to autojoin new users to a set of rooms on the server!</p>
<p>You can get the latest release from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases">Github</a> as usual; have fun - and thanks for flying Matrix :)</p>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>On October 19th (next Thursday, as of the time of writing) we're going to be back in Berlin for various meetings - and we're incredibly excited that <a href="http://blueyard.com/">BlueYard</a> have offered to host the world's first ever official <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/matrix-and-friends-tickets-38729041606">Matrix and Decentralised Communications Meetup</a> at their offices in Kreuzberg!  Matthew, Amandine and maybe others will be attending and speaking from the core team, and giving a VIP tour of the long-long-long-awaited Groups/Communities features in Matrix and Riot as well as some of the other good stuff in the pipeline - and we're also excited to have Exul joining us from the community to talk about his recent <a href="https://github.com/exul/matrix-rocketchat">Matrix&lt;-&gt;Rocket.Chat</a> bridging adventures.  We're also expecting some exciting folks to join us from the Ethereum community to talk about decentralised realtime comms in their ecosystem - plus if anyone wants to talk about other Matrix/XMPP/Tox/Briar/Richochet or similar projects please ping us and let us know asap!</p>
<p><b>Update: we're excited to announce that <a href="https://twitter.com/jFransham">Jack Fransham</a> from <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> (who are <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#polkadot-watercooler:matrix.org">very active</a> Riot/Matrix users - and just raised &gt;$130M in their token generation event yesterday) will also be joining us to tell us all about how Polkadot bridges together different blockchains!</b>. (The original speaker was Marek Kotewicz, but availability didn't work out).</p>

<p><b>Update 2: and our final speaker is confirmed as Maximilian Möhring, CEO of <a href="https://keyp.io/">Keyp</a>, who's going to talk about their self-sovereign decentralised identity system.</b></p>

<p>As a taster: the official video of our massive talk from the ETHLDN meetup a few weeks ago was just released (see below).  The meetup in Berlin will have different content and be more free-form, letting folks ask their own questions and steer the conversation and discussion as you see fit: so please come hang out in person, grab pizza and beer courtesy of BlueYard, and find the answers to all the deepest Matrix questions you never knew you even had...!</p>
<p>See you next week! :D</p>

                <p>We've just released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.23.0">Synapse 0.23</a> - which contains a bunch of significant performance improvements, bug and stability fixes - as well as a few new features: basic spam checking (the ability to configure your homeserver to reject events which match arbitrary rules, both from users and other servers) - and long-awaited support for privacy-preserving ('event_id_only') push notifications.  This means that apps can choose to register themselves to receive push notifications which do <em>not</em> contain any information about the actual push, but instead act as a simple &quot;wake up!&quot; event, which triggers the app to then sync via the client-server API in order to display the actual push notification details.  This is particularly useful for push notifications for E2E encrypted rooms, as it means the client has a chance of decrypting the message in order to display the push notification details in the UI (if the user wants that).  matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk are in the process of being moved over to use the new 'event_id_only' push format.</p>
<p>Long-awaited Communities/Groups will land in Synapse 0.24, which should come quite soon (we're almost ready to merge it to develop, but it's a major update so we wanted to get 0.23 out the door first).</p>
<p>As always, you can get your latest Synapse from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a> or a OS repository of your choice (we've just released the official Debian packages).</p>

                <p>Occasionally folks ask why we don't update the blog more often - we're infamous in only doing big formal updates once every 3 months, unless there's something very specific to yell about.  However, it's possible that some readers don't realise that we have been publishing a weekly status update blog since July - albeit a video blog: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl5dnxRMP1hXZJtaE1Q3_ztrfIMJgrgZM">Matrix Live</a>!  The episodes are published on YouTube (for now, although in future we're going to use Matrix to distribute them), and are first made available to Quadratic ($5+) Patreon supporters.  After a week we make them public to everyone though and add them to the YouTube Playlist.  The videos also have very brief bullet-point summaries of the contents in the description for those who don't have time to watch and just want to skim for interesting stuff.</p>
<p>We appreciate that video blogs are unusual for a FOSS project relative to written blogs - but we've chosen to go down this path because counterintuitively it takes much less time to just speak about what's going on than write it down; for whatever reason my blogposts always seem to take hours to write as I get sucked into the details and try to be as comprehensive and accurate as possible.  Whereas just chatting about it with Amandine is much easier, and given that we do it anyway; why not film it for everyone's benefit?  We always film the show in one continuous take (hence the &quot;live&quot;), so it's literally only eating 10-15 mins out of our week.</p>
<p>Eitherway, just wanted to remind anyone who reads this blog that the video blog exists, and to gently encourage folks to donate at <a href="https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg">Liberapay</a> if they want to get access to the videos on the day they air, rather than having to wait for a week!  Finally, we'd suggest that folks subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl5dnxRMP1hXZJtaE1Q3_ztrfIMJgrgZM">playlist</a> itself on YouTube even if they don't donate, so they can be reminded about new eps.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here's an alarming montage of Matthew &amp; Amandine geeking about Matrix, in case you've missed the show so far!</p>

                <p><strong><em>TL;DR: If you love FOSS-friendly hardware and if you love Matrix, please <a href="https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/">preorder a Purism Librem5 Matrix-native smartphone</a>, so we can fully bring native Matrix communication to both phones and desktop!</em></strong></p>
<p>It's been just over a month since Purism announced the campaign to fund the <a href="/blog/2017/08/24/the-librem-5-from-purism-a-matrix-native-smartphone/">Matrix-native Librem5 FOSS smartphone</a> - and the campaign is doing pretty well, with 54% of its target reached as of the time of writing!  So in a shameless attempt to whet everyone's appetite and <a href="https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/">encourage everyone to fund the remaining 50%</a>, we thought we'd share some of the experiments we've been doing with running native Matrix clients on a pure Linux phone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Librem5 doesn't exist yet, but we do happen to have an <a href="https://store.bq.com/en/ubuntu-edition-e5/">BQ Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Phone</a> hanging around - so we wondered: Is it possible to run a native desktop Matrix client like mujx's <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">Nheko</a> on a Linux phone, given all the latest Qt voodoo? And just how hard is it anyway to update the Qt platform abstractions (or GTK for that matter) for a given platform?  In retrospect, we probably should have just run <a href="https://github.com/LarreaMikel/uMatriks">uMatriks</a> on it - a proper dedicated Ubuntu Touch Matrix Client, but then we wouldn't have had a useful tour of maintaining the guts of a Qt distribution on mobile :)</p>
<p>So the core problem of running a client like Nheko on Ubuntu Touch is that it uses lots of fun glossy stuff from Qt 5.9, whereas Ubuntu Touch is still on Qt 5.4, which is over 2 years old now.  Also, it's been written as a desktop client so needs a bit of tuning to support a 'fat-finger' mobile form factor, although this is just a simple matter of programming and is a very similar problem to ensuring the desktop app has a nice responsive design on small screen window sizes (similar to how the telegram desktop client handles it).  In the end, we focused on solving the Qt problem: building a custom Qt 5.9 for <a href="https://ubports.com">Ubports</a> (the community project who do a fantastic job of continuing Ubuntu Touch development since Canonical pulled out), while for simplicity building it on top of the current ubports distribution (which is effectively still Ubuntu 15.04).  The reason for all this Ubuntu stuff rather than using PureOS is simply that it's not far enough along, and we don't physically have a Librem5 dev kit yet to play with!</p>
<p>In practice, this has been a fascinating process: setting up a crosscompiler to build all of Qt5.9, and then porting the ubuntumirclient Qt Platform Abstraction to work with Qt5.9, as well as (finally) working out how to build a Qt5.9-compatible custom Maliit input context platform plugin to get the onscreen keyboard (OSK) up and running.  But we got there in the end, and it was rather fun to finally see the Nheko splash screen popping up on the Aquaris E5! :D</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2833" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nheko1-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="432" height="768" />
<p>There was then a bit of a nightmare to get the OSK to work, thanks to<a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-46009"> https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-46009</a> causing the plugin to be silently not updated - but could then log in and the app worked great (albeit a bit slow thanks to being a debug build on the energy-efficient but slow Mediatek MT6582 SoC):</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-2834" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screenshot20170928_131924004-576x1024.png" alt="" width="288" height="512" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-2835" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screenshot20170928_132210382-576x1024.png" alt="" width="288" height="512" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-2836" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screenshot20170928_131057113-576x1024.png" alt="" width="288" height="512" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-2837" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screenshot20170928_132238278-576x1024.png" alt="" width="288" height="512" /></div>
Now the next step here would obviously be to tweak the app properly to layout on a phone (bigger fonts; bigger buttons; resize the window to make room for the OSK; separate the Left Panel from the timeline view; etc) - but the point here was more to show a fully fledged native Matrix client running on a current Linux Phone environment and see how it feels.  And we're happy to say that it leaves us dying to get our hands on a proper Librem5 so we can work with Nheko, uMatriks, libqmatrixclient and all the other native Matrix client projects to see how we can get the best possible native client experience running in PureOS for the phone!!
<p>Finally, there doesn't seem to be much documentation out there on how to do a heavy customisation of Ubports like this, so for the sake of posterity, here's the guide if anyone else is crazy enough to try this (or for when Ubports gets around to doing an official update to Qt 5.9 for their OS!).  A versioned copy of this lives over at <a href="https://gist.github.com/ara4n/4a4076b8fd5a61153bde6c9a0a726c72">this gist</a>.</p>

<h3 id="recipe-librem5-experiments-with-an-ubuntu-phone-and-nheko">Recipe: Librem5 experiments with an Ubuntu Phone and Nheko</h3>
<p>Starting point: one old BQ Aquaris E5 ubuntu phone, running some old version of Ubuntu Touch which had got completely stuck (UI only unfreezing for 2-3 seconds every 2-3 minutes).</p>
<p>Step one: flash to latest UBPorts image:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Set up Ubuntu desktop as a host (as per <a href="https://docs.ubuntu.com/phone/en/devices/installing-ubuntu-for-devices">https://docs.ubuntu.com/phone/en/devices/installing-ubuntu-for-devices</a>)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-device-flash
sudo apt-get install phablet-tools
</code></pre>
<ul>
 	<li>Grab an adb-compatible recovery image (yes, seems like the right place is someone's personal webspace...)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>wget http://people.canonical.com/~jhm/barajas/recovery-vegetahd.img
</code></pre>
<ul>
 	<li>If your Ubuntu desktop is running in a VM, make sure you have USB 2.0 or 3.0 support enabled (in Virtualbox this needs the extension pack installed). USB 1 is too slow and the flash will timeout, semi-bricking the phone.</li>
 	<li>Press volume-up and power on the phone during boot to get at the bootloader. Make sure it's not plugged into USB</li>
 	<li>Select fastboot</li>
 	<li>Plug into USB</li>
 	<li>Flash the recovery image and latest UBPorts OS:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo ubuntu-device-flash --server=http://system-image.ubports.com touch --device=vegetahd \\
                         --channel=15.04/stable --bootstrap --recovery-image=recovery-vegetahd.img \\
                         --developer-mode --password=secret
</code></pre>
<ul>
 	<li>Ensure the system OS is writable. (Ubuntu Touch runs the OS partition read-only by default to protect users. In this case, you can always re-flash it if all goes wrong.)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo phablet-config writable-image
</code></pre>
<ul>
 	<li>Get an SSH server running on the phone before you go insane</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>adb shell
sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start # password is as set when flashing.
</code></pre>
Step two: cross-compile latest Qt 5.9 for the phone.
<p>Ubuntu 15.04 shipped with 5.4, which is pretty old now, and too old for nheko. Based on <a href="https://rm5248.com/cross-compile-qt-for-arm/">https://rm5248.com/cross-compile-qt-for-arm/</a></p>

<pre><code># make sure you have a manifest.json, nheko.png, nheko.apparmor and nheko.desktop.
# If you don't have an icon, the app won't show up.

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks there's been a huge movement in the cryptocurrency communities over needing to find a better communication medium than Slack.  Some of the biggest communities for projects like <a href="https://status.im">Status</a>, <a href="https://aragon.one">Aragon</a>, <a href="http://www.tenx.tech/">TenX</a>, <a href="https://www.tezos.com/">Tezos</a>, <a href="https://omg.omise.co/">OmiseGo</a>, <a href="http://polkadot.network">Polkadot</a> and many others are getting overrun by phishing attacks where malicious users have set up bots which auto-DM users joining the room in order to try to extract private keys to steal funds.  Slack has very limited support for avoiding this sort of abuse (especially at the free service tiers), so the <a href="https://github.com/aragon/governance/issues/7">search is on</a> for an alternative solution.  There seems to be some confusion over what Matrix &amp; Riot can and can't do to help the situation, so we thought we'd write a blog post about it (especially after we <a href="http://www.trustnodes.com/2017/09/14/matrix-demo-steals-show-ethereum-london-conference-meetup">had so much fun</a> at the ETHLDN meetup last week!).</p>
<p>To be clear: we see Ethereum, Bitcoin, Ripple, Stellar and all the other decentralised currencies as being very closely related to Matrix.  Just as distributed ledgers disrupt the fragmented oligopoly old-school banking industry, we want Matrix to disrupt the relatively old-school communications systems of today. And so we'd really rather like that Matrix and Riot rocked when it comes to supporting cryptocurrency communities, and this is something we intend to dedicate resources to long term: we've got some big plans.</p>
<h3 id="things-matrix-provides">Things Matrix provides:</h3>
<p><strong>Decentralisation</strong>. Rather than each community having its own silo, with users having to juggle accounts over all of them, Matrix decentralises rooms over all the different servers. Users can have a single account and still jump into all the other communities (as well as the rest of the Matrix universe). However, each community can run its own server instance (if they want to) and have complete control over its behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Encryption</strong>. Matrix has <a href="/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last/">first-class end-to-end encryption</a> (although the UX in Riot needs refinement and is technically still beta).  This is great for encrypting rooms which need privacy - although it does come at the expense of being able to do server-side content filtering, which is desirable for fixing phishing attacks. So you probably don't want to turn on encryption for rooms which need phish filtering (or you could use a bot to decrypt and autoremove malicious content).</p>
<p><strong>A standard real-time API.</strong> One bit of feedback we've heard recently is that “Riot has no realtime API”.  This is spectacularly untrue; Riot is a client for the Matrix protocol, which is in and of itself an open standard realtime API for messaging, which you can use for writing whatever bots and extensions your heart desires.</p>
<p><strong>Finely grained permissions per room.</strong> Likewise there seems to be some confusion over Matrix's access control model.  In Matrix, each user in a room has a ‘power level' - typically a number between 0 and 100.  By convention, normal users who have just joined the room have 0; the room creator and ‘admins' have 100; and ‘moderators' have 50.  Pretty much every access you can do in a room then has a threshold which defines how much power a user needs to perform the action.  It doesn't get much more finely grained than this!</p>
<p><strong>Ability to disable DMs and room invites.</strong> Architecturally Matrix lets you prevent users who use a given server from receiving invites (the homeserver can just autoreject the invites, based on some set of rules). <del>We're currently putting together a quick demo to show this off in the Synapse server implementation, but it boils down to having an option to cancel invites <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/5a7f561a9bff5163ce7fce719eea083cdd0eabd9/synapse/handlers/federation.py#L1066">here</a> (federated) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/e5ae386ea4112ec91b47de339a3c8a4e034898c0/synapse/handlers/room_member.py#L243">here</a> (local).</del>
Check out the demo below!</p>
<p><strong>Ability to filter content.</strong> Similarly, Matrix architecturally lets a given server filter out messages based on content or some other pattern from being received by its users. <del>We're also putting together a demo of this too in Synapse, which boils down to redacting inappropriate events <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/e5ae386ea4112ec91b47de339a3c8a4e034898c0/synapse/federation/federation_base.py#L119">here</a> (federated) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/e5ae386ea4112ec91b47de339a3c8a4e034898c0/synapse/handlers/message.py#L239">here</a> (local). The demo isn't quite ready yet but we'll update this &amp; yell when it is.</del>
Check out the demo below!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/2457">DM/invite disabling</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/2456">spam/phish filtering</a> code has now landed on the develop branch of Synapse, and we've deployed an demo example of it at <a href="https://phishfree.riot.im">https://phishfree.riot.im</a>.  Messages containing the word 'SPAM' are filtered, and invites are disabled (unless you are the local server admin).</p>
<p><strong>Other stuff.</strong> Matrix and Riot give loads of other fun stuff too:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Widgets - the ability to embed arbitrary apps into your rooms (video conferences; currency tickers; DApps; wallets; monitoring dashboards; etc.).
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">100% Native clients on iOS & Android (including Jitsi video conferencing & Widgets, as of the develop branch!)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Read receipts! (how can you live without them on Slack?!)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Internationalised to 20+ languages (thanks to the community! :)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="/blog/2017/03/11/how-do-i-bridge-thee-let-me-count-the-ways/">Bridges</a> through to IRC, Slack, Gitter, and more.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">All sorts of alternative clients (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a>, <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">quaternion</a>) and <a href="/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html">SDKs</a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Insanely scalable and performant next-generation server (
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>) on the horizon
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">An <a href="/docs/spec">open spec</a> for the protocol.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">100% Apache-licensed FLOSS.  Riot/Web is particularly easy to hack on and theme & customise as needed.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Ability to disable federation for a room if you really want to lock it down to the users & rules of a single server.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things-we-need-to-improve">Things we need to improve:</h3>
<p>**Groups (aka Communities):  **One of the biggest missing features in Matrix is the ability to define groups of users &amp; rooms, similar to a Slack team or Discord server, which can be used to organise together a set of discussions and generally give a feeling of community.  We've been working hard at this and expect to see it land in Riot/Web in the next few weeks.  In the meanwhile, you can see some of the UX we're aiming for <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wv78GqgG59CLjIKPi7GGkdqI6KOeQUBl9Bnf-uA-Kc0/edit#heading=h.xravd1v7n60m">here</a>!</p>
<p>**E2E UX (and Riot UX in general):  **While the underlying encryption of Matrix is solid, the UX exposed by Riot needs considerable work - specifically to improve the device verification flow and automatically share keys between trusted devices.  We're continuing to work on this over the next few months.  Likewise there are <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/2984">many areas</a> for possible improvement in Riot's overall UX and design that we're working through as urgently as we can.</p>
<p><strong>Active Application Services</strong>: The per-server filtering described above is good if you just want to protect users on a given server (e.g. the server you point your community at).  However, if you want to filter all the messages for a given room which may be federated over multiple servers, you need a way to define a centralised chokepoint to define the filtering rules.  Architecturally this is meant to be performed by an ‘Active Application Service' in Matrix, but we've not yet defined or implemented this API.  The idea for the room to define a list of services that messages are filtered through by all servers before they may be accepted for the room.  This would be the ideal solution to the phishing-filtering problem, but in practice filtering just local users (and perhaps disabling federation for particularly sensitive rooms or servers) is probably good enough for the immediate problem here.</p>
<p>Hope this provides some much-needed clarity to the debate! If there are other features cryptocurrency communities need to thrive please let us know, as we'd like to actively help to support decentralized communities.  
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev:matrix.org</a> is probably the best place for further questions :)</p>
<p>Finally: one thing that has come up a few times in this discussion has been “Matrix's funding crisis means they may not be here to stay”.  All I can say is that 
<strong>Matrix is here to stay</strong>. Even if the core team ended up just being Matthew hacking away by himself funded by <a href="https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a>/
<a href="https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg">Liberapay</a>, we have a large and passionate wider dev community who aren't going anywhere.  But more importantly (and not wishing to jinx it), in the last few weeks we have received offers of significant funding which may hopefully resolve the funding crisis for the foreseeable.  Nothing is signed yet, but watch this space, and meanwhile I strongly suggest betting on Matrix being here to stay!</p>
