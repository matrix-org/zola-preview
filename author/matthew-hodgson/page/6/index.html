                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We're very excited to officially welcome the KDE Community on to Matrix as they announce that <a href="https://dot.kde.org/2019/02/20/kde-adding-matrix-its-im-framework">KDE Community is officially adopting Matrix</a> as a chat platform, and kde.org now has an official Matrix homeserver!</p>
<p><a href="https://dot.kde.org/2019/02/20/kde-adding-matrix-its-im-framework"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4015" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kde-matrix-1-1024x355.png" alt="" width="653" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>You can see the full announcement and explanation over at <a href="https://dot.kde.org/2019/02/20/kde-adding-matrix-its-im-framework">https://dot.kde.org/2019/02/20/kde-adding-matrix-its-im-framework</a>.  It is fantastic to see one of the largest Free Software communities out there proactively adopting Matrix as an open protocol, open network and FOSS project, rather than drifting into a proprietary centralised chat system.  It's also really fun to see Riot 1.0 finally holding its own as a chat app against the proprietary alternatives!</p>
<p>This doesn't change the KDE rooms which exist in Matrix today or indeed the KDE Freenode IRC channels - so many of the KDE community were already using Matrix, all the rooms already exist and are already bridged to the right places.  All it means is that there's now a shiny new homeserver (powered by <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a>) on which KDE folk are welcome to grab an account if they want, rather than sharing the rather overloaded public matrix.org homeserver.  The rooms have been set up on the server to match their equivalent IRC channels - for instance, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#kde:kde.org">#kde:kde.org</a> is the same as #kde on Freenode; <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#kde-devel:kde.org">#kde-devel:kde.org</a> is the same as #kde-devel etc.  The rooms continue to retain their other aliases (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#kde:matrix.org">#kde:matrix.org</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#freenode_#kde:matrix.org">#freenode_#kde:matrix.org</a> etc) as before.</p>
<p>There's also a dedicated Riot/Web install up at <a href="https://webchat.kde.org">https://webchat.kde.org</a>, and instructions on connecting via other Matrix clients up at <a href="https://community.kde.org/Matrix">https://community.kde.org/Matrix</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-20-at-01.56.40.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4020" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-20-at-01.56.40-1024x898.png" alt="" width="832" height="730" /></a></p>
<p>This is great news for the Matrix ecosystem in general - and should be particularly welcome for Qt client projects like <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko-Reborn</a>, who may feel a certain affinity to KDE!</p>
<p>So: welcome, KDE!  Hope you have a great time, and please let us know how you get on, so we can make sure Matrix kicks ass for you :)</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We just got back from braving the snow in Brussels at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/">FOSDEM 2019</a> - Europe's biggest Open Source conference. I think it's fair to say we had an amazing time, with more people than ever before wanting to hang out and talk Matrix and discuss their favourite features (and bugs)!</p>
<p>The big news is that <strong>we released <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.0.html">r0.1 of Matrix's Server-Server API</a> </strong>late on Friday night - our first ever formal stable release of Matrix's Federation API, having addressed the core of the issues which have kept Federation in beta thus far. We'll go into more detail on this in a dedicated blog post, but this marks the first ever time that <strong>all</strong> of Matrix's APIs have had an official stable release.  All that remains before we declare Matrix out of beta is to release updates of the CS API (0.5) and possibly the IS API (0.2) and then we can formally declare the overall combination as Matrix 1.0 :D</p>
<p>We spoke about SS API r0.1 at length in <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/matrix_french_state/">our main stage FOSDEM talk </a>on Saturday - as well as showing off the Riot Redesign, the E2E Encryption Endgame and giving an update on the French Government deployment of Matrix and the focus it's given us on finally shipping Matrix 1.0! For those who weren't there or missed the livestream, here's the talk!  <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-01-FOSDEM-Matrix-1.0.pdf">Slides are available here</a>.</p>

<p>Then, on Sunday we had the opportunity to have a quick <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/matrix/">20 minute talk in the Real Time Comms dev room</a>, where we gave a tour of some of the work we've been doing recently to scale Matrix down to working on incredibly low bandwidth networks (100bps or less).  It's literally the opposite of the Matrix 1.0 / France talk in that it's a quick deep dive into a very specific problem area in Matrix - so, if you've been looking forward to Matrix finally having a better transport than HTTPS+JSON, here goes!  <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-03-FOSDEM-Low-Bandwidth.pdf">Slides are available here.</a></p>

<p>Huge thanks to everyone who came to the talks, and everyone who came to the stand or grabbed us for a chat! FOSDEM is an amazing way to be reminded in person that folks care about Matrix, and we've come away feeling more determined than ever to make Matrix as great as possible and provide a protocol+network which will replace the increasingly threatened proprietary communication silos. :)</p>
<p>Next up: Matrix 1.0...</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>It's that time again where we break out the mince pies and brandy butter (at least for those of us in the UK) and look back on the year to see how far Matrix has come, as well as anticipate what 2019 may bring!</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>It's fair to say that 2018 has been a pretty crazy year.  We have had one overriding goal: to take the <a href="/blog/2018/01/29/status-partners-up-with-new-vector-fueling-decentralised-comms-and-the-matrix-ecosystem/">funding</a> we received in January, stabilise and freeze the protocol and get it and the reference implementations out of beta and to a 1.0 - to provide a genuinely open and decentralised mainstream alternative to the likes of Slack, Discord, WhatsApp etc.  What's so crazy about that, you might ask?</p>
<p>Well, in parallel with this we've also seen adoption of Matrix accelerating ahead of our dev plan at an unprecedented speed: with France selecting Matrix to power the communication infrastructure of its whole public sector - first <a href="/blog/2018/04/26/matrix-and-riot-confirmed-as-the-basis-for-frances-secure-instant-messenger-app/">trialling over the summer</a>, and now <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1070392608801910784">confirmed for full roll-out</a> as of a few weeks ago.  Meanwhile there are several other similar-sized projects on the horizon which we can't talk about yet.  We've had the growing pains of establishing <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a> as a startup in order to hire the core team and support these projects.  We've launched <a href="https://modular.im">Modular</a> to provide professional-quality SaaS Matrix hosting for the wider community and help fund the team.  And most importantly, we've also been establishing the non-profit <a href="/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2/">Matrix.org Foundation</a> to formalise the open governance of the Matrix protocol and protect and isolate it from any of the for-profit work.</p>
<p>However: things have just about come together.  Almost all the spec work for 1.0 is done and we are now aiming to get a 1.0 released in time by the end of January (in time for FOSDEM).  Meanwhile Synapse has improved massively in terms of performance and stability (not least having migrated over to <a href="/blog/2018/12/21/porting-synapse-to-python-3/">Python 3</a>); Riot's spectacular redesign is now <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/redesign-experimenters-needed-afa7c2d4c858">available for testing</a> right now; E2E encryption is more stable than ever with the usability rework <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/compare/develop...uhoreg:e2e_cross-signing">landing</a> as we speak.  And we've even got a full rewrite of Riot/Android in the wings.</p>
<p>But it's certainly been an interesting ride.  Longer-term spec work has been delayed by needing to apply band-aids to mitigate abuse of the outstanding issues.  Riot redesign was pushed back considerably due to prioritising Riot performance over UX. The E2E UX work has forced us to consider E2E holistically… which does not always interact well with structuring the dev work into bite-sized chunks.  Dendrite has generally been idling whilst we instead pour most of our effort into getting to 1.0 on Synapse (rather than diluting 1.0 work across both projects). These tradeoffs have been hard to make, but hopefully we have chosen the correct path in the end.</p>
<p>Overall, as we approach 1.0, the project is looking better than ever - hopefully everyone has seen both Riot and Synapse using less RAM and being more responsive and stable, E2E being more reliable, and anyone who has played with the <a href="https://riot.im/experimental">Riot redesign</a> beta should agree that it is light-years ahead of yesterday's Riot and something which can genuinely surpass today's centralised proprietary incumbents. And that is unbelievably exciting :D</p>
<p>We'd like to thank everyone for continuing to support Matrix - especially our <a href="http://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a> &amp; <a href="http://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg">Liberapay</a> supporters, whose donations continue to be critical for helping fund the core dev team, and also those who are supporting the project indirectly by hosting homeservers with <a href="https://modular.im">Modular</a>.  We are going to do everything humanly possible to ship 1.0 over the coming weeks, and then the sky will be the limit!</p>
<p>Before going into what else 2019 will hold, however, let's take the opportunity to give a bit more detail on the various core team projects which landed in 2018…</p>
<h2 id="france">France</h2>
<p>DINSIC (France's Ministry of Digital, IT &amp; Comms) have been busy building out their massive cross-government Matrix deployment and custom Matrix client throughout most of the year.  After the <a href="/blog/2018/04/26/matrix-and-riot-confirmed-as-the-basis-for-frances-secure-instant-messenger-app/">announcement in April</a>, this started off with an initial deployment over the summer, and is now moving towards the full production rollout, as confirmed at the Paris Open Source Summit a few weeks ago by Mounir Mahjoubi, the Secretary of State of Digital.  All the press coverage about this ended up in French, with the biggest writeup being at <a href="https://www.cio-online.com/actualites/lire-mounir-mahjoubi%C2%A0-%C2%A0le-libre-n-est-pas-toujours-moins-cher-mais-c-est-toujours-plus-transparent%C2%A0-10842.html">CIO Online</a>, but the main mention of Matrix (badly translated from French) is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>Denouncing the use of tools such as WhatsApp; a practice that has become commonplace within ministerial offices, Mounir Mahjoubi announced the launch in production of Tchap, based on Matrix and Riot: an instant messaging tool that will be provided throughout the administrations. So, certainly, developing a product can have a certain cost. Integrating it too. "Free is not always cheaper but it's always more transparent," admitted the Secretary of State.

The project really shows off Matrix at its best, with up to 60 different deployments spread over different ministries and departments; multiple clusters per Ministry; end-to-end encryption enabled by default (complete with e2e-aware antivirus scanning); multiple networks for different classes of traffic; and the hope of federating with the public Matrix network once the S2S API is finalised and suitable border gateways are available.  It's not really our project to talk about, but we'll try to share as much info as we can as roll-out continues.
<h2 id="the-matrix-specification">The Matrix Specification</h2>
<p>A major theme throughout the year has been polishing the <a href="/docs/spec">Matrix Spec</a> itself for its first full stable release, having had more than enough time to see which bits work in practice now and which bits need rethinking.  This all kicked off with the <a href="/blog/2018/05/17/introducing-matrix-specification-changes/">creation of the Matrix Spec Change process</a> back in May, which provides a formal process for reviewing and accepting contributions from anyone into the spec.  Getting the balance right between agility and robustness has been quite tough here, especially pre-1.0 where we've needed to move rapidly to resolve the remaining long-lived sticking points.  However, a process like this risks encouraging the classic “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good">Perfect is the Enemy of Good</a>” problem, as all and sundry jump in to apply their particular brand of perfectionism to the spec (and/or the process around it) and risk smothering it to death with enthusiasm.  So we've ended up iterating a few times on the process and hopefully now converged on an approach which will work for 1.0 and beyond. If you haven't checked out the current <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">proposals guide</a> please give it a look, and feel free to marvel at all the MSCs in flight.  You can also see a <a href="/~richardv/proposal_news.html">quick and dirty timeline of all the MSC status changes</a> since we introduced the process, to get an idea of how it's all been progressing.</p>
<p>In August we had a big sprint to cut <a href="/blog/2018/09/03/matrix-spec-update-august-2018/">stable “r0” releases of all the APIs</a> of the spec which had not yet reached a stable release (i.e. all apart from the Client-Server API, which has been stable since Dec 2015 - hence in part the large number of usable independent Matrix clients relative to the other bits of the ecosystem).  In practice, we managed to release 3 out of the 4 remaining APIs - but needed more time to solve the remaining blocking issues with the Server-Server API. So since August (modulo operational and project distractions) we've been plugging away on the S2S API.  </p>
<p>The main blocking issue for a stable S2S API has been State Resolution. This is the fundamental algorithm used to determine the state of a given room whenever a race or partition happens between the servers participating in it.  For instance: if Alice kicks Bob on her server at the same time as Charlie ops Bob on his server, who should win? It's vital that all servers reach the same conclusion as to the state of the room, and we don't want servers to have to replicate a full copy of the room's history (which could be massive) to reach a consistent conclusion.  Matrix's original state resolution algorithm dates back to the initial usable S2S implementation at the beginning of 2015 - but over time deficiencies in the algorithm became increasingly apparent. The most obvious issue is the “<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2432">Hotel California</a>” bug, where users can be spontaneously re-joined to a room they've previously left if the room's current state is merged with an older copy of the room on another server and the ‘wrong' version wins the conflict - a so-called state-reset.</p>
<p>After a lot of thought we ended up proposing an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/state_res_rejections/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">all new State Resolution algorithm</a> in July 2018, nicknamed State Resolution Reloaded.  This extends the original algorithm to consider the ‘auth chain' of state events when performing state resolution (i.e. the sequence of events that a given state event cites as evidence of its validity) - as well as addressing a bunch of other issues.  For those wishing to understand in more detail, there's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/state_res_rejections/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">the MSC</a> itself, the formal terse description of the algorithm now merged into the <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/unstable.html#state-resolution-algorithm-for-version-2-rooms">unstable S2S spec</a> - or alternatively there's an excellent <a href="https://matrix.uhoreg.ca/stateres/reloaded.html">step-by-step explanation and guided example</a> from uhoreg (warning: contains Haskell :)  Or you can watch Erik and Matthew try to explain it all on <a href="https://youtu.be/f6ZdmPSUUBA">Matrix Live</a> back in July.</p>
<p>Since the initial proposal in July, the algorithm has been proofed out in a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-test-state-resolution-ideas">test jig</a>, iterated on some more to better specify <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1693">how to handle rejected events</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4040">implemented in Synapse</a>, and is now ready to roll.  The only catch is that to upgrade to it we've had to introduce the concept of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1516/files">room versioning</a>, and to flush out historical issues we require you to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/room_upgrades/proposals/1501-room-version-upgrades.md">re-create rooms to upgrade them</a> to the new resolution algorithm. Getting the logistics in place for this is a massive pain, but we've got an approach now which should be sufficient. Clients will be free to smooth over the transition in the UI as gracefully as possible (and in fact Riot has this already hooked up).  So: watch this space as v2 rooms with all-new state resolution in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>Otherwise, there are a bunch of other issues in the S2S API which we are still working through (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/event_id_hashes/proposals/1640-event-id-as-hashes.md">changing event IDs to be hashes</a> of event contents to avoid lying about IDs, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1711">switching to use normal X.509 certificates for federation</a> and so resolve problems with Perspectives, etc).  </p>
<p>Once these land and are implemented in Synapse over the coming weeks, we will be able to finally declare a 1.0!</p>
<p>Also on the spec side of things, it's worth noting that a lot of effort went into improving performance for clients in the form of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1227">Lazy Loading Members MSC</a>.  This ended up consuming a lot of time over the summer as we updated Synapse and the various matrix-*-sdks (and thus Riot) to only calculate and send details to the clients about members who are currently talking in a room, whereas previously we sent the entire state of the room to the client (even including users who had left). The end result however is a 3-5x reduction in RAM on Riot, and a 3-5x speedup on initial sync.  The current MSC is currently being <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1758">merged as we speak</a> into the main spec (thanks Kitsune!) for inclusion in upcoming CS API 0.5.</p>
<h2 id="the-matrix-org-foundation-cic">The Matrix.org Foundation (CIC!)</h2>
<p>Alongside getting the open spec process up and running, we've been establishing The Matrix.org Foundation as an independent non-profit legal entity responsible for neutrally safeguarding the Matrix spec and evolution of the protocol.  This kicked off in June with the “<a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">Towards Open Governance</a>” blog post, and continued with the <a href="/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2/">formal incorporation</a> of The Matrix.org Foundation in October.  Since then, we've spent a lot of time with the non-profit lawyers evolving <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318">MSC1318</a> into the final Articles of Association (and other guidelines) for the Foundation.  This work is basically solved now; it just needs MSC1318 to be updated with the conclusions (which we're running late on, but is top of Matthew's MSC todo list).</p>
<p>In other news, we have confirmation that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company">Community Interest Company</a> (CIC) status for The Matrix.org Foundation has been approved - this means that the CIC Regulator has independently reviewed the initial Articles of Association and approved that they indeed lock the mission of the Foundation to be non-profit and to act solely for the good of the wider online community.  In practice, this means that the Foundation will be formally renamed The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C, and provides a useful independent safeguard to ensure the Foundation remains on track.</p>
<p>The remaining work on the Foundation is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Update and land MSC1318, particularly on clarifying the relationship between the legal Guardians (Directors) of the Foundation and the technical members of the core spec team, and how funds of the Foundation will be handled.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Update the Articles of Association of the Foundation based on the end result of MSC1318
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Transfer any Matrix.org assets over from New Vector to the Foundation.  Given Matrix's code is all open source, there isn't much in the way of assets - we're basically talking about the matrix.org domain and website itself.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Introduce the final Guardians for the Foundation.
</li>
</ul>
We'll keep you posted with progress as this lands over the coming months.
<h2 id="riot">Riot</h2>
<p>2018 has been a bit of a chrysalis year for Riot: the vast majority of work has been going into the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/a-sneak-peek-at-a-whole-new-riot-im-1114df653782">massive redesign</a> we started in May to improve usability &amp; cosmetics, performance, stability, and E2E encryption usability improvements.  We've consciously spent most of the year feature frozen in order to polish what we already have, as we've certainly been guilty in the past of landing way too many features without necessarily applying the needed amount of UX polish.</p>
<p>However, as of today, we're super-excited to announce that Riot's redesign is at the point where the intrepid can start experimenting with it - in fact, internally most of the team has switched over to dogfooding (testing) the redesign as of a week or so ago.  Just shut down your current copy of Riot/Web or Desktop and go to <a href="https://riot.im/experimental">https://riot.im/experimental</a> instead if you want to experiment (we don't recommend running both at the same time).  Please note that it is still work-in-progress and there's a lot of polish still to land and some cosmetic bugs still hanging around, but it's definitely at the point of feeling better than the old app.  Most importantly, please provide feedback (by hitting the lifesaver-ring button at the bottom left) to let us know how you get on. See the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/redesign-experimenters-needed-afa7c2d4c858">Riot blog</a> for more details!</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-25-at-04.00.44.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3854" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-25-at-04.00.44-1024x578.png" alt="" width="1024" height="578" /></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the performance and stability side of things - Lazy Loading (see above) made a <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/riot-im-web-0-17-and-ios-0-7-6-smaller-footprint-faster-launch-5ddd18a65abb">massive difference</a> to performance on all platforms; shrinking RAM usage by 3-5x and similarly speeding up launch and initial sync times.  Ironically, this ended up pushing back the redesign work, but hopefully the performance improvements will have been noticeable in the interim.  We also <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/6477">switched</a> the entire rich text composer from using Facebook's <a href="https://draftjs.org/">Draft.js</a> library to instead use <a href="https://www.slatejs.org">Slate.js</a> (which has generally been a massive improvement for stability and maintainability, although took <em><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/1890">ages</a></em> to land - huge thanks to t3chguy for getting it over the line). Meanwhile Travis has been blitzing through a massive list of key “<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/projects/12">First Impression</a>” bugs to ensure that as many of Riot's most glaring usability gotchas are solved.</p>
<p>We also welcomed ever-popular <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/stickers-are-here-introducing-riot-im-0-15-for-web-desktop-284c32b93acc">Stickers</a> to the fold - the first instance of per-account rather than per-room widgets, which ended up requiring a lot of new infrastructure in both Riot and the underlying integration manager responsible for hosting the widgets.  But judging by how popular they are, the effort seems to be worth it - and paves the way for much more exciting interactive widgets and integrations in future!</p>
<p>An unexpectedly large detour/distraction came in the form of GDPR back in May - we spent a month or so running around ensuring that both Riot and Matrix are GDPR compliant (including the necessary legal legwork to establish how GDPR even applies to a decentralised technology like Matrix).  If you missed all that fun, you can <a href="/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/">read about it here</a>.  Hopefully we won't have to do anything like that again any time soon...</p>
<p>And finally: on the mobile side, much of the team has been distracted helping out France with their Matrix deployment.  However, we've been plugging away on Riot/Mobile, keeping pace with the development on Riot/Web - but most excitingly, we've also found time to experiment with a <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-android-redesign-PoC/tree/develop">complete rewrite of Riot/Android</a> in Kotlin, using Realm and Rx (currently nicknamed Riot X).  The rewrite was originally intended as a test-jig for experimenting with the redesign on mobile, but it's increasingly becoming a fully fledged Matrix client… which launches and syncs over 5x faster than today's Riot/Android.  If you're particularly intrepid you should be able to run the app by checking out the project in Android Studio and hitting ‘run'. We expect the rewrite to land properly in the coming months - watch this space for progress!</p>
<h2 id="e2e-encryption">E2E Encryption</h2>
<p>One of the biggest projects this year has been to get E2E encryption out of beta and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/6779">turned on by default</a>.  Now, whilst the encryption itself in Matrix has been <a href="/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last/">cryptographically robust</a> since 2016 - its usability has been minimal at best, and we'd been running around polishing the underlying implementation rather than addressing the UX.  However, this year that changed, as we opened a war on about 6 concurrent battlefronts to address the remaining issues. These are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Holistic UX.  Designing a coherent, design-led UX across all of the encryption and key-management functionality.  Nad (who joined Matrix as a fulltime Lead UI/UX designer in August) has been leading the charge on this - you can see a <a href="/blog/2018/11/02/user-experience-preview-end-to-end-encryption-by-default/">preview of the end result</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here.  Meanwhile, Dave and Ryan are working through implementing it as we speak.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Decryption failures (UISIs).  Whenever something goes wrong with E2E encryption, the symptoms are generally the same: you find yourself unable to decrypt other people's messages.  We've been plugging away chasing these down - for instance, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/597">switching from localStorage to IndexedDB</a> in Riot/Web for storing encryption state (to make it harder for multiple tabs to collide and corrupt your encryption state); providing mechanisms to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/780">unwedge Olm sessions</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which have got corrupted (e.g. by restoring from backup); and many others.  We also added full telemetry to track the number of UISIs people are seeing in practice - and the good news is that over the course of the year their occurrence has been steadily reducing.  The bad news is that there are still some edge cases left: so please, whenever you fail to decrypt a message, please make sure you submit a bug report and debug logs from *both* the sender and receiving device.  The end is definitely in sight on these, however, and good news is other battlefronts will also help mitigate UISIs.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Incremental Key Backup.  Previously, if you only used one device (e.g. your phone) and you lost that phone, you would lose all your E2E history unless you were in the habit of explicitly manually backing up your keys.  Nowadays, we have the ability to optionally let users encrypt their keys with a passphrase (or recovery key) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1703">constantly upload them to the server</a> for safe keeping.  This was a significant chunk of work, but has actually <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/2169">landed already</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Riot/Web and Riot/iOS, but is hidden behind a “Labs” feature flag in Settings whilst we test it and sort out the final UX.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-signing Keys. Previously, the only way to check whether you were talking to a legitimate user or an imposter was to independently compare the fingerprints of the keys of the device they claim to be using.  In the near future, we will let users prove that they own their devices by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1756">signing them with a per-user identity key</a>, so you only have to do this check once. We've actually <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/795">already implemented</a> one iteration of cross-signing, but this <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1680">allowed arbitrary devices for a given user to attest each other</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which creates a directed graph of attestations, and associated problems with revocations), hence switching to a simpler approach.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Improved Verification. Verifying keys by manually comparing elliptic key fingerprints is incredibly cumbersome and tedious.  Instead, we have proposals for using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1267">Short Authentication String</a> comparisons and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1543">QR-code scanning</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to simplify the process.  uhoreg is currently implementing these as we speak :)
</span>
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Search.  Solving encrypted search is Hard, but t3chguy did a lot of work earlier in the year to build out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-search">matrix-search</a>: essentially a js-sdk bot which you can host, hand your keys to, and will archive your history using a golang full-text search engine (bleve) and expose a search interface that replaces Synapse's default one.  Of all the battlefronts this one is progressing the least right now, but the hope is to integrate it into Riot/Desktop or other clients so that folks who want to index all their conversations have the means to do so.  On the plus side, all the necessary building blocks are available thanks to t3chguy's hacking.
</li>
</ul>
So, TL;DR: E2E is hard, but the end is in sight thanks to a lot of blood, sweat and tears.  It's possible that we may have opened up too many battlefronts in finishing it off rather than landing stuff gradually.  But it should be transformative when it all lands - and we'll finally be able to turn it on by default for private conversations.  Again, we're aiming to pull this together by the end of January.
<p>Separately, we've been keeping a close eye on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/">MLS</a> - the IETF's activity around standardising scalable group E2E encryption.  MLS has a lot of potential and could provide algorithmic improvements over Olm &amp; Megolm (whist paving the way for interop with other MLS-encrypted comms systems).  But it's also quite complicated, and is at risk of designing out support of decentralised environments. For now, we're obviously focusing on ensuring that Matrix is rock solid with Olm &amp; Megolm, but once we hit that 1.0 we'll certainly be experimenting a bit with MLS too.</p>
<h2 id="homeservers">Homeservers</h2>
<p>The story of the Synapse team in 2018 has been one of alternating between solving scaling and performance issues to support the ever-growing network (especially the massive matrix.org server)... and dealing with S2S API issues; both in terms of fixing the design of State Resolution, Room Versioning etc (see the Spec section above) and doing stop-gap fixes to the current implementation.</p>
<p>Focusing on the performance side of things, the main wins have been:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Splitting yet more functionality out into worker processes which can scale independently of the master Synapse process.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet more profiling and optimisation (particularly caching).  Between this and the worker split-out we were able to resolve the performance ceiling that we hit over the summer, and as of right now matrix.org feels relatively snappy.
</span>
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lazy Loading Members.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="/blog/2018/12/21/porting-synapse-to-python-3/">Python 3</a>.  As everyone should have seen by now, Synapse is now Python 3 by default as of 0.34, which provides significant RAM and CPU improvements across the board as well as a path forwards given Python 2's planned demise at the end of 2019.  If you're not running your Synapse on Python 3 today, you are officially doing it wrong.
</li>
</ul>
There are also some major improvements which haven't fully landed yet:
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">State compression.  We have a new algorithm for storing room state which is ~10x more efficient than the current one.  We'll be migrating to it in by default in future. If you're feeling particularly intrepid you can actually <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/rust-synapse-compress-state">manually use it today</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (but we don't recommend it yet).
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Incremental state resolution.  Before we got sucked into redesigning state resolution in general, Erik came up with a <a href="/_matrix/media/v1/download/jki.re/ubNfLtrmXZMmlGjJZYPnlHHy">proof that it's possible to memoize state resolution</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and incrementally calculate it whenever state is resolved in a room rather than recalculate it from scratch each time (as is the current implementation).  This would be a significant performance improvement, given non-incremental state res can consume a lot of CPU (making everything slow down when there are lots of room extremities to resolve), and can consume a lot of RAM and has been one of the reasons that synapse's RAM usage can sometimes spike badly. The good news is that the new state res algorithm was designed to also work in this manner.  The bad news is that we haven't yet got back to implementing it yet, given the new algorithm is only just being rolled out now.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1229">Chunks</a>.  Currently, Synapse models all events in a room as being part of a single DAG, which can be problematic if you can see lots of disconnected sections of the DAG (e.g. due to intermittent connectivity somewhere in the network), as Synapse will frantically try to resolve all these disconnected sections of DAG together.  Instead, a better solution is to explicitly model these sections of DAG as separate entities called Chunks, and not try to resolve state between disconnected Chunks but instead consider them independent fragments of the room - and thus simplify state resolution calculations significantly. It also fixes an S2S API design flaw where previously we trusted the server to state the ordering (depth) of events they provided; with chunks, the receiving server can keep track of that itself by tracking a DAG of chunks (as well as the normal event DAG within the chunks).  Now, most of the work for this happened already, but is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3785">currently parked</a> until new state res has landed.
</li>
</ul>
Meanwhile, over on Dendrite, we made the conscious decision to get 1.0 out the door on Synapse first rather than trying to implement and iterate on the stuff needed for 1.0 on both Synapse & Dendrite simultaneously.  However, Dendrite has been ticking along thanks to work from Brendan, Anoa and APWhitehat - and the plan is to use it for more niche homeserver work at first; e.g. constrained resource devices (Dendrite uses 5-10x less RAM than Synapse on Py3), clientside homeservers, experimental routing deployments, etc.  In the longer term we expect it to grow into a fully fledged HS though!
<h2 id="bridging">Bridging</h2>
<p>2018 was a bit of a renaissance for Bridging, largely thanks to Half-Shot coming on board in the Summer to work on IRC bridging and finally get to the bottom of the stability issues which plagued Freenode for the previous, uh, few years.  Meanwhile the Slack bridge got its first ever release - and more recently there's some Really Exciting Stuff happening with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a>; a properly usable bridge through to any protocol that libpurple can speak… and as of a few days ago also supports <em>native</em> XMPP bridging via XMPP.js.  There'll probably be a dedicated blogpost about all of this in the new year, especially when we deploy it all on Matrix.org. Until then, the best bet is to learn more is to watch <a href="https://youtu.be/B0faoVdw0ak">last week's Matrix Live</a> and hear it all first hand.</p>
<h2 id="modular">Modular</h2>
<p>One of the biggest newcomers of 2018 was the launch of <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a> in October - the world's first commercial Matrix hosting service.  Whilst (like Riot), Modular isn't strictly-speaking a Matrix.org project - it feels appropriate to mention it here, not least because it's helping directly fund the core Matrix dev team.</p>
<p>So far Modular has seen a lot of interest from folks who want to spin up a super-speedy dedicated homeserver run by us rather than having to spend the time to build one themselves - or folks who have yet to migrate from IRC and want a better-than-IRC experience which still bridges well.  One of the nice bits is that the servers are still decentralised and completely operationally independent of one another, and there have been a bunch of really nice refinements since launch, including the ability to point your own DNS at the server; matrix-&gt;matrix migration tools; with custom branding and other goodness coming soon.  If you want one-click Matrix hosting, please give Modular a go :) </p>
<p>Right now we're promoting Modular mainly to existing Matrix users, but once the Riot redesign is finished you should expect to see some very familiar names popping up on the platform :D</p>
<h2 id="twim">TWIM</h2>
<p>Unless you were living under a rock, you'll hopefully have also realised that 2018 was the year that brought us <a href="/blog/category/general/this-week-in-matrix/">This Week In Matrix</a> (TWIM) - our very own blog tracking all the action across the whole Matrix community on a weekly basis.  Thank you to everyone who contributes updates, and to Ben for editing it each week. Go flip through the archives to find out what's been going on in the wider community over the course of the year!  (This blog post is already way too long without trying to cover the rest of the ecosystem too :)</p>
<h2 id="shapes-of-things-to-come">Shapes of Things to Come</h2>
<p>Finally, a little Easter egg (it is Christmas, after all) for anyone crazy enough to have read this far: The eagle-eyed amongst you might have noticed that one of our accepted talks for FOSDEM 2019 is “<a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/matrix/">Breaking the 100bps barrier with Matrix</a>” in the Real Time Communications devroom.  We don't want to spoil the full surprise, but here's a quick preview of some of the more exotic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project">skunkworks</a> we've been doing on low-bandwidth routing and transports recently.  Right now it shamelessly assumes that you're running within a trusted network, but once we solve that it will of course be be proposed as an MSC for Matrix proper.  A full write-up and code will follow, but for now, here's a mysterious video…</p>

<p>(If you're interested in running Matrix over low-bandwidth networks, please <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">get in touch</a> - we'd love to hear from you...)</p>
<h2 id="2019">2019</h2>
<p>So, what will 2019 bring?</p>
<p>In the short term, as should be obvious from the above, our focus is on:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">r0 spec releases across the board (aka Matrix 1.0)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing them in Synapse
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Landing the Riot redesign
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Landing all the new E2E encryption UX and features
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Finalising the Matrix.org Foundation
</li>
</ul>
However, beyond that, there's a lot of possible options on the table in the medium term:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reworking and improving Communities/Groups.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reactions.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">E2E-encrypted Search
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Filtering. (empowering users to filter out rooms & content they're not interested in).
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Extensible events.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Editable messages.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Extensible Profiles (we've actually been experimenting with this already).
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Threading.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Landing the Riot/Android rewrite
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Scaling synapse via sharding the master process
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Bridge UI for discovery of users/rooms and bridge status
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Considering whether to do a similar overhaul of Riot/iOS
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Bandwidth-efficient transports
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Bandwidth-efficient routing
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Getting Dendrite to production.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Inline widgets (polls etc)
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Improving VoIP over Matrix.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adding more bridges, and improving the current ones..
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Account portability
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing MXIDs with public keys
</li>
</ul>
In the longer term, options include:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Shared-code cross-platform client SDKs (e.g. sharing a native core library between matrix-{'{'}js,ios,android{'}'}-sdk)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Matrix daemons (e.g. running an always-on client as a background process in your OS which apps can connect to via a lightweight CS API)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Push notifications via Matrix (using a daemon-style architecture)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Clientside homeservers (i.e. p2p matrix) - e.g. compiling Dendrite to WASM and running it in a service worker.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Experimenting with MLS for E2E Encryption
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Storing and querying more generic data structures in Matrix (e.g. object trees; scene graphs)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Alternate use cases for VR, IoT, etc.
</li>
</ul>
Obviously we're not remotely going to do all of that in 2019, but this serves to give a taste of the possibilities on the menu post-1.0; we'll endeavour to publish a more solid roadmap when we get to that point.
<p>And on that note, it's time to call this blogpost to a close. Thanks to anyone who read this far, and thank you, as always, for flying Matrix and continuing to support the project.  The next few months should be particularly fun; all the preparation of 2018 will finally pay off :)</p>
<p>Happy holidays,</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix.org team.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Back in June we blogged about <a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">the plan of action to establish a formal open governance system</a> for the Matrix protocol: introducing both the idea of the Spec Core Team to act as the neutral technical custodian of the Matrix Spec, as well as confirming the plan to incorporate the Matrix.org Foundation to act as a neutral non-profit legal entity which can act as the legal Guardian for Matrix's intellectual property, gather donations to fund Matrix work, and be legally responsible for maintaining and evolving the spec in a manner which benefits the whole ecosystem without privileging any individual commercial concerns.  We published a draft proposal for the new governance model at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318">MSC1318: a proposal for open governance of the Matrix.org Spec</a> to gather feedback and to trial during the <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">day-to-day development of the spec</a>. Otherwise, we refocused on getting a 1.0 release of the Spec out the door, given there's not much point in having a fancy legal governance process to safeguard the evolution of the Spec when we don't even have a stable initial release!</p>
<p>We were originally aiming for end of August to publish a stable release of all Matrix APIs (and thus a so-called 1.0 of the overall standard) - and in the end we managed to <a href="/blog/2018/09/03/matrix-spec-update-august-2018/">publish stable releases of 4 of the 5 APIs</a> (Client-Server, Application Service, Identity Service and Push APIs) as well as a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/commits/master/specification/server_server_api.rst">major overhaul</a> of the Server-Server (SS) API.  However, the SS API work has run on much longer than expected, as we've ended up both redesigning and needing to implement many major changes to to the protocol: the new State Resolution algorithm (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">State Resolution Reloaded</a>) to fix state resets; versioned rooms (in order to upgrade to the new algorithm); changing event IDs to be hashes; and fixing a myriad federation bugs in Synapse.  Now, the remaining work is progressing steadily (you can see the progress over at <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/2">https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/2</a> - although some of the cards are redacted because they refer to non-spec consulting work) - and <strong>the end is in sight</strong>!</p>
<p>So, in preparation for the upcoming Matrix 1.0 release, we've been moving ahead with the rest of the open governance plan - and we're happy to announce that as of a few hours ago,<strong> the initial incarnation of The Matrix.org Foundation exists!</strong></p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Certificate.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3691" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Certificate-723x1024.png" alt="" width="496" height="702" /></a></p>
<p>Now, it's important to understand that <strong>this process is not finished </strong>- what we've done is to set up a solid initial basis for the Foundation in order to finish refining <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318">MSC1318</a> and turning it into the full Articles of Association of the Foundation (i.e. the legal framework which governs the remit of the Foundation), which we'll be working on over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>In practice, what this means is that in the first phase, today's Foundation gives us:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>A UK <strong>non-profit company</strong> - technically incorporated as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_company_limited_by_guarantee">private company, limited by guarantee</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Guardians</strong>, whose role is to be legally responsible for ensuring that the Foundation (and by extension the Spec Core Team) keeps on mission and neutrally protects the development of Matrix.  Matrix's Guardians form the Board of Directors of the Foundation, and will provide a 'checks and balances' mechanism between each other to ensure that all Guardians act in the best interests of the protocol and ecosystem.<br/ ><br />For the purposes of initially setting up the Foundation, the initial Guardians are Matthew & Amandine - but in the coming weeks we're expecting to appoint at least three independent Guardians in order to ensure that the current team form a minority on the board and ensure the neutrality of the Foundation relative to Matthew & Amandine's day jobs at New Vector.The profile we're looking for in Guardians are: folks who are independent of the commercial Matrix ecosystem (and especially independent from <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a>), and may even not be members of today's Matrix community, but who are deeply aligned with the mission of the project, and who are respected and trusted by the wider community to uphold the guiding principles of the Foundation and keep the other Guardians honest.</li>
 	<li>An immutable <strong>asset lock</strong>, to protect the intellectual property of the Foundation and prevent it from ever being sold or transferred elsewhere.</li>
 	<li>An immutable <strong>mission lock</strong>, which defines the Foundation's mission as a non-profit neutral guardian of the Matrix standard, with an initial formal goal of finalising the open governance process.  To quote article 4 from the initial Articles of Association:
<ul>
 	<li>
<div class="page" title="Page 8">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">4. The objects of the Foundation are for the benefit of the community as a whole to:</div>
<div class="column">
<p>4.1.1  empower users to control their communication data and have freedom over their communications infrastructure by creating, maintaining and promoting Matrix as an openly standardised secure decentralised communication protocol and network, open to all, and available to the public for no charge;</p>
</div>
</div>
4.1.2  build and develop an appropriate governance model for Matrix through the Foundation, in order to drive the adoption of Matrix as a single global federation, an open standard unencumbered from any proprietary intellectual property and/or software patents, minimising fragmentation (whilst encouraging experimentation), maximising speed of development, and prioritising the long-term success and growth of the overall network over the commercial concerns of an individual person or persons.
</div></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>You can read the initial <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Constitution.pdf">Articles of Association</a> here (although all the rest of it is fairly generic legal boilerplate for a non-profit company at this point which hasn't yet been tuned; the Matrix-specific stuff is Article 4 as quoted above).  You can also see the initial details of the Foundation straight from the horse's mouth over at <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11648710">https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11648710</a>.</li>
</ul>
Then, in the <strong>next and final phase</strong>, what remains is to:
<ul>
 	<li>Appoint 3+ more Guardians (see above).</li>
 	<li>Finalise<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318"> MSC1318</a> and incorporate the appropriate bits into the Articles of Associations (AoA).  (We might literally edit MSC1318 directly into the final AoA, to incorporate as much input as possible from the full community)</li>
 	<li>Tune the boilerplate bits of the AoA to incorporate the conclusions of<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318"> MSC1318</a>.</li>
 	<li>Register the Foundation as a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-regulator-of-community-interest-companies">Community Interest Company</a>, to further anchor the Foundation as being for the benefit of the wider community.</li>
 	<li>Perform an Asset Transfer of any and all Matrix.org property from New Vector to the Foundation (especially the Matrix.org domain and branding, and donations directed to Matrix.org).</li>
</ul>
So there you have it! It's been a long time in coming, and huge thanks to everyone for their patience and support in getting to this point, but finally The Matrix.org Foundation exists.  Watch this space over the coming weeks as we announce the Guardians and finish bootstrapping the Foundation into its final long-term form!  Meanwhile, any questions: come ask in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org</a> or in the blog comments here.
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine, and the forthcoming Guardians of [the] Matrix!</p>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Today is one of those pivotal days for the Matrix ecosystem: we're incredibly excited to announce that the world's first ever dedicated homeserver hosting service is now fully available over at <a href="https://modular.im">https://modular.im</a>!  This really is a massive step for Matrix towards being a mature ecosystem, and we look forward to Modular being the first of many hosting providers in the years to come :D</p>
<p>Modular lets anyone spin up a dedicated homeserver and Riot via a super-simple web interface, rather than having to run and admin their own server.  It's built by New Vector (the startup who makes Riot and hires many of the Matrix core team), and comes from taking the various custom homeserver deployments for people like Status and TADHack and turning them into a paid service available to everyone.  You can even point your own DNS at it to get a fully branded dedicated homeserver for your own domain!</p>
<p><a href="https://modular.im"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3662 size-full" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/181022-Modular-featured.png" alt="" width="800" height="241" /></a></p>
<p>Anyway, for full details, check out the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/introducing-modular-awesome-hosting-for-riot-matrix-665a7a0c616">announcement over at the Riot blog</a>.  We're particularly excited that Modular helps increase Matrix's decentralisation, and is really forcing us to ensure that the Federation API is getting the attention it deserves.  Hopefully it'll also reduce some load from the Matrix.org homeserver! Modular will also help Matrix by directly funding Matrix development by the folks working at New Vector, which should in turn of course benefit the whole ecosystem.</p>
<p>Many people reading this likely already run their own servers, and obviously they aren't the target audience for Modular.  But for organisations who don't have a sysadmin or don't want to spend the time to run their own server, hopefully Modular gives a very cost-effective way of running your own dedicated reliable Matrix server without having to pay for a sysadmin :)</p>
<p>We're looking forward to see more of these kind of services popping up in the future from everywhere in the ecosystem, and have started a <a href="/hosting/">Matrix Hosting page</a> on the Matrix website so that everyone can advertise their own: don't hesitate to get in touch if you have a service to be featured!</p>
<p>If you're interested, please swing by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#modular:matrix.org">#modular:matrix.org</a> or feel free to shoot questions to <a href="mailto:support@modular.im">support@modular.im</a>.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Ben's away today, so this TWIM is brought to you mainly in association with Cadair's TWIMbot!</p>
<h2 id="spec-activity">Spec Activity</h2>
<p>Since <a href="/blog/2018/09/03/matrix-spec-update-august-2018/">last week's sprint to get the new spec releases</a> out, focus on the core team has shifted exclusively to the remaining stuff needed to cut the first stable release for the Server-Server API.  In practice this means fleshing out the MSCs in flight and implementing them - work has progressed on both improving auth rules, switching event IDs to be hashes and others.  Whilst implementing this in Synapse we're also doing a complete audit and overhaul of the current federation code, hence the <a href="/blog/2018/09/06/critical-security-update-synapse-0-33-3-1/">0.33.3.1</a> security release this week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the community, ma1uta reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am working on the <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon">jeon</a> (java matrix api) to update it to the latest stable release. Also I changed versions of api to form <code>rX.Y.Z-N</code> where <code>rX.Y.Z</code> is a API version and <code>N</code> is a library version within API. So, I have prepared Push API (r0.1.0-1), Identity API (r0.1.0-1) and Appservice API (r0.1.0-1) for the first release and current updating the C2S API to the r0.4.0 version.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="xmpp-bridging">XMPP Bridging</h2>
<p>Are you in the market for a Matrix-XMPP bridge? When I say &quot;market&quot;, I mean it because this week we have <em>two </em>announcements for bridging to XMPP! You can choose whether you'd prefer your bridge to be implemented as a puppet, or a bot.</p>
<p>Ma1uta has a new version of <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-jabber-java-bridge">his Matrix-Xmpp bridge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a double-puppet bridge which can connects the Matrix and XMPP ecosystems. Just invite the <code>@_xmpp_master:ru-matrix.org</code> and tell him: <code>@_xmpp_master: connect test@conference.jabber.org</code> to connect current room with the specified conference.<br />You can ask about this bridge in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-jabber-java-bridge:ru-matrix.org">#matrix-jabber-java-bridge:ru-matrix.org</a> room.<br />Currently supports only conferences and only <code>m.text</code> messages. 1:1 conversations and other message types will be later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>maze appeared this week and announced <a href="https://github.com/djmaze/mxbridge">MxBridge</a>, a new Matrix-XMPP bridge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It works as a bot, so it is non-puppeting. Rooms can be mapped dynamically by the bot administrator(s). There is no support for 1-1 chats (yet). MxBridge is written as a multi-process application in Elixir and it should scale quite well (but don't tie me down on it ;)). <a href="https://github.com/djmaze/mxbridge">https://github.com/djmaze/mxbridge</a></p>

<h2 id="riot">Riot</h2>
<p>Bruno has been hacking away on Riot/Web squashing the remaining Lazy Loading Members defects and various related optimisations and fixes. We also released Riot/Web 0.16.3 as a fairly minor point release (which unfortunately has a regression with DM avatars, which is fixed in 0.16.4, for which a first RC was cut a few hours ago and should be released on Monday).  Meanwhile the first cut of Lazy Loading also got implemented on Android as well. Both are hidden behind labs flags, but we're almost at a point where we can turn it on now!  Otherwise, the Riot team has got sucked into working on commercial Matrix stuff, for better or worse (all shall be revealed shortly though!)</p>
<h2 id="construct">Construct</h2>
<p>Jason has been working heavily on Construct, and has new test users.  Construct is able to federate with Synapse and the rest of the Matrix ecosystem.  mujx has created a docker for Construct which streamlines its deployment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct development is still occurring here <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis</a> but we are now significantly closer to pushing the first release to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct">https://github.com/matrix-construct</a>. Also feel free to stop by in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net" rel="nofollow">#test:zemos.net</a> / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#zemos-test:matrix.org" rel="nofollow">#zemos-test:matrix.org</a> as well -- a room hosted by Construct, of course.</p>
<p>tulir has now deployed using the standalone install instructions on a very small LXC VM using ZFS. Unfortunately ZFS does not support O_DIRECT (direct disk IO) which is how Construct achieves maximum performance using concurrent reads. This is not a problem though when using an SSD or for personal deployments. I'll be posting more about how Construct hacked RocksDB to use direct IO, which can get the most out of your hardware with multiple requests in-flight (even with an SSD).</p>

<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Work was split this week into spec/security work, with the critical update for <a href="/blog/2018/09/06/critical-security-update-synapse-0-33-3-1/">0.33.3.1</a> - if you haven't upgraded, please do so immediately.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Hawkowl has been on a mission to finish the Python 3 port, which is now almost merged.  Testers should probably wait until it fully merges to the develop branch and we'll yell about it then, but impatient adrenaline enthusiasts may want to check out the hawkowl/py3-3 branch (although it may explode in your face, mangle your DB and format your cat, and probably misses lots of recent important PRs like the 0.33.3.1 stuff).  However, i've been running a variant on some servers for the last few days without problems - and it seems (placebo effect notwithstanding) incredibly snappy...</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Lazy Loaded Member implementation got sped up by 2-3x, which makes /sync roughly 2-3x faster than it would be without Lazy Loading.  This hasn't merged yet, but was the main final blocker behind Lazy Loading going live!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>During the ongoing work to finalise a stable release of Matrix's Server-Server federation API, we've been doing a full audit of Synapse's implementation and have identified a serious vulnerability which we are going to release a security update to address (Synapse 0.33.3.1) on 
<b>Thursday Sept 6th 2018 at 12:00 UTC</b>.</p>
<p>We are coordinating with package maintainers to ensure that patched versions of packages will be available at that time - meanwhile, if you run your own Synapse, <strong>please be prepared to upgrade as soon as the patched versions are released</strong>.  All previous versions of Synapse are affected, so everyone will want to upgrade.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, patience and understanding while we resolve the issue,</p>

                <h2 id="introducing-client-server-api-0-4-and-the-first-ever-stable-is-as-and-push-apis-spec-releases">Introducing Client Server API 0.4, and the first ever stable IS, AS and Push APIs spec releases!</h2>
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>As many know, we've been on a massive sprint to improve the spec - both fixing omissions where features have been implemented in the reference servers but were never formalised in the spec, and fixing bugs where the spec has thinkos which stop us from being able to ratify it as stable and thus fit for purpose .</p>
<p>In practice, our target has been to cut stable releases of all the primary Matrix APIs by the end of August - effectively declaring Matrix out of beta, at least at the specification level.  For context: historically only one API has ever been released as stable - the Client Server API, which was the result of a similar sprint back in Jan 2016. This means that the Server Server (SS) API, Identity Service (IS) API, Application Service (AS) API and Push Gateway API have never had an official stable release - which has obviously been problematic for those implementing them.</p>
<p>However, as of the end of Friday Aug 31, we're proud to announce the first ever stable releases of the <a href="/docs/spec">IS, AS and Push APIs</a>!</p>
<p><a href="/docs/spec"><img src="/_matrix/media/v1/download/t2l.io/587a1a86905b1e0e8f9342d76e57ffbe" /></a>
To the best of our knowledge, these API specs are now complete and accurately describe all the current behaviour implemented in the reference implementations (sydent, synapse and sygnal) and are fit for purpose. Any deviation from the spec in the reference implementations should probably be considered a bug in the impl. All changes take the form of filling in spec omissions and adding clarifications to the existing behaviour in order to get things to the point that an independent party can implement these APIs without having to refer to anything other than the spec.</p>
<p>This is the result of a lot of work which spans the whole Spec Core Team, but has been particularly driven by TravisR, who has taken the lead on this whole mission to improve the spec.  Huge thanks are due to Travis for his work here, and also massive thanks to everyone who has <del>suffered</del> <del>endured</del> reviewed his PRs and contributed to the releases.  The spec is looking unrecognisably better for it - and Matrix 1.0 is feeling closer than ever!</p>
<p>Alongside the work on the IS/AS/Push APIs, there has also been a massive attempt to plug all the spec omissions in the Client Server API.  Historically the CS API releases have missed some of the newer APIs (and of course always miss the ones which postdate a given release), but we've released the APIs which /have/ been specified as stable in order to declare them stable.  However, in this release we've tried to go through and fill in as many remaining gaps as possible.</p>
<p>The result is the release of <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html">Client Server API version 0.4</a>. This is a huge update - increasing the size of the CS API by ~40%. The biggest new stuff includes fully formalising support for end-to-end encryption (thanks to Zil0!), versioning for rooms (so we can upgrade rooms to new versions of the protocol), synchronised read markers, user directories, server ACLs, MSISDN 3rd party ids, and .well-known server discovery (not that it's widely used yet), but for the full picture, best bet is to look at <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#changelog">the changelog</a> (now managed by <a href="https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/">towncrier</a>!).  It's probably fair to say that the CS API is growing alarmingly large at this point - Chrome says that it'd be 223 A4 pages if printed. Our solution to this will be to refactor it somehow (and perhaps switch to a more compact representation of the contents).</p>
<p>Some things got deliberately missed from the CS 0.4 release: particularly membership Lazy Loading (because we're still testing it out and haven't released it properly in the wild yet), the various GDPR-specific APIs (because they may evolve a bit as we refine them since the original launch), finalising ID grammars in the overall spec (because this is surprisingly hard and subtle and we don't want to rush it) and finally Communities (aka Groups), as they are still somewhat in flux.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the Server to Server API, there has also been a massive amount of work.  Since the beginning of July it's 
<b>tripled</b> in size as we've filled in the gaps, over the course of &gt;200 commits (&gt;150 of which from Travis).  If you take a look at the <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/unstable.html">current snapshot</a> it's pretty unrecognisable from the historical draft; with the main changes being:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adding the new State Resolution algorithm to address flaws in the original one.  This has been where much of our time has gone - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1441">MSC1442</a> for full details.  Adopting the new algorithm requires rooms to be recreated; we'll write more about this in the near future when we actually roll it out.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adding room versioning so we can upgrade to the new State Resolution algorithm.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Everything is now properly expressed as Swagger (OpenAPI), just like the CS API
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adding all the details for E2E encryption (including dependencies like to-device messaging and device-list synchronisation)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Improvements in specifying how to authorize inbound events over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document federation APIs such as /event_auth and /query_auth and /get_missing_events
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document 3rd party invites over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document the /user/* federation endpoints
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document Server ACLs
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document read receipts over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document presence over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document typing notifications over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document content repository over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document room directory over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">...and many many other minor bug fixes, omission fixes, and restructuring for coherency - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1464">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1464</a> for an even longer list :)
</li>
</ul>
However, we haven't finished it all: despite our best efforts we're running slightly past the original target of Aug 31.  The current state of play for the r0 release overall (in terms of pending issues) is:
<a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-16.56.18.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3525" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-16.56.18.png" alt="" width="576" height="214" /></a>...and you can see the full breakdown over at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/1">public Github project dashboard</a>.
<p>The main stuff we still have remaining on the Server/Server API at this point is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Better specifying how we validate inbound events. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1646">MSC1646</a> for details & progress.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Switching event IDs to be hashes. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1640">MSC1640</a> for details and progress.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Various other remaining security considerations (e.g. how to handle malicious auth events in the DAG; how to better handle DoS situations).
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Merging in the changes to authoring m.room.power_levels (as per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1304">MSC1304</a>)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Formally specifying the remaining identifiers which lack a formal grammar - <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1598">MSC1597</a> and particularly room aliases (
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1607">MSC1608</a>)
</li>
</ul>
The plan here is to continue speccing and implementing these at top priority (with Travis continuing to work fulltime on spec work), and we'll obviously keep you up-to-date on progress.  Some of the changes here (e.g. event IDs) are quite major and we definitely want to implement them before speccing them, so we're just going to have to keep going as fast as we can. Needless to say we want to cut an r0 of the S2S API alongside the others asap and declare Matrix out of beta (at least at the spec level :)
<p>In terms of visualising progress on this spec mission it's interesting to look at the rate at which we've been closing PRs: this graph shows the total number of PRs which are in state ‘open' or ‘closed' on any given day:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-00.56.38.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3526" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-00.56.38-1024x722.png" alt="" width="1024" height="722" /></a></p>
<p>...which clearly shows the original sprint to get the r0 of the CS API out the door at the end 2015, and then a more leisurely pace until the beginning of July 2018 since which the pace has picked up massively.  Other ways of looking at include the number of open issues...</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3527" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-1-1024x691.png" alt="" width="1024" height="691" /></a>
...or indeed the number of commits per week…</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.02.27.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3528" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.02.27-1024x195.png" alt="" width="710" height="135" /></a>
...or the overall Github Project activity for August.  (It's impressive to see Zil0 sneaking in there on second place on the commit count, thanks to all his GSoC work documenting E2E encryption in the spec as part of implementing it in matrix-python-sdk!)</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.03.57.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3529" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.03.57-1024x925.png" alt="" width="744" height="672" /></a>
Anyway, enough numerology.  It's worth noting that all of the dev for r0 has generally followed the proposed <a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">Open Governance Model for Matrix</a>, with the core spec team made up of both historical core team folk (erik, richvdh, dave &amp; matthew), new core team folk (uhoreg &amp; travis) and community folk (kitsune, anoa &amp; mujx) working together to review and approve the changes - and we've been doing MSCs (albeit with an accelerated pace) for anything which we feel requires input from the wider community.  Once the Server/Server r0 release is out the door we'll be finalising the open governance model and switching to a slightly more measured (but productive!) model of spec development as outlined there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Matrix 1.0 gets ever closer.  With (almost) all this spec mission done, our plan is to focus more on improving the reference implementations - particularly performance in Synapse, 
UX in matrix-{'{'}react,ios,android{'}'}-sdk as used by Riot (especially for E2E encryption), and then declare a 1.0 and get back to implementing new features (particularly Editable Messages and Reactions) at last.</p>
<p>We'd like to thank everyone for your patience whilst we've been playing catch up on the spec, and hope you agree it's been worth the effort :)</p>
<p>Matthew &amp; the core spec team.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We've just released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.0">Synapse 0.33.0</a>!  This is a <strong>major performance upgrade</strong> which speeds up /sync (i.e. receiving messages) by a factor of almost 2x!  This has already made a massive difference to the CPU usage and snappiness of the matrix.org homeserver since we rolled it out a few days ago - you can see the drop in sync worker CPU just before midday on July 17th; previously we were regularly hitting the CPU ceiling (at which point everything grinds to a halt) - now we're back down hovering between 40% and 60% CPU (at the current load).  This is actually fixing a bug which crept in around Synapse 0.31, so please upgrade - especially if Synapse has been feeling slower than usual recently, and especially if you are still on Synapse 0.31.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-19-at-13.00.01-1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3406" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-19-at-13.00.01-1-1024x639.png" alt="" width="813" height="507" /></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile we have a <strong>lot</strong> of new stuff coming on the horizon - a whole new algorithm for state resolution (watch this space for details); incremental state resolution (at last!) to massively speed up state resolution and mitigate extremities build up (and speed up the synapse master process, which is now the bottleneck again on the matrix.org homeserver); better admin tools for managing resource usage, and all the Python3 porting work (with associated speedups and RAM &amp; GC improvements).  Fun times ahead!</p>
<p>The full changelog follows below; as always you can grab Synapse from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.   Thanks for flying Matrix!</p>

                <p>Welcome to TWIM for Friday the 13th! Nothing too scary, but lots of client updates and news.</p>
<h2 id="quaternion">Quaternion</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> has gained a new <code>/html</code> command that allows one to send raw HTML. Note that an actually displayed HTML subset entirely depends on the receiving client; no HTML validation or sanitation is done; a plaintext version is automatically created by stripping all the HTML tags.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="neo">neo</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:lain.haus">f0x</a> is working on <a href="https://github.com/f0x52/neo">Neo</a> again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>added emotes, working localecho and <code>/rainbow</code></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="matrix-logger">matrix-logger</h2>
<p>A useful tool from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@CromFr:matrix.org">CromFr</a> for anyone who wants to archive logs of rooms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a small matrix &quot;client&quot; for logging messages in joined rooms, and store them in a format very similar to Weechat logs.
<a href="https://gitlab.com/CromFr/matrix-logger/tree/master">Source code (Rust)</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/CromFr/matrix-logger/tags">Binary release (x86_64 windows &amp; linux)</a>
Please open issues if encounter any bug or need specific features.\nAlso I'm new to rust, so any review / advices would be appreciated :)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="matrique-client-progress">Matrique client progress</h2>
<p><a href="http://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> has been working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/matrique-go">Matrique</a>, and it's looking really good! Screenshot below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrique now has support for sending/receiving messages (plaintext, markdown, HTML, rainbow), emotes and notices. It also supports receiving images, videos, files and states. I am still working on file receiving functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love that all clients include rainbow messages.</p>
<h2 id="fluffychat-for-ubuntu-touch">fluffychat for Ubuntu Touch</h2>
<p>New to me, <a href="https://github.com/ChristianPauly/fluffychat">fluffychat</a> is a &quot;Simple Matrix Messenger for <a href="https://ubports.com">Ubuntu Touch</a>&quot;. The design philosophy for this app is focused on simplicity, and the hope is for it to complement <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a>, another Ubuntu Touch client.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are you not just contributing to uMatriks?
uMatriks is great and it's superb, that someone has created a Matrix Client for Ubuntu Touch. But sometimes you have a so detailed vision of a user interface, which you want to implement, that you can not just contribute to an existing project. However, I would like to work with the uMatriks developers together. We could use the same push gateway for example.</p>
