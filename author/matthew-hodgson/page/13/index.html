                <p>As a follow-on to the previous post, Apple approved version 0.4.0 of the iOS Matrix Console app over the weekend - <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/matrix-console/id970074271?mt=8">grab it now from the app store!</a>.  Whilst cosmetically it looks almost identical to 0.3.x, the architecture is completely different given the app is now built using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-kit">MatrixKit</a> - and stability has improved considerably as a result.  Please install and let us know how you get on!</p>

<p>Synapse has had support for exporting a comprehensive range of metrics via HTTP since 0.8.1 - we added this to help quantify the benefits of all the performance work which is going on currently in advance of Synapse 0.9. If you're interested in monitoring your own synapse and seeing what's going on using something like Prometheus, Leo just wrote a quick tutorial on getting up and running:</p>
<h4 id="how-to-monitor-synapse-metrics-using-prometheus">How to monitor Synapse metrics using Prometheus</h4>
<dl>
<dt>1: Install prometheus:</dt><dd>Follow instructions at <a href="http://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/install/">http://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/install/</a></dd>
<dt>2: Enable synapse metrics:</dt><dd>Simply setting a (local) port number will enable it. Pick a port. prometheus itself defaults to 9090, so starting just above that for locally monitored services seems reasonable. E.g. 9092:
<p>Add to homeserver.yaml</p>
<pre>metrics_port: 9092</pre>
<p>Restart synapse</p>
</dd>
<dt>3: Check out synapse-prometheus-config</dt><dd><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse-prometheus-config">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse-prometheus-config</a></dd>
<dt>4: Add <code>synapse.html</code> and <code>synapse.rules</code></dt><dd>The <code>.html</code> file needs to appear in prometheus's <code>consoles</code> directory, and the <code>.rules</code> file needs to be invoked somewhere in the main config file. A symlink to each from the git checkout into the prometheus directory might be easiest to ensure <code>git pull</code> keeps it updated.</dd>
<dt>5: Add a prometheus target for synapse</dt><dd>This is easiest if prometheus runs on the same machine as synapse, as it can then just use localhost:
<pre>global: {'{'}
  rule_file: "synapse.rules"
{'}'}
<p>job: {'{'}
name: &quot;synapse&quot;</p>
<p>target_group: {'{'}
target: &quot;http://localhost:9092/&quot;
{'}'}
{'}'}
</pre></p>
</dd>
<dt>6: Start prometheus:</dt><dd><pre>./prometheus -config.file=prometheus.conf
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>7: Wait a few seconds for it to start and perform the first scrape,</dt><dd>then visit the console:
<pre><a href="http://server-where-prometheus-runs:9090/consoles/synapse.html">http://server-where-prometheus-runs:9090/consoles/synapse.html</a></pre>
</dd></dl>
<p>And the end result looks something like...</p>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-23-at-16.32.01.png"><img src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-23-at-16.32.01-1024x930.png" alt="Prometheus screenshot" width="1024" height="930" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-905" /></a></p>
<p>...amongst many many other system &amp; application metrics.</p>

                <p>As of 9am tomorrow, somewhere in the depths of East London (and remotely from around the world), a diaspora of elite VoIP/WebRTC/Telco developers will compete to build the most innovative and impressive communications demos at <a href="http://tadhack.com/2015/tadhack-mini-london/">Tadhack Mini London</a>!  Dave, Oddvar and myself are going to be there from the core Matrix.org team, both on-site and online (at <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a>, of course) to provide support - especially to everyone who's using Matrix APIs in their solution.  And as we mentioned before, we'll even be giving away <a href="/blog/2015/03/19/tadhack-mini-london">two Parrot Bebop Drones</a> to the best hacks built using Matrix!</p>
<p>It's not too late to get involved - the more the merrier.  We reckon it's going to be a really fun weekend, so look forward to chatting to some of you soon!</p>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>As of today you can install the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/matrix-console/id970074271">basic reference Matrix client</a> on iOS from the App Store.  We've called the app &quot;Matrix Console&quot; to try to make it clear that it's very much a developer/poweruser tool for experimenting with Matrix and showcasing the Matrix APIs and an example of how to use the iOS SDK - whilst it can be used as a great replacement to IRC, it's by no means meant to be a glossy polished app like Hangouts or Slack.</p>
<p>Meanwhile you can also get <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.matrix.androidsdk.alpha">the Android version of Console</a> at the Google Play Store as we mentioned in the last post.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/matrix-console/id970074271"><img src="http://matrix.org/img/screenie.jpg" width="375" height="667" alt="iOS screenshot" class="aligncenter" /></a></p>
<p>Needless to say, they're both entirely open-source (Apache license) and you can grab the code from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk</a> respectively if you want to play with your own copy.</p>
<p>The mobile apps currently act very similarly to <a href="http://matrix.org/beta">the reference web app</a> - providing group chat (text/images/video etc) in decentralised public and private rooms, with room history kept in sync across all your different Matrix-enabled apps.  They don't yet do VoIP, although we're working on it.  Please give the apps a go and file all your bugs and feedback into <a href="http://matrix.org/jira">JIRA</a> or <a href="/beta/#/room/#ios:matrix.org">#ios:matrix.org</a> and <a href="/beta/#/room/#android:matrix.org">#android:matrix.org</a> so we can make them even better :)</p>
<p>The iOS app in particular showcases one of the coolest new features in Matrix: the ability for homeservers to support highly configurable push notifications, ensuring you never miss messages on Matrix ever again.  The way this works is that when you install the Matrix Console app from iTunes and log in, the app tells your homeserver to send push notifications to a simple push server on Matrix.org running the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">sygnal</a> codebase (you can also run your own sygnal for your own Matrix apps).  You can then configure some excitingly comprehensive push settings in the settings page of the web client (we haven't exposed the UI to configure these on the mobile apps yet) to configure what events in Matrix should trigger push notifications - and then you will automatically receive the desired pushes even when the app isn't running.</p>
<p>We think this is incredibly powerful: there are no longer <em>any</em> client-side notification settings.  Instead, all your notifications are stored server-side - per-room, per-user, per-word and as many other extensible rules as you desire (plus some helpful common special cases).  This means that the rules that determine whether you see notifications on the desktop from the webclient are <em>identical</em> to the notifications you receive push notifications on your mobile devices.  We hope this is a huge improvement over the inflexible notification rules that iMessage, Hangouts etc push onto you (so to speak).</p>
<p>To support the new push rules we've just released a new version of the web client - 0.6.5.  This implements the new rule configuration UI - see below for example UI.</p>
<img src="http://matrix.org/img/push-settings.jpg" width="988" height="1252" alt="push settings UI" class="aligncenter" />
<p>The full list of changes in matrix-angular-sdk 0.6.5 is as per below.  We hope you enjoy the new clients and push settings - thanks for flying Matrix :)</p>
<pre>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>What with the chaos of Mobile World Congress last week we seem to have been hoarding releases - so here's what's been happening!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse 0.8.0</a> was released this afternoon.  This is a major performance/stability release, with lots of good stuff going on - especially adding more customisable push notification support APIs for iOS/Android; support for registering accounts from mobile devices; extensions to the new Application Service API and lots of federation improvements and bug fixes.  <b>Please upgrade at your earliest convenience.</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile, we quietly released the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.matrix.androidsdk.alpha">Matrix Console</a> Android example app to the Google Play last week, alongside <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">v0.2.2 of the Android SDK</a> - release notes below.  There'll be a new version of the Android Console app out tomorrow, but mentioning here for completeness and to share the release notes.  Also, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">iOS SDK is now on v0.3.1</a>, with lots of performance and usability improvements.</p>
<p>Finally, we have a whole new official <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">Matrix client SDK for JavaScript</a>, all packaged up ready for use by Node developers and JS purists alike as an NPM with minimal dependencies.  Meanwhile, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-angular-sdk">matrix-angular-sdk</a> has been switched to use matrix-js-sdk from now on.  You can use the plain JS API with a <code>npm install matrix-js-sdk</code> and then:</p>
<pre>
var sdk = require("matrix-js-sdk");
var client = sdk.createClient("https://matrix.org");
client.publicRooms(function(err, data) {'{'}
    console.log("Public Rooms: %s", JSON.stringify(data));
{'}'});

</pre>
<p>Meanwhile, release notes for all &amp; sundry lie below.</p>

  they are using (e.g. mobile devices).

* Added new default push rules and made them configurable by clients:

  * Suppress all notice messages.
  * Notify when invited to a new room.
  * Notify for messages that don't match any rule.
  * Notify on incoming call.

Federation:

* Added per host server side rate-limiting of incoming federation requests.
* Added a ``/get_missing_events/`` API to federation to reduce number of
  ``/events/`` requests.

Configuration:

<p>Just a quick heads up that we'll be attending <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com">Mobile World Congress</a> (Mar 2-5) this year, chatting to the telco community about how they can benefit from Matrix; encouraging companies to build gateways, servers and clients and generally trying to grow the Matrix ecosystem.  If you're going to be there and are interested in finding out more, please mail us (matrix at matrix.org) to arrange a meeting - we'll be hanging out at the OpenMarket (8.1D113) and the Amdocs (3G10) booths.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We released Synapse 0.7.1 this morning - <strong>This release includes more critical federation stability and performance updates - please upgrade as soon as you can!</strong>.  You can get the code and installation instructions from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a> as normal.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> You can also install and run Synapse now via <a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a>, thanks to a Dockerfile at <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/silviof/docker-matrix/">https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/silviof/docker-matrix/</a> contributed today by Silvio Fricke.  Thanks Silvio!!</p>
<p>Other than the federation improvements, the big new feature that lands here is the long-awaited Application Service API.  This is a set of simple extensions to the Client-Server API to make it much easier to build powerful gateways and other application logic on top of Matrix.  You can think of it being somewhere between IRC Services, IMS application services and XMPP components - but with the simplicity of an IRC bot.  The extensions let you register application services as privileged Matrix clients, and create virtual users and virtual rooms in bulk within Matrix (e.g. bridging an entire IRC network into Matrix).  The API also lets your application service receive inbound events as HTTP pushes rather than having to poll.  The end result is that it's suddenly become <strong>a lot</strong> easier to bridge existing communities with Matrix!</p>
<p>We'll post another blog post shortly to give a lot more information; in the interim you can read more about it in the newly updated spec at <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api">http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api</a>.</p>

                <p>We just pushed out a major new release of <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse 0.7.0</a>, the python reference server for Matrix, and a minor maintenance update for <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-angular-sdk">matrix-angular-sdk 0.6.2</a>, the reference web client implementation.</p>
<p>The emphasis here has been on federation performance and stability - with all the recent interest from <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/matrix/">FOSDEM</a> and <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/632572">LWN</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8997844">HackerNews</a> we've been getting a lot of traffic on matrix.org and new servers federating up, so we've been busy profiling and fixing performance on some of the hot paths by adding in-memory caches and similar.</p>
<p><b>This release is <em>highly</em> recommended if you are running a federated server, as it fixes many denial-of-service failure modes in the federation implementation, as well as many performance improvements</b></p>
<p>Behind the scenes, there's also lots of work going on for v2 of the Client-Server API (which lets you filter the events your client subscribes to in a room, and combines the 'initial sync' and 'eventstream' APIs into a single simplified '/sync' API) - the alpha of this has landed in 0.7.0, but we don't recommend trying to use it yet. Meanwhile the Application Service API is effectively finished, but hasn't landed on the master branch yet. Synapse also finally has initial support for push notifications for the iOS client now via the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">sygnal</a> APNS gateway, although we need to actually document how to set this up to be usable in general.</p>
<p>Finally, we have switched to recommending that synapse is installed in a virtualenv rather than into ~/.local, due to various problems with how setup.py's dependency management works. Instructions on setting up a virtualenv can be found in the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/README.rst">README</a>.</p>
<p>On the clientside: we've improved performance, enabled identicons for unknown users, and now fully support OpenWebRTC for VoIP calling from Safari, Bowser, and other OpenWebRTC-capable browsers!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone running servers - please upgrade, tell your friends, and help us grow Matrix!</p>
<pre>
Changes in synapse v0.7.0 (2015-02-12)
======================================

* Add initial implementation of the query auth federation API, allowing
  servers to agree on whether an event should be allowed or rejected.
* Persist events we have rejected from federation, fixing the bug where
  servers would keep requesting the same events.
* Various federation performance improvements, including:
  - Add in memory caches on queries such as:
     * Computing the state of a room at a point in time, used for
       authorization on federation requests.
     * Fetching events from the database.
     * User's room membership, used for authorizing presence updates.
  - Upgraded JSON library to improve parsing and serialisation speeds.
* Add default avatars to new user accounts using pydenticon library.
* Correctly time out federation requests.
* Retry federation requests against different servers.
* Add support for push notifications and push rules.
* Add alpha versions of proposed new CSv2 APIs, including ``/sync`` API.
