                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>As of today you can install the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/matrix-console/id970074271">basic reference Matrix client</a> on iOS from the App Store.  We've called the app &quot;Matrix Console&quot; to try to make it clear that it's very much a developer/poweruser tool for experimenting with Matrix and showcasing the Matrix APIs and an example of how to use the iOS SDK - whilst it can be used as a great replacement to IRC, it's by no means meant to be a glossy polished app like Hangouts or Slack.</p>
<p>Meanwhile you can also get <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.matrix.androidsdk.alpha">the Android version of Console</a> at the Google Play Store as we mentioned in the last post.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/matrix-console/id970074271"><img src="http://matrix.org/img/screenie.jpg" width="375" height="667" alt="iOS screenshot" class="aligncenter" /></a>
</p>
<p>Needless to say, they're both entirely open-source (Apache license) and you can grab the code from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk</a> respectively if you want to play with your own copy.</p>
<p>The mobile apps currently act very similarly to <a href="http://matrix.org/beta">the reference web app</a> - providing group chat (text/images/video etc) in decentralised public and private rooms, with room history kept in sync across all your different Matrix-enabled apps.  They don't yet do VoIP, although we're working on it.  Please give the apps a go and file all your bugs and feedback into <a href="http://matrix.org/jira">JIRA</a> or <a href="/beta/#/room/#ios:matrix.org">#ios:matrix.org</a> and <a href="/beta/#/room/#android:matrix.org">#android:matrix.org</a> so we can make them even better :)</p>
<p>The iOS app in particular showcases one of the coolest new features in Matrix: the ability for homeservers to support highly configurable push notifications, ensuring you never miss messages on Matrix ever again.  The way this works is that when you install the Matrix Console app from iTunes and log in, the app tells your homeserver to send push notifications to a simple push server on Matrix.org running the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">sygnal</a> codebase (you can also run your own sygnal for your own Matrix apps).  You can then configure some excitingly comprehensive push settings in the settings page of the web client (we haven't exposed the UI to configure these on the mobile apps yet) to configure what events in Matrix should trigger push notifications - and then you will automatically receive the desired pushes even when the app isn't running.</p>
<p>We think this is incredibly powerful: there are no longer <em>any</em> client-side notification settings.  Instead, all your notifications are stored server-side - per-room, per-user, per-word and as many other extensible rules as you desire (plus some helpful common special cases).  This means that the rules that determine whether you see notifications on the desktop from the webclient are <em>identical</em> to the notifications you receive push notifications on your mobile devices.  We hope this is a huge improvement over the inflexible notification rules that iMessage, Hangouts etc push onto you (so to speak).</p>
<p>To support the new push rules we've just released a new version of the web client - 0.6.5.  This implements the new rule configuration UI - see below for example UI.</p>
<img src="http://matrix.org/img/push-settings.jpg" width="988" height="1252" alt="push settings UI" class="aligncenter" />
<p>The full list of changes in matrix-angular-sdk 0.6.5 is as per below.  We hope you enjoy the new clients and push settings - thanks for flying Matrix :)</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>What with the chaos of Mobile World Congress last week we seem to have been hoarding releases - so here's what's been happening!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse 0.8.0</a> was released this afternoon.  This is a major performance/stability release, with lots of good stuff going on - especially adding more customisable push notification support APIs for iOS/Android; support for registering accounts from mobile devices; extensions to the new Application Service API and lots of federation improvements and bug fixes.  <b>Please upgrade at your earliest convenience.</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile, we quietly released the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.matrix.androidsdk.alpha">Matrix Console</a> Android example app to the Google Play last week, alongside <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">v0.2.2 of the Android SDK</a> - release notes below.  There'll be a new version of the Android Console app out tomorrow, but mentioning here for completeness and to share the release notes.  Also, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">iOS SDK is now on v0.3.1</a>, with lots of performance and usability improvements.</p>
<p>Finally, we have a whole new official <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">Matrix client SDK for JavaScript</a>, all packaged up ready for use by Node developers and JS purists alike as an NPM with minimal dependencies.  Meanwhile, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-angular-sdk">matrix-angular-sdk</a> has been switched to use matrix-js-sdk from now on.  You can use the plain JS API with a <code>npm install matrix-js-sdk</code> and then:</p>
<pre>
var sdk = require("matrix-js-sdk");
var client = sdk.createClient("https://matrix.org");
client.publicRooms(function(err, data) {'{'}
    console.log("Public Rooms: %s", JSON.stringify(data));
{'}'});

</pre>
<p>
Meanwhile, release notes for all &amp; sundry lie below.
</p>
<pre>

                <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Just a quick heads up that we'll be attending <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com">Mobile World Congress</a> (Mar 2-5) this year, chatting to the telco community about how they can benefit from Matrix; encouraging companies to build gateways, servers and clients and generally trying to grow the Matrix ecosystem.  If you're going to be there and are interested in finding out more, please mail us (matrix at matrix.org) to arrange a meeting - we'll be hanging out at the OpenMarket (8.1D113) and the Amdocs (3G10) booths.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We released Synapse 0.7.1 this morning - <strong>This release includes more critical federation stability and performance updates - please upgrade as soon as you can!</strong>.  You can get the code and installation instructions from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a> as normal.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> You can also install and run Synapse now via <a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a>, thanks to a Dockerfile at <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/silviof/docker-matrix/">https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/silviof/docker-matrix/</a> contributed today by Silvio Fricke.  Thanks Silvio!!</p>
<p>Other than the federation improvements, the big new feature that lands here is the long-awaited Application Service API.  This is a set of simple extensions to the Client-Server API to make it much easier to build powerful gateways and other application logic on top of Matrix.  You can think of it being somewhere between IRC Services, IMS application services and XMPP components - but with the simplicity of an IRC bot.  The extensions let you register application services as privileged Matrix clients, and create virtual users and virtual rooms in bulk within Matrix (e.g. bridging an entire IRC network into Matrix).  The API also lets your application service receive inbound events as HTTP pushes rather than having to poll.  The end result is that it's suddenly become <strong>a lot</strong> easier to bridge existing communities with Matrix!</p>
<p>We'll post another blog post shortly to give a lot more information; in the interim you can read more about it in the newly updated spec at <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api">http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api</a>.</p>

                <p>We just pushed out a major new release of <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse 0.7.0</a>, the python reference server for Matrix, and a minor maintenance update for <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-angular-sdk">matrix-angular-sdk 0.6.2</a>, the reference web client implementation.</p>
<p>The emphasis here has been on federation performance and stability - with all the recent interest from <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/matrix/">FOSDEM</a> and <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/632572">LWN</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8997844">HackerNews</a> we've been getting a lot of traffic on matrix.org and new servers federating up, so we've been busy profiling and fixing performance on some of the hot paths by adding in-memory caches and similar.</p>
<p><b>This release is <em>highly</em> recommended if you are running a federated server, as it fixes many denial-of-service failure modes in the federation implementation, as well as many performance improvements</b></p>
<p>Behind the scenes, there's also lots of work going on for v2 of the Client-Server API (which lets you filter the events your client subscribes to in a room, and combines the 'initial sync' and 'eventstream' APIs into a single simplified '/sync' API) - the alpha of this has landed in 0.7.0, but we don't recommend trying to use it yet. Meanwhile the Application Service API is effectively finished, but hasn't landed on the master branch yet. Synapse also finally has initial support for push notifications for the iOS client now via the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">sygnal</a> APNS gateway, although we need to actually document how to set this up to be usable in general.</p>
<p>Finally, we have switched to recommending that synapse is installed in a virtualenv rather than into ~/.local, due to various problems with how setup.py's dependency management works. Instructions on setting up a virtualenv can be found in the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/README.rst">README</a>.</p>
<p>On the clientside: we've improved performance, enabled identicons for unknown users, and now fully support OpenWebRTC for VoIP calling from Safari, Bowser, and other OpenWebRTC-capable browsers!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone running servers - please upgrade, tell your friends, and help us grow Matrix!</p>
<p> </p>

                <p>Happy 2015 from everyone at Matrix.org!</p>
<p>We're excited to kick off the new year with a major performance upgrade for Synapse: having had a chance to do some profiling over the Christmas break, Synapse 0.6.1 improves performance by up to an order of magnitude thanks to optimising the way events are constructed and manipulated, DB optimisations, etc.  Suddenly things are feeling <em>much</em> more snappy and less of a PoC and more of a real system, which hopefully bodes well for 2015!  Please upgrade if you're running a homeserver, or install one if you're not - grab the code from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.</p>
<p>The iOS SDK and demo app has also been improving lots in the last few weeks - grab the latest code from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk</a>.  We have zoomable image support; full support for the new media repository in Synapse 0.6.0; file transfer status UI; offline support; snappy message synchronisation and more...</p>
<p>We also released a new simple Python SDK client library for Python called <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/matrix-client">matrix-client</a>, which is now being used by <a href="https://github.com/Kegsay/Matrix-NEB">NEB</a> (our general-purpose Matrix helper bot).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our (constantly evolving) plan for the beginning of 2015 is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Finish v2 of the client-server API based on all the lessons learnt since launch: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/4">draft in progress here</a></li>	 
        <li>Finish the Application Services API to allow proper gateways and services in and out of Matrix at last:<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/5">draft in progress here</a></li>
        <li>Re-release the spec based on the above</li>
        <li>Build robust gateways (IRC, XMPP, SIP and more) on top of the AS API</li>
        <li>Polish and release the iOS, Android demo clients - including push notification and VoIP support!</li>
        <li>Overhaul the identity server architecture and add end-to-end crypto</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the rate at which Matrix is maturing, the next few months should be really exciting - please come join us on <a href="http://matrix.org/beta">#matrix:matrix.org</a> and get involved!</p>
<code>
Changes in synapse 0.6.1 (2015-01-07)
=====================================
<ul>
<li>Major optimizations to improve performance of initial sync and event sending
in large rooms (by up to 10x)</li>
<li>Media repository now includes a Content-Length header on media downloads.</li>
<li>Improve quality of thumbnails by changing resizing algorithm.</li>
</ul>

                <p>Last week we had a great time attending WebRTC Conference Expo Paris 2014 - chatting to lots of new folks about Matrix; speaking in the &quot;To Build or Not To Build&quot; panel discussion; giving a general presentation on Matrix, and participating in the Demo shoot-out.</p>
<p>And we're very proud to say that we won the <a href="http://blog.uppersideconferences.com/award-winners-webrtc-2014-conference-expo/">Best Innovation Award</a> for a slightly frantic demo, showing an iPad mounted on our pet Trossen Robotics PhantomX Hexapod being used for robot telepresence by streaming video and audio to an Oculus Rift VR headset.  This was using our proprietary in-house WebRTC stack, but once Matrix has fully taken off we hope to share our WebRTC stack with the world too :)  This was a very last minute demo - we wanted to show something different to normal browser-to-browser IM/Video calling via Matrix and had the idea to use the Rift at the last minute - and in fact it still wasn't working when we went on stage (turns out that iOS 8.1 introduces some quirks in the video capture API which were producing corrupt video).  By switching from an iPhone 5S running iOS 8.1 to an iPad running iOS 6 we were able to turn the demo around in the nick of time and get it working live on stage (modulo a RGB&lt;-&gt;BGR colourspace bug) just in time to win the award.  Huge thanks to the jury for voting for us against the odds :D  For those interested in displaying raw video straight onto the Oculus Rift (without using any head-mounted tracking), there's an OpenGL code snippet up at <a href="https://gist.github.com/ara4n/875b5e8b66be3617efb7">https://gist.github.com/ara4n/875b5e8b66be3617efb7</a>.</p>

                <p>We're proud to announce the new 0.6.0 major release of Synapse: the Python reference implementation of Matrix - as well as 0.6.0 of the AngularJS example Matrix client, as a special early Christmas present from the Matrix team :)</p>
<p>The main priority here has been hunting down stability bugs whilst also adding in a few more features.  The most exciting new feature is the new Media/Content API: this allows every homeserver to replicate, cache and thumbnail any files associated with Matrix rooms, rather than relying on retrieving them from the origin homeserver as was previously the case.  This is really cool, as it effectively makes Matrix a distributed content distribution network and gives the same replication semantics to file attachments as to the rest of JSON in rooms.</p>
<p>We've also landed a major new branch which changes the way events are represented internally in order to make them immutable, and fixes a whole range of minor stability issues.  In other news, performance issues are still a work in progress...</p>

<code>
Changes in synapse 0.6.0 (2014-12-19)
=====================================
<ul>
<li>Add new API for media upload and download that supports thumbnailing.</li>
<li>Replicate media uploads over multiple homeservers so media is always served
to clients from their local homeserver.  This obsoletes the
--content-addr parameter and confusion over accessing content directly
from remote homeservers.</li>
<li>Implement exponential backoff when retrying federation requests when
sending to remote homeservers which are offline.</li>
<li>Implement typing notifications.</li>
<li>Fix bugs where we sent events with invalid signatures due to bugs where
we incorrectly persisted events.</li>
<li>Improve performance of database queries involving retrieving events.</li>
</ul>
