                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>What with the chaos of Mobile World Congress last week we seem to have been hoarding releases - so here's what's been happening!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse 0.8.0</a> was released this afternoon.  This is a major performance/stability release, with lots of good stuff going on - especially adding more customisable push notification support APIs for iOS/Android; support for registering accounts from mobile devices; extensions to the new Application Service API and lots of federation improvements and bug fixes.  <b>Please upgrade at your earliest convenience.</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile, we quietly released the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.matrix.androidsdk.alpha">Matrix Console</a> Android example app to the Google Play last week, alongside <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">v0.2.2 of the Android SDK</a> - release notes below.  There'll be a new version of the Android Console app out tomorrow, but mentioning here for completeness and to share the release notes.  Also, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">iOS SDK is now on v0.3.1</a>, with lots of performance and usability improvements.</p>
<p>Finally, we have a whole new official <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">Matrix client SDK for JavaScript</a>, all packaged up ready for use by Node developers and JS purists alike as an NPM with minimal dependencies.  Meanwhile, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-angular-sdk">matrix-angular-sdk</a> has been switched to use matrix-js-sdk from now on.  You can use the plain JS API with a <code>npm install matrix-js-sdk</code> and then:</p>
<pre>
var sdk = require("matrix-js-sdk");
var client = sdk.createClient("https://matrix.org");
client.publicRooms(function(err, data) {'{'}
    console.log("Public Rooms: %s", JSON.stringify(data));
{'}'});

</pre>
<p>Meanwhile, release notes for all &amp; sundry lie below.</p>
<pre>

Changes in synapse v0.8.0 (2015-03-06)

  which allows a user to register for an account, regardless of what client
  they are using (e.g. mobile devices).

* Added new default push rules and made them configurable by clients:

  * Suppress all notice messages.
  * Notify when invited to a new room.
  * Notify for messages that don't match any rule.
  * Notify on incoming call.

Federation:

* Added per host server side rate-limiting of incoming federation requests.
* Added a ``/get_missing_events/`` API to federation to reduce number of
  ``/events/`` requests.

Configuration:

* Added configuration option to disable registration:
  ``disable_registration``.
* Added configuration option to change soft limit of number of open file
  descriptors: ``soft_file_limit``.

                <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Just a quick heads up that we'll be attending <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com">Mobile World Congress</a> (Mar 2-5) this year, chatting to the telco community about how they can benefit from Matrix; encouraging companies to build gateways, servers and clients and generally trying to grow the Matrix ecosystem.  If you're going to be there and are interested in finding out more, please mail us (matrix at matrix.org) to arrange a meeting - we'll be hanging out at the OpenMarket (8.1D113) and the Amdocs (3G10) booths.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We released Synapse 0.7.1 this morning - <strong>This release includes more critical federation stability and performance updates - please upgrade as soon as you can!</strong>.  You can get the code and installation instructions from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a> as normal.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> You can also install and run Synapse now via <a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a>, thanks to a Dockerfile at <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/silviof/docker-matrix/">https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/silviof/docker-matrix/</a> contributed today by Silvio Fricke.  Thanks Silvio!!</p>
<p>Other than the federation improvements, the big new feature that lands here is the long-awaited Application Service API.  This is a set of simple extensions to the Client-Server API to make it much easier to build powerful gateways and other application logic on top of Matrix.  You can think of it being somewhere between IRC Services, IMS application services and XMPP components - but with the simplicity of an IRC bot.  The extensions let you register application services as privileged Matrix clients, and create virtual users and virtual rooms in bulk within Matrix (e.g. bridging an entire IRC network into Matrix).  The API also lets your application service receive inbound events as HTTP pushes rather than having to poll.  The end result is that it's suddenly become <strong>a lot</strong> easier to bridge existing communities with Matrix!</p>
<p>We'll post another blog post shortly to give a lot more information; in the interim you can read more about it in the newly updated spec at <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api">http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api</a>.</p>

                <p>We just pushed out a major new release of <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse 0.7.0</a>, the python reference server for Matrix, and a minor maintenance update for <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-angular-sdk">matrix-angular-sdk 0.6.2</a>, the reference web client implementation.</p>
<p>The emphasis here has been on federation performance and stability - with all the recent interest from <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/matrix/">FOSDEM</a> and <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/632572">LWN</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8997844">HackerNews</a> we've been getting a lot of traffic on matrix.org and new servers federating up, so we've been busy profiling and fixing performance on some of the hot paths by adding in-memory caches and similar.</p>
<p><b>This release is <em>highly</em> recommended if you are running a federated server, as it fixes many denial-of-service failure modes in the federation implementation, as well as many performance improvements</b></p>
<p>Behind the scenes, there's also lots of work going on for v2 of the Client-Server API (which lets you filter the events your client subscribes to in a room, and combines the 'initial sync' and 'eventstream' APIs into a single simplified '/sync' API) - the alpha of this has landed in 0.7.0, but we don't recommend trying to use it yet. Meanwhile the Application Service API is effectively finished, but hasn't landed on the master branch yet. Synapse also finally has initial support for push notifications for the iOS client now via the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">sygnal</a> APNS gateway, although we need to actually document how to set this up to be usable in general.</p>
<p>Finally, we have switched to recommending that synapse is installed in a virtualenv rather than into ~/.local, due to various problems with how setup.py's dependency management works. Instructions on setting up a virtualenv can be found in the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/README.rst">README</a>.</p>
<p>On the clientside: we've improved performance, enabled identicons for unknown users, and now fully support OpenWebRTC for VoIP calling from Safari, Bowser, and other OpenWebRTC-capable browsers!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone running servers - please upgrade, tell your friends, and help us grow Matrix!</p>
<pre>
Changes in synapse v0.7.0 (2015-02-12)
======================================

* Add initial implementation of the query auth federation API, allowing
  servers to agree on whether an event should be allowed or rejected.
* Persist events we have rejected from federation, fixing the bug where
  servers would keep requesting the same events.
* Various federation performance improvements, including:
  - Add in memory caches on queries such as:
     * Computing the state of a room at a point in time, used for
       authorization on federation requests.
     * Fetching events from the database.
     * User's room membership, used for authorizing presence updates.
  - Upgraded JSON library to improve parsing and serialisation speeds.
* Add default avatars to new user accounts using pydenticon library.
* Correctly time out federation requests.
* Retry federation requests against different servers.
* Add support for push notifications and push rules.
* Add alpha versions of proposed new CSv2 APIs, including ``/sync`` API.

</pre>

                <p>Happy 2015 from everyone at Matrix.org!</p>
<p>We're excited to kick off the new year with a major performance upgrade for Synapse: having had a chance to do some profiling over the Christmas break, Synapse 0.6.1 improves performance by up to an order of magnitude thanks to optimising the way events are constructed and manipulated, DB optimisations, etc.  Suddenly things are feeling <em>much</em> more snappy and less of a PoC and more of a real system, which hopefully bodes well for 2015!  Please upgrade if you're running a homeserver, or install one if you're not - grab the code from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.</p>
<p>The iOS SDK and demo app has also been improving lots in the last few weeks - grab the latest code from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk</a>.  We have zoomable image support; full support for the new media repository in Synapse 0.6.0; file transfer status UI; offline support; snappy message synchronisation and more...</p>
<p>We also released a new simple Python SDK client library for Python called <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/matrix-client">matrix-client</a>, which is now being used by <a href="https://github.com/Kegsay/Matrix-NEB">NEB</a> (our general-purpose Matrix helper bot).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our (constantly evolving) plan for the beginning of 2015 is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Finish v2 of the client-server API based on all the lessons learnt since launch: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/4">draft in progress here</a></li>	 
        <li>Finish the Application Services API to allow proper gateways and services in and out of Matrix at last:<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/5">draft in progress here</a></li>
        <li>Re-release the spec based on the above</li>
        <li>Build robust gateways (IRC, XMPP, SIP and more) on top of the AS API</li>
        <li>Polish and release the iOS, Android demo clients - including push notification and VoIP support!</li>
        <li>Overhaul the identity server architecture and add end-to-end crypto</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the rate at which Matrix is maturing, the next few months should be really exciting - please come join us on <a href="http://matrix.org/beta">#matrix:matrix.org</a> and get involved!</p>

                <p>Last week we had a great time attending WebRTC Conference Expo Paris 2014 - chatting to lots of new folks about Matrix; speaking in the &quot;To Build or Not To Build&quot; panel discussion; giving a general presentation on Matrix, and participating in the Demo shoot-out.</p>
<p>And we're very proud to say that we won the <a href="http://blog.uppersideconferences.com/award-winners-webrtc-2014-conference-expo/">Best Innovation Award</a> for a slightly frantic demo, showing an iPad mounted on our pet Trossen Robotics PhantomX Hexapod being used for robot telepresence by streaming video and audio to an Oculus Rift VR headset.  This was using our proprietary in-house WebRTC stack, but once Matrix has fully taken off we hope to share our WebRTC stack with the world too :)  This was a very last minute demo - we wanted to show something different to normal browser-to-browser IM/Video calling via Matrix and had the idea to use the Rift at the last minute - and in fact it still wasn't working when we went on stage (turns out that iOS 8.1 introduces some quirks in the video capture API which were producing corrupt video).  By switching from an iPhone 5S running iOS 8.1 to an iPad running iOS 6 we were able to turn the demo around in the nick of time and get it working live on stage (modulo a RGB&lt;-&gt;BGR colourspace bug) just in time to win the award.  Huge thanks to the jury for voting for us against the odds :D  For those interested in displaying raw video straight onto the Oculus Rift (without using any head-mounted tracking), there's an OpenGL code snippet up at <a href="https://gist.github.com/ara4n/875b5e8b66be3617efb7">https://gist.github.com/ara4n/875b5e8b66be3617efb7</a>.</p>

                <p>We're proud to announce the new 0.6.0 major release of Synapse: the Python reference implementation of Matrix - as well as 0.6.0 of the AngularJS example Matrix client, as a special early Christmas present from the Matrix team :)</p>
<p>The main priority here has been hunting down stability bugs whilst also adding in a few more features.  The most exciting new feature is the new Media/Content API: this allows every homeserver to replicate, cache and thumbnail any files associated with Matrix rooms, rather than relying on retrieving them from the origin homeserver as was previously the case.  This is really cool, as it effectively makes Matrix a distributed content distribution network and gives the same replication semantics to file attachments as to the rest of JSON in rooms.</p>
<p>We've also landed a major new branch which changes the way events are represented internally in order to make them immutable, and fixes a whole range of minor stability issues.  In other news, performance issues are still a work in progress...</p>
<p>To get involved, head over to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a> and install and upgrade today!</p>

                <p>One of the final remaining missing bits of Matrix today is specifying and implementing the Application Service (AS) APIs which allow you to easily extend Matrix with custom server-side functionality. The AS APIs should let you perform any arbitrary manipulation on chatroom contents, modulo end-to-end encryption constraints - e.g. machine translation; archiving/searching contents; interactive automated services; conferencing; firing push notifications and other hooks; etc. If you really want to look behind the curtain, the bug tracking the development (somewhat out-of-date) is at <a href="/jira/browse/SPEC-34">SPEC-34</a>.</p>
<p>However, the most obvious use case for this is gatewaying Matrix rooms through to existing communication platforms (XMPP, SIP, non-standardised systems) - which is obviously key to Matrix's overall goal of defragmenting communication.  And the good news is that even though the AS APIs don't yet exist, we can still make good progress here through the existing client-server API.  Anyone who's hung around chat systems like IRC should be familiar with the idea of bots - non-human users who participate in chatrooms and but perform arbitrary automated functionality - and you can go quite a long way in using the 'bot' idiom to add automatic functionality to Matrix.</p>
<p>[In fact the first AS API we'll be adding will probably be simply extending the client-server API with some additional privileges to allow homeserver admins to hook up services to their server which are essentially privileged bots (e.g. ability to autojoin rooms created on that server with high power-level; ability to flag themselves as an invisible 'service bot'; ability to monitor events from rooms without joining them: useful for read-only services such as sending push notifications, adding search/archive functionality; etc).  This should also be familiar to IRC users, as it's similar to the model that IRC Services uses.]</p>
<p>So, we already have a few bots hanging around prototyping out bridging to other systems, which hopefully should evolve into full Application Services (where it makes sense; sometimes a bot is good enough).  For instance, we have the <a href="https://github.com/tm604/Matrix-IRCBridge">Matrix/IRC Bridge</a> thanks to tm604 and LeoNerd.  The way this works is simply a bot which joins IRC channels and their Matrix room equivalents; watching the messages on both sides of the bridge and relaying them to the other side, creating virtual users as required.  In future we can be smarter about having the bridge talk on behalf of actual users, or letting actual users control their virtual users, but it's good enough as a first cut.</p>
<p>So for Friday's <a href="http://www.voipusersconference.org/2014/vuc517-matrix-org/">VUC 517</a>, we decided at the last minute (on Tuesday) to make as much of VUC accessible via Matrix as possible.  One side of this was hooking up the <a href="https://jitsi.org/Projects/JitsiMeet">Jitsi Video Bridge</a> to be accessible by talking to the underlying XMPP server - the other side was hooking up via SIP to the <a href="https://www.zipdx.info">ZipDX audio bridge</a> that is used for audio-only participants in the conference.  Both of these would be done as Matrix bots - a virtual user that you could voice/video call 1:1 over Matrix which would then route your call into VUC appropriately.</p>
<p>By Thursday, the Jitsi bot got to the point of being able to place calls and see a single video stream (picked at random), but the video uplink wasn't getting through and actually selecting the right stream to watch (or viewing multiple streams) wasn't in place either.  I'm sure there'll be a similar blogpost once it's finished, so I'm not going to talk about it further here.  Meanwhile, on Thursday night we hacked together a separate bot to jack into the ZipDX bridge via SIP.  Tim Panton's suggestion was to use <a href="http://www.freeswitch.org">FreeSWITCH</a>'s <a href="https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/mod_verto">mod_verto</a> for this, and after Anthony Minesalle and Mike Jerris from FreeSWITCH had popped up on <a href="http://matrix.org/beta">#matrix:matrix.org</a> on Tuesday to find out what we're up to, this seemed like serendipity.</p>
<p>We hadn't played with mod_verto before, although had been pointed at it by someone on IRC shortly after we released Matrix - it's a cool project from the FreeSWITCH dev team that exposes a simple JSON-RPC interface for call signalling over websockets, providing a much more suitable way for WebRTC developers to get calls in and out of FreeSWITCH than shoehorning a SIP stack into their browser.  In this respect it's quite similar to Matrix, but there are some huge differences:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Verto doesn't (yet) do federation - either for message-passing (like XMPP) or history-replication (like Matrix or XMPP FMUCs).  In fact, Matrix fundamentally competes more with JSON-RPC at OSI layer 5 by defining a standardised RESTful API for federated state synchronisation - which so happens to define some datatypes for VoIP signalling; whereas Verto currently seems to be focused solely on the application-layer problem of VoIP signalling.</li>
	<li>Verto is a generic RPC API with method names like verto.invite, verto.answer, verto.media, verto.bye etc. for handling call signalling.  It's obviously readily extensible to any other functionality expressed as an RPC invocation.  The Matrix client-server API however passes around event objects within the context of a room - it's message passing rather than RPC.</li>
	<li>Matrix's VoIP events support trickle-ICE; announcing ICE candidates from WebRTC as and when they become available.  This good is for speedy call-setup (you don't have to wait for all ICE to complete before setting up the call) and to support call continuity when roaming between different IP networks (in theory).  However, Verto currently requires ICE candidates to be presented monolithically - it hasn't made sense to implement trickle-ICE as FreeSWITCH's core engine doesn't support it yet.</li>
        <li>Verto looks to be wired to speak JSON-RPC over Websockets, whereas Matrix deliberately uses plain old HTTP as its baseline for maximum simplicity and compatibility in PUTting and GETting JSON events around</li>
	<li>Verto could be an interoperable standard but the API hasn't been documented yet (unless I've totally missed it) - to build the bot we looked at the websockets tab in Chrome's network inspector and drew some inferences from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/e43139ac5e1f337d9a82ee16d9a4f15195120ec3/contrib/vertobot/verto-example.json">JSON seen in a call</a> placed using the <a href="https://webrtc.freeswitch.org/verto">FreeSWITCH Verto demo site</a>, which was very intuitive and almost self-documenting.  Meanwhile, the (minimal) doc for Matrix's events is up at <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#voice-over-ip">http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#voice-over-ip</a>.</li>
</ul>
Verto has a huge advantage however, in that FreeSWITCH has a mod_verto today, and doesn't have a mod_matrix - so one can use mod_verto right now as an easy way to get VoIP calls in and out of FreeSWITCH from the web and bridge them to SIP!  So, when writing a Matrix&lt;-&gt;SIP bridging bot for VUC, Verto turned out to be a really nice way to quickly get something up and running.  The end result is at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/e43139ac5e1f337d9a82ee16d9a4f15195120ec3/contrib/vertobot/bot.pl">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/contrib/vertobot/bot.pl</a> - a (precisely!) 300 line perl script built on LeoNerd's <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Net-Async-Matrix">Net-Async-Matrix</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Net::Async::Protocol::WebSocket">Net::Async::Protocol::WebSocket</a> which logs into Matrix and routes any 1:1 audio calls it receives through to the defined mod_verto service.  Currently it gleefully hardcodes in the destination extension it calls and the caller-ID, but this could trivially be extended.  It also chokes on SSL WebSockets, so your mod_verto needs to be listening unencrypted on port 8081.
<p>The task of mapping between Matrix m.call.* VoIP events and Verto verto.* RPC methods was almost entirely trivial (although I hasten to add that Matrix's and Verto's were developed completely independently - it's just that there are only so many ways to express VoIP signalling in JSON!)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Matrix's m.call.invite is equivalent to the combination of verto.invite + verto.media (but may lack ICE candidates)</li>
	<li>Matrix's m.call.candidates has no direct equivalent, so has to be coalesced and merged into verto.media</li>
	<li>Matrix's m.call.answer is equivalent to verto.answer (but may lack ICE candidates)</li>
	<li>Matrix's m.room.displayname is equivalent to verto.display (assuming I understand verto.display)</li>
	<li>Matrix's m.call.hangup is equivalent to verto.bye</li>
	<li>…and these are the only verto RPCs we mapped.</li>
</ul>
For the demo itself, we obviously needed a FreeSWITCH with mod_verto all up and running to hook into the ZipDX bridge: our friends at <a href="http://truphone.com">Truphone</a> were good enough to provide one at zero notice (Thanks James, Andy, Giacomo!), and we were up and running.
<p>Unfortunately we did hit some problems: Net::Async::Matrix has a few quirks which LeoNerd is working out currently; the bot doesn't coalesce the trickle-ICE properly currently causing a race-condition that means ICE setup may fail; Matthew's use of IO::Async was a bit buggy; and moreover we didn't have time to implement DTMF… which was a bit of a shame as you can only unmute yourself on the ZipDX bridge via DTMF *5!</p>
<p>But in general, the mini-hackathon was a success and it was great fun to be able to listen into VUC via the bridge and demonstrate the first ever Matrix&lt;-&gt;SIP call!  The bot ran as @vucbot:matrix.org, although is turned off now as there's no VUC to listen to, and the FreeSWITCH &amp; bot were only deployed temporarily.  Once the kinks mentioned above are sorted out we'll hopefully set it running again permanently!  And hopefully this little bot is an exciting precursor to more robust Matrix bridges and application services in the months to come...</p>
<p>If you're crazy enough to want to try to run the bot yourself, then it should actually be quite simple to get up and running:</p>
<p><code> # grab synapse if you don't have it already
git clone https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse.git synapse-develop

<p>Finally, huge thanks to everyone to helped make the VUC bridging escapade work out - Emil Ivov at Jitsi, James Body, Andy Smith and Giacomo Vacca at Truphone, Anthony Minesalle &amp; Mike Jerris &amp; Brian West at FreeSWITCH for writing freeswitch and mod_verto, Tim Panton for the VUC intro and suggestion of mod_verto, Randy Resnick &amp; Michael Graves at VUC itself, and of course the Matrix team for glueing our side of it together!</p>
<p>Looking forward to lots more ambitious cross-protocol gatewaying and federation in future!</p>

                <p>Since we exited alpha and released Synapse 0.5.0 last week there's been a flurry of bug fix releases as we ran around firefighting some of the more exciting problems which popped up thanks to merging the federation-auth and event-signing branches.</p>
<p>We released 0.5.3a on Nov 27, which seems to now be pretty stable - if you were holding off on upgrading your homeserver and trying to federate with the new 0.5 release branch, now would be a great time to press the button!</p>
<p>Most excitingly, we believe we have <strong>finally fixed the PyNaCL dependency problems</strong> which have plagued pretty much anyone setting up a homeserver.  This was a problem in PyNaCL itself - huge thanks to Mark for hunting it down and sending the PyNaCL team <a href="http://git.io/1Rr5OA">pull</a> <a href="http://git.io/SUHmBA">requests</a> to get it fixed.  As a result, installing synapse as of 0.5.3a really should be a one-liner at last (please let us know if it isn't!):</p>
<p><code>pip install --user --process-dependency-links https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tarball/master</code></p>
<p>The full changelog of what's been going on since 0.5.0 is as follows:</p>
<pre>
Changes in synapse 0.5.3a (2014-11-27)
=====================================

 * Depend on a fixed version of PyNaCL
 * Fix bug that caused joining a remote room to fail if a single event was not
   signed correctly.
 * Fix bug which caused servers to continuously try and fetch events from other
   servers.

Changes in synapse 0.5.2 (2014-11-26)
=====================================

 * Fix major bug that caused rooms to disappear from people's initial sync.

Changes in synapse 0.5.1 (2014-11-26)
=====================================
See UPGRADES.rst for specific instructions on how to upgrade.

 * Fix bug where we served up an Event that did not match its signatures.
 * Fix regression where we no longer correctly handled the case where a
   homeserver receives an event for a room it doesn't recognise (but is in.)
