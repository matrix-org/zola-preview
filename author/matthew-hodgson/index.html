                <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two critical severity vulnerabilities in end-to-end encryption were found in
the SDKs which power Element, Beeper, Cinny, SchildiChat, Circuli, Synod.im
and any other clients based on matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk or
matrix-android-sdk2.</li>
<li>These have now been fixed, and we have not seen evidence of them being
exploited in the wild. All of the critical vulnerabilities require
cooperation from a malicious homeserver to be exploited.</li>
<li><strong>Please upgrade immediately in order to be protected against these
vulnerabilities.</strong></li>
<li>Clients with other encryption implementations (including Hydrogen, ElementX,
Nheko, FluffyChat, Syphon, Timmy, Gomuks and Pantalaimon) are not affected;
<strong>this is not a protocol bug</strong>.</li>
<li>We take the security of our end-to-end encryption extremely seriously, and we
have an ongoing series of public independent audits booked to help guard
against future vulnerabilities.  We will also be making some protocol changes
in the future to provide additional layers of protection.</li>
<li>This resolves the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/23/pre-disclosure-upcoming-critical-security-release-of-matrix-sd-ks-and-clients">pre-disclosure</a> issued on September 23rd.</li>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Every year we do an annual wrap-up and retrospective of all the things happening in the Matrix core team - if you’re feeling particularly curious or bored you can check out the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2015/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-special/">2015</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2016/12/26/the-matrix-holiday-special-2016-edition/">2016</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2017/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-mini-special-2017-edition/">2017</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/12/25/the-2018-matrix-holiday-special/">2018</a> editions for context.  The idea is to look at the bigger picture trends in Matrix outside of the weekly <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix/">TWIM</a> posts to get an idea of the stuff which we made progress on, and the stuff which still remains.</p>
<p>That said, it’s hard to know where to start - Matrix accelerated more than ever before in 2019, and there’s been progress on pretty much all battlefronts.  So as a different format, let’s take the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/12/25/the-2018-matrix-holiday-special#2019">stuff we said we had planned for 2019</a> from the end of last year’s update and see what we actually achieved...</p>
<h4 id="2019-the-immediate-priorities">2019: the immediate priorities</h4>
<p>So, our immediate priorities for 2019 were:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>r0 spec releases across the board (aka Matrix 1.0)</em></li>
<li><em>Implementing them in Synapse</em></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ Well, unless you’ve been floating in a sensory deprivation tank for the last year, hopefully you spotted that Matrix (as a protocol) finally exited beta - starting off with the announcement at FOSDEM in February of the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019/">first stable release of the Server-Server API</a>, alongside the Synapse 0.99.x series as we began the process of migrating to the 1.0 APIs.</p>
<p>Specifically this meant killing off self-signed certificates, adding .well-known server discovery and implementing room version semantics so we could upgrade the underlying room version algorithm to fix the residual flaws.  This culminated in June with the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation/">official release of Matrix 1.0</a> - now including the remaining APIs and a stable release of Synapse 1.0.  The emphasis was on addressing all the main pre-1.0 design flaws rather than adding features or performance, but with 1.0 out the door at last we’ve been able to make progress there too.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Landing the Riot redesign</em></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ The full redesign of Riot’s UI on Web/Desktop landed shortly after FOSDEM in Feb with <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/the-big-1-0-68fa7c6050be">The Big 1.0</a>. Cosmetically we got most of the new look &amp; feel in place, and have had very positive feedback overall - although some of the UX thinkos of the old app remain and coming up on the radar for fixing.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Finalising the Matrix.org Foundation</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>✅ This happened too, coincident with releasing Matrix 1.0 in June - read all about it at <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">https://matrix.org/foundation</a>. So far the governance and legal infrastructure the Foundation provides has helped the project significantly, and while it was a mammoth task to organise, we’re very glad it’s here!  Huge thanks go out to Jon, Ross and Jutta for agreeing to join the foundation as Guardians - they have been excellent in patiently listening to the various dramas of the year and ensuring Matrix’s neutrality and that we keep an even keel.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Landing all the new E2E encryption UX and features</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The good news on E2E encryption is that we’ve been making solid progress throughout the year - the bad news is that we are still yet to turn it on by default.  Progress updates for the various pieces of the puzzle are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>✅ The final UX is pretty much locked down (after several iterations as we try to tread the balance between trustworthiness and security) - here’s a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/wwqBo5oAFfk8XKmtd2YaIs/Cross-signing">sneak preview</a> of what we’re aiming at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🏗 Cross-signing is the single biggest remaining piece of work in progress - letting users attest to the trustworthiness of their own devices, so you only ever have to trust a given user once rather than trusting all their devices individually. We gave a <a href="https://youtu.be/C2eE7rCUKlE?t=2974">very early demo</a> of an experimental implementation back at FOSDEM in Feb, inspired by some of the initial spec proposal at <a href="https://github.com/uhoreg/matrix-doc/blob/cross-signing/proposals/1680-cross-signing.md">MSC1680</a> (MSC = Matrix Spec Change, our <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">process for evolving Matrix</a>).<br/><br/>
However, having played with it a bit, MSC1680 turned out to be too generic and complicated (it worked by the user signing a device with any other of their devices, building a twisted maze of which device vouched for which) - and we replaced it with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1756">MSC1756</a>, which shifts the model to be the simpler “the user has a key, which they use to sign their devices”. However, this in turn requires more infrastructure - you need somewhere secure to store your signing key, which prompted <a href="https://github.com/uhoreg/matrix-doc/blob/ssss/proposals/1946-secure_server-side_storage.md">MSC1946</a> - Secure Secret Storage &amp; Sharing (SSSS): the ability to sync your signing key between devices by storing it (encrypted, of course) on the server.<br/><br/>
Meanwhile, it also became obvious that the primitives for key verification needed to be improved too: introducing verification by emoji comparison (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1267">MSC1267</a>) and QR codes (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1543">MSC1543</a>), and switching key verification to be performed in the context of a DM (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2241">MSC2241</a>) so that you can see your verification history, find verifications, and easily dip in and out of verifying users as needed.<br/><br/>
Whilst everyone else was panicking about Matrix 1.0 and associated baggage, Uhoreg was off in the wilderness plugging his way through all of this - iterating on the design, speccing it and implementing it in synapse and matrix-js-sdk, complete with a test jig to demonstrate it all working (<a href="https://scitech.video/videos/watch/1c8a0262-dee9-4927-b9e9-9856a7f4d8bf">part 1</a> and <a href="https://scitech.video/videos/watch/d1ef04a8-397a-4570-a9a9-cef143ea637c">part 2</a>).  Over the last few months the rest of the team has joined him though, and we’ve been frantically working away implementing it all on both Riot/Web, iOS &amp; RiotX/Android.  For instance - here’s <a href="https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/IoFfFRWTmRNTbNDzfmKFPvLq">verification happening in DM</a> between Riot/Web &amp; RiotX a few weeks ago, and here’s a very early (unskinned) cut of <a href="https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tAWxQKhrfiPxBvtAOQfMiGjW">verification</a> happening in Riot/Web’s RightPanel a few days ago.<br/><br/>
We were hoping to get cross-signing ready for the end of 2019, but in practice we’re now sprinting to get it done by FOSDEM 2020 in Feb - not least because we have a main-stage talk proposed to tell everyone how we landed it and turned on E2E by default... ;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ Support for non-E2E clients.  The last thing we want is to make it impossible to write a simple Matrix client, or to suddenly excommunicate (hah) all the existing Matrix bots &amp; bridges which haven’t implemented E2E.  To this end, poljar created <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">pantalaimon</a> - our very own Matrix daemon, which can sit in the background and offload all your E2EE from your Matrix client by acting as a transparent Matrix proxy which magically encrypts everything.  Built on matrix-nio and asyncio python3, We use it in production today for running various bots and it works excellently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ Support for search in E2E rooms.  Hot off the heels of pantalaimon’s success, poljar also created <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/seshat">seshat</a> - a native library for clientside indexing encrypted Matrix events written in Rust, powered by the <a href="https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy">tantivy</a> full-text search engine.  (pantalaimon also has support for indexing via tantivy, which involved contributing python bindings for tantivy, but we ended up going with Rust so we could embed it natively in as many Matrix clients as possible).  Seshat is particularly cool in that the indexes themselves are encrypted in on disk - and in future could even be synced between clients using <a href="https://github.com/uhoreg/matrix-doc/blob/ssss/proposals/1946-secure_server-side_storage.md">SSSS</a> so you don’t have to reindex your messages every time you log in on a new device.  Seshat is implemented behind a labs flag on Riot/Desktop and it will ship as soon Riot/Desktop’s build pipeline is fully updated to support native modules (which will also unlock other goodies, such as using faster/safer native E2E primitives, safer key storage, and Discord-style keyboard-shortcuts for VoIP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🏗 Fixing “unable to decrypt” errors.  We’ve done big sprint over the last month or so to track down the final straggling causes of unable to decrypt errors.  Some of these are legitimate bugs (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/6399">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/6399</a>) - but many are artefacts of the current architecture: for instance, if the sender has no way to know your device was in the room when it encrypted a message, you won’t be able to decrypt.  We’re addressing this by improving better error messages and feedback so the user isn’t surprised by what’s going on (aiming for Jan) - and in future we’ll have to revisit E2E’s fundamentals to ensure that it’s impossible to receive a message without also receiving the key to decrypt it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ Support for push notifications in E2E rooms.  This is kinda solved right now by having all clients get (silently) pushed whenever they receive a message in an E2E room with push enabled, and relying on the client to be woken up by the push in order to decrypt the message in order to display the push notification.  However, this is battery intensive, and we could probably do better - but this isn’t a blocker for going live.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🏗 Support for FilePanel and NotifPanel in E2E rooms.  Seshat should fix this by indexing all your messages (and so tracking whether they contain pushes or files, and populating up your local view of your file &amp; notif panels respectively) - just need to ensure it’s hooked up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>...and that’s where things stand right now on E2E by default.  We’ll start turning it on by default for private rooms as soon as the UX has landed (probably starting first with new DMs and private rooms, prompting the user in case they want to opt out - and then migrating existing ones).  It’s worth noting that we have poured a <em>lot</em> of work into E2E encryption now - often to the detriment of the rest of Matrix; our rich featureset and decentralisation has combined to make this a tough nut to crack, but the end is in sight.  Thanks to all for your patience and support while we’ve been working through this.</p>
<p>That takes us to the end of the stuff we planned to prioritise in 2019 - but what about the more speculative medium-term stuff which was on the menu this time last year?</p>
<h4 id="2019-the-medium-term-priorities">2019: the medium-term priorities</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Reworking and improving Communities/Groups.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We have some really promising UX work and a fairly early spec proposal (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1772/proposals/1772-groups-as-rooms.md">MSC1772</a>), but work in earnest hasn’t kicked off yet. It’s going to be one of the next big projects though. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reactions.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ Riot now has Reactions! 🎉🎉🎉  The only remaining work is to finish the remaining rough edges of the spec proposal (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1849/proposals/1849-aggregations.md">MSC1849</a>) and actually land them in the Matrix spec proper.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>E2E-encrypted Search</em></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/seshat">Seshat</a> exists! (see above)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Filtering. (empowering users to filter out rooms &amp; content they're not interested in).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ We’ve ended up thinking lots in 2019 about empowering users to filter content.  The main impetus has been to ensure that users and communities can filter out abuse (on their own terms), and also to start building infrastructure which can be used for folks to share their own filters.  Over the last few months, this has started to take concrete form - with the arrival of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/msc2313/proposals/2313-moderation-policy-rooms.md">MSC2313</a> “Moderation policies as rooms”, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir">Mjolnir</a> - a bot you can run to enforce moderation policies on your rooms.  It’s all quite early, but we expect a lot more work in this space over the coming year (and it’s wryly amusing that <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">Twitter has also woken up</a> to it being an interesting problem needing to be solved.)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Extensible events</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry folks; no progress here since a flurry of spec work (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1767/proposals/1767-extensible-events.md">MSC1767</a>) back in Jan 2019. The good news is that the spec proposal seems to be relatively well received. The bad news is that we haven’t had bandwidth to finish reviewing it, implementing it and migrating it anywhere. It blocks a bunch of really useful stuff in Matrix, and there are users willing to pay for it (via New Vector) - we’ll get to it as soon as we can.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Editable messages.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ These landed too and are a thing of joy!  Just need to merge <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1849/proposals/1849-aggregations.md">MSC1849</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Extensible Profiles (we've actually been experimenting with this already).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to Extensible Events, there was a flurry of spec work (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1769/proposals/1769-extensible-profiles-as-rooms.md">MSC1769</a>) back in Jan, but little progress since.  This will also unlock a lot of really useful features - e.g. custom status, custom profile data, social timeline rooms etc.  We’ll likely get to it shortly after communities work.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Threading.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>🏗 So we actually landed label-based threading (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2326/proposals/2326-label-based-filtering.md">MSC2326</a>) in Synapse 1.6, but it’s not exposed in Riot yet (or elsewhere).  It doesn’t have quite the same semantics as Slack-style threading; the idea is to filter down your room based on which messages are tagged as part of a given topic.  However, it’s very powerful, and it’ll be fun to add it to Riot at some point in 2020.  Meanwhile, better-than-label-based-threading is also on the cards, although slightly lower priority than some of the other stuff in this section.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Landing the Riot/Android rewrite</em></li>
</ul>
<p>🏗 As you probably know, RiotX is a full rewrite of Riot/Android in Kotlin using modern AndroidX and Jetpack idioms - and it entered beta <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/introducing-the-riotx-beta-for-android-b17952e8f771">back in June</a>.  Since then we’ve been frantically working away on both playing catch-up with the old app… as well as implementing all the new stuff (reactions, edits, new E2E verification, cross-signing etc) which makes no sense to waste time adding in Riot/Android, but also pushes out the timeline on RiotX itself.</p>
<p>We’re currently sprinting to try to get RiotX ready for FOSDEM in February - hopefully users will have felt the app starting to really stabilise over the last few months (it even supports breadcrumbs now!)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Considering whether to do a similar overhaul of Riot/iOS</em></li>
</ul>
<p>🏗 It’s cheating a bit, but Manu (the lead developer on Riot/iOS and delivery manager of Riot/Mobile in general) has been hacking on an entirely new client called <a href="https://github.com/manuroe/messagerie">Messagerie</a> in his spare time, using SwiftUI.  The idea of throwing away the whole UI layer and replacing it with the latest best practices sounds suspiciously like RiotX - it’ll be interesting to see how RiotX/iOS takes shape next year! </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Scaling synapse via sharding the master process</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We ended up bottlenecked on IO rather than CPU in 2019, and as a result we worked on splitting synapse’s database across multiple database instances on a per-table granularity.  However, the master process itself doesn’t shard yet; so we’re now bottlenecked on CPU and need to get on and do this asap to unlock further Synapse scalability for mega-monolithic-deployments like the Matrix.org homeserver. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bridge UI for discovery of users/rooms and bridge status</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>🏗 There’s been a bit of movement in the last few weeks on this, but nothing concrete yet. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bandwidth-efficient transports</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>✅ We finished the 100bps CoAP transport proof-of-concept for Matrix, demoed it at FOSDEM and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/03/12/breaking-the-100-bps-barrier-with-matrix-meshsim-coap-proxy">shipped it in March</a>. However, we haven’t progressed it much further; it really needs a corporate sponsor who wants to fund work to finish it off and bake it properly into Matrix. <strong>If you’re interested, please <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">get in touch</a>.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bandwidth-efficient routing</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>🏗 We also did a bunch of related work on bandwidth-efficient routing, which sadly hasn’t been released yet.  However, it’s interesting to note that the <a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/english/">Decentralized Systems and Network Services Research Group</a> at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology’s Institute of Telematics has been looking into this space too - c.f. their <a href="https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000100364">A Glimpse of the Matrix</a> paper, which ponders very similar problems. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Getting Dendrite to production.</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>🏗 Dendrite work has been bubbling away in the background thanks to Anoa, Brendan, cnly (our GSoC dendrite contributor) and others.  Inevitably most of our bandwidth has gone into getting Synapse to 1.0 and making sure it’s fit for purpose, but we want and need to keep Dendrite alive for next-generation purposes - and in fact New Vector is hiring new people to work on it in 2020. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Inline widgets (polls etc)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>🏗 We have an MSC (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2192">MSC2192</a>), but not an implementation. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Improving VoIP over Matrix.</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>Very little progress here, frustratingly.  Jitsi has been upgraded and conference calls should kick ass these days (let us know if they don’t), but 1:1 needs a lot of love.  Hopefully we’ll get to it in 2020. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Adding more bridges, and improving the current ones.</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of bridging progress in 2020 - all new puppeting Slack support; huge fixes to the IRC bridge (including shifting to Postgres at last); Bifrost (the XMPP bridge) progressed too, and there’s been loads of community bridging work around WhatsApp, Discord and others. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Account portability</em></li>
<li><em>Replacing MXIDs with public keys</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve just started looking at implementing these seriously via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/proposal/remove_mxids_from_events/proposals/1228-removing-mxids-from-events.md">MSC1228</a> (as of last week) - expect progress in 2020.</p>
<p>So that sums up progress on the medium term menu - as you can see, a bunch actually happened; a bunch made progress; a few didn’t happen at all.</p>
<h4 id="2019-the-longer-term-priorities">2019: the longer-term priorities</h4>
<p>Finally, on the longer term radar:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Shared-code cross-platform client SDKs (e.g. sharing a native core library between matrix-{js,ios,android}-sdk)</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>No progress here.  Instead, all three main platforms have continued to write and maintain their own platform-specific SDKs for now.  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/seshat">Seshat</a> however will be the first piece of native rust code shared across all 3 platforms - let’s see how that goes first... </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Matrix daemons (e.g. running an always-on client as a background process in your OS which apps can connect to via a lightweight CS API)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>✅ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a> lives!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Push notifications via Matrix (using a daemon-style architecture)</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>No progress here, unless you count the CoAP low-bandwidth work.  However, Bubu (also Riot/Android Fdroid maintainer) has been working on a project called <a href="https://bubu1.eu/openpush/">OpenPush</a> which looks to help in this space (albeit not built on Matrix, but could be used by Matrix).  There are a few other related projects.  If someone wants to build this on top of Matrix + CoAP please get in touch asap! </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Clientside homeservers (i.e. p2p matrix) - e.g. compiling Dendrite to WASM and running it in a service worker.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>🏗 Work is actually happening on this currently.  Dendrite has successfully compiled to WASM and runs, and we’ve had it (almost) talking HTTP tunnelled over libp2p as part of P2P Matrix experiments.  In 2020 we’re going to be investing a lot in P2P Matrix - to give users full control of their communication without even having to run a server, and also to simplify onboarding and account portability enormously.  We have a talk about this accepted for FOSDEM 2020 (<a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/dip_p2p_matrix/">The Path to P2P Matrix</a>) and we’re actively (frantically) hacking on Dendrite to make it happen - keep an eye out for how things develop!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Experimenting with MLS for E2E Encryption</em></li>
</ul>
<p>🏗 Now that E2E-by-default has entered the “it works! let’s land it in Riot asap” phase, Uhoreg has had some time to start thinking about the longer term future of encryption in Matrix.  <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/charter/">MLS (Messaging Layer Security)</a> is the IETF’s initiative to define a standard mechanism for end-to-end-encrypted group chats, which has some major algorithmic improvements over Olm/Megolm and the Double Ratchet Algorithm as used by Signal.  The catch is that it doesn’t work at all well with decentralisation - however, we’ve been <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/mls/MnLJkbJ_Mwe8Oz0Ll6delGJLPz4">working with them</a> to try to ensure MLS can work in a decentralised world.  More recently, uhoreg has had a chance to think a lot more about this and we’re working on a proposal for Decentralised MLS which builds on plain MLS while also giving the semantics needed for Matrix.  It’s all very experimental at this point (and the proof-of-concept implementation is written in <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>!) - but looks promising.  We’ll share more asap, and will certainly be investing more time in this in 2020.. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Storing and querying more generic data structures in Matrix (e.g. object trees; scene graphs)</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly no progress here :( </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Alternate use cases for VR, IoT, etc.</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>...and none here either.</p>
<p>So, of all the myriad things on our radar for 2019 (as of Dec 2018), hopefully this gives some idea of where we hit the mark.</p>
<h4 id="2019-the-unpredictable-bits">2019: the unpredictable bits</h4>
<p>However, there’s also a tonne of other stuff which happened which wasn’t explicitly on the radar.  On the synapse side, we finished fully migrating from Python 2 to Python 3, and started using asyncio and all the latest Python 3 goodies!  We finally <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6358">implemented configurable history retention</a> for servers and rooms! We even implemented <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6409">self-destructing messages</a> in Synapse (not that Riot exposes them yet). And there has been loads of optimisation and performance work since 1.0 landed in June.</p>
<p>On the ops side, we overhauled all our ops processes and security after the Matrix.org <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/05/08/post-mortem-and-remediations-for-apr-11-security-incident/">datacenter breach</a> in April, throwing away our legacy infrastructure and rebuilding it properly - and subsequently have been expanding our ops team from one dedicated ops person to four.  We also found ourselves having to do another emergency datacenter migration back in November when the old one was unable to reliably service IO for our database cluster. </p>
<p>We also spent a bunch time after shipping Matrix 1.0 working on tightening up Matrix’s privacy model - particularly around third party identity servers, integration managers, and making sure that folks self-hosting Matrix don’t accidentally depend on use 3rd party services without realising it.  If you missed out on the fun at the time, you can read all about it <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/30/tightening-up-privacy-in-matrix/">here</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/09/27/privacy-improvements-in-synapse-1-4-and-riot-1-4/">here</a>.  This ended up being way more work than we expected, but we’re very glad to have sorted it out now. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, mainstream uptake of Matrix has properly taken off, with the French Government launching Tchap (their fork of Riot), now with hundreds of thousands of daily active users.  The <a href="https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Open-Source-Bundeswehr-baut-eigene-verschluesselte-Messenger-App-4623404.html">German Government revealed today</a> that they are also formally trialling Matrix, starting with the Bundeswehr (Ministry of Defense); we’ve been helping them out with the deployment too. It is not an exaggeration to suggest that we could end up with an official cross-government Matrix network, publicly federated with the wider Internet, for self-hosted encrypted decentralised instant messaging.  In fact Ulrich Kelber, the Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragte (Federal Data Protection Commissioner) for Germany <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/whatsapp-matrix-oder-xmpp-bmi-sucht-einen-messenger-fuer-bundesbehoerden-1912-145326.html">pointed out</a>: “You could even set up a privacy-friendly messenger service in cooperation with France, which in the medium term could represent a real alternative to existing products on the market as a pan-European solution”. </p>
<p>Alongside all this, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/12/19/welcoming-mozilla-to-matrix/">Mozilla announced</a> they are replacing the Moznet IRC network with Matrix; <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/20/welcome-to-matrix-kde/">KDE joined Matrix</a> in Feb, <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T230531">Wikimedia</a> is getting set up on their server, and more and more massive players (including the largest in the world) keep getting in touch to find out how they can best get onboard Matrix - it’s incredibly exciting.  It also means that we were able to <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/10/10/new-vector-raises-8-5-m-to-accelerate-matrix-riot-modular/">raise capital</a> to keep folks employed to work on Matrix fulltime via <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a> and scale up <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a> as a paid hosting platform - which massively helps support core Matrix development.</p>
<h4 id="2020">2020</h4>
<p>All that remains now is to make some predictions for 2020.  Our main priorities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get E2E enabled for private rooms by default (see above). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Riot First-time User Experience (FTUE).  While we redesigned Riot’s UI in 2019, there are still far too many weird gotchas which trip over new users.  Starting in October we began a shift to completely change how Riot development works - transitioning the project to being led by the UX design team rather than the dev team, and ensuring that the design team considers the app holistically across all 3 platforms.  Above all else, our priority is to make it kick ass for normal non-technical mainstream users - not just for opensourcey wizards.  This is a tough ask, but we believe it’s literally make-or-break for the project in the long term if Matrix is ever to become as prevalent as Slack or WhatsApp, and we are throwing everything we have at it.  The second that E2E is on by default, the entirety of the Riot teams will be focusing on the mission to clear our <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aproject%3Aftue">FTUE backlog</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RiotX. We’re shipping RiotX on Android as fast as we can - currently users on Riot/Android are left high and dry and we need to do everything we can to finish RiotX and get them upgraded as rapidly as possible. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communities.  Off the back of FTUE comes the importance of grouping rooms &amp; users together into communities in a much better way than we have today.  This will be up next. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synapse: shard the master by user/room to avoid being it being bottlenecked on CPU.  We also need to apply smarter queue management on federation traffic to better reduce the memory footprint (and so eliminate complexity limits on small-footprint hosted servers!) - and we also desperately need to speed up joins. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite &amp; P2P Matrix: the plan currently is to use Dendrite as the basis for our P2P Matrix experiments.  In practice this means making it federate using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/proposal/remove_mxids_from_events/proposals/1228-removing-mxids-from-events.md">MSC1228</a>-semantics (no point in wasting time implementing the ‘legacy’ key management), and then experiment with hooking it up to various P2P transports (e.g. our low-bandwidth CoAP transport) and discovery systems (e.g. mDNS; libp2p; etc).  How we go about actually getting it into production depends entirely on how well the experiment goes; we could evolve Matrix to be hybrid CS/P2P; we could treat it as a new protocol and bridge to it; who knows.  Watch this space...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MLS: figure out our plan for next-generation E2E - for better scaling, and better reliability, and what (if anything) we should do with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/charter/">MLS</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridges: loads of work on the horizon to put a better UX on Bridging.  Bridge stability has improved enormously over the last year (thanks Half-Shot!) but we need to transition from being robust but ugly to being robust and polished... </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spec: we need to work out how to go faster on reviewing MSCs (both our own and from the wider community).  While the governance process in general feels healthier than it’s ever been, empirically we’re not exactly burning through the MSC backlog - and this is in part that MSC work is squeezed in alongside the other dayjob stuff everyone’s working on. Finding the right balance between sculpting spec and sculpting code is tough, but we’re going to try to improve it in 2020. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abuse / Reputation: we want to empower users to make their own minds up about what content they want to see and not see on Matrix (or what they want to host or not host on their servers / communities / rooms).  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir">Mjolnir</a> is a good start, but we’ll be continuing to work on this throughout the year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, all the things listed above that we didn’t get to in 2019 are of course still options on the menu too.</p>
<p>So there you have it.  I’ve not even tried to talk about the amazing stuff that the wider Matrix community has been up to - whether that’s amazing new clients like <a href="https://dittochat.org/">Ditto</a> (React Native!) or <a href="https://github.com/kiliankoe/nio">Nio!</a> (SwiftUI), or new bridges like <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts">mautrix-hangouts</a>, or even poljar’s secret rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/poljar/weechat-matrix-rs">weechat-matrix in Rust</a>; your best bet there is to skim through <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix/">TWIM</a>.  Huge undying thanks go out though to everyone who builds on Matrix and keeps the ecosystem maturing and growing (especially while we’re scurrying around shoring up the foundations) - there’s simply no point in Matrix as a protocol without the vibrant community building on top.</p>
<p>All told, it’s been a bit of an epic year (both in terms of wins and fails), and all that remains is to thank <em>everyone</em> who continues to use Matrix (particularly our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a> supporters) for their ongoing support and for helping the project accelerate forwards.  More than ever before, the world needs free and open communication open to all; the age of proprietary communication silos may be coming to an end - consigned to live alongside AOL CDs and Compuserve IDs in the history books.  With your support, Matrix can provide a decent mainstream yet decentralised alternative - and we’ll do everything we can to make that happen in 2020.</p>
<p>Happy holidays!</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix.org team.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We've just released Synapse 1.7.2 - a minor point release to address two regressions which snuck into 1.7.0 and 1.7.1.  Sorry for the upgrade faff; hopefully we will be back to a saner release cadence shortly.  Reminder that if you are on 1.7.0 or earlier you should upgrade asap as 1.7.1 contained security fixes.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We’re incredibly excited that <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/synchronous-messaging-at-mozilla-the-decision/50620">Mozilla just announced</a> that they’ve selected Matrix as the successor to IRC as the communication platform for the public Mozilla community!!  This comes off the back of a <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/synchronous-messaging-at-mozilla-trial-servers-feedback/44871">formal 1-month trial</a> in September to evaluate various options side by side, and now New Vector will be helping Mozilla get their homeserver up and running on the <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a> hosting platform over the coming weeks - and federating openly with the rest of the open global Matrix network! :)</p>
<p>We have always been massive fans of Mozilla: they have been an excellent role model as champions of the open web, open standards, not to mention open source - and it’s fair to say that Mozilla has been a major inspiration to how Matrix has evolved (Riot aspires to be to Matrix what Firefox is to the Web: a flagship open source app which provides an accessible friendly interface into an open standard network).  It’s very reassuring to see that Mozillians from the trial recognise the alignment and have converged on Matrix as the way forward - it’s a massive win for the open web and standards-based communication in general.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that we’ve also always been massive fans of IRC, and Matrix is unashamedly derivative of IRC in capabilities and culture, while broadening the scope to decentralised synchronisation and relaying of any kind of data.  For context, the genesis of the team which eventually spawned Matrix was on a student IRC server ~20 years ago - and subsequently everything we’ve worked on (up to Matrix) was coordinated exclusively through IRC.  We even used to give conference talks on how to run your project/company off IRC.  I can’t really overstate how fundamental IRC is to our history - and we still keep our private IRC network online for old time’s sake (albeit bridged to Matrix). The very first protocol bridge we built for Matrix back in 2015 was for IRC - and Moznet and Freenode were the first public bridges we turned on. As of right now, <code>/stats u</code> on Moznet says that there are 4950 connected users, of which 1724 (so 35%) are actually Matrix users connected via the Moznet bridge - effectively using Matrix as a big decentralised IRC bouncer in the sky.</p>
<p>All of this is to say is that we deeply understand how dependent Mozilla has been on IRC over the years, and that we built Matrix to be a worthy successor which tries to capture all the best bits of IRC while providing much richer primitives (E2E encryption, openly federated decentralised chatrooms, arbitrary data sync, HTTP API, VoIP, etc).  It’s also worth noting that even though Moznet is being turned off, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd">matrix-ircd</a> exists as a very promising project that exposes <em>any</em> Matrix homeserver as an ircd - so for all you IRC die-hards, Moznet can absolutely live on in the afterlife!  (matrix-ircd is still alpha right now, but it’s a relatively modest amount of Rust and PRs are <em>very</em> welcome - if you grok IRC it should be a really really fun project to contribute to).</p>
<p>In other news, the trial in September was an amazing opportunity to gather feedback first-hand from a wide range of Mozillians as they gave Riot and Matrix a spin, often for the first time - and it was a lot of fun to take that feedback and rapidly act on it to improve the app.  For instance, having direct expert feedback on our screenreader support meant that we were able to <a href="https://blog.riot.im/riot-web-1-5/">radically improve our accessibility</a>, and we’ve kept up the momentum on this since the trial (regardless of the outcome) with Mozilla &amp; Riot devs hacking together with the aim of making Riot the most accessible communication app out there without exception.  Huge thanks to Marco Zehe for all his guidance (and PRs), as well as the rest of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#a11y:matrix.org">#a11y:matrix.org</a>!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Riot’s UX continues to mature in general. One of our two primary projects right now is to improve First Time User Experience (<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aproject%3AFtue+">FTUE</a>) - i.e. making our UX as smooth and polished and predictable as possible, especially as seen by new users.  This project had just kicked off in September as the Mozilla trial began, and some of the major improvements to the Room Directory and Room Creation flow which subsequently landed in Riot/Web 1.5 were prioritised directly based on Mozillian feedback.  Since the trial we’ve been focusing more on our other primary project (getting E2E Encryption enabled by default), but we will be back on FTUE asap - particularly to incorporate all the feedback we anticipate as Mozilla goes live!  We are absolutely determined for Riot to have as good if not better UX than the likes of Slack or Discord.  New Vector is also <a href="https://apply.workable.com/new-vector/j/6CB817C79E/">actively hiring more designers</a> to come work fulltime on Riot’s UI and UX as we shift Riot’s focus from being developer-led to design-led - if this sounds interesting, please get in touch!  And finally, everything is of course open source and PRs are genuinely appreciated to keep Riot heading in the right direction (please just check first if they change the UI/UX).</p>
<p>Finally, in case you’re dreading having to use a graphical chat client like Riot, the Mozilla instance will of course be accessible to any <a href="https://matrix.org/clients/">Matrix client</a> that floats your boat - for instance, <a href="https://github.com/poljar/weechat-matrix">weechat-matrix</a> also got a spurt of development to support Mozilla IAM single-sign-on so that commandline junkies can get their fix too. (It’s worth noting that weechat-matrix really is an incredibly fully featured and usable client - complete with full end-to-end encryption support.  If you haven’t tried it, you’re missing out).</p>
<p>So, to conclude: it has been indescribably valuable to have the expertise and enthusiasm of the Mozilla community in contributing feedback and fixes to Riot (and even <a href="https://github.com/bnjbvr/botzilla">building new Matrix bots</a>!).  Huge thanks to everyone who invested their time and energy participating in the trial and for their trust in concluding that Matrix was the way forward.  We see this as a massive responsibility and honour to help power the wider Mozilla community, and we will do everything we can to make it as successful as conceivably possible :)</p>
<p>To the future of an open web, with even more open communications!</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix &amp; Riot team :)</p>
<p>P.S. we’ve come a long way since <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/matrix-and-irc-mozillians-custom-client/2911/7">Matrix was first proposed</a> for Mozilla :D</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Over the course of today we've been made aware of folks port-scanning the
general internet to discover private Matrix servers, looking for publicly
visible room directories, and then trying to join rooms listed in them.</p>
<p>If you are running a Matrix server that is intended to be private, you must correctly
configure your server to not expose its public room list to the general public -
and also ensure that any sensitive rooms are invite-only (especially if the
server is federated with the public Matrix network).</p>
<p>In Synapse, this means ensuring that the following options are set correctly in
your <code>homeserver.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span># If set to &#39;false&#39;, requires authentication to access the server&#39;s public rooms
</span><span># directory through the client API. Defaults to &#39;true&#39;.
</span><span>#
</span><span>#allow_public_rooms_without_auth: false
</span><span>
</span><span># If set to &#39;false&#39;, forbids any other homeserver to fetch the server&#39;s public
</span><span># rooms directory via federation. Defaults to &#39;true&#39;.
</span><span>#
</span><span>#allow_public_rooms_over_federation: false
</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>For private servers, you will almost certainly want to explicitly set these to
<code>false</code></strong>, meaning that the server's &quot;public&quot; room directory is hidden from the
general internet and wider Matrix network.</p>
<p>You can test whether your room directory is visible to arbitrary Matrix clients
on the general internet by viewing a URL like
https://sandbox.modular.im/_matrix/client/r0/publicRooms (but for your server). 
If it gives a &quot;Missing access token&quot; error, you are okay.</p>
<p>You can test whether your room directory is visible to arbitrary Matrix servers
on the general internet by loading Riot (or similar) on another server, and
entering the target server's domain name into the room directory's server
selection box.  If you can't see any rooms, then are okay.</p>
<p>Relatedly, <strong>please ensure that any sensitive rooms are set to be &quot;invite only&quot;
and room history is not world visible</strong> - particularly if your server is
federated, or if it has public registration enabled.  This stops random
members of the public peeking into them (let alone joining them).</p>
<p>Relying on security-by-obscurity is a very bad idea: all it takes is for someone
to scan the whole internet for Matrix servers, and then trying to join (say)
#finance on each discovered domain (either by signing up on that
server or by trying to join over federation) to cause problems.</p>
<p>Finally, if you don't want the general public reading your room directory,
please also remember to turn off public registration on your homeserver.
Otherwise even with the changes above, if randoms can sign up on your server
to view &amp; join rooms then all bets are off.</p>
<p>We'll be rethinking the security model of room directories in future (e.g.
whether to default them to being only visible to registered users on the local
server, or whether to replace per-server directories with per-community
directories with finer grained access control, etc) - but until this is sorted,
please heed this advice.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about randoms having managed to discover or join rooms
which should have been private, please contact security@matrix.org.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>This morning (06:11 UTC) it became apparent through mails to support@matrix.org that a security researcher was working through the TLS Certificate Transparency logs for <code>*.matrix.org</code>,<code>*.riot.im</code> and <code>*.modular.im</code> to identify and try to access non-public services run by New Vector (the company formed by the original Matrix team, which hosts <code>*.matrix.org</code> on behalf of the Matrix.org Foundation, and develops Riot and runs the https://modular.im hosting service).</p>
<p>Certificate Transparency (CT) is a feature of the TLS ecosystem which lets you see which public certificates have been created and signed by given authorities - intended to help identify and mitigate against malicious certificates.  This means that the DNS name of any host with a dedicated public TLS certificate (i.e. not using a wildcard certificate) is visible to the general public.</p>
<p>In practice, this revealed a handful of internal-facing services using dedicated public TLS certificates which were accessible to the general internet - some of which should have been locked to be accessible only from our internal network.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>kibana.ap-southeast-1.k8s.i.modular.im</code> - a Kibana deployment for a new experimental Modular cluster which is being set up in SE Asia. The Kibana is in the middle of being deployed, and was exposed without authentication during deployment due to a firewall &amp; config error.  However, <strong>it is not a production system and carries no production traffic or user data</strong> (it was just being used for experimentation for hypothetical geography-specific Modular deployments).  We firewalled this off at 07:53 UTC, and are doing analysis to confirm there was no further compromise, and will then rebuild the cluster (having fixed the firewall config error from repeating).</li>
<li>AWX deployments used by our internal Modular platform, which were behind authentication but should not be exposed to the public net.</li>
<li>Various semi-internal dev and testing services which should be IP-locked to our internal network (but are all locked behind authentication too).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, certain historical Modular homeservers &amp; Riots (from before we switched to using wildcard certs, or where we’ve created a custom LetsEncrypt certificate for the server) are named in the CT logs - thus leaking the server’s name (which is typically public anyway in that server’s matrix IDs if the server is federated).</p>
<p>We’re working through the services whose names were exposed checking for any other issues, but other than the non-production SE Asia Kibana instance we are not aware of problems resulting from this activity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we’ll be ensuring that semi-internal services are only exposed on our internal network in future, and that Modular server names are not exposed by CT logs where possible.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: You can list all the public non-wildcard TLS certs for a given domain by looking somewhere like https://crt.sh/?q=%25.matrix.org.  This lets you find internal-sounding services to try to attack.  In practice no production services were compromised, and most of our internal services are correctly firewalled from the public internet.  However, we’re reviewing the IP locking for ones in the grey zone (and preventing the bug which caused an experimental Kibana to be exposed without auth).</p>
<p>We’d like to thank Linda Lapinlampi for notifying us about this.  We’d also like to remind everyone that we operate a Security Disclosure Policy (SDP) and Hall of Fame at https://matrix.org/security-disclosure-policy/ which is designed to protect innocent users from being hurt by security issues - everyone: please consider disclosing issues responsibly to us as per the SDP.</p>

<p>We've released Synapse 1.4.1 as a small but important bugfix to 1.4.0.</p>
<p>This fixes a regression which crept in with our newly implemented &quot;erase redacted data after N days&quot; feature where some APIs
would fail when hitting erased redactions - anyone on Synapse 1.4.0 will want to upgrade asap.</p>
<p>As always, you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.4.1">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Massive news for the Matrix ecosystem today: <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a> (the
startup which the Matrix core team formed to fund development in 2017) has
raised an additional $8.5M of funding in order to speed up Riot/Matrix
development and expand Matrix hosting via <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a>!</p>
<p>The new funding comes in the form of a Series-A equity investment in New
Vector from three of the top venture capital funds in London.  The round is
led by <a href="https://notion.vc">Notion</a> - a fund set up by the founders of
MessageLabs, who many will know as one of the leaders in secure hosted email
services.  Notion's long history with email means they immediately clocked the
potential of Matrix's mission to build a new open global communication network -
after all, Matrix aims to provide a worthy replacement to email (and the
phone network, for that matter!).  Joining Notion in the round is <a href="https://firstminute.capital">First
Minute</a> - a fund set up by the founders of
Lastminute.com (arguably the UK's most famous original dotcom), and
<a href="http://dawncapital.com/">Dawn</a> - one of the largest SaaS tech specialist
funds in Europe (famous for backing iZettle, Mimecast, Neo4J and many more).</p>
<p>The last funding round in Jan 2017 from Status was instrumental in stabilising
the big 1.0 release of Matrix and exiting beta in June; creating the
Matrix.org Foundation as a neutral custodian for the standard; stabilising and
optimising Synapse; redesigning Riot’s user interface; bringing in a full-time
professional UI/UX designer to the team; supporting the huge amount of
encryption work required to turn on E2EE by default (cross-signing, key
backups, device verification, e2e search, the pantalaimon e2e daemon etc);
creating RiotX/Android; and launching the Modular.im hosting platform.</p>
<p>With today’s new funding, the priorities for Matrix will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Turning on end-to-end encryption by default for DMs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much better support for grouping rooms into Communities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More anti-abuse/anti-spam mechanisms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shrinking Synapse (and/or finishing Dendrite)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Canonical DMs (having one DM per user, and have them feel clearly distinct from ‘rooms’)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extensible Profiles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decentralised accounts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Threading</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...and furthering development on P2P Matrix, so users can have full control of their communications without having to run or trust a server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the New Vector side, this funding will support: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A whole new wave of UX improvements to Riot (particularly around onboarding and first time user experience).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making Modular hosting as polished and powerful as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a whole new set of next-generation Modular integrations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While New Vector’s contributions to the Matrix ecosystem can’t be ignored,
it’s important to remember that the Matrix protocol and specification itself
is governed and controlled by the independent and neutral <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">Matrix.org
Foundation</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/proposals/1779-open-governance.md">extensive governance
processes</a>.
We set up the Foundation <em>very</em> deliberately to enforce the protocol's
neutrality, formalise the project's mission, goals and values and hold true to
them no matter what - specifically to protect the project from conflicts of
interest with commercial Matrix endeavours, including New Vector.</p>
<p>That said, New Vector would not be taking money from any investors if they did
not believe their goals are aligned with Matrix's. To clarify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matrix exists to create an open secure decentralised communication network and protocol for the benefit of all.</li>
<li>New Vector exists to help grow Matrix and be one of many successful companies in the Matrix ecosystem. </li>
<li>Tech VCs exist to invest their money in growing companies in order to get a return when the company IPOs or gets bought.</li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out that these goals are not incompatible if one understands that the
potential of the Matrix ecosystem is directly linked to its openness and size
(hint: funding sources who didn’t understand this self-selected out ;). By
funding Matrix development and helping the open ecosystem and public network
grow, New Vector can go provide more Matrix hosting via
<a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a> and more Government &amp; Enterprise deployments
via <a href="https://vector.im">Vector.im</a>.  Critically, other companies can and do
build on top of Matrix too - and frankly the more players there are, the more
valuable the network, and the more value to be shared for everyone (including
New Vector).  This model worked relatively well for the Web, and we believe
it'll work for Matrix too.</p>
<p><strong>Update: the best way to gauge the investment in New Vector is to hear it
first hand from the investors.  Jos from Notion is leading the round, and has
a <a href="https://notion.vc/resources/new-vector-series-a/">fascinating blog post</a>
(written with zero input from Matrix or New Vector folks) to explain where the
investors are coming from.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update 2: More excellend <a href="https://medium.com/dawn-capital/communications-of-the-future-will-be-open-and-secure-why-we-invested-in-new-vector-2bd8a060faf7">first-hand analysis</a> from Dan at Dawn Capital, who does a really deep dive into how they see Matrix and New Vector. Another must read.</strong></p>
<p>In this case, all of New Vector's new investors have a background as respected
tech entrepreneurs, and everyone involved categorically understands that
Matrix itself is a neutral open source project, and the mission is to help
build up the whole network to be as successful as possible rather than
sabotage it by constraining it in any way.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s great news for the ecosystem: Matrix is 5 years old now, and
while the project is growing faster than ever (over 300% more active users in
the last year!) - it's fair to say that we haven't moved as fast as our
mainstream competition - for instance, Slack is only a year older, and Discord
is a year younger(!)  Obviously much of this is due to Matrix being a
completely different proposition: we've been creating an open spec; multiple
client codebases; multiple server codebases; the bridges; a fault tolerant
decentralised network - not to mention the complexities of decentralised E2E
encryption.  Based on comparing with our endeavours prior to Matrix, we
estimate building this stuff in an open and decentralised manner takes roughly
6 times longer.</p>
<p>But the project is now in a position where the foundations are solid: the
protocol is out of beta, reference servers and clients are production ready,
and it’s more than time to make all of this mainstream. We have to redouble
our focus on user experience and ensure that we compare favourably to today’s
established alternatives while staying true to Matrix’s principles.  Making
sure there are Matrix apps out there which provide a credible alternative to
with the likes of Slack and WhatsApp (until they eventually join Matrix, of
course) is what will make the difference between Matrix being a cliquey FOSS
curiosity versus really being the natural successor to today’s instant
messaging, email and phone networks.</p>
<p>In the end; Matrix needs full-time contributors in order to continue to grow,
and keeping New Vector funded is a very good way to achieve that (<a href="https://vector.im/careers">New Vector
is hiring!</a>).  (That said, if any philanthropic
billionaires are reading this, the Matrix.org Foundation is actively
soliciting donations to improve Matrix independently of New Vector's efforts -
particularly around the areas of countering online abuse and disinformation).</p>
<p>In the meantime, huge thanks to Jos at Notion for believing in Matrix and
leading this funding round in New Vector - and huge thanks to the other
investors who saw the potential!  And most of all, thank you to all those
supporting Matrix, whether by donating to the Foundation, promoting and using
the protocol, or contributing code to the ecosystem.  You are the ones keeping
the dream alive :)</p>
<p>You can read things from the NV angle over at https://blog.vector.im/8-5m-to-accelerate-matrix/.
We hope you’re as excited as we are to open a whole new chapter as Matrix
picks up yet more momentum :D</p>
<p>-- Matthew, Amandine, and the whole Matrix team</p>
