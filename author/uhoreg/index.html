<p>We released version 1.7 of the Matrix Spec on Thursday.  This release features media repository improvements and reactions.  Thank you to all who contributed to this release, whether through writing or reviewing MSCs, writing spec PRs, or finding spec bugs.  And congratulations to those who had their first MSC make it to the release.  Read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/05/25/matrix-v-1-7-release">blog post</a> for the full details.</p>
<p>We're in the process of working out what Matrix 1.8 looks like and need to hear what people are working on. If you have an MSC or idea you're planning on looking at in the next 2 months, let us know in #sct-office:matrix.org so we can prioritize it accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3184">MSC3184: Challenges Messages</a>!  This feature allows participants in a room to make decisions randomly by playing rock, paper, scissors; flipping a coin; or drawing straws.</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happy Friday, everyone. This week we disclosed three security advisories for Synapse. The TL;DR is that you should upgrade to at least Synapse 1.74.0 or newer. Please see <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/05/24/disclosing-synapse-security-advisories">the Matrix.org blogpost</a> for links to the advisories.</p>
<p>Also of note is the release of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.84.0">Synapse 1.84.0</a> this Tuesday. New in this release is</p>
<ul>
<li>an option to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/15197">prevent downloading media from specified domains</a>;</li>
<li>a new set of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/15312">redis TLS configuration options</a> (Roel ter Maat); and</li>
<li>addition support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4009">new</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2659">stabilised</a> MSCs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside this are a batch of bugfixes and internal improvements. We are aware of one regression in v1.84.0‚Äîexpect a minor release with a fix to that sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>We've also begun an effort to profile and improve the performance of the <code>/messages</code> endpoint. That should benefit everyone, but in particular we hope to improve the UX of the <a href="https://archive.matrix.org/">Matrix Public Archive</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you as ever to our contributors, testers, and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">community of server operators</a>.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, it's been a while. Which means we were busy, just not with developing Nheko! However, we did do some stuff now:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sticker and emoji pickers now have sections and include both normal emojis and custom emojis in the emoji picker. This means your search results are also sectioned and you don't need to use ~ for custom emoji anymore. You can also now edit your custom emoji right from the picker (or rather open the settings menu from there). This should make going crazy with custom emoji much easier and I hope you have fun with it!</li>
<li>LorenDB also finally fixed that pressing a key would focus the input bar but eat the first key. This was pretty annoying, but it should now behave much nicer!</li>
<li>Sateallia meanwhile fixed a similar bug with the focus in the search menu on some platforms, implemented selecting multiple files to upload in the filepicker (before you only could drop a group of files into Nheko at once).</li>
<li>You can now copy images from the image viewer to the clipboard.</li>
<li>And lastly your rooms in the search are now ordered by recency of the last message. This should make rooms with the same name have always the right room appear on top. Additionally upgraded rooms are now in italics, which should make it still possible to jump to them, but also distinguish them in the search.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a nice day and try custom stickers and emojis some time!

<p>A client for matrix, the decentralized communication protocol</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tobiasfella:kde.org">Tobias Fella</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's what's happened in NeoChat in the last weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>I (Tobias) implemented support for sending stickers, based on MSC2545. You can now send them from the emoji picker, which has also been improved visually.</li>
<li>I also implemented support for editing your account's stickers in NeoChat's settings. Other parts of the MSC (room stickers, etc.) are coming soon.</li>
<li>James improved read markers and state changed, limiting the number of the that are shown at the same time.</li>
<li>Aleix and I improved the notifications by grouping multiple messages from the same room into a single notification.</li>
<li>James added caching for the last event in a room, meaning that on startup, NeoChat will now sort all rooms in a correct order.</li>
<li>We fixed a bug where the user/room/emoji completion menu randomly did not open.</li>
<li>James finished documenting all of NeoChat's codebase.</li>
<li>I improved NeoChat's space support by replacing the existing space view with a new sidebar in style similar to many other clients.</li>
<li>I also improved logging, which will hopefully help us debug many problems, especially around encryption issues. In the future, if you notice such problems, make a copy of <code>~/.local/share/KDE/neochat.log</code> (on Linux; for other platforms, talk to us to figure out where the log file is) and possible also <code>neochat.log.old</code> immediately, to help with debugging.</li>
<li>Rooms with only two users (i.e., DMs) will now show a more useful sidebar, omitting irrelevant details like the normal room member list.</li>
<li>James also improved NeoChat's developer tools, now showing more useful information.</li>

<ul>
<li>In our journey to rid the ele-web-world of stuck notifications we‚Äôve fixed several bugs. Unfortunately fixing these bugs has surfaced other existing bugs that make the experience worse :sob:
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre hard at work on all these items, keeping the original fixes and introducing new fixes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While that means we‚Äôre skipping the public release this week, it does also mean that we‚Äôll have made some significant improvement in our next version!</li>
<li>Also on the topic of notifications we‚Äôre adding the final touches to our new notifications settings screens, ensuring that the push rules and toggles match up as you‚Äôd expect.</li>
<li>Next week we‚Äôre <strong>hosting a community testing session for our Intentional Mentions MSC</strong>. The MSC aims to remove the unnecessary pings when people use your username in the timeline but do not tag you explicitly.

<p>Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org">Ivan ü¶Ä</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, new projects have started!</p>
<ul>
<li>A new crate has been created, <code>matrix-sdk-ui</code>, which is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1931">the new home for the UI API</a> the Matrix SDK provides, like <code>Timeline</code>, and <code>RoomList</code>. Developing this kind of UI API inside the Matrix SDK instead of the client side (e.g. ElementX iOS or Android or even Gnome Fractal) means it improves testability and quality greatly, as we can tweak the network layer more easily, and in depth. It also means that it boosts the productivity of developers that create new Matrix clients: no need to deal with synchronisation, room presentation, timeline, pagination etc., everything is managed automatically.
<ul>
<li><code>RoomList</code> is a layer on top of <code>SlidingSync</code>. The work has started, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1911">the progress can be tracked in this meta issue</a>. To make it real, some improvements were necessary on the <code>SlidingSync</code> side, esp. being able <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1942">to change the sync-mode of an existing <code>SlidingSyncList</code></a>, which led to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1955">a nice revamping of the ranges API</a>. We are not mentioning many small clean ups (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1950">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1947">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1919">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1963">4</a> and so on).</li>
<li>Work has started to support <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1948">Sliding Sync sticky parameters properly</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1975">Ruma has been upgraded</a>, notably to support the latest Matrix 1.7 features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the Crypto land:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1970">User/device pairs who have invalid one-time keys are now timed out</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1939"><code>VerificationRequest</code> has a new state when a request transitions</a>. <code>VerificationRequest</code> is used to control the flow of the verification but only up to a certain point. Once different specific verification flows are handled (i.e. SAS or QR Code), the <code>VerificationRequest</code> object creates a child object of the <code>Verification</code> type. The idea behind this patch is to add a new <code>VerificationRequestState</code> variant called <code>Transitioned</code> which holds the child verification object as associated data. This makes it much simpler to go through the whole verification flow by allowing users to just listen to the <code>VerificationRequest::changes()</code> method,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/281">The return of OTK fetching failures</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1944">Replace the <code>libolm</code> backup encryption code with a native Rust version</a>, which allow Wasm targets to use the <code>backups_v1</code> feature of <code>matrix-sdk-crypto</code>,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1945">Disable automatic-key-forwarding for the <code>matrix-sdk-ffi</code> bindings</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1974">Better logs</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I managed to find some time to commit <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/develop/contrib/lnav"><code>lnav</code> configuration files for Synapse</a> this week. <code>lnav</code> is a log-viewing tool with too many bells and whistles for its own good. I particularly like it because it can interleave multiple log files by timestamp, and highlight log lines based on their severity. If you spend a lot of time looking at logs, these things can lower your blood pressure. Take a look if you think you'd find it useful.</p>

<p>Hello TWIM! It's another week and here at Synapse we released
v1.76.0. The big news for this release is that faster joins are now 
enabled by default. It has arrived üöÄ! In addition, some other notable 
features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the default room version to v10</li>
<li>Added a <code>set_displayname()</code> method to the module API for setting a user's display name</li>
<li>Implemented support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3890">MSC3890</a>: Remotely silence local notifications</li>
<li>Implemented experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3930">MSC3930</a>: Push rules for (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3381">MSC3381</a>) Polls</li>
<li>Add index to improve performance of the <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> endpoint used for jumping to a specific date in the timeline of a room</li>
</ul>
<p>and much more! You can read all about it <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.76.0">here</a>. Also, please note that the upgrade from 1.75 to 1.76 changes the account data replication streams in a backwards-incompatible manner.

<blockquote>
<h1 id="nheko">Nheko</h1>
<p>We did a lot of work on our markdown input this week. mauke finally fixed those pesky links with a closing parenthesis at the end from dropping that when linkified, without breaking links inside parentheses. Yes, it is still a regex and possibly outlawed in many civilized countries for having detrimental side-effects on society, but it works, so who am I to argue! Additionally we changed the newline behaviour (and fixed a bug related to line-breaks as well). A single line-break now corresponds to a line-break. You can find more about that decision <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@deepbluev7/109771668066978726">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/757">here</a>. You can opt out of that behaviour and other changes we do to the default cmark/commonmark behaviour using the new <code>/cmark</code> command. Speaking of other changes, we now support <code>||warning|spoiler||</code> as a way to enter spoilers, with the warning being optional as well as <code>~~text~~</code> for strike-through.</p>
<p>There is also now a workaround for Wayland users, who were bothered by stuck menus. This still needs to be fixed in Qt eventually, but in the meantime you can now close menus by clicking somewhere inside of Nheko thanks to a contribution by enigma9o7. Decodetalkers also made Nheko clean up notifications on exit and the fullscreen image overlay hide, when the save dialog is open. You can create DMs by pasting an mxid again now. Previously you needed to delete and re-enter the last character... The username completer should also now open around twice as fast and clicking notifications now once again restores Nheko from the tray. The last goodie was contributed by Malte. The invite dialog inside a room can now search for users you have a DM open or the server side userdirectory for suggestions.</p>
<p>Also, I am attending FOSDEM, so let's see if you can find me!

<h1 id="matrix-call-multitrack-recorder">Matrix Call Multitrack recorder</h1>
<p>Resulting from some past discussion of how matrix live may be improved, I did open https://github.com/vector-im/element-call/issues/789 to support multitrack recordings of participants.
However, it turns out this can quite easily be solved using a bot:</p>
<p>Therefor https://git.nordgedanken.dev/mtrnord/matrix-call-multitrack-recorder has been created. This is an early alpha bot using matrix-nio which can participate in both legacy WebRTC matrix native calls and Element-Call style calls.
Its purpose is to record each stream of a user to either a WAV or mp4 file.</p>
<p>However, since this is very early, it should be noted there currently exist some UX issues and some features are missing.</p>
<p>Feel free to give it a try or just join the Room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-call-multitrack-recorder:midnightthoughts.space">#matrix-call-multitrack-recorder:midnightthoughts.space</a></p>

<p>A few years ago, I've written a small bot-api in Rust that used (and still uses) Fractals Matrix-implementation. Since that has been abandoned <em>quite</em> a while ago, I wanted to look into porting my crate to the matrix-rust-sdk. As it turns out, there wouldn't really be any point in doing so. The SDK can be used more or less directly. Which I've learned, by writing a small <a href="https://github.com/msirringhaus/matrix_exif_bot">demo-bot</a>.</p>
<p>This rather simple bot parses the exif-data of pictures that are posted, extracts the GPS-data (if available) and replies with a Matrix location-event for the image location. The plan was to do this with threads, but the SDK sadly doesn't support those. So good old replies it is.
As a bonus, which turned out to be uglier than I thought, it'll also remove it's location-posts automatically, if the corresponding image gets removed.
Configurable autojoin on invite and a command to leave are implemented as well.</p>

<p>Some of the spec core team have been on holidays this week, but we still finished FCP on one MSC, and merged another to the spec.  As mentioned in last week's update, progress will be slower over the holiday season, but we'll be back in the new year, working to make Matrix better.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2783">MSC2783: Homeserver Migration Data Format</a>!  If you're running a homeserver using one implementation, it's currently impossible to switch to a different implementation without losing data.  This MSC proposes a file format for exporting data from one implementation and importing it into another.</p>

<p>Conduit is getting a lot more usable with this release, the main missing feature is backfill over federation (loading room messages from before your server joined a room).

<p>Ho ho ho Matrix fans!</p>
<p>It's that time of year again, and we have a special gift for all of you just in time for the holidays: Neochat now supports end-to-end encryption! This is made possible thanks to the release of libQuotient 0.7.</p>
<p>While this feature is still somewhat experimental, it's a big step forward in ensuring the privacy and security of your conversations. Just keep in mind that if your only logged-in client is Neochat and something goes wrong, you might lose your messages.</p>
<p>If you're feeling adventurous and want to try out the new end-to-end encryption feature, you can already get it from Flathub and some distros. We're also working on supporting it in our Windows, Android, and macOS builds, so stay tuned for updates.</p>
<p>And in the spirit of the season, here's a Christmas joke: Why was the JavaScript developer's house cold? Because he left his closure open!</p>

<h1 id="libquotient-0-7">libQuotient 0.7</h1>
<p>It took us (yes, us - there's more than one person actively working on the project!) a very long time but libQuotient 0.7.0 is out, with a <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.7.0">huge wall of release notes</a>. Big, big, BIG thanks to Carl Schwan and Tobias Fella for their contributions and early adoption of this release in NeoChat (NeoChat maintained compatibility with libQuotient's development branch, along with the stable branch, for quite some time by now). A short summary of most significant things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements: C++20, Qt 5.15 or 6.x</li>
<li>E2EE code is now in beta quality, features:
<ul>
<li>sending/receiving new messages</li>
<li>getting historical messages where Megolm keys are already loaded</li>
<li>encrypting/decrypting attachments</li>
<li>device verification (to-device flow only, no in-room verification yet)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Individual APIs for <code>m.fully_read</code> and <code>m.read</code> markers</li>
<li>Client-Server API backend uses Matrix 1.5 API definitions</li>
<li>A complete rewrite of the event types framework to make it truly extensible; you can now add both base classes and specific event types on the client side without touching the library code (the library still provides standard ones)</li>
<li>Account registry for multi-account usage; account access tokens and pickling keys are stored with Qt Keychain</li>
<li>Sticker events support</li>
<li>Pinned messages support</li>
<li>First-class support in Network Access Manager for <code>mxc:</code> URLs, to enable showing inline images in messages</li>
<li>A lot of code tightening, bug fixing, performance improvements</li>

<blockquote>
<h1 id="matrix-spam-ml">Matrix Spam ML</h1>
<p>As part of the efforts for working on detecting spam using ML I started to write a moderation bot.</p>
<p>This bot is written from scratch with some design decisions that hopefully will improve usability for both newcomers and seasoned admins.</p>
<p>These decisions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an action can be done using a reaction, then it will be done using a reaction.</li>
<li>There is a private admin room and a public room for warnings, where admins issue actions. This is meant to serve as a human-readable ban list if admins want to provide this to their users.</li>
<li>The bot will at a later point be able to issue reports to server admins via email and matrix easily by allowing admins to just react after doing a ban. The bot will initially ask how to contact a server if it didn't issue a report to the server before. The bot will remember the setting supplied last time for a server and allows updating the settings if they change. These reports will contain a warning that it was issued from the bot and that replies are necessary for it to be properly relayed back to the admins for further questions. These replies will end up as threads in the admin room. Also, as part of the report, the event JSON for the report will be sent with the report to allow server admins to review the case themselves. (This is still WIP)</li>
</ul>
<p>The warnings also contain a &quot;false positive&quot; action. This is meant to be used to feed back into the used model for further training and improving it.</p>
<p>All in all, I hope to simplify the process of moderation based on what I experienced as an admin. Feel free to chime in at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spam-ml:midnightthoughts.space">#matrix-spam-ml:midnightthoughts.space</a> to suggest ideas for the bot. At the time of writing, it is still very much a prototype/demo.</p>

<li>We made small fixes and improvements to voice broadcasts and device manager.</li>
<li>We are making progress on automating the Element Desktop release process.</li>
<li>We are investigating performance improvements in matrix-js-sdk.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you love to live on the edge, in labs (you can enable labs features in settings on develop.element.io or on Nightly):</p>
<ul>
<li>The rich text editor can now create inline code.</li>
<li>Soon, we will have a Favourite Messages screen!</li>
</ul>
<p>We will skip one release cycle while team members are on holiday, so after 20th December, the next release will be 17th January 2023.

<p>matrix-social is a new Matrix &quot;Social Media&quot; client made using the Matrix Rust SDK and Yew. With a design inspired by Reddit, matrix-social's purpose is to be a social media client that integrates well with the rest of the Matrix ecosystem. At the moment, it is very early in development, and lacks crucial features such as sending messages, comments, reactions, and categories.</p>
<p>The source code is licensed AGPL and hosted at https://codeberg.org/imbev/matrix-social</p>

<p>Going towards Christmas we from Nordeck can announce that we made another of our widgets Open Source: <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-barcamp">matrix-barcamp</a>.</p>
<p>The matrix-barcamp widget allows to perform agile Barcamps in Matrix spaces. You can create a space, add the widget to a Lobby room and use it to collaboratively create your Barcamp agenda.
Once you set up your sessions, the widget can take care of creating the individual discussion rooms inside the space.
The widget was created in collaboration with the ZIT SH from the German public sector.
Like the <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-poll">matrix-poll</a> widget, this widget is built using TypeScript, React, our <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit">matrix-widget-toolkit</a>, and the matrix-widget-api.
Our remaining widgets will follow soon, we keep you updated here.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, reach out to us at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nordeck:matrix.org">#nordeck:matrix.org</a>.

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1255">the last fixes ported over from the demo branch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1270">the growing-full-sync-window support</a> added, we turned our head back to debugging a few remaining <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1405">deserialization</a> and decryption bugs in Sliding Sync when we were hit by a new tokio-thread-panic on Element-X at the end of the week. A quick debugging revealed that it was caused by out of bound indizes supplied by the server. We are still looking into making our code more defensive for these circumstances, too.</p>
<p>Async Uniffi is progressing nicely meanwhile, with now both Swift and Kotlin being able to run and execute a Rust created future. We now have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1228">fallible function support implemented on the proc-frontend</a> and further work is coming up to support <code>&amp;str</code> and <code>&amp;[u8]</code>.</p>
<p>This week also saw the first experimentation in replacing the default Sled database backend. A first PoC attempt was made with sanakirja (pijul is based on), but after learning that its API is unsound and can lead to UB, the team agreed that this requires quit a bit more work (especially in terms of safety guards) than we have time for in the short term. Thus, offering a sqlite-backend for mobile in the short term at least for the crypto store has been agreed upon.</p>

<h1 id="introducing-the-matrix-events-directory">Introducing the Matrix Events Directory</h1>
<p>Are you a client developer working with custom event types in the Matrix ecosystem? It can be tough to keep track of all the different events that are being used, and even harder to interoperate with other developers' clients and bots. That's why I've built the Matrix Events Directory, a website where you can look up and register custom event types. </p>
<p>Here are just a few ways the Matrix Events Directory can help you:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you come across an event type that you're not familiar with, you can use the directory to find out more about it and decide if you want to do anything with it.</li>
<li>If you're working on implementing a new feature in your client, you can use the directory to see if anyone else has already done it and potentially interoperate with their work.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope that the Matrix Events Directory will improve interoperability and make it easier for the community to define and use their own custom events, while still being able to build on top of the Matrix spec. </p>
