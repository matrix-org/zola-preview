<blockquote>
<p>I managed to find some time to commit <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/develop/contrib/lnav"><code>lnav</code> configuration files for Synapse</a> this week. <code>lnav</code> is a log-viewing tool with too many bells and whistles for its own good. I particularly like it because it can interleave multiple log files by timestamp, and highlight log lines based on their severity. If you spend a lot of time looking at logs, these things can lower your blood pressure. Take a look if you think you'd find it useful.</p>

<p>Hello TWIM! It's another week and here at Synapse we released
v1.76.0. The big news for this release is that faster joins are now 
enabled by default. It has arrived üöÄ! In addition, some other notable 
features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the default room version to v10</li>
<li>Added a <code>set_displayname()</code> method to the module API for setting a user's display name</li>
<li>Implemented support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3890">MSC3890</a>: Remotely silence local notifications</li>
<li>Implemented experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3930">MSC3930</a>: Push rules for (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3381">MSC3381</a>) Polls</li>
<li>Add index to improve performance of the <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> endpoint used for jumping to a specific date in the timeline of a room</li>
</ul>
<p>and much more! You can read all about it <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.76.0">here</a>. Also, please note that the upgrade from 1.75 to 1.76 changes the account data replication streams in a backwards-incompatible manner. Server operators running a multi-worker deployment should consult <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.76/docs/upgrade.md#changes-to-the-account-data-replication-streams">the upgrade notes</a>.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="nheko">Nheko</h1>
<p>We did a lot of work on our markdown input this week. mauke finally fixed those pesky links with a closing parenthesis at the end from dropping that when linkified, without breaking links inside parentheses. Yes, it is still a regex and possibly outlawed in many civilized countries for having detrimental side-effects on society, but it works, so who am I to argue! Additionally we changed the newline behaviour (and fixed a bug related to line-breaks as well). A single line-break now corresponds to a line-break. You can find more about that decision <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@deepbluev7/109771668066978726">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/757">here</a>. You can opt out of that behaviour and other changes we do to the default cmark/commonmark behaviour using the new <code>/cmark</code> command. Speaking of other changes, we now support <code>||warning|spoiler||</code> as a way to enter spoilers, with the warning being optional as well as <code>~~text~~</code> for strike-through.</p>
<p>There is also now a workaround for Wayland users, who were bothered by stuck menus. This still needs to be fixed in Qt eventually, but in the meantime you can now close menus by clicking somewhere inside of Nheko thanks to a contribution by enigma9o7. Decodetalkers also made Nheko clean up notifications on exit and the fullscreen image overlay hide, when the save dialog is open. You can create DMs by pasting an mxid again now. Previously you needed to delete and re-enter the last character... The username completer should also now open around twice as fast and clicking notifications now once again restores Nheko from the tray. The last goodie was contributed by Malte. The invite dialog inside a room can now search for users you have a DM open or the server side userdirectory for suggestions.</p>
<p>Also, I am attending FOSDEM, so let's see if you can find me!

<blockquote>
<h1 id="matrix-call-multitrack-recorder">Matrix Call Multitrack recorder</h1>
<p>Resulting from some past discussion of how matrix live may be improved, I did open https://github.com/vector-im/element-call/issues/789 to support multitrack recordings of participants.
However, it turns out this can quite easily be solved using a bot:</p>
<p>Therefor https://git.nordgedanken.dev/mtrnord/matrix-call-multitrack-recorder has been created. This is an early alpha bot using matrix-nio which can participate in both legacy WebRTC matrix native calls and Element-Call style calls.
Its purpose is to record each stream of a user to either a WAV or mp4 file.</p>
<p>However, since this is very early, it should be noted there currently exist some UX issues and some features are missing.</p>
<p>Feel free to give it a try or just join the Room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-call-multitrack-recorder:midnightthoughts.space">#matrix-call-multitrack-recorder:midnightthoughts.space</a></p>
<p>Many thanks to tÔªøuÔªølÔªøiÔªør for https://github.com/maubot/echortc which helped to get a basic MVP rather quickly.</p>

As such, the team has been busy‚Äîlike really busy‚Äîimproving the existing API for Sliding Sync and Timeline, adding fixes, like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1422">duplicate message prevention</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1418">various sliding sync internal fixes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1413">timeline reset</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1396">fixes in the <code>VecDiff</code> generation</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1412">proper retries on decryption errors</a>, and performance improvements, like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1382">defer loading tracked users</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1441">reducing the cold cache size and time</a> and not the least adding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1428">support for tracing via OpenTelemetry</a>.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I've written a small bot-api in Rust that used (and still uses) Fractals Matrix-implementation. Since that has been abandoned <em>quite</em> a while ago, I wanted to look into porting my crate to the matrix-rust-sdk. As it turns out, there wouldn't really be any point in doing so. The SDK can be used more or less directly. Which I've learned, by writing a small <a href="https://github.com/msirringhaus/matrix_exif_bot">demo-bot</a>.</p>
<p>This rather simple bot parses the exif-data of pictures that are posted, extracts the GPS-data (if available) and replies with a Matrix location-event for the image location. The plan was to do this with threads, but the SDK sadly doesn't support those. So good old replies it is.
As a bonus, which turned out to be uglier than I thought, it'll also remove it's location-posts automatically, if the corresponding image gets removed.
Configurable autojoin on invite and a command to leave are implemented as well.</p>

<p>It's that time of year again, and we have a special gift for all of you just in time for the holidays: Neochat now supports end-to-end encryption! This is made possible thanks to the release of libQuotient 0.7.</p>
<p>While this feature is still somewhat experimental, it's a big step forward in ensuring the privacy and security of your conversations. Just keep in mind that if your only logged-in client is Neochat and something goes wrong, you might lose your messages.</p>
<p>If you're feeling adventurous and want to try out the new end-to-end encryption feature, you can already get it from Flathub and some distros. We're also working on supporting it in our Windows, Android, and macOS builds, so stay tuned for updates.</p>

<li>We‚Äôre still working on Notifications, reviewing how they work across platforms for new users, and planning the improvements we‚Äôre looking to make in the new year. While we look at this user experience holistically, we‚Äôre making some subtle changes to the product including removing the bold dot and ordering rooms by activity by default for new users.</li>
<li>We‚Äôre also continuing to improve the password reset flow so that user‚Äôs who can‚Äôt remember their passwords have a smoother experience regaining access to their account.</li>
<li>And, thanks to a contribution we now have the ability to multi-select members when changing users‚Äô permissions in a room! Head to Room Settings &gt; Roles &amp; Permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In labs (you can enable labs features in settings on develop.element.io or on Nightly):</p>
<ul>
<li>Rich text editor improvements are still coming so be sure to check them out, including updates to emoji handling and  inline code formatting.</li>
<li>Threads! Threads notifications and performance improvements are landing thick and fast. We‚Äôre nearly ready to enable the feature by default and we‚Äôll be excited to do that in the new year.

<h1 id="libquotient-0-7">libQuotient 0.7</h1>
<p>It took us (yes, us - there's more than one person actively working on the project!) a very long time but libQuotient 0.7.0 is out, with a <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.7.0">huge wall of release notes</a>. Big, big, BIG thanks to Carl Schwan and Tobias Fella for their contributions and early adoption of this release in NeoChat (NeoChat maintained compatibility with libQuotient's development branch, along with the stable branch, for quite some time by now). A short summary of most significant things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements: C++20, Qt 5.15 or 6.x</li>
<li>E2EE code is now in beta quality, features:
<ul>
<li>sending/receiving new messages</li>
<li>getting historical messages where Megolm keys are already loaded</li>
<li>encrypting/decrypting attachments</li>
<li>device verification (to-device flow only, no in-room verification yet)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Individual APIs for <code>m.fully_read</code> and <code>m.read</code> markers</li>
<li>Client-Server API backend uses Matrix 1.5 API definitions</li>
<li>A complete rewrite of the event types framework to make it truly extensible; you can now add both base classes and specific event types on the client side without touching the library code (the library still provides standard ones)</li>
<li>Account registry for multi-account usage; account access tokens and pickling keys are stored with Qt Keychain</li>
<li>Sticker events support</li>
<li>Pinned messages support</li>
<li>First-class support in Network Access Manager for <code>mxc:</code> URLs, to enable showing inline images in messages</li>
<li>A lot of code tightening, bug fixing, performance improvements</li>

<h1 id="matrix-spam-ml">Matrix Spam ML</h1>
<p>As part of the efforts for working on detecting spam using ML I started to write a moderation bot.</p>
<p>This bot is written from scratch with some design decisions that hopefully will improve usability for both newcomers and seasoned admins.</p>
<p>These decisions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an action can be done using a reaction, then it will be done using a reaction.</li>
<li>There is a private admin room and a public room for warnings, where admins issue actions. This is meant to serve as a human-readable ban list if admins want to provide this to their users.</li>
<li>The bot will at a later point be able to issue reports to server admins via email and matrix easily by allowing admins to just react after doing a ban. The bot will initially ask how to contact a server if it didn't issue a report to the server before. The bot will remember the setting supplied last time for a server and allows updating the settings if they change. These reports will contain a warning that it was issued from the bot and that replies are necessary for it to be properly relayed back to the admins for further questions. These replies will end up as threads in the admin room. Also, as part of the report, the event JSON for the report will be sent with the report to allow server admins to review the case themselves. (This is still WIP)</li>
</ul>
<p>The warnings also contain a &quot;false positive&quot; action. This is meant to be used to feed back into the used model for further training and improving it.</p>
<p>All in all, I hope to simplify the process of moderation based on what I experienced as an admin. Feel free to chime in at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spam-ml:midnightthoughts.space">#matrix-spam-ml:midnightthoughts.space</a> to suggest ideas for the bot. At the time of writing, it is still very much a prototype/demo.</p>

<h1 id="telodendria"><a href="https://telodendria.io">Telodendria</a></h1>
<p><strong>Telodendria</strong> <code>v0.1.0</code> was released earlier this week. This is the very first tagged release, and it is a mostly symbolic release intended to signal that most of the elementary components necessary to construct a Matrix homeserver are now in place, and I'm ready to actually start implementing Matrix API endpoints. In fact, I've already started on the user-interactive authentication API and the registration endpoints, and am making good progress on them.</p>
<p>As always, I could use your help. If you like what's happening, then feel free to spread awareness about the project, come say hi in the <a href="https://telodendria.io/man/man7/telodendria.7.html">Matrix rooms</a>, or <a href="https://telodendria.io/#donate">send a donation</a>. Again, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria-newsletter:bancino.net">#telodendria-newsletter:bancino.net</a> has the latest, and now that I'm actually versioning the project, you might be interested in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria-releases:bancino.net">#telodendria-releases:bancino.net</a>, which is a low-traffic room that simply notifies of new releases.</p>

<h1 id="synapse">Synapse</h1>
<p>How is it Friday already (and the end of the year)?? While the holidays are almost upon us, the
team behind Synapse has been hard at work and has released v1.74.0rc1 for your consideration.
Some notable features and bugfixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved user search for international display names</li>
<li>The addition of a new <code>push.enabled</code> config option to allow opting out of push notification calculation</li>
<li>Fixes for a long-standing bug where a device list update might not be sent to clients in certain circumstances</li>
<li>The addition of Single-Sign On setup instructions for Mastodon-based instances</li>
</ul>
<p>and much, much more! You can take a look here: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases. 
A note about the end of the year: With the holiday season coming up we plan to release Synapse v1.74.0 as normal next Tuesday, December 20th, 2022 and then skip releases for the next two weeks, before resuming with v1.75.0rc1 on Tuesday, January 10th, 2023.</p>

<h1 id="valheim-matrix-bridge">Valheim Matrix Bridge</h1>
<p>The bridge now avoids double bridging even with multiple users running the bridge client side. It also prevents historical messages from showing up in Valheim, so that starting the game is less confusing. Last but not least, red_sky (nheko.im) ported the user color algorithm from Nheko, so the colors should now look more familiar instead of being a generic blue.

<p>Going towards Christmas we from Nordeck can announce that we made another of our widgets Open Source: <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-barcamp">matrix-barcamp</a>.</p>
<p>The matrix-barcamp widget allows to perform agile Barcamps in Matrix spaces. You can create a space, add the widget to a Lobby room and use it to collaboratively create your Barcamp agenda.
Once you set up your sessions, the widget can take care of creating the individual discussion rooms inside the space.
The widget was created in collaboration with the ZIT SH from the German public sector.
Like the <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-poll">matrix-poll</a> widget, this widget is built using TypeScript, React, our <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit">matrix-widget-toolkit</a>, and the matrix-widget-api.

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1255">the last fixes ported over from the demo branch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1270">the growing-full-sync-window support</a> added, we turned our head back to debugging a few remaining <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1405">deserialization</a> and decryption bugs in Sliding Sync when we were hit by a new tokio-thread-panic on Element-X at the end of the week. A quick debugging revealed that it was caused by out of bound indizes supplied by the server. We are still looking into making our code more defensive for these circumstances, too.</p>
<p>Async Uniffi is progressing nicely meanwhile, with now both Swift and Kotlin being able to run and execute a Rust created future. We now have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1228">fallible function support implemented on the proc-frontend</a> and further work is coming up to support <code>&amp;str</code> and <code>&amp;[u8]</code>.</p>
<p>This week also saw the first experimentation in replacing the default Sled database backend. A first PoC attempt was made with sanakirja (pijul is based on), but after learning that its API is unsound and can lead to UB, the team agreed that this requires quit a bit more work (especially in terms of safety guards) than we have time for in the short term. Thus, offering a sqlite-backend for mobile in the short term at least for the crypto store has been agreed upon.</p>

<h1 id="introducing-the-matrix-events-directory">Introducing the Matrix Events Directory</h1>
<p>Are you a client developer working with custom event types in the Matrix ecosystem? It can be tough to keep track of all the different events that are being used, and even harder to interoperate with other developers' clients and bots. That's why I've built the Matrix Events Directory, a website where you can look up and register custom event types. </p>
<p>Here are just a few ways the Matrix Events Directory can help you:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you come across an event type that you're not familiar with, you can use the directory to find out more about it and decide if you want to do anything with it.</li>
<li>If you're working on implementing a new feature in your client, you can use the directory to see if anyone else has already done it and potentially interoperate with their work.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope that the Matrix Events Directory will improve interoperability and make it easier for the community to define and use their own custom events, while still being able to build on top of the Matrix spec. </p>
