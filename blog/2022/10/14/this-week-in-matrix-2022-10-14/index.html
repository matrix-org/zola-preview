<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3873">MSC3873: event_match dotted keys</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC aims to eliminate an ambiguity in the push rules portion of the spec. Specifically, that which arises from how to deal with event fields which have a dot (period) in them - such as <code>m.ts</code>. The problem is that a <code>.</code> in the push rule definition is intended as a path-separator. For instance, if you want to match on the value of the &quot;foo&quot; field in the event below:</p>
<pre data-lang="json" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-json "><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;bar&quot;</span><span>: {
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;foo&quot;</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">123
</span><span>  }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>you'd write &quot;bar.foo&quot;. But if instead of foo, we have <code>m.foo</code>, then you'd be stuck when trying to figure out what field to match against in the following case:</p>
<pre data-lang="json" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-json "><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;bar&quot;</span><span>: {
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;m.foo&quot;</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">1
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;m&quot;</span><span>: {
</span><span>      </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;foo&quot;</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">2
</span><span>    }
</span><span>  }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Are you matching against <code>1</code> or <code>2</code>?</p>
<p>This MSC tries to fix this by stating that &quot;matching on a dot in a field name requires that dot to be escaped&quot;. So you'd write &quot;m.foo&quot; to mean the field <code>m.foo</code>, rather than a dictionary &quot;m&quot; containing a key &quot;foo&quot;.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, check the MSC out and voice your opinion if any of that seems interesting to you :)</p>

<p>It is exciting to see more actors joining the Matrix ecosytem! We strongly encourage ejabberd developers to join #homeservers-dev:matrix.org and to open MSCs if they find clever ways to improve Matrix.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Out of curiosity I wanted to know which <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/server-server-api/#server-discovery">server discovery methods</a> various homeservers were using.
To get the data, I cobbled together my <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@f0x52/autodiscover-server-configuration">autodiscover-server-configuration library</a> with a list of known servers
from my homeserver's <code>destinations</code> table, which holds 14683 entries (although a few are clearly invalid).
After following the discovery flow for every server on the list, it'd also check <code>HEAD /_matrix/key/v2/server</code> to see if the resulting (delegated) hostname is behind a reverse-proxy,
or directly connecting to Synapse (or a proxy-server that doesn't set it's own <code>server</code> header). Visualized are the results.
Some favorite server names:</p>
<ul>
<li>a very large cheesecake shoved into a server rack</li>
<li>you just got gnomed</li>

<p>Another year, another Syphon release (I jest, but it has been a while)!</p>
<p>The long awaited <a href="https://github.com/syphon-org/syphon/releases/tag/0.2.14"><code>0.2.14</code></a> release has been cut last week. Unfortunately, due to CI issues, not all official builds are available yet. As most of the core team has been rather preoccupied with life lately, some delay is expected, but they are on the way!</p>
<p>In the meantime, the GitHub release page contains the successful builds, including Android and MacOS x86, and the full changelog for this release. Some highlights from the latter include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spec-compliant private read receipts (we've had private read receipts for a while, but now they're spec-compliant)!</li>
<li>Device name editing, including a random name generator</li>
<li>Additional text made copy-able in the UI (such as the session ID)</li>
<li>As well as a huge amount of refactoring, bugfixes and general improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, massive thanks to all contributors, especially <code>@EdGeraghty</code> and <code>@Florian-Sabonchi</code> who single-handedly accounted for more than 3/4 of the changelog!</p>

<p>r._.hit has been working on voip call v1 support as part of the Google Summer of Code. Calls v1 are an improvement over the existing v0 call spec, which should make the calling experience much nicer (however they are still an MSC). As part of his work Nheko now mostly supports the v1 signalling. There are some improvements still missing like allowing multiple streams for screenshare instead of compositing them locally and a few more things, but the bulk of the work is done now. Thank you very much for working on this.</p>
<p>In other news Nheko now evaluates pushrules locally, which means you can now get notifications on servers that don't support the /notifications endpoint properly and you can properly get notifications for encrypted messages. Since this is quite a large change, feedback is welcome. We also broke our dbus API to make it faster. When listing rooms they now don't include the avatar, but just an mxc uri and you need to manually query the avatar over dbus if you need it. Last but not least, Nheko now supports Unicode 15 in the emoji picker including 🪿!</p>

<p>This week, we have finally fixed one of my biggest annoyances with NeoChat so far: Mentioning a user will now be highlighted in the input field and more reliable, meaning you will no longer have to guess if writing a user's name will actually create a mention. While implementing this, I also added the ability to send room links in a similar way to user mentions.</p>
<ul>
<li>When switching between rooms, NeoChat will also remember the text you have typed so far and will restore it when you switch back to that room.</li>
<li>When sending a video, the resolution will now be sent correctly</li>
<li>Viewing of custom emojis has been fixed after it broke while implementing link previews</li>
<li>The replied-to message is now shown in a nicer way for messages</li>
</ul>
<p>The image viewer has also been improved significantly: It will now only cover NeoChat's window and includes quick actions to resize, rotate and save the image</p>

<li>There’s a labs setting to start using Element Call from rooms and video rooms for group chats and (I might be biassed) but it’s just wonderful. Check it out!</li>

<li>It’s been a busy week for the Element iOS team - this week we’ve been focussing on improving our accessibility on the navigation elements we introduced a few weeks ago, this includes the voiceover text on the filters.</li>
<li>We’re also making very good progress on the new login with QR code and device manager features and expecting them to be ready soon</li>
<li>Other bug fixes include:
<ul>
<li>Fixing a glitch in the header in the All Chats and Spaces home views.</li>
<li>Fixing the freeze and crash that was occurring when searching in a room</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>This week is a big week for the Android app! After being in Labs for a few weeks the new layout is finally here. We think the new layout simplifies the experience for users:
<ul>
<li>The filters and recents help you get where you’re going faster (but it’s still configurable to your own workflow)</li>
<li>The new spaces menu and access point is within reach, meaning you can separate your chats however you choose, suiting your daily work &amp; play patterns!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The team have also started back up on threads in full force this week so expect some improvements to land soon</li>
<li>It’s not only the fun stuff that’s been worked on, we’re also squashing bugs. My favorite:
<ul>
<li>Animated images now autoplay in the timeline</li>
<li>If the emoji keyboard is disabled, it’s disabled everywhere (previously it would still show when sending a reply)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>libolm 3.2.13 was released this week.  This is mainly a maintenance release to fix compatibility with node 18.  There was also: a minor change to the Python packaging, documentation updates, and a slight improvement to the pkgconfig file.  Most people will not need to update.</p>

<p>simplematrixbotlib is an easy to use bot library for the Matrix ecosystem written in Python and based on matrix-nio.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@imbev:matrix.org">imbev</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is not a new release of simplematrixbotlib this week, however I would like to share some progress on the upcoming simplematrixbotlib version 3.</p>
<h2 id="new-matching-system">New matching system</h2>
<p>Instead of the current implementation that uses the MessageMatch class with various methods such as <code>MessageMatch.command()</code>, <code>MessageMatch.prefix</code>, etc., version 3 will be using a custom matching syntax. The following is a preview of the currently planned matching api for version 3:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>message = </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;!echo something Matrix&quot;
</span><span>
</span><span>prefix = </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;!&quot;
</span><span>rule = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">f</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span>{prefix}</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">echo &lt;message *&gt;&quot;
</span><span>
</span><span>matched = botlib.match(message, rule)
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">if </span><span>matched:
</span><span>    print(matched[</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&#39;message&#39;</span><span>]) </span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># &quot;something matrix&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>In this snippet, rules such as f&quot;{prefix}echo &lt;message *&gt;&quot; would be treated as required literals, with the usage of &lt;&gt; to denote arguments. The optional usage of python's f-strings feature also makes inclusion of variables such as prefix more intuitive and flexible. For more information on the simplematrixbotlib version 3 matching api, please checkout the relevant issue at https://codeberg.org/imbev/simplematrixbotlib/issues/4 or room at https://matrix.to/#/#simplematrixbotlib:matrix.org .</p>

<p>After the release of 0.6 a few weeks back, the team has removed a lot of legacy code that will be dropped by the next release. Most notably the previous experimental timeline API has been removed and was replaced this week with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/940">the new stateful-messages timeliness API</a>, which will soon be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1106">available via FFI, too</a>. Meanwhile the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1054">sliding sync extensions</a> are still on-going as a recent rest showed that the internal test-client jack-in fails to pull events via the API - investigations are under way.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> now includes support for easily customizing the upstream Synapse container image, by adding custom build steps to its <code>Dockerfile</code>.</p>
<p>Until now, people who wished to make additions to the Synapse container image had to make a fork and build it from scratch. This new feature makes things much easier. To learn more, see <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#synapse-container-image-customization-support">this changelog entry</a></p>
<p>This Synapse-customization feature was developed in an effort to assist another feature which we've landed today: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse-s3-storage-provider">synapse-s3-storage-provider</a> support.</p>
<p>Users can now easily store their media repository files on Amazon S3 (or any other S3-compatible object store) using <code>synapse-s3-storage-provider</code>. To get started, see our <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-synapse-s3-storage-provider.md">Storing Synapse media files on Amazon S3 with synapse-s3-storage-provider</a> documentation.</p>
