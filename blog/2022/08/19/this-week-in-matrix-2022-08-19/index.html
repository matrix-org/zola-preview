<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>This week the Spec Core Team focused on improvements to the spec source itself. richvdh <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1211">opened a PR</a> for edit events, and yours truly did <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1210">a small PR</a> to clarify the required state of the response to <code>/_matrix/client/v3/login/</code>.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aspec-bug">a lot more open issues</a> available for people to tackle however, so feel free to get involved and help out if you have some spare time!</p>
<p>Finally other than the usual rounds of review by the team, I've been working on a spec process document that aims to explain the practical portions of the text found at https://spec.matrix.org/proposals/, but in a easily scannable manner. Look out for a PR with that in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2871">MSC2871: Give widgets an indication of which capabilities they were approved for</a>! What a mouthful!</p>
<p>Historically, widgets have laid outside of the spec and have only been implemented in a small subset of clients - mainly Element. As of recent weeks though, there's now a team at Element backing the feature. So exciting times ahead!</p>
<p>Regardless, let's highlight this MSC! It solves a crucial problem with a simple solution. Widgets can ask the client they're embedded in to do certain things (if granted certain capabilities), and the client, potentially after asking the user for permission, can allow or deny those actions. This MSC adds the machinery for a further step: the client will tell the widget what capabilities they requested were allowed, and which were denied.</p>
<p>I believe this spec is non-contentious, but is blocked on widgets entering the spec as a whole. Regardless, if this particular piece of the puzzle interests you, or you'd like to read all about widgets in general, the see either the MSC above or this widget spec tracking PR: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/pull/825.

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.4">Dendrite 0.9.4</a>, containing primarily bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bug in the roomserver around handling rejected outliers has been fixed</li>
<li>Backfilled events will now use the correct history visibility where possible</li>
<li>The device list updater backoff has been fixed, which should reduce the number of outbound HTTP requests and <code>Failed to query device keys for some users</code> log entries for dead servers</li>
<li>The <code>/sync</code> endpoint will no longer incorrectly return room entries for retired invites which could cause some rooms to show up in the client &quot;Historical&quot; section</li>
<li>The <code>/createRoom</code> endpoint will now correctly populate <code>is_direct</code> in invite membership events, which may help clients to classify direct messages correctly</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool will now log an error if the shared secret is not set in the Dendrite config</li>
<li>A couple of minor bugs have been fixed in the membership lazy-loading</li>
<li>Queued EDUs in the federation API are now cached properly</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now has some very dirty hack to render spoilers on desktop platforms. This does not show the reason and not work in mobile mode, doesn't hide it from notifications or from the sidebar. But it is at least something. Similarly we tightened what tags we allow when validating the incoming html again. Also, as a small fix, DMs should now also properly start with encryption enabled when started from a profile and there were a few crash fixes when searching for direct chat partners and closing the window too quickly or when a user uploads a device with invalid keys.</p>

The new reactive <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/940">Timeline API</a> has been progressed, it, too, has some FFI definitions now, allowing mobile client to start playing with it. Crypto-JS, too, has progressed, adding support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/958">de/encrypting attachments in an memory efficient fashion</a>. On the crypto-side, the longer on-going refactor and improvements have yielded another few PRs, too, that have successfully merged, while others are still pending reviews. Other than that, we've seen quite a few smaller fixes and improvements, around logging, docs and the examples.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in the dart SDK we mostly fixed bugs. Many of those are related to call negotiations where streams were closed in the wrong order, not closed at all or in group calls the call never learned about new members or the call_ids would not match. There were also a few fixes to the background thumbnailing support added in 0.11.1, helper methods were added to easily send the right message corresponding to the mimetype of some media and fetching a timeline for some event id should work properly again.</p>
<p>We have some support to mark a room as either a dm or a group using slashcommands now, you have more flexibility when implementing the SSSS Bootstrap now (using the extra Bootstrap parameter in onUpdate() and to round it all off, we now have nice coverage numbers as well as coverage display on merge request diffs.</p>

<h2 id="six-days-until-matrix-community-summit-berlin-2022">Six days until Matrix Community Summit Berlin 2022</h2>
<p>In less than a week the Matrix Community Summit Berlin is taking place at c-base.
Join us early on Thursday (25th August) for a Barcamp where we will brainstorm, draft and prototype new ideas.
The main conference days are Friday and Saturday (26th and 27th August). We have a schedule all about Matrix hosting, clients and development.
With three simultaneous tracks there sure is something for you to listen to. It's also the perfect place to get to know other community members.
Look forward to talks, workshops, a signing party, a Matrix P2P live test, dinner and barbecue!</p>
<p>We're not planing to stream or record the event. Our focus lies on providing a great in-person activities.
If attendees want to blog or toot/tweet about it, please use the hashtag #MatrixCommunitySummit.
Also, German-speaking folks can look forward to more coverage from the event on my podcast.
https://chrpaul.de/podcast/</p>
<p>Because we've heard about some confusion:
The event is NOT organised by the Matrix Foundation. To minimize the misconception, we've renamed it to the Matrix Community Summit Berlin.
This is an event initiated by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@yan:datanauten.de">Yan</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaller94:matrix.org">jaller94</a> and other Matrix enthusiasts. We also organise the Matrix Meetup Berlin.</p>

<p>Have you ever felt lost in the Matrix world? Too many rooms and spaces to manage? Well, back by popular demand  (with Timo's blessing), I present, The Room of the Week! Every week we strive to highlight a room or a space that we believe deserves attention for discussing interesting going on across the Matrix Network.</p>
<p>Last week, we were serving coffee, this week, it's tea! Specifically, tea at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#tea:matrix.org">#tea:matrix.org</a></p>
<p>Do you prefer sheng or shu puerh? Maybe bit more into lapsang, liuan or perhaps cliff oolongs? Greens or whites? Sencha? Having mood to discuss impact of varios clays and pot shapes? Is it better warm up water in bofura, tetsubin or electric kettle? Simply everything about the tea.</p>
<p>Come join us while the kettle is whistling.</p>
<p>If you have a room you wish to see highlighted, join us at:
https://matrix.to/#/!bIyiUUnriVoHtYzuPS:fachschaften.org?via=chat.shawnsorbom.net&amp;via=matrix.org&amp;via=fachschaften.org
To get your favorite room of the week highlighted.</p>
