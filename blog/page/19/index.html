            <h2 id="matrix-1-0">Matrix 1.0</h2>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We are very excited to announce the first fully stable release of the Matrix protocol and specification across **all **APIs - as well as the Synapse 1.0 reference implementation which implements the full Matrix 1.0 API surface.</p>
<p>This means that after just over 5 years since the initial work on Matrix began, we are proud to have finally <strong>exited beta</strong>!!  This is the conclusion of the work which we announced at <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019">FOSDEM 2019</a> when we cut the first stable release of the Server-Server API and began the Synapse 0.99 release series in anticipation of releasing a 1.0.</p>
<p>Now, before you get too excited, it’s critical to understand that Matrix 1.0 is all about providing a <strong>stable, self-consistent, self-contained and secure version of the standard</strong> which anyone should be able to use to independently implement production-grade Matrix clients, servers, bots and bridges etc.  It does <strong>not</strong> mean that all planned or possible features in Matrix are now specified and implemented, but that the most important core of the protocol is a well-defined stable platform for everyone to build on.</p>
<p>On the Synapse side, our focus has been exclusively on ensuring that Synapse correctly implements Matrix 1.0, to provide a stable and secure basis for participating in Matrix without risk of room corruption or other nastinesses.  However, we have deliberately <strong>not</strong> focused on performance or features in the 1.0 release - so I’m afraid that synapse’s RAM footprint will not have got significantly better, and your favourite long-awaited features (automatically defragmenting rooms with lots of forward extremities, configurable message retention, admin management web-interface etc) have not yet landed.  In other words, this is the opposite of the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/the-big-1-0-68fa7c6050be">Riot 1.0 release</a> (where the entire app was redesigned and radically improved its performance and UX) - instead, we have adopted the mantra to <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast">make it work, make it work right, and then (finally) make it fast</a>.  You can read the <a href="/blog/2019/06/11/synapse-1-0-0-released">full release notes</a> here.  It’s also worth looking at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.0.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> through the Synapse 0.99 release series to see the massive amount of polishing that’s been going on here.</p>
<p>All this means that the main headline features which land in Matrix 1.0 are vitally important but relatively dry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using X.509 certificates to trust servers rather than perspective notaries, to simplify and improve server-side trust.  This is a <strong>breaking change</strong> across Matrix, and we’ve given the community several months now to ensure their homeservers run a valid TLS certificate.  See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">MSC1711</a> for full details, and the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/05/24/final-countdown-to-1-0">2 week warning</a> we gave.  As of ~9am UTC today, the matrix.org homeserver is running Synapse 1.0 and enforcing valid TLS certificates - the transition has begun (and so far we haven’t spotted any major breakage :).  Thank you to everyone who <a href="https://arewereadyyet.com">got ready</a> in advance!</li>
<li>Using .well-known URIs to discover servers, in case you can’t get a valid TLS certificate for your server’s domain.</li>
<li>Switching to <strong><a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v4.html">room version 4</a> by default</strong> for creating new rooms.  This fixes the most important defects that the core room algorithm has historically encountered, particularly:
<ul>
<li>The new State Resolution algorithm to fix the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2432">Hotel California bug</a> and many others: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">State Resolution Reloaded</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1659">Collision resistant event IDs</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Specifying the ability to upgrade between room versions</li>
<li>Full specification of lazy loading room members</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1267">Short Authentication String</a> (Emoji!) interactive verification of E2EE devices</li>
<li>...and lots and lots and lots of bugfixes and spec omission fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, there is a <em>lot</em> of really exciting stuff in flight right now which sadly didn’t stabilise in time for Matrix 1.0, but will be landing as fast as we can finalise it now that 1.0 is at last out the door.  This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editable messages!  (These are in Synapse 1.0 and Riot already, but still stabilising so not enabled by default)</li>
<li>Reactions! (Similarly these are in develop)</li>
<li>Threading!! (We’ve planted the seeds for this in the new ‘aggregations’ support which powers edits &amp; reactions - but full thread support is still a bit further out).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/uhoreg/matrix-doc/blob/cross-signing2/proposals/1756-cross-signing.md">Cross-signed verification for end-to-end encryption</a> (This is on a branch, but due to land any day now).  We’ve also held off merging E2E backups into the Matrix 1.0 spec until cross-signing lands, given it may change the backup behaviour a bit.  Once this is done, we can seriously talk about turning on E2E by default everywhere.</li>
<li>Live-tracking of room statistics and state in Synapse!  (This is in Synapse 1.0 already if you check out the new room_stats and room_state tables, but we need to provide a nice admin interface for it).</li>
<li>Support for smaller footprint homeservers by reducing memory usage and stopping them from joining overly complex rooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then stuff which we haven’t yet started, but is now unlocked by the 1.0 release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixing extremities build-up (and so massively improving performance)</li>
<li>Rewriting Communities.  Groups/Communities deliberately didn’t land in Matrix 1.0 as the current implementation has issues we want to fix first.  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a> has the details.</li>
<li>Rewritten room directory using the new room stats/state tables to be super-speedy.</li>
<li>Super-speedy <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3122">incremental state resolution</a></li>
<li>Removing MXIDs from events (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1228">MSC1228</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to give a quick taster of the shape of things to come, here’s RiotX/Android, the all-new Riot client for Android, showing off Edits &amp; Reactions in the wild…
<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/blog/img/edits.jpg" style="height: 640px;"/>
</div>
<br/>
...and here’s a screenshot of the final test jig for cross-signing devices in end-to-end encryption, so you will never have to manually verify new devices for a trusted user ever again!  We demoed a *very* early version of this at FOSDEM, but this here is the testing harness for real deal, after several iterations of the spec and implementation to nail down the model. + means the device/user's cross-signing key is trusted, T means it's TOFU:

<br/>
So, there you have it - welcome to Matrix 1.0, and we look forward to our backlog of feature work now landing!
<p>Massive massive thanks to everyone who has stuck with the project over the years and helped support and grow Matrix - little did we think back in May 2014 that it’d take us this long to exit beta, but hopefully you’ll agree that it’s been worth it :)</p>
<p>Talking of which, we were looking through the photos we took from the first ever session hacking on Matrix back in May 2014…</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/nightmare.jpg" alt="Whiteboard 1" /></p>
<p>...suffice it to say that of the architectural options, we went with #3 in the end...</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/pl.jpg" alt="Whiteboard 2" /></p>
<p>...and that nowadays we actually know how power levels work, in excruciating and (hopefully) well-specified detail :)</p>
<p>There has been an absolutely enormous amount of work to pull Matrix 1.0 together - both on the spec side (thanks to the Spec Core Team for corralling proposals, and everyone who's contributed proposals, and particularly to Travis for editing it all) and the implementation side (thanks to the whole Synapse team for the tedious task of cleaning up everything that was needed for 1.0).  And of course, huge thanks go to everyone who has been helping test and debug the Synapse 1.0 release candidates, or just supporting the project to get to this point :)</p>
<h2 id="the-matrix-org-foundation">The Matrix.org Foundation</h2>
<p>Finally, as promised, alongside Matrix 1.0, we are very happy to announce the official launch of the finalised Matrix.org Foundation!</p>
<p>This has been a long-running project to ensure that Matrix’s future is governed by a neutral non-profit custodian for the benefit of everyone in the Matrix ecosystem.  We started the process nearly a year ago back with the initial proposal <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org">Towards Open Governance of Matrix.org</a>, and then legally <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2">incorporated the Foundation</a> in October, and published the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1779/proposals/1779-open-governance.md">final governance proposal</a> in January.</p>
<p>As of today the Foundation is finalised and operational, and all the assets for Matrix.org have been transferred from <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a> (the startup we formed in 2017 to hire the core Matrix team).  In fact you may already have seen Matrix.org Foundation notices popping up all over the Matrix codebase (as all of New Vector’s work on the public Matrix codebase for the foreseeable is being assigned to the Matrix.org Foundation).</p>
<p>Most importantly, we’re excited to introduce the <strong>Guardians of the Matrix.org Foundation</strong>.  The Guardians are the legal directors of the non-profit Foundation, and are responsible for ensuring that the Foundation (and by extension the Spec Core Team) keeps on mission and neutrally protects the development of Matrix. Guardians are typically independent of the commercial Matrix ecosystem and may even not be members of today’s Matrix community, but are deeply aligned with the mission of the project. Guardians are selected to be respected and trusted by the wider community to uphold the guiding principles of the Foundation and keep the other Guardians honest.</p>
<p>We have started the Foundation with five Guardians - two being the original founders of the Matrix project (Matthew and Amandine) and three being entirely independent, thus ensuring the original Matrix team forms a minority which can be kept in check by the rest of the Guardians. The new Guardians are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prof. Jon Crowcroft - Marconi Professor of Communications Systems in the Computer Lab at the University of Cambridge and the Turing Institute. Jon is a pioneer in the field of decentralised communication, and a fellow of the Royal Society, the ACM, the British Computer Society, the Institution of Engineering and Technology, the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.<br/><br/>Jon is a global expert in decentralisation and data privacy, and is excellently placed to help ensure Matrix stays true to its ideals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ross Schulman - Ross is a senior counsel and senior policy technologist at New America’s Open Technology Institute, where he focuses on internet measurement, emerging technologies, surveillance, and decentralization. Prior to joining OTI, Ross worked for Google.<br/><br/>Ross brings a unique perspective as a tech- and decentralisation-savvy lawyer to the Foundation, as well as being one of the first non-developers in the Matrix community to run his own homeserver. Ross has been known to walk around Mozfest clutching a battery-powered Synapse in a box, promoting decentralised communication for all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr. Jutta Steiner - As co-founder and CEO of Parity Technologies, Jutta is dedicated to building a better internet - Web 3.0 - where users’ privacy &amp; control come first. Parity Technologies is a leader in the blockchain space – known to many as the creator of one of the most popular Ethereum clients, it is also the creator of two ambitious new blockchain technlogies, Polkadot and Substrate, that make it easier to experiment and innovate on scalability, encryption and governance.<br/><br/>Parity has been pioneering Matrix enterprise use since the moment they decided to rely on Matrix for their internal and external communication back in 2016, and now run their own high-volume deployment, with end-to-end encryption enabled by default. Jutta represents organisations who are professionally dependent on Matrix day-to-day, as well as bringing her unique experiences around decentralisation and ensuring that Web 3.0 will be a fair web for all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’d like to offer a very warm welcome to the new Guardians, and thank them profusely for giving up their time to join the Foundation and help ensure Matrix stays on course for the years to come.</p>
<p>For the full update on the Foundation, please check out the new website content at <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">https://matrix.org/foundation</a> which should tell you everything you could possibly want to know about the Foundation, the Guardians, the Foundation’s legal Articles of Association, and the day-to-day Rules which define the Open Governance process.</p>
<h2 id="and-finally">And finally…</h2>
<p>Matrix 1.0 has been a bit of an epic to release, but puts us on a much stronger footing for the future.</p>
<p>However, it’s very unlikely that we’d have made it this far if most of the core dev team wasn’t able to work on Matrix as their day job.  Right now we are actively looking for large-scale donations to the Matrix.org Foundation (and/or investment in <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a>) to ensure that the team can maintain as tight a focus on core Matrix work as possible, and to ensure the project realises its full potential.  While Matrix is growing faster than ever, this perversely means we have more and more distractions - whether that’s keeping the Matrix.org server safe and operational, or handling support requests from the community, or helping new members of the ecosystem get up and running.  If you would like Matrix to succeed, please <a href="mailto:funding@matrix.org">get in touch</a> if you’d like to sponsor work, prioritise features, get support contracts, or otherwise support the project.  We’re particularly interested in sponsorship around decentralised reputation work (e.g. publishing a global room directory which users can filter based on their preferences).</p>
<p>Finally, huge thanks to everyone who has continued to support us through thick and thin on <a href="https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a>, <a href="https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg">Liberapay</a> or other platforms.  Every little helps here, both in terms of practically keeping the lights on, and also inspiring larger donations &amp; financial support.</p>
<p>So: thank you once again for flying Matrix.  We hope you enjoy 1.0, and we look forward to everything else landing on the horizon!</p>
<p>- Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix.org Team.</p>

            <p>Well here it is: Synapse 1.0.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.0 is the reference implementation of the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec">Matrix 1.0 spec</a>. The goal of the release overall has been to focus on security and stability, such that we can officially declare Synapse (and Matrix) out of beta and recommended for production use. This means changing the default room protocol version used for new rooms to be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/37871106c6fc6013c17b5711fb93853fff140267/proposals/2002-rooms-v4.md">v4</a>, which includes the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/f714aaadd011ac736d779f8460202a8d95799123/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">state resolution algorithm</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/event_id_hashes/proposals/1659-event-id-as-hashes.md">collision-resistant event IDs</a>, which are now formatted to be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/proposal/no_slash_in_event_id/proposals/1884-replace-slashes-in-event_ids.md">URL safe</a>.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.0 also ships with support for the upcoming <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v5.html">v5 room protocol</a> (which enforces honouring server key validity periods), but this will not be used as the default for new rooms until a sufficient number of servers support it.</p>
<p>Please note that Synapse 1.0 does <strong>not</strong> include significant performance work or new features - our focus has been almost exclusively on providing a reference implementation of the Matrix 1.0 protocol. But having cleared our backlog on security/stability issues we will finally be now unblocked to pursue work around reducing RAM footprint, eliminating forward-extremity build up, and shipping new features like Edits, Reactions &amp; E2E cross-signing support.</p>
<p>As part of the security work, Synapse 1.0 contains a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md#it-used-to-work-just-fine-why-are-you-breaking-everything">breaking change</a> that requires a valid TLS certificate on the federation API endpoint. <strong>Servers that do not configure their certificate will no longer be able to federate post 1.0.</strong></p>
<p>It is also worth noting that Synapse 1.0.0 is the last release that will support Python 2.x and Postgres 9.4. For more information see <a href="/blog/2019/04/08/synapse-deprecating-postgres-9-4-and-python-2-x">here</a> but the TL;DR is that you should upgrade asap.</p>
<p>This release has been a long time coming. Many thanks indeed to everyone who helped test the release candidates and provided feedback along the way.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.0 is just one component of a larger Matrix 1.0 release, which you can <a href="/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation">read all about here</a>.</p>

<p>Quiet week, not much happening, the only real progress has been shipping a Synapse 1.0 release candidate :) Joking aside we’d really appreciate your help in testing it ahead of the full release next week. Get the RC here <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.0.0rc1">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.0.0rc1</a></p>
<p>Also friends don’t let friends operate a Synapse install without a valid certificate on the federation API. Post 1.0, servers that are not compliant will be locked out of the federation.

<p>Are you in the know about Matrix? If not, prepare to learn about <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/">RiotX</a>, a <em>completely re-written</em> Matrix client for Android. This new version has a Kotlin SDK.</p>
<p>Benoit, from the team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many things to announce this week on RiotX:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto is starting to work! We can now decrypt message and send encrypted messages. The whole feature is not implemented yet, but we will merge the PR at the beginning next week before going further. Thanks François for the great work!</li>
<li>On the timeline, message composed by only emoji are now displayed bigger (as in other Riot clients)</li>
<li>We can now see details and actions of each message, including state event.</li>
<li>We can also see the detailed list of reactions for a particular message, and reaction display rendering has been improved. More details of what has been improved by Valere can be found in this PR description: <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/pull/168">https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/pull/168</a>.</li>
<li>Local echo on message edition has been improved</li>
<li>The 3 main themes has been implemented (Light, Dark Black). Status theme is still there but has not been tested yet. There are still some little issues which will be fixed in the next coming days.</li>
<li>The new Home is on develop, composed by a catchup tab, a direct message tab and a group room tab. The drawer is now used to display the groups hierarchy.</li>
<li>A debug signature has been added to the git repository, so the APK built by buildkite can now be installed and replace a previously installed APK.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is still lots of work to do, but we are quite confident to deliver a first alpha version of RiotX to a larger audience at the end of June.</p>

<p>I spent so much of my week migrating matrix.org to a great new design (from Nad), and am really happy with the result. I'm also really happy with Gatsby, the SSG we've chosen. All these things have flaws but overall it works well.</p>

<p>See you next week, and be sure to stop by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> with your updates!</p>

<p>Alongside Synapse’s 1.0 release, the Matrix Specification is also getting a 1.0 on June 10th. In practice this means a fresh release of the Client-Server, Server-Server, Application Service, and Identity Service specifications. The Push Specification is just so simple it hasn’t needed an update yet.</p>

<p>Main news in synapse-land this week is that we released Synapse v0.99.5.2, which fixes a big performance regression which was introduced v0.99.5. Folks who are currently on v0.99.5/v0.99.5.1 are advised to upgrade asap.</p>
<p>Otherwise, work has been continuing apace towards a v1.0 release on 10th June.</p>

<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/">Construct</a> is a homeserver implementation in C++:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Construct has added support for Server Access Control Lists (m.room.server_acl). The exact behavior of the implementation is configurable by the server administrator, and is even more comprehensive than Synapse. In Construct, ACLs can be configured to cover incoming EDUs, outgoing events, and indirectly fetched events.</li>
<li>The GraphicsMagick library has been utilized to implement the media thumbnailing feature called for by the specification. This is an optional dependency written in C and offers a rich API which as been extremely fun to work with. In the future, expect your Construct to be capable of things like annotating images with the Server Command Line which can be used to generate memes in your chatroom or write custom text on top of stickers!</li>
<li>On the backend we have devoted significant effort to getting the most out of dynamic-linking to simplify the architecture of a large and modular free-software project. This effort makes adding features and contributions to Construct extremely straightforward. I will enumerate the basics for those familiar with developing C software: We are now loading all modules at runtime with the flags <code>RTLD_GLOBAL|RTLD_DEEPBIND|RTLD_LAZY</code> and we build with the flag <code>--weak-unresolved-symbols</code>; during execution we hook the error handling in <code>ld.so</code> to throw our own C++ exception directly from the PLT slot of a missing symbol. In summary this allows features to be added to Construct by simply creating an interface in a header and definitions in a loadable module, while still enjoying optional loading and unloading of the module at runtime. This is a significant feat that remains unrealized in most existing projects around the free software ecosystem!</li>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> now has native Matrix edit support in both directions and basic Prometheus metrics. I'll probably start making 0.6.0 RCs after improving the metrics a bit.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts">mautrix-hangouts</a> got some bugfixes and options to configure the displaynames of the ghost users on Matrix (like adding <code>(FB)</code> or <code>(Hangouts)</code> suffixes).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a>'s Matrix puppeting was finished (meaning typing notifs, read receipts and presence updates can now be bridged to WhatsApp) and unexpected disconnection handling was fixed (automatic reconnections should now usually work again).
Backfilling needed some hacks to work with Matrix puppeting. The problem is that the real Matrix users have rate limits and can't send timestamp-massaged messages. I decided to just invite the default ghost user to the room while backfilling and make it leave afterwards so that private chat room names and such would stay intact. Some clients like Riot Android/iOS sometimes do weird things, such as moving the room out of &quot;People&quot;, but that shouldn't be too bad.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> has seen some work in becoming more flexible.</p>
<p>Synapse is not a requirement anymore. People can now use the playbook to install any of the other services, wiring them to a Synapse instance installed in another way.
This is mostly useful for installing bridges or other auxiliary services without going &quot;all in&quot; on the playbook.
Not having Synapse as a fixed requirement also opens the door for installing alternative homeservers, when such become available in the future.</p>
<p>On a similar note, to ease maintanability, all bridges have been moved to separate Ansible roles (outside of the <code>matrix-synapse</code> role).
There have been lots of improvements related to bridge configuration with even more likely to come soon.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>After lots of refinements, polishing and a few distractions we’re finally at the point of announcing the final timeline for both Matrix 1.0 and Synapse 1.0! We are targeting <strong>Monday 10th June</strong> as our release date - please consider this your two week warning!</p>
<p>This is the end game of the process we began back in February when we released the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019">first stable release of the Server-Server API</a> at FOSDEM, and started the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/05/synapse-0-99-0">Synapse 0.99</a> release series to prepare for 1.0.</p>
<p>Matrix 1.0 refers to the upcoming set of API releases which provides a matched set of stable and secure APIs across all of Matrix - at which point the project (at last) exits beta! In practice, this will be Client-Server API 0.5 (including final membership lazy loading, E2E backups and interactive verification and lots more), SS API 0.2 (including server key validity period fixes and associated v5 room protocol) and any other spec updates. The next 2 weeks will see a flurry of spec activity as we get everything together - you can see the full list and track the progress for the CS 0.5 spec release at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/2.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Synapse 1.0 will be the reference implementation of Matrix 1.0, and so makes the changes required to implement Matrix 1.0 and close all currently known security and stability issues and thus exit beta. This means changing the default room protocol version used for new rooms to be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/37871106c6fc6013c17b5711fb93853fff140267/proposals/2002-rooms-v4.md">v4</a>, which includes the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/f714aaadd011ac736d779f8460202a8d95799123/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">state resolution algorithm</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/event_id_hashes/proposals/1659-event-id-as-hashes.md">collision-resistant event IDs</a>, which are now formatted to be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/proposal/no_slash_in_event_id/proposals/1884-replace-slashes-in-event_ids.md">URL safe</a>. <strong>Support for v4 rooms shipped in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/05/21/synapse-0-99-5-1-released">Synapse 0.99.5.1</a>, so please upgrade asap to 0.99.5.1 before 1.0 is released to ease the transition.</strong>. Synapse 1.0 will also ship with support for the upcoming v5 room protocol (which enforces honouring server key validity periods), but this will not used as the default for new rooms until sufficient servers are speaking Matrix 1.0.</p>
<p>As part of the security work, Matrix 1.0 and Synapse 1.0 also contains a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md#it-used-to-work-just-fine-why-are-you-breaking-everything">breaking change</a> that requires a valid TLS certificate on the federation API endpoint. <strong>Servers that do not configure their certificate will no longer be able to federate post 1.0</strong></p>
<p>You can check that your server has been correctly configured <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/">here</a> and see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">here</a> for more info on what you need to do. If in doubt head to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>We've been tracking readiness for the certificate change at https://arewereadyyet.com, at the time of writing 68% of active <em>servers</em> on the federation have valid certificates. We obviously would want that number to be higher, however since the largest installations <em>have</em> upgraded the total number of <em>users</em> who are ready for 1.0 stands at 96%, which we consider to be high enough to release 1.0.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/awry.2019-05-24.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>This is not a drill</strong>, from here until 10th June we need everyone to not only ensure that their own server is ready, but also to encourage their fellow admins to update as well. With your help we can get everyone over the line!</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for your help to date, especially those providing support in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>Onwards!</p>

<p>The process of renaming QMatrixClient to Quotient has commenced - expect some turbulence while we're transitioning. The place for the repos is at <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im">https://github.com/quotient-im</a>. Note that although the library repo name has changed, the old version of the library will continue releases under the old name (libQMatrixClient), and only in the master branch the library will be renamed. In most cases redirects should bring you home even if you request the old URL (thanks to GitHub); however, people with git repos are strongly advised to update their remotes to new URLs!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neo now supports sending multiple images, videos and files at once. You'll get a bar with previews, and the option to remove them from the queue/add more.<br />
There's also been a bunch of changes to how events are handled. Images and videos should be much more robust against missing keys (no thumbnail, no information, etc), and there's basic displaying of the most common state events.<br />
I also added an experimental media repository fallback option, which is disabled by default, and only implemented for room avatars. This allows you to provide a list of alternative homeservers Neo is allowed to try when your own homeserver can't load a piece of media.<br />
Due to the loss of lain.haus, I lost admin access in the Neo room, so keep your eyes out for a new one when my infra is back.<br />
I'm currently not really versioning anything, but I do push significant commits to <a href="https://neo.lain.haus/neo">https://neo.lain.haus/neo</a> for people to try. Once it gets to a more useable state, I'll start adopting semantic versioning.</p>

<h3 id="major-whatsapp-bridging-update">Major WhatsApp bridging update</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> made great strides on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on mautrix-whatsapp to add history bridging and Matrix puppeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>New portals are populated with some history when creating them (exact count is configurable)</li>
<li>All messages missed during bridge downtime are backfilled</li>
<li>Creating portals is smarter now:</li>
<li>When logging in initially, it'll create portals for a few recent chats (count configurable).</li>
<li>It'll create portals when there are incoming messages as before, but it should no longer create portals for chats that only have old messages.</li>
<li>The missed message backfilling creates portals when necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Matrix puppeting isn't quite finished yet. It can already use your Matrix account to bridge messages sent from whatsapp mobile, but it doesn't use the account to bridge EDUs (typing notifs, presence, read receipts) yet.</p>
<p>To make the history bridging a bit nicer, I made a PR to fix timestamp massaging in synapse: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/5233. Timestamp massaging was removed from the spec in 1.0, but it wasn't intentionally removed from synapse, it just broke due to other changes. It was probably supposed to stay there as an easter egg until there's a proper solution for bridging history.</p>

<h3 id="gsoc-2019-reliable-bridges">GSoC 2019 – Reliable Bridges</h3>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kai:nasnotfound.de">Kai</a> for this introduction to his project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>Reliable Bridges</em> GSoC project is about implementing a feedback mechanism for the Matrix network in cases where bridges are not able to properly handle messages. Currently clients are unable to know if a message was successfully sent over a bridge. With the new mechanism in place they get the information about errors happening at bridges and can behave accordingly by e.g. notify the user of the failed delivery.</p>
<p>The implementation is foremost focused on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-dicord</a> bridge which uses the underlying <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>. A JS bridge was chosen so that as much code as possible is brought into the SDK and other bridges can profit sooner from the work done.</p>
<p>The first step for implementing the new feature will be the signaling of permanent errors occurring at the bridge (in contrast to temporary failures). They might occur e.g. when the sending account was banned on the bridged foreign network. These permanent errors will be implemented as a new type of PDU originating from the bridge.</p>
<p>After permanent errors are done, the subsequent weeks will see work on temporary failures which might include work on Synapse as well as work on Riot Web to have a client which actually uses the new events. As these events are new features being introduced there will also be a MSC draft. There everyone can check out the proposed solution and tear it apart with their criticism (if applicable 😉).</p>
<p>For discussions related to the GSoC project or when you have some opinions on how the MSC should look like, you are invited to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#reliablebridges:nasnotfound.de">Reliable Bridges Matrix room</a>.</p>

            <p>Okay folks, this is an important one. v0.99.5.1 will be the last release before we ship Synapse v1.0. <strong>It is really important that you upgrade to v0.99.5.1 because it implements rooms <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/room_v4/proposals/2002-rooms-v4.md">version 4</a> - which is the room version that Synapse 1.0 will default to.</strong></p>
<p>This means that Synapse 1.0 servers will create new rooms as version 4 by default and servers that have not upgraded to at least v0.99.5.1 will not be able to join those rooms.</p>
<p>Over the coming days we will announce a release day for Synapse v1.0, the idea is to give admins 2 weeks notice so that anyone yet to configure their federation SSL certificate has time to do so. <strong>This is important, failure to configure your certs will mean not being able to federate with v1.0 servers.</strong> If you are not sure if you certs are valid, you can test <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/">here</a> and read <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">here</a> for more info on what to do.</p>
<p>Aside from room v4, this release also includes the ability to blacklist specific IPs from federating as well as experimental support for edits and reactions. We are not quite ready to mark the feature 'done done', but it is very close. Watch out for news as the feature lands properly.</p>
<p>We're really close to v1.0 now, give us a few more days and we'll announce an official release date.</p>
<p>As ever, you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.5.1">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.

<p>This is great! All Rubyists should check it out. Ananace notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I still need to set up fixtures for all the API endpoints I'm exposing so I can verify every single API call as well, but I see that as a later thing as that relates mostly to how the other side (the HS) handles my input, not to how the SDK itself handles said input</p>
