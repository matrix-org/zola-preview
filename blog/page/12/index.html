<h3 id="the-latest-in-appservice-proposals-synthetic-events">The latest in appservice proposals: Synthetic events</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, I've been let loose on more spec things: This time I'm looking at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">synthetic events</a>. The goal with this proposal is to give appservices more visibility over the innards and actions of a homeserver. When a user registers, we want an appservice to know (perhaps to send them a little greeting, or to provision some resources) or perhaps you want to clear up bridge resources when the user deactivates their account.</p>
<p>The hope with this proposal is that it's going to set the foundations for services to be able to hook into and provide richer functionality based upon user actions outside of rooms. It might sound a little dry right now, but eventually I'm hoping this can be extended in lots of ways and potentially do away with per-implementation modules, instead writing services that work with all homeservers.</p>
<p>Please give the proposal some love/feedback :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When asked if that was a specification change he drafted because of limitations faced when trying to implement a bridge, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, so it's something I've been plotting for a while, but internally we wanted the ability to &quot;act&quot; based upon signups to a homeserver i.e. sending a welcome. In the past this has been implemented client-side in Element, but that has obvious caveats.</p>
<p>The traditional response has usually been to write a Synapse module, but I wanted to do something that could be used on other homeserver implementations and also not have to have it co-located with the homeserver, so the natural home for this kind of logic was appservices. </p>
<p>There are other things there too like logouts / deactivations which are good for erasing data on a service too. Generally I'm hoping it can be extended further once it's stable, for other use cases too</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3401">MSC3401</a> (Native Group Voip Signalling) has been receiving positive feedback over the course of the week. The MSC spells out how one would go about implementing native, decentralised group voice and video calls over Matrix without the need for a third-party service. This is the next step forward after the full-mesh group signalling work, as demoed in previous editions of TWIM, lands. Quite exciting stuff!</p>
<p>Otherwise there was another Spec Core Team retro this week. Discussion focused mainly on how to handle event types that not every implementation using Matrix may need (think pinned messages and how that might not be very useful for IoT networks...). Watch this space!</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2666">MSC2666: Get rooms in common with another user</a>!</p>
<p>This is actually already implemented and enabled by default in Synapse, believe it or not. But no clients have support for it yet (there is an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/4897">outstanding matrix-react-sdk PR</a>...).</p>
<p>This is a pretty cool feature in my opinion, any client want to be the first?</p>

<p>This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/09/21/synapse-1-43-0-released">released Synapse 1.43</a>! This mainly contains internal changes, including those in preparation for Spaces leaving beta, but it's worth calling out that this version of Synapse now uses the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: room version capabilities</a> API to ask clients to prefer <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">room version 9</a> when creating restricted rooms.</p>
<p>Support for room version 9 was introduced in Synapse 1.42, so we'd strongly encourage administrators to upgrade.</p>
<p>Perhaps more notably for Synapse developers, we've spent quite a lot of time over the past few weeks improving the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/">SyTest</a> suite of integration tests. Several of the tests had race conditions which would cause them to occasionally fail when testing a multi-worker deployment of Synapse. These flakey tests have plagued our continuous integration pipelines, and are finally being fixed.</p>
<p>The long term plan is still to transition to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a> (written in Go) and away from SyTest (written in Perl), but we still need to ensure that SyTest is reliable in the meantime.</p>

<p>Hi there,
Didn't post updates about the etke.cc service for a while. If somebody not familiar - we setup and maintain matrix servers (based on awesome <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>)... and setup VPN... and DNS recursive resolver, and... AND!!!! Provide hosting, yes. So, starting today that's available for everyone (we offer it for some time in &quot;well, you know, we don't provide hosting, but if you want it so hard...&quot; way and it works good)</p>
<p>Even with that update (literally the most requested thing, was in every third order we got), provided hosting considered as your own server, the only difference that you don't pay hosting provider directly, but through us. So, you get root access to the server and we treat it as any other customer's infrastructure</p>

<p>What improvements did hifi bring to the formatting you may ask? I asked, and hifi answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the fallbacks are inconsistent and usually are markdown which is a lie üòÖ
replies and mentions are completely all over the place in the fallback in addition to being markdown 
the unformatted html is now something in between and doesn't do code blocks at all because those ticks are just noise on irc 
it tries to look like more that you pasted long text rather than sending markdown </p>

<p>That's very considerate for IRC user, thanks hifi!</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.43.0 is out now!</p>
<h2 id="preparing-for-spaces">Preparing for Spaces</h2>
<p>Quite a lot of work has gone into preparing for Spaces to graduate from beta testing. For example, Synapse now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asks clients to prefer <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">room version 9</a> when creating restricted rooms (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10772">#10772</a>), via the API defined in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: room version capabilities</a>.</li>
<li>Allows the Spaces Summary APIs to be handled by worker processes.</li>
<li>Omits rooms with unknown room versions from the Spaces Summary.</li>
<li>Properly handles upgrades of Spaces to different room versions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Includes initial work toward fully supporting oEmbed for embedding URL previews (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10714">#10714</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10759">#10759</a>).</li>
<li>Slightly speeds up room joins over federation (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10754">#10754</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10755">#10755</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10756">#10756</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10780">#10780</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10784">#10784</a>).</li>
<li>Somewhat improves service restart times for large Synapse deployments.</li>
<li>Significantly refactors federation event authentication code for greater clarity (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10744">#10744</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10745">#10745</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10746">#10746</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10771">#10771</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10773">#10773</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10781">#10781</a>).</li>
<li>Adds further static type hints to various modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also spent quite a lot of time on SyTest, our integration test suite. In particular, many of the tests made assumptions about event processing which were not correct when targeting a multi-worker Synapse deployment. These flakey tests have plagued our continuous integration pipelines, and are finally being fixed.</p>
<p>These are just the highlights; please see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.43.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/AndrewFerr">AndrewFerr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BramvdnHeuvel">BramvdnHeuvel</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cuttingedge1109">cuttingedge1109</a>.</p>

<h3 id="spec">Spec</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3394">MSC3394: New auth rule that only allows someone to post a message in relation to another message</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs are in FCP.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>If MSC2918 above is giving you feelings of d√©j√† vu, don't worry. It already had FCP proposed, but due to a resolved concern being incorrectly processed by mscbot on github, a new FCP proposal was carried out.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> (Polls - mk II) receive a fair amount of attention this week. It implements inline polls via a new <code>m.poll</code> type and makes use of the concept of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">extensible events</a>. Do check it out if you're interested in voting through means other than message reactions!</p>
<p>Otherwise Alexandre Franke and myself will be looking at cleaning up the CI of the matrix-org/matrix-doc repo next week, as well as continue to move the infrastructure for the new spec release forwards.</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1235">MSC1235: Proposal for Calendar Events</a>.</p>
<p>This one is entirely new to me, and has some slight overlap with some work for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2762">MSC2762: Allowing widgets to send/receive events</a>, where we were thinking about how a widget could act as a calendar using Matrix rooms and events as a calendar backend.</p>

<p>The Synapse team is busy gearing up for 1.43.0 next week, which will make room version 9 the default for newly created <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>We've also been doing quite a lot of work on Sydent. Notably, last week's 2.4.0 release introduced a few regressions which have been resolved in subsequent point releases. The one-shot <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/v2.4.3/docs/casefold_migration.md">case folding migration script</a> for Sydent is still performing unexpectedly slowly; look for that to be resolved soon.</p>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, now is a good time to ensure you're ready for the deprecation of PostgreSQL 9.6 (November) and Python 3.6 (December). Do you have plans to upgrade to Pg 10 and Py 3.7 or newer? If not, there's no time like the present! üóì</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest 2021</a> is less than two weeks away! Many Matrix projects intend to participate, including Synapse.</p>

<p>With rooms version 9 as the default, it feels like Spaces are trying hard to escape beta!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beeper is a unified chat app built on top of Matrix. We've created 10+ open source Matrix bridges and integrated them into an easy to use all-in-one service which does not require setting up your own homeserver. You can learn more at <a href="http://beeper.com/">beeper.com</a>.</p>
<p>We've been hard at work for the last few weeks and have a number of updates we'd like to share across all our clients and bridges.</p>
<p>For detailed release notes, check out our changelog here: <a href="https://www.notion.so/Beeper-Product-Changelog-cdbc7b68526d45f7b8ced8d4ba170c8d">https://beeper.notion.site/Beeper-Product-Changelog-cdbc7b68526d45f7b8ced8d4ba170c8d</a></p>
<h4 id="all-clients">All clients</h4>
<ul>
<li>New verification flow for Desktop, Android, and iOS! Logging in and verifying your session is now super easy to do. This is extra important for Beeper because we enable secure backup by default and require all users to set up a security key.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Added the ability to view your rooms using our Smart Inbox that places the most important messages at the top, or with Classic which leaves the room in a reverse chronological order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now select network by network which messages should appear in your inbox using our Inbox Filtering feature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We now have beta support for Custom CSS theming! Check out some of the themes that have already been made by the community. https://gitlab.com/beeper/beeper-themes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previously we only supported DMs for Discord out of the box, but now you can pick and choose which Discord servers to sync into Beeper</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Redesigned room list: we started a redesign of our Android app and adopted the Material design language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrated Android SMS bridge: Our previous Android Messages bridge was built on a shakey puppeteer foundation, so we rewrote it. Our new Android SMS uses native APIs to send/receive SMS. RCS remains elusively out of our grasp for now. We open sourced our bridge at https://gitlab.com/beeper/android-sms</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko got a lot more colorful this week. red_sky (nheko.im) and LorenDB finished up the jdenticon support. This means instead of the first character of a users display name, you now have the option to see a colorful avatar for users without an explicit avatar. You may have seen something similar on Github and other platforms. Currently this needs the <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/qt-jdenticon">qt-jdenticon</a> plugin, which is a bit troublesome to install correctly, but we should improve that in the near future.</p>
<p>Prezu added a homeserver entry field to the room directory, making it much more useful (no history yet though). Thulinma added a /goto command to navigate to specific events or room and fixed scrolling to a specific event (in the past it only approximately scrolled to the right location). Symphorien added the Alt+A shortcut to navigate between rooms with active mentions and notifications. Additionally Priit completed the Estonian translation.</p>
<p>Additionally we released a security fix on Monday (together with a few other clients). We only released a fix for the master branch in Nheko instead of also the latest stable release. This confused a few people, but I hope my explanations made sense. The gist of it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the master branch the local homeserver admin could force Nheko to forget which identity keys it saw for a user and as such insert a new device with the same device id, but attacker controlled identity keys and request old encryption keys from Nheko. In Nheko's case we had some protections against that, but if the server sent a device_list.left event for that user, Nheko would delete those protections. From our understanding this could not be abused over federation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 0.8.2 this can also be abused, but 0.8.2 does not implement key sharing completely. It can only forward the currently in use encryption key, not historical ones. As such the impact in our opinion was too limited to release a security fix. 0.8.2 does not allow you to send encrypted messages only to verified devices as such the homeserver admin could always insert just a different device to get access to new encrypted messages. Because of that we have a big warning in the README and when enabling encryption in 0.8.2, that one should not rely on the security of the E2EE implementation in it. We are aiming to have stable and secure E2EE in the next release (and so far it is looking good), but if you are using 0.8.2 I can only repeat, that it won't protect you from an attacker even without the disclosed security issue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this clears up some of the confusion. Feel free to visit us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> and tell me, that I am wrong.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca">uhoreg</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week saw two releases of libolm, a library that implements olm, megolm, and some other Matrix-related encryption functions.  The main changes in version 3.2.5 are new functions for getting error codes rather than error strings so that implementations don't need to rely on string parsing to decode errors, and added support for fallback keys in the Android and iOS bindings.  There were also improvements in error handling in the  unpickling functions, and the shared library no longer exports certain private symbols, which caused problems when those same symbols were exported by other libraries.  The initial implementation of this last change caused build failures in some environments, so version 3.2.6 was released to fix this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am super happy to finally give you another update on TheBoard, due to holidays during the last weeks I had less time to work on TheBoard. But now there still accumulated enough changes for a little Update:</p>
<p>I experimented what technologies I could use for the still required GUI elements. A new User List was implemented using Vue.js. Vue seemed to be a little overkill for the kind of GUI required in the case of TheBoard. So I re-implemented the user list with react-no-js.
I am happy with <strong>react-no-js</strong> and it is used for a <strong>user list plus a tool settings menu</strong> on the right hand side of the canvas.</p>
<p>The tool panel in particular opens up a lot of possibilities. The eraser already makes use of it by giving the option to only delete specific item types (Image, stroke or text). This can be very handy if you want to delete strokes drawn on top of an image without deleting the image as well. What can be deleted is highlighted by a new <strong>filter system</strong> which allows to make any modification to objects selected by a filter function (see the attached image)</p>
<p>Other small changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Animated camera movement (for a upcoming &quot;follow other user&quot; feature) currently used for the Go Home Button</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opening a board now loads at the last edited location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The touchscreen navigation (zoom/pan) was re-implemented and should now work much better</p>

<p>The Board is very exciting! I could see in <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard#planned-use-cases">the planned use cases</a> that Timo already intends to make a widget out of it. It would be very useful for real-time collaboration, but that's not all! When asked if a standalone app will come, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo</a> confirmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed. I wasn't thinking about a builtin home-server yet. But a standalone app is still planned because I want the app to be able to manage different boards. Therefore I need to be able to control room creation and listing rooms. It should basically feel like onenote if you intend to use it like that.</p>

It generates an infinite procedural terrain to venture in. The integrated chatbox is nothing special but it's really nice to have it bridged to Matrix now, it's less lonely when playing alone. The appservice bridge creates users matching player name and color. Display names from Matrix are presented in the same color as in Element.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Today we are disclosing a critical security issue affecting multiple Matrix clients and libraries including <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> (Web/Desktop/Android), <a href="https://fluffychat.im/">FluffyChat</a>, <a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io/">Nheko</a>, <a href="https://cinny.in/">Cinny</a>, and <a href="https://schildi.chat/">SchildiChat</a>. Element on iOS is not affected.</p>
<p>Specifically, in certain circumstances it may be possible to trick vulnerable clients into disclosing encryption keys for messages previously sent by that client to user accounts later compromised by an attacker.</p>
<p>Exploiting this vulnerability to read encrypted messages requires gaining control over the recipient‚Äôs account. This requires either compromising their credentials directly or compromising their homeserver.</p>
<p>Thus, the greatest risk is to users who are in encrypted rooms containing malicious servers. Admins of malicious servers could attempt to impersonate their users' devices in order to spy on messages sent by vulnerable clients in that room.</p>
<p>This is not a vulnerability in the Matrix or Olm/Megolm protocols, nor the libolm implementation. It is an implementation bug in certain Matrix clients and SDKs which support end-to-end encryption (‚ÄúE2EE‚Äù).</p>
<p><strong>We have no evidence of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild</strong>.</p>
<p>This issue was discovered during an internal audit by Denis Kasak, a security researcher at Element.</p>
<h2 id="remediation-and-detection">Remediation and Detection</h2>
<p>Patched versions of affected clients are available now; please upgrade as soon as possible ‚Äî we apologise sincerely for the inconvenience. If you are unable to upgrade, consider keeping vulnerable clients offline until you can. If vulnerable clients are offline, they cannot be tricked into disclosing keys. They may safely return online once updated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is difficult or impossible to retroactively identify instances of this attack with standard logging levels present on both clients and servers. However, as the attack requires account compromise, homeserver administrators may wish to review their authentication logs for any indications of inappropriate access.</p>
<p>Similarly, users should review the list of devices connected to their account with an eye toward missing, untrusted, or non-functioning devices. Because an attacker must impersonate an existing or historical device, exploiting this vulnerability would either break an existing login on the user‚Äôs account, or a historical device would be re-added and flagged as untrusted.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you have previously verified the users / devices in a room, you would witness the safety shield on the room turn red during the attack, indicating the presence of an untrusted and potentially malicious device.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Matrix supports the concept of ‚Äúkey sharing‚Äù, letting a Matrix client which lacks the keys to decrypt a message request those keys from that user's other devices or the original sender's device.</p>
<p>This was a feature added in 2016 in order to address edge cases where a newly logged-in device might not have the necessary keys to decrypt historical messages.  Specifically, if other devices in the room are unaware of the new device due to a network partition, they have no way to encrypt for it‚Äîmeaning that the only way the new device will be able to decrypt history is if the recipient's other devices share the necessary keys with it.</p>
<p>Other situations where key sharing is desirable include when the recipient hasn't backed up their keys (either online or offline) and needs them to decrypt history on a new login, or when facing implementation bugs which prevent clients from sending keys correctly. Requesting keys from a user's other devices sidesteps these issues.</p>
<p>Key sharing is described <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/end-to-end-encryption-implementation-guide#key-sharing">here</a> in the Matrix E2EE Implementation Guide, which contains the following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to securely implement key sharing, clients must not reply to every key request they receive. The recommended strategy is to share the keys automatically only to verified devices of the same user. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the approach taken in the original implementation in matrix-js-sdk, as used in Element Web and others, with the extension of also letting the sending device service keyshare requests from recipient devices.  Unfortunately, the implementation did not sufficiently verify the identity of the device requesting the keyshare, meaning that a compromised account can impersonate the device requesting the keys, creating this vulnerability.</p>
<p>This is not a protocol or specification bug, but an implementation bug which was then unfortunately replicated in other independent implementations.</p>
<p>While we believe we have identified and contacted all affected E2EE client implementations: if your client implements key sharing requests, we strongly recommend you check that you cryptographically verify the identity of the device which originated the key sharing request.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>The fact that this vulnerability was independently introduced so many times is a clear signal that the current wording in the Matrix Spec and the E2EE Implementation Guide is insufficient. We will thoroughly review the related documentation and revise it with clear guidelines on safely implementing key sharing.</p>
<p>Going further, we will also consider whether key sharing is still a necessary part of the Matrix protocol. If it is not, we will remove it. As discussed above, key sharing was originally introduced to make E2EE more reliable while we were ironing out its many edge cases and failure modes. Meanwhile, implementations have become much more robust, to the point that we may be able to go without key sharing completely. We will also consider changing how we present situations in which you cannot decrypt messages because the original sender was not aware of your presence. For example, undecryptable messages could be filed in a separate conversation thread, or those messages could require that keys are shared manually, effectively turning a bug into a feature.</p>
<p>We will also accelerate our work on matrix-rust-sdk as a portable reference implementation of the Matrix protocol, avoiding the implicit requirement that each independent library must necessarily reimplement this logic on its own. This will have the effect of reducing attack surface and simplifying audits for software which chooses to use matrix-rust-sdk.</p>
<p>Finally, we apologise to the wider Matrix community for the inconvenience and disruption of this issue.  While Element discovered this vulnerability during an internal audit of E2EE implementations, we will be funding an independent end-to-end audit of the reference Matrix E2EE implementations (not just Olm + libolm) in the near future to help mitigate the risk from any future vulnerabilities. The results of this audit will be made publicly available.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>Ultimately, Element took two weeks from initial discovery to completing an audit of all known, public E2EE implementations. It took a further week to coordinate disclosure, culminating in today's announcement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension">Dimension</a>, an integration manager alternative for Element, got a refresh from @TimeWalker to bring the project up to modern day standards. Please give it a go if you've been running Dimension, and report bugs if there's problems! While I haven't personally had time to maintain it as much as I'd like, it's great to see people taking on 3 year old bad code and fixing it üòÑ</p>
<p>For TWIM readers, Dimension is an &quot;integration manager&quot; that replaces the default one shipped with Element. It's not entirely mobile-ready yet, but does give a user interface for managing various bots, bridges, and widgets. In practice, an integration manager isn't needed as most bots and bridges (and even widgets) can be set up without an integrations manager, like all of https://t2bot.io/ (ironically, given Dimension was originally targeted at t2bot.io). People do still use it though to configure self-hosted platforms with their very own Element, Synapse, bridges, and bots. </p>
<p>While I still probably won't have much time personally to maintain it, PRs are certainly accepted. Dimension is a bit complex to work within and test, but people in #dimension:t2bot.io should be able to help out.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, we're massively pleased to announce the third major release of the TS/JS bridging library <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/3.0.0">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>. This release contains several large breaking changes to the previous way of life, most notably we have stopped using the matrix-js-sdk for most of our code, instead using the matrix-bot-sdk (Hi TravisR , we see you up there!).</p>
<p>There are several reasons why we went this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notably, this library focuses work on simply implementing APIs and bridge/bot logic. There is no additional cruft to support client use-cases or browsers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's historically had a brilliant coverage of the CS and AS APIs, and has been extremely flexible to add new stable and unstable APIs to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the start of this project, it was the only library with a complete Typescript coverage. Typescript types continue to be extremely useful to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're hoping to make use of the upcoming encrypted appservices support, to replace the slightly janky pantalaimon support the bridge library currently uses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to Travis and the matrix.org bridge team for working through these changes!</p>
<p>There are a bunch of common sense improvements that break API compatibility in this release also, so please be sure to check them out and update. We don't anticipate supporting 2.X except for extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll be updating the matrix-org suite of bridges over the coming weeks so please watch for bugs and let us know how we're doing!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You might remember my short story from last TWIM about the race between different translators? Seems like that one was good enough to motivate a few people to contribute translations. While those don't seem to be 100% complete yet, we saw a significant jump in translation percentages (especially Portuguese), so thank you to everyone who contributed to that!</p>
<p>Thulinma also made the whole userprofile scrollable, which improves the experience on small screens a lot. He also implemented message deduplication by event id, which is required by the spec to be done on the client side. This fixes a lot of duplicates when using conduit and your join event appearing 2~3 times on synapse.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue with how different homeservers update one time key counts and added some additional code to remove old one time keys, if we ever uploaded to many (which might have happened in the past in a few edge cases). We also now escape img tags in usernames correctly in more places, redundant date separators when paginating back in a room should not appear anymore and tastytea decreased the margins on blockquotes, so that they look less jarring and take up less space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>v0.6.0-beta.2 has been published of <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> as an early version to support encryption on bots and improvements to appservices. It's a bit self-directed to figure out how it works, but <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-bot-sdk:t2bot.io">#matrix-bot-sdk:t2bot.io</a> is available to try and help out.</p>
<p>Please give it a go and report bugs. The final v0.6.0 release is expected to contain not only encryption support for bots, but also appservices and real documentation. For now though, it's just the bots.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/patience">Patience</a>, a full stack integration testing approach for Matrix clients and servers, has added initial support for Hydrogen this week. As it already supported Element Web, we now have a (basic) system for testing multiple clients together which is taking shape! ü•≥ From here, we plan to add configuration options to express the permutations of clients you want to test together.</p>
<p>This project is still in its early stages, but we hope to eventually have support for many different clients and then use it to test common flows like user verification, which can differ quite a lot across clients. If you're interested in this topic, feel free to join the new <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-patience:matrix.org">#matrix-patience:matrix.org</a> room.</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.42.0 is out now!</p>
<p>This release includes changes that you may need to be aware of before upgrading, such as the removal of two deprecated Admin APIs or a retroactive fix to ensure that email notifications are only sent to addresses which are presently associated with an account. Please see the  <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.42/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1420">Upgrade Notes</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="room-version-9-a-bugfix-for-restricted-rooms">Room Version 9: A Bugfix for Restricted Rooms</h2>
<p>Synapse 1.42 includes support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">Room Version 9</a>, which fixes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3373">an oversight</a> in the list of event fields which were protected from redaction in Room Version 8's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>. This makes it possible, in certain circumstances, for a restricted room to degrade into a state where participating servers will disagree about the room's membership.</p>
<p>Because changing a room version's redaction algorithm also changes the way that event IDs are calculated, properly fixing this issue required the creation of a new room version.</p>
<p>To ensure compatibility with existing servers, Synapse 1.42's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: Room version capabilities</a> hints will continue to ask clients to prefer Room Version 8 when creating restricted rooms and Room Version 6 otherwise. A future release of Synapse will ask clients to prefer Room Version 9 for restricted rooms.</p>
<h2 id="handling-unknown-rooms">Handling Unknown Rooms</h2>
<p>Very rarely, users find themselves in rooms created with unstable or experimental room versions. Then, when Synapse removes support for these versions, bad things happen. The server no longer understands how to interact with that room version, which means <em>you</em> can't interact with that room. And if you can't interact with that room, you can't <em>leave</em>.</p>
<p>In Synapse 1.42, rooms with unknown room versions are no longer returned down <code>/sync</code>. This prevents them from appearing in your client, though you may need to empty your client's cache and re-sync to see any effect.</p>
<h2 id="new-mscs">New MSCs</h2>
<p>In addition to Room Version 9 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">MSC3375</a>), this release includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An initial implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">MSC3231: Token authenticated registration</a>, which makes it possible for homeservers to disable user registration while still allowing new accounts to be made by people who know a pre-shared secret.</p>
<p>This MSC and its implementations were produced as part of a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project by Callum Brown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An updated implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946: Spaces Summary</a> following recent changes to the proposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3283">MSC3283: Expose capabilities for profile actions</a>, which hints to clients whether or not a server allows users to change their display name, avatar, or email address.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>In addition to the usual array of improvements to performance, type hints, error messages, and documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom Presence Router modules can now be built using Synapse's <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.42/modules.html#presence-router-callbacks">new, unified module interface</a> which debuted in Synapse 1.37.</li>
<li>Code around federation event handling and authentication has been significantly refactored to improve reliability and maintainability, including extracting nearly 1,800 lines of code from the <code>FederationHandler</code> class into a separate <code>FederationEventHandler</code> class.</li>
<li>Backfilling history and fetching missing events now use the same code paths, reducing the potential for bugs.</li>
<li>Concurrently fetching the same large set of events (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10703">#10703</a>) is now much more efficient, preventing the process hangs which were possible in prior, extreme cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just the highlights; please see the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.42/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1420">Upgrade Notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.42.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>You may be wondering: what's up with all of these abandoned MSCs?? The answer is that the matrix-org/matrix-doc repo <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3367">changed its base branch</a> to <code>main</code> to help preserve the git history since the spec website rewrite. In doing so, all PRs were automatically updated to the new base branch by github... except those that were coming from deleted users and repos. Those ones were simply closed!</p>
<p>But as they seemed to be have been effectively abandoned by their authors, it was more of a cleanup than an accident. However, if your MSC was affected by this change and you would like to continue it, please contact someone in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-office:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-office:matrix.org</a> and we'll help you out.</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of this week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2448">MSC2448: Using BlurHash as a Placeholder for Matrix Media</a>!</p>
<p>MSC2448 defines a way for clients to include a &quot;blurhash&quot;, or a short, textual representation of a blurred version of an image, inside events which other clients can show while waiting for thumbnails to download from media servers. This replaces the potentially blank space while an image's thumbnail is loading with a (IMO) beautiful alternative!</p>
<p>Yes I wrote this MSC... but I swear it's what <a href="https://github.com/anoadragon453/pick-a-spec">the script</a> picked! We do not question the script!!</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/08/31/synapse-1-41-1-released">Synapse 1.41.1 is out</a> and it contains patches for <strong>two security vulnerabilities</strong> which could inappropriately disclose private room metadata to unauthorized users on a participating homeserver. Please upgrade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">Room Version 9</a> is coming in Synapse 1.42 next week. This version fixes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3373">an oversight</a> in which event fields are protected from redaction in room version 8, making it possible for restricted rooms to break if a join event is redacted. Because event IDs are based on the redaction algorithm, we can't fix this without creating a new room version.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility across the federation, Synapse 1.42 will still instruct clients to create restricted rooms using room version 8. Synapse 1.43, scheduled for release on 21 September, will begin instructing clients to use room version 9 instead.</p>

All 3 of them were trying really hard, so in my opinion every placement is a first place, buuuuuut Thulinma actually came first by bringing the Dutch translation from 5% to 100%. A few hours later Priit came in as a close second updating the Estonian translation to 100%. ISSOtm noticed that and tried to catch up which resulted in a 3rd place finish for the French translation. Now I understand the excitement people feel watching others compete in sports without having to do anything themselves!</p>
<p>red_sky (nheko.im) meanwhile fought a much more difficult enemy, Apple documentation and code signing! To be honest, I expected him to be beaten, but Nheko's DMGs are now actually properly signed and notarized. So if you are on macOS, you should now see less ugly warnings when installing Nheko. All nightlies building of the master branch are signed as well as our future releases.</p>
<p>In more community contributions, resolritter fixed the right click menu not working on replies. So you can copy a link from a reply now by right-clicking it without having to scroll up. Thulinma fixed window alerts not working when using conduit, because Conduit does not implement the /notifications endpoint Nheko uses and he helped me debug and fix device lists not showing up when using Conduit as well as sessions always getting rotated in &quot;Send encrypted messages to verified devices only&quot; mode.</p>
<p>In our work to stabilize E2EE we also now require a proper secrets daemon running on Linux (and other platforms, but there it is always provided by the OS). This is used to store the pickle key as well as the cross-signing secrets, so that an attacker can't read the from the config file. We already used such a daemon before, but we failed silently and we didn't use it for the pickle key until now. So if this prevents you from running Nheko, please open an issue so that we can work on a solution. Those APIs can be really fickle so additional testing and feedback would help us out a lot!</p>
<p>Also exciting is that Nheko now supports playing encrypted audio and video files without storing a temporary unencrypted copy on disk as well as animated images like WebP and GIF! It took us a while to figure out a proper solution, but now you can send animated stickers and you will finally be able to understand why other people were lauging at still images. (We also had to fix some bugs in our sticker editor, where we didn't add the mimetype to the sticker info for that.)</p>
<p>Some more embarrassing news, I didn't know I was a moderator in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:fachschaften.org">#conduit:fachschaften.org</a>, so I happily pinged everyone in the room while discussing room mentions. To prevent that from happening in the future, Nheko now shows a red warning above the message input if you will be pinging the whole room to give you time to reconsider. If that is not enough to stop me from doing that, we might require confirmation before sending such messages in the future, but so far this seems to work. Pinging everyone by accident can really scare you and composing a message in Matrix shouldn't be scary!</p>
<p>I hope I didn't forget anything and please make sure you check out Conduit, since they are doing a great job in revealing bugs in Nheko!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/circles-ios">Circles</a> is a project to build a secure, end-to-end encrypted social network, using Matrix as the foundation.</p>
<h4 id="news">News</h4>
<p>We're getting very close to a real App Store launch.  The latest beta release this week is <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/cWuDwqpG">0.98</a>  This version might be The One!  So please, if you haven't tried Circles in a while, give this one a shot.  Also please share the link with any friends and family who you think might be interested.  The current signup token has plenty of slots for everyone.</p>
<p>If you want to see some activity in your circles, invite me to follow your Community circle and I'll invite you to follow back.  I'm @cvwright:kombucha.social.</p>
<h4 id="warning">WARNING</h4>
<p>If you've been using Circles with your own (non-Kombucha) server, you probably DO NOT WANT this version.  Support for bring-your-own-server will return very soon after our App Store launch.</p>
<h4 id="latest-updates">Latest updates</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Broke and then re-enabled new account signup.  Thanks to everyone who helped diagnose this one, and sorry if you were unable to sign up using a recent build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a weeks-old bug where posting a message into a circle would then send you back to your list of all your social circles.  Big thanks to Yosef for bringing this to my attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug in recent 0.9x builds where the Matrix rooms underlying circles and groups were being created with invalid encryption parameters.  If you've been unable to post anything, this is the likely culprit.  The fix is to update to the latest build, then delete your old circles/groups and create new ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have a new icon.  It's blue!  I was worried that Apple might think the old icon looked too much like the Apple Photos icon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New and improved interface for managing your account information.  Added support for changing your password and for deactivating your account.  I hope you never want this last one, but Apple requires it for apps that allow you to create accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed support for Markdown formatting in posts and image captions.  This is a sad one, but unfortunately the performance of the open source library that we were using for Markdown just wasn't up to the task.  On the bright side, our timelines load much more quickly now, and the scrolling should be much smoother.  Look for Markdown support to return with the release of iOS 15 later this year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another update to the Recent Activity list.  Now it should refresh itself automatically if/when it initially comes up empty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved layout and usability on iPad.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tobi_fh:matrix.org">tobi</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CoMatrix project enables the usage of the Matrix protocol (more precisely Matrix Client-Server API) for constrained IoT devices via CoAP and CBOR in a constrained network (e.g. a 802.15.4/6LoWPAN network).</p>
<p>CoMatrix provides a gateway, which ports Matrix to CoAP/CBOR/(DTLS). This gateway communicates with constrained IoT devices on one side via CoAP+CBOR and translates to the Matrix protocol on the other side (i.e. HTTP+JSON). CoMatrix also provides a client library (for RIOT-OS) which is a starting point to implement CoMatrix clients (for constrained devices) which are able to interact with Matrix homeservers via the gateway.</p>
<p>Currently CoMatrix supports the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sending of messages to a Matrix room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receiving the last message of a Matrix room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User registration at a Matrix Synapse HS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joining a Matrix room upon invitation</p>
</li>
<li>

<blockquote>
<p>I have made a small 120k pipeline-agent software (including all dependencies except NodeJS v8)  which can run on multiple platforms (including OpenWRT) and takes pipeline work over the Matrix protocol. In the end it's going to be used to setup things like VPN connections between gateways. </p>
<p>We also have a commercial web portal almost published where one can create web apps and configure pipelines to process the results. And yes, the portal also uses Matrix as its persistent storage -- it was implemented using my Matrix CRUD Repository from last week :)</p>
<p>The agent software (pipeline-runner) is open source  and has zero (0) runtime dependencies except NodeJS, and available from here: https://github.com/sendanor/pipeline-runner -- It's still in early development, though.</p>

            <p>Today we are releasing Synapse 1.41.1, a security update based on last week's release of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/08/24/synapse-1-41-0-released">Synapse 1.41.0</a>. This release patches two moderate severity issues which could reveal metadata about private rooms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-3x4c-pq33-4w3q">GHSA-3x4c-pq33-4w3q</a> / CVE-2021-39164: Enumerating a private room's list of members and their display names.</strong></p>
<p>If an unauthorized user both knows the Room ID of a private room <em>and</em> that room's history visibility is set to <code>shared</code>, then they may be able to enumerate the room's members, including their display names.</p>
<p>The unauthorized user must be on the same homeserver as a user who is a member of the target room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-jj53-8fmw-f2w2">GHSA-jj53-8fmw-f2w2</a> / CVE-2021-39163: Disclosing a private room's name, avatar, topic, and number of members.</strong></p>
<p>If an unauthorized user knows the Room ID of a private room, then its name, avatar, topic, and number of members may be disclosed through Group / Community features.</p>
<p>The unauthorized user must be on the same homeserver as a user who is a member of the target room, and their homeserver must allow non-administrators to create groups (<code>enable_group_creation</code> in the Synapse configuration; off by default).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in both cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>The private room's Room ID must be known to the attacker.</li>
<li>Another user on the attacker's homeserver must be a legitimate member of the target room.</li>
<li>The information disclosed is <em>already</em> present in the database and thus legitimately known to the administrators of homeservers participating in the target room.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'd like to credit <a href="https://twitter.com/0xkasper">0xkasper</a> for discovering and responsibly disclosing these issues.</p>
<p>This release also fixes a small regression in 1.41.0 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10709">#10709</a>) which broke compatibility with older Twisted versions when Synapse was a configured to send email.</p>
<p>Please update at your earliest convenience.</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2582">MSC2582</a> (Removing mimetype from EncryptedFile object) was one of those MSCs that were relatively small, but had been languishing for <em>ages</em>. Partly because it required client implementations to update, but also partly because one needed to go in after a while and actually confirm that all known clients had updated. @uhoreg took up the mantle on his own to do so, and as a result this MSC has hit FCP and is soon to be merged. Thank you!</p>
<h4 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h4>
<p>The random MSC of the week is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3262">MSC3262: aPAKE authentication</a>!</p>
<p>Alongside <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2957">MSC2957</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3265">MSC3265</a>, this MSC is requesting a better way of communicating one's password to the homeserver without sending it in plaintext (over TLS, hopefully).</p>
<p>Remember that this is only done in exchange for an access token, which is then used for all subsequent requests. Still though, I can see the merit!</p>

<p>Synapse 1.41.0 is out! Check the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/08/24/synapse-1-41-0-released">release announcement</a> to find out about all of the details, including progress on MSCs, great new Admin APIs, and the ability to handle the <code>/createRoom</code> endpoint on workers. As mentioned in last week's TWiM, Synapse 1.41 uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: Room version capabilities</a> to tell clients that they can and should use Room Version 8 when creating <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>. The future is here!</p>
<p>We've also stopped publishing Debian packages for Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy).</p>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è We expect to publish a <strong>security release</strong> Synapse 1.41.1 on Tuesday, 31 August which fixes two moderate severity issues.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Synapse team would like to extend a warm welcome to Sean Quah, who joined Element's backend team this week. Welcome, Sean!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el">Ement.el</a>, a Matrix client for Emacs, gained some more improvements this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multi-account support was merged, so you can now use multiple accounts at the same time.  You can even be in the same room in two different accounts, at the same time, in side-by-side windows (which is useful for testing).  (Note that existing users will need to log in again, because the format of the saved-session file changed.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rooms you have been invited to now show up in the rooms list, and you can join them by clicking a button in the room's buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypted rooms now display a warning in the header and suggest that users consider using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon/">Pantalaimon</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Membership events are now formatted more usefully, similar to Element's style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completion for room and user names and IDs is implemented using standard Emacs commands and bindings (i.e. <code>C-M-i</code> by default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last-read marker may be jumped to, even if it's at an earlier event that has not yet been retrieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emotes (i.e. <code>/me</code>-style messages) can be sent by pressing <code>e</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timestamps in the room list are shaded according to how &quot;hot&quot; (i.e. recently updated) the room is (see screenshot).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various small fixes and enhancements.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now supports uploading to online key backup and warns you before enabling it, that we don't recommend using the asymmetric version. If you update to one of the current builds (and or the next version), you will also experience a bit longer load times on first startup. That is because we force-cleared the cache to be able to handle the new goodies like spaces and sticker/emote-packs. In the best case, everything is seamless.</p>
<p>We also had contributions by various people:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>resolritter cleaned up that while tab moved you down most popup lists, it didn't move up when shift was pressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harmathy extended the FAQ to answer commonly asked questions like &quot;Does Nheko support E2EE&quot; or &quot;What commands are supported&quot;. Don't worry, we know most of you won't read that and will still answer that question when you undoubtedly come asking it again. We just can now be even more passive aggressive than just pointing at the right wiki page. Instead we will point at the FAQ now, which will point at the wiki!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thombles made the emoji completer behave more nicely. Instead of jumping to the bottom left corner before closing, it will now just close. It should also now behave correctly when selecting text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alfasi updated the install instructions for Gentoo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure we have ever seen that many new faces contributing to Nheko in a week, I'm pretty happy to see that!</p>

<h3 id="ruma">Ruma</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ruma.io/">Ruma</a> is a set of Rust library crates around Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org">jplatte</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been so long since our last update that I couldn't possibly list all of the individual changes, but here's a rough overview of the work since then (three months ago):</p>
<p>There's been loads of bug fixes, many compatibility improvements and at least one large refactoring. We've been much faster about releasing changes to crates.io after ruma 0.1.0, now we're already at ruma 0.4.0 (!);  the changes needed to upgrade are really not that significant though. Notable areas of improvement are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UIAA: No more stringly-typed auth type + map of properties. The <code>AuthData</code> enum that holds the authentication information clients send to servers now has one variant for every auth type defined in the spec.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event relations: These used to be serialized wrongly for encrypted events and were only (de)serializable as part of a larger event (making using them in custom ways impossible). Both of these issues were fixed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the GSoC coding period is over and our students have both written a blog post summarizing their work: <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/gsoc-coverage/">API Coverage project (Adam Blanchet)</a>, <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/gsoc-tools/">Tooling project (Devin Ragotzy)</a></p>
<p>If you want more detailed updates about Ruma, please watch <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">our repository</a>'s GitHub releases, since nobody in the project currently wants to write regular blog posts or TWIM updates (if you are interested in changing that, get in touch over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a>).</p>
