<blockquote>
<p>The first iteration of visually representing the data gathered by Server Stats Discoverer (traveler bot)  is now publicly available at https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/</p>
<p>It for now is only a graph of room relations but in the future is supposed to be extended for a server based graph as well as a Table to search your room within.</p>
<p>Be aware that the page is best viewed and used on desktop. Clicking a Room Node will open a new tab with the matrix.to link. If this fails this might be because of no canonical alias being available.</p>
<p>For the developers the data can be taken from https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/relations  The format currently is only available in the d3js format but in the future that API also will be extended for different usecases.</p>
<p>For any feedback like accessibility issues or other issues please reach out to me either via DM or in #server_stats:nordgedanken.dev </p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>A reminder that <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> is available to communicate directly with the Spec Core Team. A clarification from the last edition of TWIM is that this room is intended to be a low-traffic room solely for asking about the status of a/your MSC, rather than the Spec process or anything else. There is however <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org</a> for discussion of the Spec process, and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> for discussion of the Matrix spec and MSCs in general.</p>
<p>Otherwise the Spec Core Team has been doing a little bit of house-keeping. For those that have been living under a rock, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">Spaces</a> is an upcoming feature intended to replace the old Groups/Community stuff with a much-improved implementation. And one that will actually make it into the spec! We've closed all old groups-related MSCs as they are now obsolete.</p>
<p>Additionally we've been giving some feedback on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946</a> (Spaces Summary) which is another part of the Spaces puzzle (and is still a blocker for the release of the feature), as well as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3079">MSC3079</a> (Low Bandwidth CS API) which allows Matrix to operate on resource constrained devices and networks. Yours truly has also been making some PRs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3180">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3179">two</a>) to help clarify the Spec process.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a release! <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/05/synapse-1-33-0-released">Synapse 1.33 is out</a>, and we plan to release a security patch for it on Tuesday, May 11th. This follows our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/discussions/9914">previous discussion</a> where we committed to trying to decouple routine security updates from our regular feature releases.</p>
<p>Read the release notes for details, but the big news is that we finally have experimental support for moving presence off of the main process. We're still testing it, but we hope it will allow instances that need presence to more easily scale out.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/04/30/this-week-in-matrix-2021-04-30#synapse">last week's TWiM</a> we shared a graph of Synapse's memory use when joining Matrix HQ for the first time. In particular, we saw a spike to 1.4 GB before settling at 800 MB.</p>
<p>In the week since producing that graph, we've managed to nearly eliminate the spike, halving it to 760 MB. After backfilling history, the room settles at around 650 MB:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These changes are still a work in progress, but we hope to get them merged into Synapse in time for the 1.35 release on June 1st.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> has a request:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a patch for synapse, that reduces the size of almost empty incremental syncs by 50% (30% if you include http headers). If you are a client developer, you may want to test your client against a synapse with that patch applied, since it broke quite a few clients, that relied on synapse sending empty fields. While synapse sends empty fields, other server implementations, like conduit, don't, so fixing any issues here will help with portability across different server implementations too. With a bit of hope this patch can actually be applied in a few weeks to the official synapse, but it was backed out from the next RC because of the breakage. So if you can, please test your client, which you are developing, against the following PR and fix any issues you experience from it: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9919</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>The initial alpha version of <a href="https://gitlab.com/beeper/brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> is now public, which means you can now (try to) use <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-imessage">mautrix-imessage</a> on a jailbroken iOS device for iMessage bridging. Setup instructions are on docs.mau.fi: https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/imessage/ios/setup.html</p>
<p>Brooklyn was developed by ethanrdoesmc. It's an app/tweak that handles communicating with iMessage and runs mautrix-imessage as a subprocess for the Matrix side. The initial alpha supports basic text and media message bridging. Sending and receiving tapbacks, replies, read receipts and typing notifications will also be supported in the future.</p>

<li>
<p>Identd implementation to get verified usernames on IRC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLS support for IRC connections</p>
</li>

<p>IRC excess flood prevention with a buffer</p>

<p>Minor fixes to ghosting issues and some other stuff. This will be the last big update for a while as it has mostly stabilized enough for daily use.</p>
<p>More testers are still welcome to get the remaining issues ironed out so if you need to connect to unbridged and unplumbed networks and run your own homeserver it would be an excellent time to try it out.</p>

<h3 id="fluffychat">FluffyChat</h3>
<p><a href="https://fluffychat.im">FluffyChat</a> is the cutest cross-platform matrix client. It is available for Android, iOS, Web and Desktop.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">krille</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FluffyChat 0.30.0 has been released</p>
<p>In this release we have mostly focused on bugfixing and stability. We have switched to the new Flutter 2 framework and have done a lot of refactoring under the hood. The annoying freezing bug should now be fixed. Voice messages now have a new backend which should improve the sound quality and stability. There is now a more professional UI for editing aliases of a room. Users can now see a list of all aliases, add new aliases, delete them and mark one alias as the canonical (or main) alias. Some minor design changes and design fixes should improve the overall UX of the app exspecially on tablets.</p>
<p>Version 0.30.0 will be the first version with arm64 support. You can download binaries from the CI and we will try to publish it on Flathub. Together with the new Linux Desktop Notifications feature, this might be interesting for the Librem 5 or the PinePhone. Sadly I don't own one of these very interesting devices. If you have one, I would very like to see some screenshots of it! :-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shiny:shine.horse">Shine</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fluffychat update: Native Fluffychat Linux build now works well on aarch64 devices!</p>
<p>If you want to try the binary from CI, keep in mind that GDK_GL=gles needs to be set to force it to use the OpenGL ES. Flatpak build on Flathub already has it set up and works out of the box.</p>
<p>Some distributions can have issues with input fields and virtual keyboard, making it look like the input is set up as right-to-left. To my understanding, it's an issue of certain older GTK versions with Flutter.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now should stop showing you actions, that you can't do anyway, because that is confusing and useless. This includes the following and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Invite members, if you have no invite permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete messages, if you don't have redaction permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send a message, reply to one, edit one and more, if you can't even send the message!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell us, if we missed something or we removed an action, that you actually have permissions to do!</p>
<p>Apart from that we also started working on some of the features for the next major release. That release will mostly focus on bringing End-to-End-Encryption out of beta. As a first step, Nheko now shows if a message was sent from a verified device or not. This has 3 different trust levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>green</strong>: The message is from a device you verified. Either by device verification or cross signing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>greyish</strong>: The message is from an unverified device, but that user has never rotated their master signing key and has cross-signed that device. As such we can probably assume, that this is a trusted device. For extra safety, you should of course verify that user, but if it is just an internet personality you will never meet, you trust you are speaking to the right party anyway and can't really verify them anyway, since you don't know how they look either! We don't want to prompt users with red warning signs in such cases, which will lead to them not doing verification properly, because they just want the red marks to go away. Many people are also not interested in the MITM aspects of E2EE. We think this is an okay tradeoff, but any feedback is welcome of course! This is basically Trust On First Use (TOFU), if you heard that term before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The device is not verified. This can have a few reasons. Either we verified the user, but they didn't verify that device. Or we didn't verify that user and they have changed their master key at some point. Or the signatures for that device are wrong, etc. If you see such a device, you should probably investigate, why that is the case.</p>

<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/04/23/this-week-in-matrix-2021-04-23#fractal">our previous announcement</a> and building on the fresh foundations of our rewrite, Julian got busy on room history. It now appears when a room is selected in the sidebar! To make that selection easier, room filtering in the sidebar <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/726">has been implemented by new contributor Veli Tasali</a>. Once a room is selected and displayed, messages can even be sent to them! Sounds like we‚Äôre done and the client is ready‚Ä¶ SHIP IT! Not really though, as it‚Äôs still very basic, but at least <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/issues/720">the bare minimum to make it actually usable is now here</a>.</p>

            <p>Since the end of 2019, we have spent quite a bit of time thinking about and exploring different technologies whilst building various demos for P2P Matrix.  Our mission for P2P Matrix is to evolve Matrix into a hybrid between today's server-oriented network and a pure P2P network - empowering users to have <strong>total</strong> autonomy and privacy over their data if they want (by storing it in P2P Matrix, by embedding their server into their Matrix client), while also letting users store their data in serverside nodes if they so desire.</p>
<p>The goal is to protect metadata much better (as users no longer have to depend on a server run by someone else to communicate), as well as drive new features such as account portability, multi-homed accounts, low-bandwidth Matrix and smarter federation transports - and provide support for internet-less mesh communication via Matrix which can also interoperate with the wider network.  You can read more about it in our <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix/">Introducing P2P Matrix</a> blog post from last summer, or watch our <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/matrix_pinecones/">FOSDEM 2021 talk</a> where we previewed Pinecone.  It's important to note that this has been a small but important long-term project for Matrix, and has been progressing entirely outside our business-as-usual work of improving the core protocol and reference implementations.</p>
<p>As the project has progressed, we've built a variety of prototypes using existing libraries (<a href="https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p">go-libp2p</a>, <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p">js-libp2p</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go">Yggdrasil</a>), demonstrating what an early P2P Matrix might feel like if it were running on a mobile device, in the web browser and so on using such an overlay network. Each of these demos has taught us something new, and so in October 2020 we decided to take this knowledge to build an experimental new overlay network of our own.</p>
<p>Pinecone is designed to provide end-to-end encrypted communications between devices, regardless of how they are connected to one another, in a lightweight and self-arranging fashion. The routing protocol is a hybrid, taking inspiration from <a href="https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go">Yggdrasil</a> by building a global spanning tree, but rather than forwarding all traffic using the spanning tree topology, we use it as a bootstrap routing mechanism for a line/snake topology, ordered by their ed25519 public keys, which we have affectionately named SNEK (Sequentially Networked Edwards Key) routing.</p>
<p>Nodes seek out their closest keyspace neighbours on the network and paths are built between these pairs of nodes, similar to how a Chord DHT functions, populating the routing tables of intermediate nodes in the process. These paths are then used to forward traffic without having to perform up-front searches, allowing for very fast connection setups between overlay nodes. These paths are resilient to network topology changes and handle node mobility considerably better than any other name-independent routing scheme that we have seen ‚Äî early results are very promising so far. We have also been experimenting with a combination of the ŒºTP (Micro Transport Protocol) and TLS to provide stateful connection setup, congestion control and end-to-end encryption for all federation traffic carried over the Pinecone network.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-05-06-pineconesim.png" alt="Pinecone simulator showing line/snake logical network topology" /></p>
<p>If Pinecone works out, our intention is to collaborate with the libp2p and IPFS team to incorporate Pinecone routing into libp2p (if they'll have us!) while incorporating their gossipsub routing to improve Matrix federation... and get the best of both worlds :)</p>
<p>Today we're releasing the source code for our current early implementation of Pinecone ‚Äî you can <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone">get it from GitHub</a> right now! It's very experimental still and not very well optimised yet, but it is the foundation of our latest mobile P2P Matrix demos, which support P2P Matrix over both <strong>Bluetooth Low Energy</strong> mesh networks, <strong>multicast DNS</strong> discovery within a LAN, and/or by routing through <strong>static Pinecone peers</strong> on the Internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android: https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/394600067ea8ba37</li>
<li>iOS: https://testflight.apple.com/join/Tgh2MEk6</li>
</ul>
<p>Building a routing overlay is only the first step in the journey towards P2P Matrix. We will also be looking closely in the coming months at improving the Matrix federation protocol to work well in mixed-connectivity scenarios (rather than the full mesh approach used today) as well as decentralised identities, hybrid deployments with existing homeservers and getting Dendrite (the Matrix homeserver which is embedded into the current P2P demos) more stable and feature-complete.</p>
<p>The long-term plan could look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-05-06-pinecone.png" alt="Diagram showing possible P2P Matrix stack" /></p>

            <p>Synapse 1.33.0 is out! Three main items of note:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We plan to release <del>1.33.1</del> <ins>1.33.2</ins> with a <strong>low severity security fix</strong> on Tuesday next week, and we're interested in your thoughts on decoupling routine security fixes from normal releases. Please weigh in on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/discussions/9914">this discussion</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> We shipped 1.33.1 with a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9936">small dependency fix</a> when installing Synapse via <code>pip</code>. A security release is still planned for Tuesday, which will now be 1.33.2.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use Synapse's optional account revalidation feature (see <code>account_validity</code> in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.33.0/docs/sample_config.yaml#L1373-L1455">config.yaml</a>), you'll want to review the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.33.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1330">upgrading instructions</a> as we've made a few small changes to the email templates it uses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synapse now has <em>very</em> experimental support for moving presence off of the main process. This has not yet been extensively validated, so please proceed with caution. We expect to get this to a point where we can confidently recommend it in the coming weeks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, this is another release focused on internals. We're driving toward a goal of reducing excess memory consumption when joining large or complex rooms, and most of our effort (aside from the presence work) has been focused on measurement, instrumentation, and experimentation for that.</p>
<p>We did manage to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9825">slightly speed up room joins</a>, improve the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9821">performance of the user directory</a>, and refine our implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083</a>. Additionally, thanks to work by ShadowJonathan, Synapse now passes all of <code>flake8-bugbear</code>'s <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear">lints</a>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.33.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1330">Upgrading Instructions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.33.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for further information.</p>
<h3 id="thank-you">Thank You</h3>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/rkfg">rkfg</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ShadowJonathan">ShadowJonathan</a>.</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>We've opened up a new room for MSC authors to come and ask about the MSC process, as well as for review and feedback on their MSC ideas over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a>. If you're unsure what the next steps for your MSC are, or aren't sure whether an idea would make sense for inclusion in the Matrix Specification, then this room is the perfect place to ask about it. Come on by!</p>
<p>In terms of MSC work, Spaces remains one of the most active topics in the spec this week, with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a> finally reaching Final Comment Period! A lot of work went into writing and reviewing the MSC, as well as crafting the implementation - so congratulations to everyone involved! Of course, any concerns can still be raised over the next 5 days by anyone before the proposal is ultimately merged to the spec.</p>
<p>There are a number of changes being merged to the spec as we move swiftly towards the next major Spec release. Those that have merged this week are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3154">MSC2403: Knocking and MSC2998: Room Version 7</a></p>

<p>We expect to release 1.33 on Tuesday; more on that next week.

<p>Announcing a new bouncer style Matrix IRC bridge to <em>bridge</em> the gap between IRC and Matrix in a way that's easy to configure and manage by homeserver administrators for small scale deployment.</p>
<p>Meet Heisenbridge https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge ü•≥ (it's a Breaking Bad reference ü§¶)</p>
<p>It's written in Python and started off as an experiment if it's possible to create a somewhat well performing stateless IRC bridge that's practically almost zero configuration. It quickly found a use case of being able to join !channels on IRCnet that hasn't been possible in the past.</p>
<p>Intended target audience are people who run their own homeserver and would like to transition from a combination like ssh+irssi to pure Matrix (with weechat-matrix, of course!) but still keep IRC close without losing the &quot;fine details&quot; of the protocol that happens when plumbing a room properly.</p>
<p>As the bridge is written by someone who doesn't really know Python help is much appreciated in the form of filing issues, sending pull requests or just discussing about it on Matrix to tell how you would like to use it!</p>

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line/">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inbound read receipts! But with a view caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Receipts are only fetched for the &quot;most recently active&quot; room.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example: if you send a message in room A, then room B, receipts will only be fetched for room B and not room A, until you (or someone else, from LINE) posts in room A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will be fixed in the next update. I have an idea for some Puppeteer trickery to get it working.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read receipts in group chats are bridged as annotations (reactions) instead of &quot;real&quot; read receipts, until all members of the chat have read a message.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because LINE's read receipts for group chats don't tell show <em>who</em> read a message, but only <em>how many</em> people a message was read by.</li>
<li>To capture this in Matrix, instead of sending read receipts for a group chat message, the bridge puts a reaction of &quot;Read by #&quot; on it, with &quot;#&quot; matching how many people read the message so far. Once everyone in the chat has read a message, the reaction is removed and a &quot;real&quot; receipt is sent for all users.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Internal changes to message syncing that should hopefully make inbound messages more reliable, or the very least improve code maintenance. </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey there, it is your friendly neighborhood cat client! Pardon, chat client!</p>
<p>Jedi18 implemented forwarding of messages. Just select a message and press Alt-F or use the context menu to send a message to the room you select in the popup! This encrypts and decrypts messages and media appropriately, but be aware that sending an encrypted file to an unencrypted room uploads the file unencrypted. (In all other cases the media is not uploaded again.)</p>
<p>Furthermore matrix.to links are now rewritten to matrix:-URIs internally. This means joining rooms and such should now work the same across both of them. It also makes navigation to events work now and even has a shiny highlight effect now! You can also create links to events now from the context menu. These are generated as matrix.to links, since currently the onboarding experience should still be better. Once the next version of the matrix.to website gets deployed, you can even just click there to open the event in Nheko! (Instead of having to copy a <code>/join</code> command).</p>
<p>Since &quot;Copy link to event&quot; was confusing to people and AppAraat opened his present box, only to realize it did not contain &quot;Copy link location&quot;, we implemented that too as well as a copy action, to copy the event body for good measure. I hope everyone who got confused will forgive me!</p>
<p>Apart from that we also updated our screenshots on <a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io/">https://nheko-reborn.github.io/</a> (and all AppStream based store pages) to be higher resolution and reflect the current design. Furthermore we fixed the login on conduit homeservers and that no rooms were shown, if the server didn't support the groups API.</p>
<p>That's all, and keep on c(h)atting! &lt;3</p>

<p>I announced this project last week. It's exactly what it sounds like: A puppetting bridge to puppet a telephone number from Matrix. It's currently pre-alpha and not ready for use on public-facing HSes.</p>
<p>Not too much has happened in the last week as I've been a bit busy. The main thing is that there's now a <a href="https://github.com/KB1RD/matrix-pstn-bridge/tree/voip-dev">dev branch where outbound voice calls work</a>. Other than the 2014 <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2014/11/30/bridging-matrix-sip-via-verto">SIP experiment</a>, I think this is the first bridge to make voice calls work?</p>
<p>I hope having a reference VoIP bridge can help pave the way for more VoIP bridging. I'm already looking into how code can be generalized for other bridges. For example, I've opened an <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk/issues/112">issue in matrix-bot-sdk to add helper classes and stuff for VoIP support</a>. I'd be curious to see how other bridge builders think this could be accomplished. üëÄ</p>

OK, setup it yourself and try to stay normal while trying to configure coturn to properly run in docker cluster.  Because of that, I did a service where you can order initial setup and configuration of homeserver (yes, with coturn in docker cluster!) <strong>and</strong> with full control of customization and fine-tuning of manual configuration (website even has step-by-step guide how the process works).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of you might already have seen that bot show up in rooms. To clear up some confusion around it I will briefly explain what it does and what it is supposed to do:</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-do">What does it do?</h4>
<p>The Bot is simply existing to do the same task as Matrix Traveler (bot) already did for years now. It joins rooms, listens for an alias, tries to join it.</p>
<p>The main difference between these 2 bots is that my bot also searches for aliases in old messages.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-save">What does it save?</h4>
<p>It only saves the relations between rooms. This means it knows which room was posted where. It doesn't know who posted it, when it was posted, why it was posted or any other content of messages.</p>
<p>However due to matrix' nature it does need to get the data once onto a synapse to read trough it. This means it has the data on my synapse. (Running in helsinki at hetzner).</p>
<h4 id="what-can-i-do-if-i-do-not-want-it">What can I do if I do not want it?</h4>
<p>The easiest way is to just ban it. It will fully forget that room.</p>
<p>Kicking works too but it might again join if it gets found again.</p>

<h3 id="matrix-uri-scheme">Matrix URI scheme</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jboi:jboi.nl">Jonathan</a> noticed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>matrix:</code> URI scheme has just been officially accepted (safelisted) into the HTML standard! üöÄ</p>
<blockquote>
<p>https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/6320</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="what-is-the-matrix-uri-scheme">What is the Matrix URI scheme?</h4>
<p>You are probably familiar with <code>mailto:user@example.com</code> or <code>tel:+1-555-438-3732</code>. The former is usually used to open an email address in your mail client, while the latter is used for phone numbers. This allows applications to register themselves as a handler for it, like for example GMail or Thunderbird, and your browser and other applications can find them and tell them to open an editor or similar, with that identifier as the target. There are also a lot of other applications that have similar schemes like Telegram, Zoom and more.</p>
<p>In Matrix you have similar identifiers, most notably users (@user:example.org) and rooms (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#room:example.org">#room:example.org</a>). The matrix URI scheme now allows you to open such identifiers in your favourite Matrix clients. You can now just click on matrix:u/user:example.org or matrix:r/room:example.org and start chatting with the user or join the room. (There is a bit more to it, you actually need an action after the identifier for it, otherwise it will just open the user profile or show the room, if you are joined to it, but that is the idea. For more details, check https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/proposals/2312-matrix-uri.md )</p>
<p>As you can see the format of the matrix: scheme is a bit different that standard Matrix identifiers. This is mostly because they need to start with <code>scheme:</code>, where <code>scheme</code> is different depending on the application, but some characters are also treated differently in URIs, which is why the matrix scheme decided to avoid them where possible.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-mean-that-the-matrix-scheme-is-now-part-of-the-html-standard">What does it mean, that the matrix: scheme is now part of the HTML standard?</h4>
<p>In general desktop and mobile clients could already implement the Matrix scheme before, FluffyChat, Quaternion, gomuks and Nheko have even done so already. This means if you are using those clients, you can already use the Matrix scheme today!</p>
<p>On the web things are a bit more difficult though. Since you don't want arbitrary websites to intercept arbitrary schemes, schemes need to be safelisted in the HTML spec/browsers. So today web clients can't be registered to open matrix: URIs. But the first step is done now. The HTML spec now officially lists <code>matrix:</code> as a safelisted scheme.</p>
<h4 id="next-steps">Next steps</h4>
<p>For web clients like Element to be able to open matrix: URIs, a few more things need to happen.</p>
<ol>
<li>Browsers need to implement the HTML standard change and allow web apps to register the Matrix scheme.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Status in Firefox: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1688030</li>
<li>Status in Chrome(ium): https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1169258</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Web clients need to actually implement handling <code>matrix:</code> URIs.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Tracking issue for Element: https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/16875</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be wondering about matrix.to, which was used to share matrix identifiers before. In the long term matrix URIs will probably replace it. Watch the next few TWIMs to find out what happens and/or subscribe to the following issues: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to/issues/191 https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to/issues/192</p>
<h4 id="closing-words">Closing words</h4>
<p>As you can see, this was a big step for Matrix as a whole. This of course couldn't have been possible without <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">Alexey</a> writing such an awesome proposal and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mayeul:mayeul.net">MayeulC</a> pushing for the changes in browsers and the HTML standards. A lot of other people were also involved in implementing the scheme in their clients, sending the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/matrix">RFC to IANA</a> or working on matrix.to, which was our solution until now and will probably bridge the gap into the future. The matrix scheme being in the HTML standard may look small, but a lot of stuff was blocked on it, that can now start making progress. Exciting, isn't it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it gets better...</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MayeulC spotted, that Mozilla now safelisted the <code>matrix:</code> scheme in Firefox: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1688030#c15</p>
<p>Expect this to land around Firefox 90 probably.</p>
<p>So we can check one more thing on our list. Apart from Chrome, we are now only waiting on webclients to implement it. This is moving faster than I expected!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this truly lands in a Firefox version in the near future I'll be very, very happy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello folks! Today at 17:41, we sunset the matrix.org gitter bridge after many years of active service. It started out as a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter/commit/c641e6eb4916c1addbff5ba50d0bf0a5f2084690">tiny little project, forked from another gitter&lt;-&gt;IRC bridge</a> before eventually becoming part of the matrix-appservice-bridge family of bridges (thanks Leo for putting in the hard work there!). It never quite gained all the nice features that the IRC and Slack bridges enjoyed, in part due to it's dependence on the use of one bot account (serving as a relay). However, it was still the entrypoint for Matrix users into the likes of NeoVIM and Typescript and continued to run for several years.</p>
<p>Years later, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix">gitter.im gained the ability to speak Matrix</a>,  so the old bridge can finally be laid to rest. Thanks to everyone that used and supported the bridge, and we hope you enjoy using the new one!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre Franke</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In keeping with our tradition of sending an update every two months, here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been up to since <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/05/this-week-in-matrix-2021-02-05#fractal">the last one</a>.</p>
<p>Amongst a bunch of maintenance changes (dependency updates and the likes), we had a few ones that stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/695">Some views have been migrated to HdyStatusPage</a>. This provides a more homogeneous look across GNOME applications and help them fit better on smaller screens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We noticed regressions around message replacement and removal (edit display and redactions) and we started fixing them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another regression made it impossible to join rooms by alias or id. This was fixed as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We updated information in a couple places and we now have clearer contributing guidelines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We rarely talk about new issues that are still open and tend to focus on fixed ones. We do have <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/milestones/19">a milestone</a> with the remaining known blockers for our next version, 4.5, which we hope to be able to release Really Soon Now‚Ñ¢.</p>
<p>But as interesting as all that is, it pales in comparison to our bigger announcement. We are rewriting Fractal! Julian, Alexandre and Thib have documented the thought process behind this decision and the work done so far. For more details, have a look at <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2021/04/23/getting-fractal-up-to-speed/">Julian‚Äôs blog</a>. The summary is that even though such rewrites are usually frowned upon (for good reasons), two major technological shifts (from a homegrown backend to matrix-rust-sdk and from GTK3 to GTK4) made it an option that we needed to consider‚Ä¶ and so we did! This should result in a cleaner codebase, easier to maintain in the long run, and improvements that we can share with the rest of the Matrix community.</p>
<p>The work for the rewrite currently happens in a <code>fractal-next</code> branch. So far, we have the basic boilerplate in place. The app launches, offers a basic login form, does initial sync and while the interface then looks very similar to stable Fractal, it will just load an unsorted list of rooms for now. Not very impressive on the visible side, but Julian has also been very busy contributing to matrix-rust-sdk.</p>
<p>Hopefully we‚Äôll be able to break the aforementioned tradition and report more progress soon. Watch this space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I released version 0.0.5 of my Sailfish client: https://openrepos.net/content/deepbluev7/konheko</p>
<p>It adds an about page and more importantly fixes a bug where closing the window would not relaunch the app via the task icon! Shout out to Rudi Timmermans, who made the about page and is now working on some further design improvements! Small release, since I was working on Nheko most of the time, but I hope I can add persistence and E2EE soon to it!</p>

<p>Cactus Comments is a federated comment system for the open web built on Matrix.</p>
<p>We put out a blog post called <a href="https://cactus.chat/blog/mscs-were-excited-for/">MSCs We're Excited For</a>.</p>
<p>It's about some of the spec change proposals that we're keeping an eye on for Cactus Comments.</p>
<p>We also released Web Client v0.8.0!</p>
<p>This release brings some improvements to the <code>&quot;&lt;time&gt; ago&quot;</code> text, as well as the ability to let the client fetch more messages &quot;live&quot; (i.e. without reloading the page).  You can set a number of seconds in <code>updateInterval</code> to enable this, it is disabled by default.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make comment time a semantic <code>time</code> element (Thanks to @hectorjsmith for !4).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add hover text to comment time (Thanks to @hectorjsmith for !4).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show &quot;just now&quot; instead of negative seconds if message timestamp is ahead of the client's time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add ability to fetch new messages periodically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New config option: <code>updateInterval</code>, which controls how often to fetch new messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change thumbnail size from 32x32 to 64x64.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stylesheet: allow linebreaks in comments.</p>

<p>This dashboard is a small experiment on what metadata you can get from matrix without any auth.</p>
<h4 id="how">How?</h4>
<p>It utilizes the synapse database to lookup alive and responding servers and on these currently just runs a query each 5m to check the version.</p>
<p>It allows a) to see the amount of servers and which servers my synapse at any point knows and b) to track the individual versions.</p>
<p>For my server at point of writing this results in 2348 Servers of which are 2269 running Synapse, 70 running Dendrite, 8 running Conduit and 1 running Construct.</p>
<h4 id="tech-used">Tech used</h4>
<p>Used under the hood is a small rust script doing all the heavy lifting of many thousand requests each five minutes (around 2-3 per server currently).</p>
<p>The data is cached mostly in RAM as well as being written to a influxdb oss 2.x which allows for the grafana integration.</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.32.2 is out! <strong>Synapse now requires Python 3.6</strong> (or later) and we've made a few small changes which you should be aware of before upgrading. These are documented in the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.32.2/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1320">upgrade notes</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We scrubbed the releases of Synapse 1.32.0 and 1.32.1 as we discovered a pair of regressions including <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9853">a bug</a> with Prometheus metrics after tagging the release. These have been resolved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Monday, humankind flew a helicopter on Mars. And while our pursuit of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">Space(s)</a> is considerably more modest, it is nevertheless progressing apace: Synapse 1.32 includes an experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083</a>.</p>
<p>This release also includes a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9491">new Synapse module</a> for routing of presence updates, which can allow devices to share presence information without requiring that they also share a room. Please note there are some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9823">nuances to worker configuration</a> when using this module which we hope to iron out in a future release.</p>
<p>The Admin API is newly able to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.32.2/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#override-ratelimiting-for-users">manage rate limits</a>, and the user listing endpoint can finally <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9691">sort its results</a> by a variety of criteria.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this is again a very internals-focused release: many additional type hints, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9654">improvements to structured logging</a>, and small cleanups, especially those possible now that we've left Python 3.5 behind. We've made changes to how we check whether accounts are <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9711">exempt from rate limits</a> to avoid cases where we mistakenly applied limits to Application Services which should have been exempt, and we've fixed a bug with sharded federation senders which could occasionally <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9770">pin the CPU</a>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.32.2/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1320">Upgrading Instructions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.32.2/CHANGES.md#synapse-1322-2021-04-22">Release Notes</a> for further information.</p>

<li><em>Open Web Docs: web documentation as critical infrastructure</em>
<ul>
<li><strong>Will Bamberg</strong> is a technical writer who works on MDN Web Docs, originally for Mozilla and now for 
Open Web Docs. He's especially interested in ways we can make documentation more engaging and accessible.
Open Web Docs is a collective of people and organizations that exists to support web documentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Hydrogen Deep Dive</em>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bruno from Element</strong> will do a deep dive into the architecture of Hydrogen, the upcoming next-generation
Matrix web-client. What are the guiding principles, what makes it fast, what is different about it, and how
could it also benefit Element Web?</li>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to Homeservers, the Matrix spec also describes Push Gateways and Identity Services, which augment our ability to send notifications or discover users via identifiers like email addresses.</p>
<p>On the Matrix.org Foundation side, we maintain production-grade reference implementations of these services:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Synapse, a Homeserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sygnal, a Push Gateway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sydent, an Identity Service</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We recently became aware of a few security and denial of service concerns in Sydent. Yesterday, we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.3.0">Sydent 2.3.0</a> with fixes for those issues. It's extremely uncommon to self-host Sydent, but we wanted to highlight our work there all the same.</p>
<p>We've also finally settled on quarterly objectives for the Synapse team at Element, and the first thing we're focusing on is gaining a better understanding of how Synapse uses memory. Specifically, we'd like to drive down the peak RAM associated with joining large, complex rooms like Matrix HQ. We've already landed a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9825">small speed up</a> to that effect, but expect more specific metrics in the future.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.32 is due out early next week, and we look forward to seeing you then.</p>

<h3 id="old-gitter-bridge-end-of-life-2021-04-21">Old Gitter bridge end of life (2021-04-21)</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org">Eric Eastwood</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Next week on Wednesday (2021-04-21), the old Gitter bridge (identified as <code>@gitterbot:matrix.org</code>) will be shut down and any plumbed rooms (bridged connections) remaining will no longer bridge. To replace this, we've already migrated all of the portal rooms and many of the plumbed rooms in preparation so most users will not need to take any further actions. The remaining rooms with the old Gitter bridge are unfortunately not possible to migrate and for those communities a clean break will be needed. The new native Gitter bridge is here to replace this!</p>
<p>You can read most of the same information and details if you still need to plumb for your existing room in the blog post, https://matrix.org/blog/2021/04/15/old-gitter-bridge-end-of-life-2021-04-21-to-be-replaced-with-native-bridge</p>

<h3 id="element-now-has-a-microsoft-teams-bridge">Element now has a Microsoft Teams bridge</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey hey folks, something I can finally talk about in the open is that Element now has a Teams bridge! After months of being isolated on a desert island being fed nothing but rice crackers and diet pepsi, I can talk about our newest bridge. It's fairly feature packed with support for all the usual formatting options, plus Jitsi widget bridging (as links) and full puppeting including DMs. Matthew even went and nattered to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/14/matrix_teams/">The Register</a> about it. So you heard it here first, no network is truly safe from the open federation and we hope to welcome teams users into the Matrix. The bridge is currently a closed source offering under the EMS banner for now.</p>
<p>You can read about it in https://element.io/blog/ems-launches-bridging-for-microsoft-teams/</p>

<p>Also, some more news. I've started making improvements to <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-github">matrix-github</a> as it continues to serve as the primary way for me to get notifications from GitHub. The latest improvements are that you can now dynamically create and assign filters to notifications coming to the bridge. This means you can name filters and turn them on and off as required (i.e. don't bug me about matrix-org on weekends please). The v0.1.0 release is <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-github/releases/tag/0.1.0">out</a>.</p>

<p>I've been using this for months now, and can confirm it works great!</p>
<h3 id="matrix-pstn-bridge">Matrix PSTN Bridge</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kb1rd:kb1rd.net">KB1RD</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a simple puppetting bridge to the public telephone network via providers like Twilio. It's designed to be modular and support several different providers (though it only supports Twilio ATM). Once more providers are added, it will be possible to seamlessly migrate your phone number between multiple providers and save conversation history.
Chats are created by starting a DM with the control bot (currently hardcoded at <code>@_pstn_:myserver.org</code>) and running the <code>dial</code> command. Multiple users can join a room with the control bot and are all given access to puppet the bridge.</p>
<p>Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Connect to <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> &amp; get current account balance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send SMS texts to phone numbers and receive texts back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intelligent dialing looks up phone numbers based on the one you're using</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give SMS users &quot;pet names&quot; via the <code>name</code> command</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow multiple users to puppet a bridge &amp; allow the bridging of bots</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some planned features could include: (I'm not committing to any of these ;D)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Displaying bridge info in Element settings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dialer widget</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending MMS (pictures, video, voice, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting extended information about users. Services like Twilio offer carrier
lookups and that sort of thing. Could be useful to help weed out spam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phone calls -- This is very hard</p>
<ul>
<li>Answering machine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faxing. Why not, I guess?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay-as-you-go managed phone number service</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start a chat with the bridge bot and buy a phone number via Matrix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment security is an issue here ;)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Puppetting WhatsApp business or Facebook Messenger. Companies like Twilio offer connections to proprietary messengers like these.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not ready for production use, though. It's still stuck on a SQLite DB and has a few usability issues.</p>

            <p>Next week on Wednesday (2021-04-21), the old Gitter bridge (identified as <code>@gitterbot:matrix.org</code>) will be shut down and any plumbed rooms (bridged connections) remaining will no longer bridge. To replace this, we've already migrated all of the portal rooms and many of the plumbed rooms in preparation so most users will not need to take any further actions. The remaining rooms with the old Gitter bridge are unfortunately not possible to migrate and for those communities a clean break will be needed. The new native Gitter bridge is here to replace this!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix">Gitter is bridged natively to Matrix</a> on the <code>gitter.im</code> homeserver and all of the public rooms are available there. The new native Gitter bridge has many advantages over the old bridge and is being actively developed to ensure parity and delivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to join public Gitter rooms from Matrix via <code>#&lt;community&gt;_&lt;room&gt;:gitter.im</code></li>
<li>Native feeling virtual users on both sides of the bridge so messages appear from the author itself</li>
<li>Bridging edits, replies (mapped to threads on Gitter), deletes, file transfers</li>
<li>Full support for markdown, emoji and mentions</li>
<li>Soon to be <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/issues/2671">direct message (DM) support</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you still need your <strong>existing</strong> Matrix room for a public community plumbed to Gitter, we‚Äôre happy to help community admins with the setup of a manual plumb. Send an email to <a href="mailto:support@gitter.im">support@gitter.im</a> with the details! Self-service plumbing will be coming in future (meanwhile, please keep it to public community rooms only, if you must!)</p>
<p>We hope that this notice helps make the transition a little smoother and avoid any disruptions üôá</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the migration path or the new bridge, you can always chat with us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gitter:matrix.org">#gitter:matrix.org</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As already mentioned a few times, this year the Matrix organization is taking part <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">in GSoC</a> again. This is an amazing opportunity for students to take part in various Matrix-related projects and helping those projects implement awesome new features. <strong>Submission for this closes on April 13 this year (which is Monday on my clock)!</strong> If you want to take part in GSoC as a student, submit your final proposals now! You can find some examples here: <a href="http://matrix-org.github.io/gsoc">http://matrix-org.github.io/gsoc</a>. If you want to submit your own ideas, please contact a potential mentor before that. If you have questions, please check out the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gsoc:matrix.org">#gsoc:matrix.org room</a>.</p>
<p>If you have already been writing a proposal, now is the time to put on the final polish and submit your proposal. If you are interested, now is the last opportunity this year to submit your proposal! We are excited to see, who will want to take part this year!</p>

<p>Ding dong the snake is dead! üêç‚ò†Ô∏è</p>
<p>We released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/04/06/synapse-1-31-0-released">Synapse¬†1.31</a> on Tuesday. There are certainly nice things in it (read the release notes), but also, two days after that... WE FINALLY <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9766">REMOVED SUPPORT FOR PYTHON 3.5</a>!</p>
<p>As part of that, we now have a formal <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.31.0/docs/deprecation_policy.md">deprecation policy</a> that explicitly states our platform support strategy. Namely: <strong>we follow upstream lifecycles</strong>. Thus, we can say with confidence that we will drop support for Python 3.6 in December of this year. So when upgrading, please do ensure that your operating system of choice provides modern Python packages.</p>
<p>By the way: if you're looking to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribute to Synapse</a>, now is a good time to start grepping for <code>3.5</code> or <code>xenial</code> or <code>stretch</code> and seeing what cobwebs turn up which can finally be swept away. üï∏üßπ</p>
<p>We're also experimenting with using GitHub Actions for CI, and would certainly appreciate reviews and pull requests from folks who are more knowledgeable in that area, especially around speeding up workflows and caching.</p>
<p>We'll be back next week with more details on the specific quarterly goals the team is committing itself to, but until then, üëã!</p>

            <p>We've released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.31.0">Synapse 1.31.0</a>!</p>
<p>Mainly internal changes this time (type hints, code lints, etc.) but we've also landed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9643">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9652">initial</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9653">work</a> on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946: Spaces Summary</a>. And speaking of MSCs, Synapse 1.31 has an experimental flag which can enable support for the draft <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3026">MSC3026: &quot;busy&quot; presence state</a>.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.31 can now restrict OpenID Connect logins based on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9609">userinfo attributes</a> (Thanks, HubbeKing!).</p>
<p>This release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9634">fixes a rare infinite loop</a> when fetching cross-signing keys or handling device list updates, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9640">further</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9639">improves</a> the speed of federation catchup. It also makes Admin APIs around user reactivation <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9636">behave correctly</a> when account passwords are disabled.</p>
<p>See the  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.31.0">Release Notes</a> for further information.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-python-3-5-release">The Final Python 3.5 Release</h3>
<p>This is the last release of Synapse to support Python 3.5 or PostgreSQL 9.5, and the last release of official packages for Debian 9 (Stretch) and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial).</p>
<p>Future releases of Synapse will follow upstream end-of-life dates for <a href="https://endoflife.date/python">Python</a> and <a href="https://endoflife.date/postgresql">Postgres</a>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we anticipate ending support for Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6 in December of this year. We will also cease producing packages for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) at that time.</p>
<h3 id="thank-you">Thank You</h3>
