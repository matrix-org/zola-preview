            <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.28.0">Synapse 1.28.0</a> is now available!</p>
<p>This release comes with several further improvements to the user experience of single sign-on and numerous bugfixes and stability improvements.</p>
<p>For admins, Synapse 1.28 adds a new Admin API for retrieving <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.28.0/docs/admin_api/rooms.md#event-context-api">event context</a> and implements new spam checker hooks which enable checking file uploads and remote downloads. We've also improved memory usage of media repository workers.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have marked an undocumented Admin API for deprecation. If any of your tools use <code>/_synapse/admin/v1/users/&lt;user_id&gt;</code> to get account information, please replace that with the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.28.0/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#list-accounts">V2 List Accounts</a> API, which has been available since Synapse 1.7.0.</p>
<p>There are no special upgrade instructions for 1.28.0. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.28.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> for more details on what's in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/arya2331">arya2331</a>, <a href="https://github.com/auscompgeek">auscompgeek</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bubu">bubu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/compu42">compu42</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dykstranet">dykstranet</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/shadowjonathan">shadowjonathan</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">sorunome</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soru has been working on experimenting with / designing a way to improve push systems within the matrix ecosystem, so that ideally clients can display full event contents in a notification and dispose of specific push notifications without the need for any extra HTTP calls. This lead her to making <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3013">MSC3013</a> (encrypted push), so that no gateway is able to read event contents pushed down to the client and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3014">MSC3014</a>, so that the client can know which rooms have been read on other devices, allowing them to dispose push notifications.</p>
<p>This is more than just MSCs already, soru already got encrypted push in a patched synapse and a patched fluffychat working locally, and it is working super great!</p>
<p>Dunno soru is just really excited about this somehow <code>&gt;~&lt;</code> 🦊</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">krille</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's talk more about Hedwig: This is a push gateway for matrix and an alternative to Sygnal. Hedwig is completely written from scratch in Rust (Yes! Rust!) and offers the basic functionality to forward matrix push notifications to Firebase Cloud Messaging. That's it. Nothing more. It is intended to be as lightweight as possible and so it is very fast and stable. Just change a simple config.toml file and run the binary. There are docs for how you can configure a proxy in Apache2 and an example systemD service file. Currently it only supports event_id_only formatted notifications but maybe, in the future, we expand this functionality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.10">Dendrite 0.3.10</a>, and have committed a couple more fixes to <code>master</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The database is now only queried for remote servers once in <code>/send</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The oldest cache entries are now gradually evicted, saving a small amount of memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The destination queues in the federation sender are now not stored forever, saving some memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where a non-excluded event could be accidentally excluded from <code>/sync</code> has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some dependency fixes have been merged</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sytest compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 60%</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synapse 1.27 is out, and you can <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/18/synapse-1-27-0-released">read all about it</a> on the Matrix Blog! This is the version that powered FOSDEM, and we're super proud of it. Especially the much improved support for multiple social login providers, which debuted at FOSDEM and is now enabled on matrix.org.</p>
<p>In addition to all the performance, stability, and social login improvements, there are two important things to note:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you use SSO, you will need update your configuration before upgrading; please see the link above for details.</li>
<li>We were unable to build Docker images for ARM platforms in time for this release, and will not build images for ARMv7 in future releases.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To avoid unexpected breakage, we have not updated the  <code>latest</code> tag on Docker Hub for this release; if you want Synapse 1.27, you'll need to specifically reference the <code>v1.27.0</code> tag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Images for ARM64 (and an updated <code>latest</code> tag) will return with the next Synapse release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It took us a bit longer than usual to get 1.27 out the door, so we're also pleased to announce that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.28.0rc1">1.28.0rc1</a> is also now available, and we expect to release it early next week. Keep your eyes peeled for more on that next week!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had a fun week this time. Today I tested trilenes screen sharing code, which seems to work pretty well on X11, although it only shares the full screen atm. I expect window sharing to land next week though. We also ran into some issues with matrix.org enabling optional SSO login, which locked some people out of their accounts, since Nheko preferred SSO login in that case... This is now fixed and in such cases you will be offered both login flows.</p>
<p>Jedi18 also added a room name completer, which means you can finally complete aliases when typing them! The room settings were also ported to Qml and now actually show the room topic. Apart from that there were various UX fixes here ad there, like hovering actually working properly now, emote messages formatting correctly in notifications and more. We also adapted the matrix: uri support to the latest changes, although the MSC is a bit volatile atm, so it may need some more adaptions over time.</p>
<p>I think that's all, have a nice weekend everyone!</p>

<h3 id="hydrogen">Hydrogen</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm back working on Hydrogen, and started to tackle logging to be able to diagnose problems better. I've opted for a structured log format in JSON that gives a tree of log nodes for an entire operation (e.g. sync, or sending a message, ...) which will be more compact and should also be easier to find patterns in than a pure line based format. I had hoped to get that out in a release by today but didn't get as far as I hoped, so should get released early next week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-02-19-VTLG5-image.png" alt="2021-02-19-VTLG5-image.png" /></p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.27.0">Synapse 1.27.0</a> is now available!</p>
<p>We're especially proud of this release, as this is the version of Synapse that powered <a href="/blog/2021/02/15/how-we-hosted-fosdem-2021-on-matrix">FOSDEM 2021 on Matrix</a>. As such, our main focus was on stability, performance, and long-awaited support for social login.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-new">What's New</h3>
<p>To our surprise, nearly <em>half</em> of all people who created accounts on the FOSDEM homeserver did so via a social login method. Full support for those methods is included in Synapse 1.27.0, and already available for all users on the matrix.org homeserver.</p>
<p>We've also changed how we use Redis in larger deployments, making Synapse more resilient to lost connections and eliminating delays when restarting with multiple federation senders.</p>
<p>Our Server Admin APIs saw a few tweaks, including new APIs to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.27.0/docs/admin_api/rooms.md#forward-extremities-admin-api">query and delete forward extremities</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.27.0/docs/admin_api/rooms.md#room-state-api">list the current state of a room</a>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.27.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> for more.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-for-sso">Breaking Changes for SSO</h3>
<p>If you use Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML, OAuth2, or OpenID Connect you <strong>must</strong> adjust your provider's configuration before upgrading to Synapse 1.27.0, as some endpoint URLs have changed. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.27.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1270">upgrading notes</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="dropping-armv7-docker-images">Dropping ARMv7 Docker Images</h3>
<p>We were unable to produce ARM-based Docker images for this release due to problems with cross-compilation. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to cease building 32-bit ARMv7 Docker images as part of our release process. We will resume publishing ARM64 images with the next Synapse release.</p>
<p>Users on ARMv7 platforms (most notably Raspberry Pis) should consider building images locally using Synapse's Dockerfile or switching to installing Synapse directly as a Python module. Users with Raspberry Pi 3's or newer also have the option of installing a 64-bit Linux distribution and using an ARM64 Docker image.</p>
<h3 id="thank-you-to-our-contributors">Thank you to our contributors</h3>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Just over a week ago we had the honour of using Matrix to host FOSDEM: the world's largest free &amp; open source software conference.  It's taken us a little while to write up the experience given we had to recover and catch up on business as usual... but better late than never, here's an overview of what it takes to run a ~30K attendee conference on Matrix!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_5335e89b9ca474d844bdc37ea328967b.png" alt="" /><small><center><em>[confetti and firework easter-eggs explode over the closing keynote of FOSDEM 2021]</em></center></small></p>
<p>First of all, a quick (re)introduction to Matrix for any newcomers: Matrix is an open source project which defines an open standard protocol for decentralised communication.  The global Matrix network makes up at least 28M Matrix IDs spread over around 60K servers.  For FOSDEM, we set up a fosdem.org server to host newcomers, provided by <a href="https://ems.element.io">Element Matrix Services (EMS)</a> - <a href="https://element.io">Element</a> being the startup formed by the Matrix core team to help fund Matrix development.</p>
<p>The most unique thing about Matrix is that conversations get replicated across all servers whose users are present in the conversation, so there's never a single point of control or failure for a conversation (much as git repositories get replicated between all contributors).  And so hosting FOSDEM in Matrix meant that everyone already on Matrix (including users bridged to Matrix from IRC, XMPP, Slack, Discord etc) could attend directly - in addition to users signing up for the first time on the FOSDEM server.  Therefore the chat around FOSDEM 2021 now exists for posterity on all the Matrix servers whose users who participated; and we hope that the fosdem.org server will hang around for the benefit of all the newcomers for the foreseeable so they don't lose their accounts!</p>
<p>Talking of which: the vital stats of the weekend were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We saw almost 30K local users on the FOSDEM server + 4K remote users from elsewhere in Matrix.</li>
<li>There were 24,826 guests (read-only invisible users) on the FOSDEM server.</li>
<li>There were 8,060 distinct users actively joined to the public FOSDEM rooms...</li>
<li>...of which 3,827 registered on the FOSDEM server.  (This is a bit of an eye-opener: over 50% of the actively participating attendees for FOSDEM were already on Matrix!)</li>
<li>These numbers don't count users who were viewing the livestreams directly, but only those who were attending via Matrix.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given last year's FOSDEM had roughly 8,500 in-person attendees at the Université libre de Bruxelles, this feels like a pretty good outcome :)</p>
<p>Graphwise, local user activity on the FOSDEM server looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_e24e0febde0118ea9f2e93005d926d48.png" alt="" />
<img src="/blog/img/upload_63bad29ebc4d672d9979f9eea48fcfc5.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="how-was-it-built">How was it built?</h2>
<p>There were four main components on the Matrix side:</p>
<ol>
<li>A horizontally-scalable Matrix server deployment (Synapse hosted in <a href="https://ems.element.io">EMS</a>)</li>
<li>A Jitsi cluster for the video conferencing, used to host all the Q&amp;A sessions, hallway sessions, stands, and other adhoc video conferences</li>
<li>An elastically scalable Jibri cluster used to livestream the Jitsi conferences both to the official FOSDEM livestreams and to provide a local preview of the conference on Matrix (to avoid the Jitsis getting overloaded with folks who just want to view)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/conference-bot">conference-bot</a> - a Matrix bot which orchestrated the overall conference on Matrix, written from scratch for FOSDEM by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a>, consuming the schedule from FOSDEM and maintaining all the necessary rooms with the correct permissions, widgets, invites, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Architecturally, it looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_06b59bc2b2d518ffe616020e1fe5bee8.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>On the clientside, we made heavy use of widgets: the ability to embed arbitrary web content as iframes into Matrix chatrooms. (Widgets currently exist as a set of <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">proposals</a> for the Matrix spec, which have been preemptively implemented in Element.)</p>
<p>For instance, the conference-bot created Matrix rooms for all the FOSDEM devrooms with a predefined widget for viewing the official FOSDEM livestream for that room, pointing at the appropriate HLS stream at stream.fosdem.org - which looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_07145dc9cf8d5ae22b6eaf91a63dd8d6.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Each devroom also had a schedule widget available on the righthand side, visualising the schedule of that room - huge thanks to Hato and Steffen and folks at <a href="https://nordeck.net/">Nordeck</a> for putting this together at the last minute; it enormously helped navigate the devrooms (and even had a live countdown to help you track where you were at in the schedule!)</p>
<p>Each devroom was also available via IRC on Freenode via a dedicated bridge (#fosdem-...) and via XMPP.</p>
<p>The bot also created rooms for each and every talk at FOSDEM (all 666 of them), as the space where the speaker and host could hang out in advance; watch the talk together, and then broadcast the Q&amp;A session.  At the end of the talk slot, the bot then transformed the talk room into a 'hallway' for the talk, and advertised it to the audience in the devroom, so folks could pose follow-on questions to the speaker as so often happens in real life at FOSDEM.  The speaker's view of the talk rooms looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_f8b9121b21323955233d6633d19e3fb5.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>On the right-hand side you can see a &quot;scoreboard&quot; - a simple widget which tracked which messages in the devroom had been most upvoted, to help select questions for the Q&amp;A session.  On the left-hand side you can see a hybrid Jitsi/livestream widget used to coordinate between the speaker &amp; host.  By default, the widget showed the local livestream of the video call - if you clicked 'join conference' you'd join the Jitsi itself.  This stopped view-only users from overloading the Jitsi once the room became public.</p>
<p>The widgets themselves were hosted by the bot (you can see them at https://github.com/matrix-org/conference-bot/tree/main/web).  Meanwhile the chat.fosdem.org webclient itself ended up being identical to mainline Element Web 1.7.19, other than FOSDEM branding and being configured to hook the 'video call' button up to the hybrid Jitsi/livestream widget rather than a plain Jitsi.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for conferencing we hosted an off-the-shelf Jitsi cluster sized to ~100 concurrent conferences, and for the Jibri livestreaming we set up an elastic scalable cluster using AWS Auto Scaling Groups.  Jibri is essentially a Chromium which views the Jitsi webapp, running in a headless X server whose framebuffer and ALSA audio is hooked up to an ffmpeg process which livestreams to the appropriate destination - so we chose to run a separate VM for every concurrent livestream to keep them isolated from each other.  The Jibri ffmpegs compressed the livestream to RTMP and relayed it to our nginx, which in turn relayed it to FOSDEM's livestreaming infrastructure for use in the official stream, as well as relaying it back to the local video preview in the Matrix livestream/video widget.</p>
<p>Here's a screengrab of the Jitsi/Jibri Grafana dashboard during the first day of the conference, showing 46 concurrent conferences in action, with 25 spare jibris in the scaling group cluster ready for action if needed :)</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_1dfb1ef630c0ac8f5b3fd81f52491964.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There was also an explosion of changes to Element itself to try to make things go as smoothly as possible.  Probably the most important one was implementing Social Login - giving single-click registration for attendees who were happy to piggyback on existing identity providers (GitHub, GitLab, Google, Apple and Facebook) rather then signing up natively in Matrix:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_45b228cf122b2faedfca5e36b6d52576.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This was a real epic to get together (and is also an important part of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix">achieving parity</a> between Gitter and Element) - and seems to have been surprisingly successful for FOSDEM.  Almost 50% of users who signed up on the FOSDEM server did so via social login!  We should also be turning it on for the matrix.org server this week.</p>
<p>Finally, on the Matrix server side, we ran a cluster of synapse worker processes (1 federation inbound, reader and sender, 1 pusher, 1 initial sync worker, 10 synchrotrons, 1 event persister, 1 event creator, 4 general purpose client readers, 1 typing worker and 1 user directory) within Kubernetes on <a href="https://ems.element.io">EMS</a>.  These were hooked up for <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/03/how-we-fixed-synapses-scalability/">horizontal scalability</a> as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_22b8ea14fff89c1bce93767b82ab1db5.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The sort of traffic we saw (from day 2) looked like this:</p>

<p>Overall, people seem to have had a good time.  Some folks have <a href="https://twitter.com/haerwu/status/1358731829512183813">even</a> been <a href="https://twitter.com/AxSaucedo/status/1358048849944797187">kind</a> enough to call it the <a href="https://twitter.com/cterboven/status/1358343020576440322">best</a> online event they've been to :)  This probably reflects the fact that FOSDEM rocks no matter what - and that Matrix is an inherently social medium, built by and for open source communities (after all, the whole Matrix ecosystem is developed over Matrix!).  Also, Matrix being an open network means that folks could join from all over, so the social dynamics already present in Matrix spilled over into FOSDEM - and we even saw a bunch of people spin up their own servers to participate; literally sharing the hosting responsibility themselves.  Finally, having critical infrastructure rooms available such as <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#beerevent:fosdem.org">#beerevent:fosdem.org</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#cafe:fosdem.org">#cafe:fosdem.org</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#food-trucks:fosdem.org">#food-trucks:fosdem.org</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/bortzmeyer/status/1358022989875466240">probably</a> helped as well.</p>
<p>That said, we did have some production incidents which impacted the event.  The most serious one was on Saturday morning, where it transpired that some of the endpoints hosted on the main Synapse process were taking way more CPU than we'd anticipated - most importantly the /groups endpoints which handle traffic relating to communities (the legacy way of defining groups of rooms in Matrix).  One of the last things we'd done to prepare for the conference on Friday night was to create a +fosdem:fosdem.org community which spanned all 1000 public rooms in the conference, as well as add the +staff:fosdem.org community to all of those rooms - and unfortunately we didn't anticipate how popular these would be.  As a result we had to do some emergency rebalancing of endpoints, spinning up new workers and reconfiguring the loadbalancer to relieve load off the main process.</p>
<p>Ironically the Matrix server was largely working okay during this timeframe, given event-sending no longer passes through the main process - but the most serious impact was that the conference bot was unable to boot due to hitting a wide range of endpoints on startup as it syncs with the conference, some of which were timing out.  This in turn impacted widgets, which had been hosted by the bot for convenience, meaning that the Jitsi conferences for stands and talk Q&amp;A were unavailable (even though the Jitsi/Jibri cluster was fine).  This was solved by lunchtime on Saturday: we are really sorry for folks whose Q&amp;As or conferences got caught in this.  On the plus side, we spotted that many affected rooms just added their own widgets for their own Jitsis or BBBs to continue with minimal distraction - effectively manually taking over from the bot.</p>
<p>The other main incident was briefly first thing on Sunday morning, where two Jibri livestreams ended up trying to broadcast video to the same RTMP URL (potentially due to a race when rapidly removing and re-adding the jitsi/livestream widget for one of the stands).  This caused a cascading failure which briefly impacted all RTMP streams, but was solved within about 30 minutes.  We also had a more minor problem with the active speaker recognition malfunctioning in Jitsi on Sunday (apparently a risk when using SCTP rather than Websockets as a transport within Jitsi) - this was solved around lunchtime.  Again, we're really sorry if you were impacted by this.  We've learned a lot from the experience, and if we end up doing this again we will make sure these failure modes don't repeat!</p>
<p>Other things we'd change if we have the chance to do it again include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a to-the-second countdown via a widget in the talk room so the speaker &amp; host can see precisely when they're going 'live' in the devroom (and when precisely they're going to be cut in favour of the next talk)</li>
<li>Providing a scratch-pad of some kind in the talk room so the host &amp; speaker can track which questions they want to answer, and which they've already answered</li>
<li>Keep the questions scoreboard and scratchpad visible to the speaker/host after their Q&amp;A has finished so they can keep answering the questions in the per-talk room, and advertise the per-talk room more effectively.</li>
<li>Use Spaces rather than Communities to group the rooms together and automatically provide a structured room directory! (<a href="https://youtu.be/TzUfS08lMek?t=1609">Like this!</a>)</li>
<li>Use threads (once they land!) to help structure conversations in the devroom (perhaps these could even replace the hallway rooms?)</li>
<li>Make the schedule widgets easier to find, and have more of them around the place</li>
<li>Make room directory easier to find.</li>
<li>Give the option of recording the video in the per-talk and stands for posterity</li>
<li>Provide more tools to stands to help organise demos etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there you have it.  We hope that this shows that it's possible to host successful large-scale conferences on Matrix using an <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/feb/08/just-say-no-to-zoom/">entirely open source stack</a>, and we hope that other events will be inspired to go online via Matrix!  We should give a big shout out to <a href="https://hope.net">HOPE</a>, who independently trailblazed running conferences on Matrix last year and <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/08/11/hope-2020-delivers-historic-marathon-of-hacking/">inspired us</a> to make FOSDEM work.</p>
<p>If you want to know more, we also did a talk about FOSDEM-on-Matrix in this month's <a href="https://youtu.be/Wp2rSyqZsbs?t=4903">Open Tech Will Save Us</a> meetup and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzUfS08lMek">Building Massive Virtual Communities on Matrix</a> talk at FOSDEM went into more detail too.  Our historical <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/04/taking-fosdem-online-via-matrix">Taking FOSDEM online via Matrix</a> blog has been somewhat overtaken by events but gives further context still.</p>
<p>Finally, huge thanks to FOSDEM for letting Matrix host the social side of the conference.  This was a big bet, starting from scratch with our <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1301285515774373889">offer to help</a> back in September, and we hope it paid off.  Also, thanks to all the folks at Element who bust a gut to pull it together - and to the FOSDEM organisers, who were a real pleasure to work with.</p>
<p>Let's hope that FOSDEM 2022 will be back in person at ULB - but whatever happens, the infrastructure we built this year will be available if ever needed in future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix Construct added Application Services support. I've been using the Mautrix Telegram bridge on a daily basis, and it's been a pleasure to develop with. Expect more bridges to be tested in the coming weeks. I'll also be working on completing the documentation for how to setup a bridge in Construct. Just to give some insight: The server has the ability to manage all of your bridges as sub-processes. In any client, just create a room for your bridge and enter its configuration there. Voila! The bridge's console appears right in that room and can even highlight you about errors!</p>

<p>We survived FOSDEM! Last week was relatively slower in Synapse land as we paused to catch our breath, but we do have news!</p>
<p>First, releases. Synapse 1.27.0rc2 is out now (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.27.0rc2/CHANGES.md#synapse-1270rc2-2021-02-11">changelog</a>), and we anticipate a full 1.27 release early next week. This is basically the branch that FOSDEM ran, so we think it's a good one.</p>
<p>Second, keeping with our biweekly development cadence, the first 1.28 release candidate is due out midweek next week, so keep your eyes peeled for that. Given FOSDEM, most of our recent focus has been on stability, bug fixes, and social login. We hope to <em>knock</em> your socks off with more ambitious features soon. 😉</p>

<p>We just landed basic support for edits. Which means edits are now applied to the original message instead of showing the fallback and you can edit your messages. You can also change a text message to a video (or the other way around) or change, who you replied to, but the latter fails to render in some clients properly, so be aware of that. Edits also send a secondary relation format, which makes handling edits easier, but I still haven't written up the MSC for that... The UI is not final yet and you can't show edit history yet, but apart from that it may or may not work fine.</p>
<p>There were also a lot of bugfixes like broken kerning in some cases, improved focus handling when clicking buttons in the timeline, Duplex devices should now work in calls, notifications now work on Haiku and a few more.</p>
<p>Now please stop asking for edits! :D</p>

<h3 id="fosdem-2021">FOSDEM 2021</h3>
<p>FOSDEM is happening this year, regardless of pandemics or anything else! Actually FOSDEM in my experience is a huge super-spreader event even in normal years, so it may be refreshing to know that this year it will be <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/04/taking-fosdem-online-via-matrix">fully virtual, and hosted using Matrix and Jitsi</a>!</p>
<p>Matrix have several relevant talks happening:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/matrix_gitter/">Adding Matrix for interoperability to existing chat apps</a> <em>Saturday @ 10:25</em> (this is about Gitter bridging/integration)</li>
<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/matrix_pinecones/">Pinecones and Dendrites - P2P Matrix Progress</a> <em>Saturday @ 11:30</em> (this is about P2P)</li>
<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/matrix_communities/">Building massive virtual communities in Matrix</a> <em>Sunday @ 12:00</em> (this is about Spaces)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, there is a bonus talk from Brendan:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/community_devroom_mental_health_free_software/">Mental health and free software</a> <em>Sunday @ 13:50</em> (in which Brendan talks about mental health issues in the context of working on free software, which may or may not relate to people, though certainly not me, pinging him at all hours to ask about customer integrations and features)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, perhaps the most important part of FOSDEM: <strong><a href="https://shop.matrix.org/product/fosdem-2021-matrix-t-shirt-limited-edition">FOSDEM 2021 Matrix T-Shirt (Limited Edition)</a> is now available</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/">FOSDEM</a> is tomorrow! We're all very excited to be powering the fosdem.org homeserver, and we hope you'll join in over the weekend.</p>
<p>Earlier this week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.27.0rc1">Synapse 1.27.0rc1</a>, though the final release is currently blocked on resolving a regression in Synapse 1.26 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9264">#9264</a>) which could cause logins to fail if your <code>public_baseurl</code> was unset in your Synapse configuration. The workaround is to ensure that value is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/docs/sample_config.yaml#L70-L81">correctly set</a> for your deployment.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we're quite excited to get 1.27 out the door, as it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solves an issue (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9172">#9172</a>) where federation senders could take many minutes to catch up after restarts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contains countless improvements to our support for social login methods, many of which will be live for FOSDEM users this weekend.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also included the usual host of bug fixes and Admin API additions, but more on those when the actual release happens. You can preview the release notes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.27.0rc1">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>See you at FOSDEM!</p>

<p>My iMessage bridge is starting to be usable now. Text and files work in both directions and tapbacks and replies work iMessage-&gt;Matrix. Currently it only supports running on a Mac, the iOS option will come later.

<p>Another release! Wow. We're also testing 0.24.0-rc1 which has quite a few big ticket items this week. Off the top of the list is a new command to <code>!plumb</code> rooms dynamically in admin rooms, provided you have permissions in the bridge (happy days self hosters!). We've also added the feature to warn if your messages don't get through in your admin room. Finally, there are a bunch of small bug fixes and one large one that should make the bridge <strong>much</strong> more resistant to netsplits, so that it should recover in a much safer way should it get hit by a ton of traffic. Please test, and if all goes well the formal release will be out next week!</p>

<p>In other news, lorendb extended the drop zone for media to the full timeline, the privacy screen got merged, some more emojis should now display properly, you can now change your avatar and displayname globally or per room and clicking a matrix link in your browser should now actually open the link in Nheko (we were missing the %u in the .desktop file).</p>

<p>I have been learning about matrix the last few months. The result of that is <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~f4814n/frost">frost</a> a very basic GUI matrix client written in Go using <a href="https://gioui.org">Gio</a> and a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~f4814n/matrix">CS library</a>. Highlights of the project so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Works on Linux, Windows, macOS and Android (although I only test on Linux and often break the other platforms)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should work on WASM and iOS with not too much effort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very, very limited E2EE support. (If the session is manually verified by other clients, events can be encrypted and decrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Library that handles storage, encryption and some other things with a opinionated but simple to use (I hope) interface.</p>
</li>

<p>I started this project to understand matrix and improve my Go skills (which are not that great) and if somebody wants to play around with it and give me some feedback on it, I would very much appreciate it.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@carl:kde.org">Carl Schwan</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NeoChat is continuing to make progress. First of all Tobias, Nicolas and Hannah have been working on packaging NeoChat for many platforms. We now have nightly builds for Android, Windows, macOS, AppImages and Flatpak. There is still work to be done to improve the quality of the builds and fixing some platform incompatibility bugs. Nicolas has also been working on optimizing the performance and the RAM usage, fixing a few bottlenecks. Tobias finally landed his big revamp of the login flow and we now support login using single sign-on. Myself (Carl) worked on E2EE support in NeoChat and Quotient. This week we finished our Qt bindings for libOlm and started adding device key tracking and more!</p>

<p>Hey folks! It's been a while since we've had an update but things are always manic at bridge HQ. This release is a bit of a whopper containing quite a few bugfixes (including improvements to the experimental encrypted bridge support). We've also updated to Typescript 4.1 which is a bit stricter on those promise return types. Finally, you can now create intents on the bridge and use it's components without starting the HTTP listener which has been a longstanding issue for as long as I've been maintaining.</p>
<p>So go out there and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/v2.5.0-rc1">test this release</a>, all going well we should 🚢 early next week!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Then, later...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apart from the current releases, we have a few things cooking right now:</p>
<h4 id="edits">Edits</h4>
<p>Yes, I have tried to avoid them for long, but <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/pull/420">I am finally working on it</a>. It's a bit different to how Element and others do it, but it also generates a fallback to be compatible with the current MSCs where possible. I've grown a bit tired of having to explain myself everytime, why I did not want to support edits (yet), so I'm experimenting with a few solutions now. Expect a blog post summarizing those experiments in the future and maybe an MSC.</p>
<h4 id="polish">Polish</h4>
<p>Jedi18 and LorenDB are both busy polishing up the rough corners in Nheko, like finally being able to set your username and avatar in the UI as well as being able to copy text via right click, jdenticons and other fancy stuff. We also had a few contributions in the last release, which should improve the UX a lot.</p>
<h4 id="gsoc">GSoC</h4>
<p>Furthermore we will be participating in GSoC (if matrix.org gets accepted) and will probably mentor a student, that implements a few of the smaller features, which users may be missing after using Element for long.</p>
<p>I think that is all I wanted to share. I hope you enjoy the release and if you have any issues or feature requests, tell us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> or open an issue on Github!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the project is already fairly rich in features, I decided that it's timely (some would say - way overdue) to bump up the version a bit. In that light, the next Quaternion beta is numbered 0.0.95 beta 3 (no four-number version any more) and it's out now! <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.95-beta3">Release notes</a> list notable changes since (0.0.9.5) beta 2, with two most significant being ability to enter messages in Markdown and the overhauled timeline that allows you to easily discern between already read and yet unread messages and also quickly scroll to the read marker.</p>

<li>
<p>We made some improvements to use less RAM in the background sync module that manages push notifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We continued to improve performance in E2EE to speed up message sending using pre-sharing keys and re-sharing keys methods. Element-iOS now automatically rejects share requests from not verified devices. It does not send anymore such requests if it is not verified.</p>

<p>It's been a really long time since an update on <a href="https://github.com/ruma/state-res">ruma/state-res</a> but work has continued!</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks to a push from <a href="https://github.com/gnieto">@gnieto</a> the state-res crate no longer has its own PDU type, we are now <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/384">using a trait</a>.</li>

<p>Conduit continues its use of state-res, which has helped workout the kinks and buggy bits.</p>

<p>Just a small dev update on things that currently happen over at the Serverlist project &quot;Keymaker&quot; and its companion bot.</p>
<p>Follow it in detail at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#serverlist:nordgedanken.dev">#serverlist:nordgedanken.dev</a>  or https://github.com/keymaker-mx/</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The registration bot finally is starting to get its admin backend -&gt; The registration probably happens in a few weeks from now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keymaker has now a admin login page (using matrix as auth provider) to allow a web UI for admins to manage servers (WIP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bot successfully writes servers upon registration to the database. This is the main task of the bot besides the capability to administrate the page using the page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bot now is able to be used by admins in an admin room which also gets notifications if a user registered a new server.</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.26.0">Synapse 1.26.0</a> is now available!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This release includes a new database schema version. If you need to roll back to Synapse 1.25.0, you will also need to follow the associated <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1260">database downgrade instructions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to a truckload of refactoring and general improvements, Synapse 1.26.0 includes three major new features:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/auth_chain_difference_algorithm.md">brand new algorithm</a> for calculating the auth chain difference, which should dramatically improve worst case performance during state resolution (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622">#8622</a>).</li>
<li>Initial support for enabling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9110">multiple OpenID Connect providers</a>, paving the way for proper multi-provider social login workflows.</li>
<li>A significant speed-up to redaction performance in large rooms.</li>
</ol>
<p>It also brings several improvements to Admin APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific media items can be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/admin_api/media_admin_api.md#protecting-media-from-being-quarantined">protected from quarantine</a>. </li>
<li>The <code>joined_rooms</code> API now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#list-room-memberships-of-an-user">works for remote users</a>.</li>
<li>Deactivating a user can now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#deactivate-account">optionally remove their avatar URL and display name</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also made it possible to offload several additional APIs to worker processes, including read receipts and account data persistence, further improving Synapse's scalability.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> for more.</p>
<p>Lastly, a reminder: we have <strong>deprecated Python 3.5 and PostgreSQL 9.5</strong> and will cease support at the end of March. Due to deprecations in our Python tooling, we were unable to produce a binary package for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) in time for this release. We have resolved this for 1.27.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/0xflotus">0xflotus</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chris-ruecker">chris-ruecker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/emelie-qis">emelie-qis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jerinjtitus">jerinjtitus</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/tzyl">tzyl</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>New website! <a href="https://beeperhq.com">beeperhq.com</a>. Beeper is a Matrix server+client combo preconfigured with 12+ bridges. Our mission is to bring a lot of new users into the Matrix ecosystem and give them a fast and powerful client to message people on all networks. Beeper is a paid subscription service, but since all the bridges are open source, you can set the whole system up yourself for free if you choose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're doing a lot of work to boost bridge reliability. Beeper now comes with bridges to Signal, Whatsapp, FB, Slack, Skype, Telegram, Instagram, Hangouts, Twitter, Discord. iMessage coming within a week or two.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sneak peek below of our upcoming desktop UI</p>

<h4 id="looking-for-contract-work">Looking for contract work?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We are offering bounties of $500-2,000 USD to build new open source bridges based on tulir's mautrix-python or mautrix-go libraries. In particular, we would love to commission Linkedin, MS Teams, Google Chat, GroupMe, WeChat, Snapchat (maybe run it in Anbox?), Line and Email (gmail specifically) bridges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are also looking for contract iOS and Android developers familiar with the Element codebase to reskin the app with our new UI. Part-time roles with potential for full time.</p>

<p>Google Summer of Code has come around again! Last year was really successful for Matrix: six projects, with members of the community coming forward to mentor students for their project. This year there is a slight tweak to the formula: <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/10/google-summer-of-code-2021-is-bringing.html">the projects will now be 175 hours, rather than the traditional 350, over the summer</a>.</p>
<p>Since we need to <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline">submit an application to Google within the next few weeks</a>, I have a request: if you admin a Matrix-related Open Source project and would like to have a student work with you over the summer, get involved!</p>
<p>How to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources">Google's own documentation</a> on the setup. This is fairly thorough, and should get you most of the way there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about a task, that you consider a student should be able to contribute to your project over a 10-week/175-hour period. Try to come up with 2-3 of these.</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be a well-defined feature that genuinely contributes to the progress of your project, but maybe doesn't block other work on the critical path.</li>
<li>This is a very important step, and one that may need some time and discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>DM me (@benpa:bpulse.org) and we'll talk about next steps.</p>
</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h4>
<p>We've decided to ditch the focus as it was clear that it wasn't a great indicator of progress. Once one team member has reviewed all of the focus items, they will move on to other MSCs. None of that work is reflected in the focus, and items in there often stick around while waiting on a small number of people to complete work on.</p>
<p>As such, we'd instead like to direct people to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/31">Spec Core Team Backlog board</a>, which is a better representation of the current state of things. And of course the weekly list of MSCs state changes above.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of this week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.6">Dendrite 0.3.6</a>, which included a number of refactors in the sync API and a selection of fixes. It is also the first version to be released with multi-arch Docker images with ARMv7/ARM64 targets.</p>
<p>Since then, the following changes have been merged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sync filtering support for event types, senders as well as better-supported limits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation support for MSC2946 (Spaces Summary)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug where large well-known files could consume a lot of memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for in-process DNS caching for federation traffic (although it is disabled by default)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some preparatory work for tracking the most recent membership states in the sync API for future history visibility work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 60%, up from 58% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>

<p>🎉 Synapse 1.26.0rc1 is here!</p>
<p>☠️ But don't install it yet; wait for rc2.</p>
<p>A few issues were reported with rc1 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9187">#9187</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9193">#9193</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9208">#9208</a>), and we'll issue an rc2 early next week once we're confident they've been resolved.</p>
<p>Otherwise, once 1.26.0 is released you can look forward to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/docs/auth_chain_difference_algorithm.md">a new algorithm</a> for calculating auth chain difference in v2 State Resolution which should significantly speed up some of the most expensive state resolution calculations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622">#8622</a>).</p>
<p>We've also dramatically improved the performance of redactions in large rooms, helping Synapse's moderation tools scale to communities of any size (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9022">#9022</a>). And speaking of scaling, Synapse 1.26 makes it possible to offload many different APIs to worker processes, including read receipts and account data persistence.</p>
<p>Lastly, Synapse 1.26 will include support for multiple Single Sign-On Identity providers, though we expect further fit-and-finish for that feature to land in 1.27.</p>
<p>You can preview the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/CHANGES.md">changelog</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1260">upgrade notes</a> now, but remember: wait for rc2! 😉</p>

<p>It is a <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a> library.

For writing it provides methods to send messages, edit them, and send receipts and typing notifications.</p>

<h4 id="opsdroid-1">opsdroid</h4>
<p><a href="https://opsdroid.dev/">opsdroid</a> is an easy to use chat-ops framework with excellent Matrix support.</p>
<h4 id="0-20-release">0.20 Release</h4>
<p>This week opsdroid released version 0.20. This is a <em>massive</em> release that's been a long time coming because of a <strong>complete rewrite of the internals of the matrix connector to use <a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a></strong>---thanks to <a href="https://github.com/awesome-michael">@awesome-michael</a> for the initial work on this.</p>
<p>Having ported the connector to nio, our GSOC student <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tyagdit:matrix.org">@Tyagdit</a> got to work polishing the nio port and reimplementing the <strong>matrix database</strong> module in the core opsdroid library. Opsdroid has a concept of memory which is a key-value store which can be backed my many different kinds of <a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/">databases</a>. The <a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/matrix.html">matrix database</a> stores the opsdroid memory in room state, meaning your bot's database and messages are all stored in the same place.</p>
<p>Finally, the other big feature added to the matrix support in this release is <strong>End to End Encryption</strong> support. Thanks to using matrix-nio as our matrix library it was possible to implement support for encrypted matrix rooms. This also includes support in the matrix database for encrypted memory which works by referencing event ids in room state (<a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/matrix.html#encryption">see here</a> for more info). As this is the first release to support E2EE I would still consider it &quot;beta&quot;; please open issues if you have any trouble using it.</p>
<h4 id="highlights-1">Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>End to End Encryption support in the Matrix connector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matrix database now included in core, with e2ee support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of Python's install &quot;extras&quot; to allow for installations with fewer packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved documentation of the matrix connector and database (at least a little).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for Python 3.9 (and dropped support for 3.6).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Checkout the <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/releases">full release notes</a> for all the gory details.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Version 2.0 of <a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal">matrix-corporal</a> has been released.</p>
<p>It's a huge release bringing many improvements (read all of it in the <a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal/releases/tag/2.0.0">release notes</a>).</p>
<p>Here's a short summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an <strong>Event Hooks system</strong> has been introduced, so matrix-corporal can now also act like a &quot;generic firewall&quot; (similar to what <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxgwd">mxgwd</a> was doing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>device-free login</strong> is now used when impersonating users (thanks to a new API introduced by Synapse v1.24.0) - this is both faster and more resilient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for <strong>Interactive Authentication</strong> (and thus, <strong>End-to-End-Encryption</strong>) has been added. Users can now set up E2EE keys, manage devices, etc. (actions that require Interactive Authentication and were previously broken). Requires cooperation between <code>matrix-corporal</code> and the <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-synapse-rest-password-provider">REST auth password provider module</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>End-to-End-Encryption control</strong>. matrix-corporal can enforce whether rooms that users create are encrypted or unencrypted. You can force-disable or force-enable encryption for locally-created rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fixes user-creation regression</strong> that happened with Synapse v1.24.0. matrix-corporal v1.12.0 is also out, with a backport of this fix (for users who don't want to jump to 2.0 yet).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It's not dead! yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's been some code refactoring on the <a href="https://github.com/anchor-logoot">algorithm</a>. Mainly, the search tree used has been split into a different package</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm working on porting the Notepad to the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api">widget API</a>. Ongoing work is on the <a href="https://github.com/KB1RD/matrix-notepad/tree/nextgen">nextgen branch</a> and is tracked by <a href="https://github.com/KB1RD/matrix-notepad/projects/3">this</a> project. The widget is currently blocked on some stuff in the widget API, so I probably won't be releasing soon. The code in there needs a <em>ton</em> refactoring, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that the old notepad client will disappear on the next release and you'll need to add a widget for the Notepad for any documents that you want to edit. Currently, this means you would have to use Element, but I heard Ditto just might be doing some widget work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The widget API is planned to do everything and more that my &quot;mxapps&quot; project was supposed to do, so that project will be deprecated in favor of using the widget API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's also a little demo/teaser video showing the old notepad talking to the new one. You can see the rate limiting issues that the Notepad hits there, which is on my todo list.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week we released Dendrite 0.3.5, our first release of 2021, which includes a fairly significant refactor of parts of the sync API, along with other fixes. More work has since been merged into <code>master</code> too.</p>
<p>Changes in the last two weeks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sync streams are now logically separate, with a lot of behaviour fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities are now deep-checked properly, which should significantly reduce the peaks of CPU and RAM when handling the current room state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pagination tokens in <code>/messages</code> have been fixed, which should improve the reliability of scrolling back in the timeline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of fixes have been made to the <code>/sync</code> response, largely avoiding <code>null</code>s, which should make some clients happier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send-to-device messaging has been refactored, which should improve E2EE stability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well-known/DNS records for federated servers are now cached rather than performing lots of lookups, speeding up outbound federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Device list requests to remote servers now time out quicker, so as to not block <code>/send</code> transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental support for MSC2946 has been merged (gated behind the <code>mscs</code> configuration)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request context is no longer reused for <code>/send</code>, which should help in cases where the remote sending server gives up waiting or the connection breaks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for general Dendrite chat or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite-dev:matrix.org">#dendrite-dev:matrix.org</a> for development discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you explain something: Dendrite federation is basically working fine, AIUI, what does it mean that <code>Server-server APIs</code> is &lt;100%?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil</a> helpfully replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are still some edge-case tests that we haven't got passing yet, but I think that's only ~20 tests or so.<br />
There are also a few tests which are quite sensitive to exactly what Synapse does/returns, even though Dendrite is probably doing the right thing but maybe taking a different amount of time to do it or returning something slightly different, so there'll be some tests we need to fix too</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>🎉 <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/13/synapse-1-25-0-released">Synapse 1.25.0</a> is out! It includes a pretty significant speedup for state resolution in bridged IRC rooms, as well as the usual assortment of bug fixes and improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🕵️ For a limited time, and thanks to funding from the European Commission, paid bug bounties are now available for Synapse and other Matrix.org projects via the <a href="https://app.intigriti.com/company/programs/matrix/matrix/detail">Intigriti bug bounty platform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>👋 If you're wondering about the face behind these updates, scroll up and check out Matrix Live!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We're on track for 1.26.0rc1 next week, which includes a massive speedup for message redaction in large rooms, as well as finally landing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622#issuecomment-729620021">fundamental algorithmic improvements</a> to state resolution.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we remain hard at work preparing for FOSDEM-on-Matrix, with special emphasis on improving our stability and moderation capabilities at scale. See y'all next week!</p>

<p>Just pushed version 1.25.0 of Synapse for my Kubernetes <a href="https://github.com/ananace/matrix-synapse">image</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts">chart</a>. Haven't quite had the time to finish up the redo of the scripts, but expect that 1.25.0 will be the last version with a specific image, I'm hoping to have generalized the chart enough that it should work with any reasonable image at that point.</p>

<h3 id="gitter">Gitter</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org">Eric Eastwood</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few improvements to the Gitter bridge this week so that when a room updates and the avatar or topic changes, it now propagates across to Matrix automatically. We also handle updating the name whenever we have to rename a room or a group.</p>
<p>We're also thinking about how best to tackle self-service plumbing so you can pipe a Gitter room into your existing Matrix room. And the bigger idea of connecting various bridged portal rooms together. So you can connect your community on Gitter &lt;-&gt; Matrix &lt;-&gt; IRC seamlessly for example. The current thinking is introducing this as a native Matrix concept so you can easily connect any Matrix room to another Matrix room. We'd love to hear your thoughts in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2923">MSC2923</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@robintown:townsendandsmith.ml">Robin</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Version 2 of mx-puppet-groupme is here! This week I did some reverse engineering of the GroupMe Android app with mitmproxy so that I could work out the remaining undocumented features of GroupMe's API. As a result, typing notifications, read receipts, and videos are now working! Though note that due to limitations of the platform, read receipts are a DMs-only feature.</p>
<p>We also now have a Dockerfile (thanks, Trey B.!), double puppeting support was added, the code was ported to Typescript, and it should now work with older versions of Node. So at this point the bridge is basically feature-complete! As usual, send any questions, bugs, or feature requests to <a href="https://gitlab.com/robintown/mx-puppet-groupme">GitLab</a> or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#mx-puppet-groupme:townsendandsmith.ml">Matrix</a>. 💜</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on moving mautrix-facebook to act as a Messenger mobile app instead of the web app in order to hopefully make it more reliable. The initial version is starting to work now.</p>
<p>It's currently in the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook/tree/mobile">mobile</a> branch. I'm not actually sure if it helps with facebook forcing password resets (for some reason they've never done that to my account), but if it does, I'll merge it into master in the near future.</p>
<p>The new version only supports Postgres like my newer bridges, but I'll invent a SQLite migration tool before merging to master.</p>

<h3 id="neochat-1-0-1-released">NeoChat 1.0.1 released</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@carl:kde.org">Carl Schwan</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NeoChat 1.0.1 was released with a few important bugfixes. https://carlschwan.eu/2021/01/13/neochat-1.0.1-first-bugfix-release/. On the unstable branch, we continued to improve the integration with Plasma. We now display the unread count in the taskbar and we are getting inline replies too thanks to the work of <a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/knotifications/-/merge_requests/28">Kai Uwe Broulik</a> in Knotifications. Another important change is that rooms can now be opened in a new separate window.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bugfixing for the next release is in progress, fixing various issues and instabilities introduced with the new features, but some smaller features also still made it in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is now a call invite screen more fitting for mobile devices, when you enable the &quot;Touchscreen mode&quot; in the settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various clickable elements now have a ripple effect again to give feedback, when a click was registered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko now handles the Matrix URI scheme. This means opening a link starting with <code>matrix:</code> should open Nheko (at least on Linux) and redirect to the appropriate room and matrix URIs inside of Nheko are also handled. This currently does not support navigating to a specific event, but opening user profiles, starting chats with specific users and opening or joining rooms should work. Nheko also does not automatically linkify links starting with <code>matrix:</code>, so you need to do that manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verification dialogs were cleaned up a bit and hopefully are easier to understand now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flatpak nightlies now support VOIP calls, but as a result are now a few MB more to download.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we are nearing the next release, it would be appreciated, if you could check the <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/">translations for your platform are up to date</a> and try the <a href="https://matrix-static.neko.dev/room/!TshDrgpBNBDmfDeEGN:neko.dev/">current nightlies</a> and check them for bugs your experience and want to have fixed before release.

<p>I'd like to have announced the next beta release for Quaternion 0.0.9.5 - unfortunately, <a href="https://travis-ci.community/t/org-com-migration-unexpectedly-comes-with-a-plan-change-for-oss-what-exactly-is-the-new-deal/10567">migrating from Travis CI</a> took more than I wanted; but adventurous souls are welcome to test the master branch that's basically ready for beta 3.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it surfaced that Quaternion 0.0.9.4e Windows binaries have been expecting (very old and no more supported) OpenSSL 1.0. This is now fixed in <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.9.4f">Quaternion 0.0.9.4f</a> (hopefully this will be the last 0.0.9.4 rebuild and I won't chase the above-mentioned OpenSSL project in trying to expire Latin letters).</p>

<p>PingPong measures transport latencies on Matrix networks. It connects to two Matrix accounts simultaneously, and bounces messages back and forth between them.

<p>I have been working on this for a while now and I believe it is ready for others to use at this point. No binary releases yet, the program must be built from source.
