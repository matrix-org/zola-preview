<h2 id="spec">Spec</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>A large chunk of e2e has landed in the spec, largely thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Zil0:matrix.org">Zil0</a>'s work. There are still some things left, but the main bits related to sending encrypted messages is in there. Attachments and key sharing are being reviewed today</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> progressed on Push, Application Services, and Client-Server APIs.</li>
 	<li>To follow along with progress, the best place to look is the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/1">August 2018 r0 tracker</a>.</li>
</ul>

Key backups are being worked on, and we've had some new thoughts on key verification.
<h2 id="rumatrixorg">ru-matrix.org</h2>
Well are you?
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@murz:ru-matrix.org">Alexey</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> have a new Russian-language community wiki available at <a href="https://ru-matrix.org">https://ru-matrix.org</a>. This:</p>
<blockquote>accumulates Russian translates of Matrix FAQ and manuals, and other info about Matrix in Russian.

<a href="http://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> continues work on <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/matrique-go">Matrique</a>, a glossy Qt client:
<blockquote>Typing notification and desktop notification of Matrique are working, plus other improvements</blockquote>

Lazy Loading (LL) is available on develop behind the LABS flag, and is being polished. It will probably not make it to next release, but it's progressing!
<h3 id="riotmobile">Riot Mobile</h3>
New releases are imminent for both Android and iOS:
<ul>
 	<li>iOS: bug fixes and Lazy Loading in settings</li>
 	<li>Android: bug fixes, better management of permission requests at startup</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sharedsecretauthandmatrixcorporeal">Shared Secret Auth and Matrix Corporal</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> has been working on several operations tools for Synapse. Firstly <strong><a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth">Shared Secret Auth</a></strong> password provider module for Matrix Synapse.
<blockquote>It allows external systems (which know the shared secret) to easily obtain access tokens for any user hosted on the homeserver. This is incredibly useful for all sorts of automation (no more pre-generated access tokens or plain-text passwords).</blockquote>
With this tool, you can pass a mxid, and get back an access_token for that user. With this, you can do whatever actions would normally be done with a token. For example, you for a new starter at a company, you could join a set of rooms known to be needed by new starters.
<p>Support room for Shared Secret Auth: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth:devture.com">#matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth:devture.com</a></p>
<p>Next, he has released <a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal">Matrix Corporal</a>, reconciliator and gateway for a managed Matrix server:</p>
<blockquote>It's a way to take control of Matrix (Synapse) in a corporate (or other such) environment.<br />Based on a configuration policy (generated by an external system, like your intranet), it can auto-create and auto-disable users, keep their profile and authentication details to date, auto-join/leave users to communities and rooms, etc.<br />It's also meant to sit in front of the Matrix Synapse Client API, inspecting and allowing/denying requests, in accordance with the configuration policy (preventing people from leaving certain rooms/communities, preventing them from messing around with their profile details, etc.)</blockquote>
Support room for Matrix Corporal: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-corporal:devture.com">#matrix-corporal:devture.com</a>
<p>Note that Slavi also maintains <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>, which can deploy these projects along with Synapse itself.</p>
<h2 id="bots">Bots</h2>
<h3 id="twimbot">twimbot</h3>
I was extremely young when I first read and understood Larry Wall's explanation about the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris">virtue of laziness</a>, but I did not expect it to lead here. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> has created (I think inspired by an idea from <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>), a "<a href="https://github.com/Cadair/skill-twim">twimbot</a>". This bot works in conjunction with <a href="https://opsdroid.github.io/">opsdroid</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/connector-matrix">opsdroid connector-matrix</a> - it works by storing selected messages from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> in room state. In this way, it either assists the author by making it easier to produce the blog post you're reading, or it coldly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45240758">replaces the author</a>, leading to his sacking and penury. To view updates currently held by the bot, join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim_updates:cadair.com">#twim_updates:cadair.com</a>.
<h3 id="hashtagbot">Hashtag bot</h3>
When he's not working away on the Matrix Spec, <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> continues to work on less [essential|sane] Matrix projects. This week we have <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hashtag:t2bot.io">@hashtag:t2bot.io</a>, a bot that converts #hashtags to Matrix groups.
<blockquote>Why? Because why not. Source available on github: <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-hashtag-bot">https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-hashtag-bot</a></blockquote><br /><h2 id="bridges">Bridges</h2><br /><h3 id="matrixappservicebridgeandmatrixappserviceirc">matrix-appservice-bridge and matrix-appservice-irc</h3><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> will only be working full time with the Matrix Core team for another week (!!!), but until then he's going full-speed with bridge work. First <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">matrix-appservice-irc</a>:<br /><blockquote>Just pushed out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/blob/release-v0.11.0/CHANGELOG.md">matrix-appservice-irc 0.11.0-rc3</a> which contains a lot of nice things. The full changelog is there, hoping to get some of this tested and running on the matrix.org servers soon, but initial testing looks good :)</blockquote><br />Having worked so much on IRC bridging the last few months, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has this week managed to make improvements to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>:<br /><blockquote>Released matrix-appservice-bridge 1.6.0 which contains mostly things I was writing for the irc bridge and factored out instead. There's a couple of goodies like automatic caching of profiles/events, and getEvent as a way to fetch events from the homeserver without fiddling with context.</blockquote>
Full changelog: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/1.6.0/CHANGES.md">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/1.6.0/CHANGES.md</a>
<blockquote>Some <code>Intent</code> operations now cache requests that would otherwise fall through
to the homeserver which can be expensive. This is configurable for <code>Intent</code>s
via the <code>opts.caching.ttl</code> and <code>size</code> options.
AgeCounters now allow you to set your own time period buckets.
Added a new function <code>Intent.getEvent</code> which will fetch events
from the homeserver without any context information, which should
be quick.
<code>MembershipCache</code> is now exposed to let folks read and write to the cache
while also letting the bridge access it.
<p><code>a</code> release: Fix issue where <code>roomState</code> would fail.
<code>b</code> release: Fix issue where we were calling this.intent <em>inside</em> intent like fools!
<code>c</code> release: Fix issue where some stole js-sdk code was not checked thoroughly.</blockquote></p>
<h3 id="whatsapp">WhatsApp</h3>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> announces that <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> "is now somewhat usable for basic chatting".
<blockquote>It uses the <a href="https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp">go-whatsapp</a> library to talk with the WhatsApp Web API. Using the web API means that you'll still need WhatsApp on your phone connected to the internet, but it also means you won't get banned for using the bridge.<br />The bridge is still very alpha, but basic message bridging and some advanced features already work. There's a <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp/blob/master/ROADMAP.md">features &amp; roadmap</a> document about that.</blockquote>

<h3 id="mxtoot">mxtoot</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/mxtoot">mxtoot</a> is a Matrix-Mastodon bot from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a>, creator of <a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">Jeon</a> and the ecosystem around it.
<p>There were two releases last week:</p>
<blockquote>0.4.6 with additional commands (follow, unfollow, mute, unmute, block, unblock users, show followers and followings of the specified user) and a little bugfix.</blockquote>
<a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/mxtoot/releases/tag/0.4.7">0.4.7 is out now</a>, which increases the length of messages to 4000 characters.

<h2 id="theconstructusingasynchronousdiskio">The Construct using asynchronous disk IO</h2>
Jason writes:
<blockquote>the Construct has advanced to fully asynchronous disk IO in a single-threaded environment.<br />RocksDB is a highly configurable and customizable database with a very large callback surface to support many different environments, which is good to connect it with something like AIO.<br />Normally RocksDB gets its performance from concurrent standard POSIX system calls (blocking IO) with multiple threads. The callback surface and its internals are not specifically suited for deviating from the pthread model. However I hacked RocksDB and tricked it into believing that my userspace contexts, which mimic the <code>std::thread/pthread</code> interface, are threads.<br /><a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/blob/ac3b45604a8e7c6e4a8d3b3d84d62bfbc1070c46/ircd/db.cc#L4336">This is an example of a RocksDB callback to read from a file</a>, it expects this callback to return immediately (i.e as soon as the kernel returns from a blocking read(2).) Except, where I call <code>fs::read()</code> that is actually a stack-suspension which makes a request to linux AIO where the stack resumes after AIO has called back with the data (see: <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/blob/master/ircd/aio.cc">https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/blob/master/ircd/aio.cc</a>)<br />No modifications to the internals of RocksDB were necessary.

Check out the content there, and please please <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">contact me</a> if you have articles, videos or anything else you'd like to see included. Of course, if you'd like to <em>produce</em> some content and have it included, that would be great too! Ideas for missing articles:

            <p>All the threes, Synapse 0.33.3!</p>
<p>This release brings together a lot of bugfixes, and also some preparation for support for Lazy Loading and Room Versioning.</p>
<p>We also have, as a great contribution from <a href="https://github.com/vojeroen">@vojeroen</a>, SNI extension support! With v0.33.3, Synapse now supports sending SNI over federation for vhosted servers, which resolves <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1491">this long-standing request</a>.</p>
<p>As always, you can get the new update from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.3">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.3</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.</p>

<h2 id="spec">Spec</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> continues to plow through work in documenting, clarifying and confirming the spec. You can check out his project on Github: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/1">August 2018 r0</a>, which should give an idea of both the scale of the project and the amount of work which has been done. Rather than list out individual items as I have been, please take a look at that project, and come chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> if you'd like to contribute.

<a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass">Seaglass</a>, the MacOS-native client, now has <a href="https://bintray.com/neilalexander/Seaglass/Seaglass#files">automatically generated builds available on bintray</a>.
<p>Seaglass is now a very usable and stable client on macOS. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">neilalexander</a> has been very active this week:</p>
<blockquote>Seaglass has had various updates, including the groundwork for joining and leaving channels, LOADS of crashes fixed, some more work done on avatars and E2E encryption has been fairly well road-tested now

<blockquote>Quaternion has gained a new way to highlight mentions - with tinted background instead of colored text. Also, the majority of work on rooms grouping is done, and the current master branch features the roomlist grouped by tag (but rooms under each tag are pretty much out of order so it's not really ready for daily use yet).</blockquote>

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> is continuing to make progress on his Java-focused collection of APIs and SDKs, he's eagerly awaiting the r0 release of the spec (aren't we all!)
<blockquote>Jeon (https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon) (client2server and application api) has released on the Maven Central Repository with version 0.4.1. The next goal: the stable release of all apis 1.0.0 after the Matrix spec will be released (I hope it will be soon :))
Jmsdk (https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk) the client and bot SDK have released on the Maven Central Repository.
Gene (https://github.com/ma1uta/gene) the lightweight api for android has released on Maven Central Repository with 0.2.1 version.
So, everyone can use this libraries without additional settings and additional repositories.
Matrix-Jabber-Bridge (https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-jabber-java-bridge) the double-pupped bridge between the Matrix and Jabber. I am still working on it and I think it will be released in a few weeks.</blockquote>
<h3 id="rubysdkv003">Ruby SDK v0.0.3</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/ananace/">Ananace</a> has tagged and released the next development version of the <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby Matrix SDK</a> - 0.0.3. He has plans to "finish up documentation and unit testing", with the aim of making a v1.0.0 release.
<h3 id="mautrixappservicego">mautrix-appservice-go</h3>
<a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has a new, yet-to-be-revealed project, and in support of this he's been working again on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-appservice-go">mautrix-appservice-go</a>:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-appservice-go">mautrix-appservice-go</a> is a bit more active again: it now has an initial intent API similar to the one in <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-appservice-python">mautrix-appservice-python</a> (which in turn is based on the intent API from matrix-appservice-bridge).</blockquote>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
No release this week, but Synapse has been progressing:
<ul>
 	<li>Python 3 port continues at pace, we expect to have a beta to test in monolith mode rsn (Hawkowl leads this)</li>
 	<li>Erik has been working on some federation API refactoring to make matrix.org snappier and hopes to have the new state resolution algo ready to go if not deployed late next week</li>
 	<li>Richvdh has been looking at performance, as well as spec PRs/ Next week will be r0 work</li>
</ul>
Many Synapse maintainers are also doing huge lifts on development of the spec.
<h2 id="matrixsupportnowinntfy">Matrix support now in ntfy</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> took a rare 30-minute window away from bridge maintenance to add Matrix support to <a href="https://github.com/dschep/ntfy">ntfy</a>. ntfy describes itself as
<blockquote>A utility for sending notifications, on demand and when commands finish</blockquote>
but in fact, you also send notifications whenever you like by calling <code>ntfy send</code> from anywhere you'd normally execute shell commands. This will make it really easy to integrate Matrix notifications into any other application!
<h2 id="matrixdockeransibledeploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> brought updates to matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> got a lot of improvements lately:

 	<li>email-sending support, so that Matrix Synapse can send email notifications (enabled by default)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd">mxisd</a> Identity Server support (enabled by default)</li>
 	<li>more detailed <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/README.md">docs</a> split into various sections (used to be a single README, but with more and more features it was turning into a wall of text)</li>

Non-Matrix-related aside: as a lazy Brit, I was vaguely aware of the cultural weight language carries in the history of Scandinavia, but didn't realise that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language#Bokm%C3%A5l_and_Nynorsk">Norway still has some fundamental differences</a> ongoing.

As part of an overhaul of the documentation surrounding Matrix, I'm planning to launch a "Community Guides Index". This will be a page or section on Matrix.org with links to useful and informative documentation hosted elsewhere. If you have or know of informative articles, please <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">let me know</a>, or share them in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#TWIM:matrix.org</a>.

<h3 id="quaternionnewredactedmessagehandlingoptions">Quaternion: new redacted message handling options</h3>
Many of you will have seen the incredible volumes of spam plaguing Freenode over the last few weeks. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">Kitsune</a> has added new features to <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> to help:
<blockquote>In response to the recent spam deluge from Freenode Quaternion has got an option to tidy up your timeline after all the spam-cleaning: you can hide all redacted messages or just those that came from recently joined users (along with the join message). So as long as the spammer gets moderated, it can become inexistent for you.
The experimental code doing that will eventually be moved to <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> for the benefit of <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/matrique-go">Matrique</a>, <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a> and other clients based on the library.</blockquote>
This is especially cool: moving functionality to the lib for the benefit of other projects makes me very happy. :D

Big updates are on the horizon for both iOS and Android, with 0.7.0 of iOS headed to TestFlight today with a release due once it's through beta &amp; AppStore review.  More details once the releases are out!
<p>Meanwhile on Riot/Web, Lazy Loading members is pretty much complete - just writing end-to-end tests to ensure that encryption still works well when lazy loading is enabled.  Next up is actually progressing the redesign at last!</p>

Not strictly this week, but we missed it before. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> has been working away on his Java-based Matrix suite. <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/gene">Gene</a> is a more lightweight API implementation than <a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">Jeon</a>, covering all of the current C2S spec. A big motivation is to be able to use Gene on Android, which is not possible for Jeon due to it having more dependencies.

<h2 id="informoprojectreleasessaltstackstates">Informo project releases SaltStack states</h2>
vabd, from the <a href="https://github.com/Informo/">Informo</a> project, arrived to say they have produced "a set of SaltStack states that includes deploying fully working Synapse homeservers: <a href="https://github.com/Informo/salt-states">https://github.com/Informo/salt-states</a>"
<p>They introduce the Informo project:</p>
<blockquote>Informo's a project (still a work in progress, currently) that aims at bypassing censorship of information on the Internet, by basically having news items go through a decentralised and federated network made of Matrix homeservers. Since we need to host nodes to this network (at least for testing purposes), we've worked on a working and automated infrastructure using <a href="https://saltstack.com/salt-open-source/">SaltStack</a>, which involved hand-writing a few SaltStack states, including states handling the installation and configuration of working Synapse homeservers. In the spirit of giving back to the community, we're publishing all of those hand-written states (available at the GH link above) under the GPLv3 license. If you want to discuss with us about what we're doing, or this topic specifically, please join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discuss:weu.informo.network">#discuss:weu.informo.network</a> ?
The project is still pretty much a WIP and the technical specifics (even the ones we already implemented in our projects) are still under discussion and subject to changes (as mentioned in the GH repo's readme). All I can add for sure to what we already say is that we'll be working in partnership with NGOs to promote the project in countries where the press is heavily censored, and we're planning on implementing a cryptographic verification chain of some sort to reduce the risk of intentional disinformation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The release focuses on performance, notable highlights include reducing CPU consumption through speeding up state delta calculations and reducing I/O through lazily loading state on the master process
Separately work continues on our python 3 port and we hope to have something concrete to trial very soon – we're really excited about this and expect step change improvements in CPU and memory use.</blockquote>
Latest synapse is now available on Debian thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrew:shadura.me">andrewsh</a>.
<h2 id="roomtagging">Room Tagging</h2>
This is not from this week at all, other than that it was new information to me. Actually it's ancient, matrix-wise, but I think it's interesting for those who don't know! Although Riot doesn't have an interface for adding custom room tags ("Favourites" and "Low Priority" come by default), Matrix supports arbitrary strings as room tags, and will display them if you add them via another CS API call. To facilitate this <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> created <a href="https://gist.github.com/turt2live/697d5b3781fb7ab7e11d704ea90e3dbe">a small script, tag_room.sh</a>, which makes it very simple to set your own room tags.
<h2 id="fin">FIN</h2>

            <p>Folks, it's release time, Synapse 0.33.2 has landed.</p>
<p>The release focuses on performance, notable highlights include reducing CPU consumption through speeding up state delta calculations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3592">#3592</a>) and reducing I/O through lazily loading state on the master process (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3579">#3579</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3581">#3581</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3582">#3582</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3584">#3584</a>)</p>
<p>Separately work continues on our python 3 port and we hope to have something concrete to trial very soon - we're really excited about this and expect step change improvements in CPU and memory use.</p>
<p>Finally we have some ground work for upcoming room membership lazy loading, there is nothing to see here as yet, but rest assured we will make a lot of noise as soon as it is ready. Stay tuned.</p>

<h2 id="updatesonircbridgesfromhalfshot">Updates on IRC bridges from Half-Shot</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has been working tirelessly on the IRC bridge lately, so I wanted to update on his recent successes:
<blockquote>I've recently been working on mitigating the effects of a netsplit on the IRC bridge, and optimising it to start and run faster. This week I trimmed down the heap usage (where the memory usually goes) to just under a gigabyte on my 10,000 matrix user test bridge. Previously it could spike to as much as 3.5GB. This optimisation is still in a testing phase but results are looking positive.</blockquote>
For reference here is the memory usage of the Freenode process during startup:
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-current.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3445" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-current.png" alt="" width="853" height="268" /></a></p>
<p>And here are the results of my local test bridge before and after the change:</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-before.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3446" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-before.png" alt="" width="860" height="385" /></a></p>

<p>We also made some internal changes to the appservice-bridge to cache the joined state of all the bridge users and therefore avoiding joining rooms which saves us some time on startup.</p>

<a href="/blog/2018/08/02/security-update-synapse-0-33-1/">Synapse 0.33.1</a> is out now as a security update release. Please update if you haven't already - it fixes two issues concerning event visibility where if you knew the event ID of an event you could read it even if you didn't have access to it; we don't believe these have been exploited in the wild, but you will definitely want to upgrade now.
<p>Meanwhile the Python 3 port is progressing well (all sytests now pass in Python 3, i think!), and intrepid folks are starting to experiment with running it in production.</p>
<h2>Decentralised Web Summit &amp; Matrix Live</h2>
Meanwhile, Matthew &amp; Amandine have been in San Francisco for the 2018 <a href="https://decentralizedweb.net">Decentralised Web Summit</a> - so this week's Matrix Live is live from SFO and gives a quick overview of the sort of things we got up to!  Some of the sessions are already online thanks to the (somewhat unreliable) live stream (e.g. here's Muneeb (Blockstack), Amandine, Danielle (Dat), and Zooko (Zcash) talking about their respective governance models &amp; growing pains over the last 2 years: <a href="https://youtu.be/tsz3ffrJDpw?t=12133">https://youtu.be/tsz3ffrJDpw?t=12133</a>).  The summit was a massive success, with lots of discussions about decentralised reputation, UI/UX for decentralised apps, metadata-resistance, the balance of P2P versus decentralised-servers, etc.  Hopefully some of the conversations we had will result in some major improvements to Matrix in the future!
<p>Edit: <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-01-DWeb-1.pdf">Here are the slides</a> for our &quot;<a href="https://decentralizedwebsummit2018.sched.com/event/Fhlb/workshop-diving-into-decentralized-communication">Diving into Decentralised Communication</a>&quot; workshop, for those interested in a comparison between Matrix/SSB/Mastodon/Status/Vuvuzela/Briar.  They're pretty minimal, as they just formed a framework for discussion, but might still be of interest.</p>

            <p>Following on from the previous post, we have an update from zil0 on his <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6091058287476736/#5468043765874688">GSoC project</a>, which entailed implementing E2E support in the Matrix Python SDK.</p>
<hr />
<p>The goal of my project is to implement Matrix's end-to-end encryption protocol in Python, as part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a>. My mentors are Richard van der Hoff (richvdh) and Hubert Chathi (uhoreg).</p>
<p>It was easy to get started on the project, since the simple parts came first (adding API calls), and then the whole process to follow is documented in an <a href="/docs/guides/e2e_implementation.html">implementation guide</a>, while there is also the reference implementation in JavaScript. And most importantly, the community is nice. :)</p>
<p>Some parts of the work consist in wrapping around the cryptographic primitives implemented in <a href="https://git.matrix.org/git/olm/">libolm</a> (via <a href="https://github.com/poljar/python-olm">Python bindings</a>), in order to handle encrypted events. Others are less straightforward, such as tracking device lists of users, or finding the right way to persist keys and related data between startups.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of this project is that I am working on a new part of the Python SDK, while also having to integrate with existing code, which is a cool balance between freedom and guidelines.</p>
<p>As the encryption documentation is a bit outdated and incomplete, one (fun) difficulty is to look for information across old issues, Gdocs and source code (and asking my mentor when in doubt). For anyone trying to implement E2E, it should be better by the end of the project, as I am currently working on documenting the missing bits.</p>
<p>I have had a great experience so far. Working on an open source project differs from my previous coding experiences, as people are actually going to use what I write! I have learnt to think about the best design from a usability point of view, discuss different approaches, and I had to write tests and document my code, which sadly is not something I do on personal projects. I enjoyed reviews, and the discussions they led to. And of course I have learnt quite an interesting lot about the E2E voodoo, along with some new Python tricks.</p>
<p>Currently, the implementation is in a working state. Some of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+author%3AZil0">code</a> is merged, and some is awaiting review. It is possible to try it <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk/issues/100#issuecomment-402508438">here</a> before everything is merged.
The project will be finished in about one week, after some tidying up and when I release device verification and key sharing, which should be the last missing features compared to Riot.</p>

            <p>As you may know, for the last few months anoa (Andrew) and APWhiteHat have been working on Dendrite, the next generation Matrix homeserver, written in Go. We asked for an update on their progress, and Andrew provided the blog post below. Serious progress has been made on Dendrite this summer!</p>
<p> </p>
<hr />
<p>Hey everyone, my name is Andrew Morgan and I've been working full-time over the summer on Dendrite, our next-generation Matrix homeserver. Over the last two months, I've seen the project transform from a somewhat functioning toy server to a near-production-ready homeserver that is working towards complete feature support. I've appreciated the thought put into the project since day one, and enjoy the elegance of the multi-component design. Documentation is fairly decent at the moment, but comments are plentiful throughout the codebase, while the code itself tends towards simple and maintainable rather than complex and unmanageable.</p>
<h2>Application Service Integration
</h2>
The main focus of my time here has been on the implementation of application service support for Dendrite. Application services are external programs that act as privileged extensions to a homeserver, allowing such functionality as bots in rooms and bridges to third-party networks. Supporting application services requires a few different bits and pieces to be set up. Currently all planned features have a PR for them, with the bold items already merged:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Sending events to application services</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Support user masquerading for events</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Support editing event timestamps</strong></li>
 	<li>Support room alias querying</li>
 	<li>Support user ID querying
</li>
 	<li>Support third party lookup proxying
</li>
</ul>
As you can see a decent portion of the functionality is already in master! The rest will hopefully follow after some further back and forth.
<h2>Google Summer of Code
</h2>
I certainly haven't been going at this all on my own. Alongside extensive help from Erik, who's been mentoring me, our resident Google Summer of Code student, APWhiteHat, has been tackling feature after feature in Dendrite wherever he can find them. Application services received a good deal of help on client-server endpoint authentication side, however, APWhiteHat has mostly been focusing on federation and some other very useful pieces. While his GSoC period still has a week or so before its conclusion, he has so far implemented:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Idempotency to roomserver event processing to prevent duplication
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Username auto generation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Tokens library based on macaroons
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Lots of left-over federation stuff: state API &amp; get missing events being the major ones
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">AS support to clientapi auth
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Typing server: handling of PUT /typing by clientapi
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">More typing server stuff on its way
</li>
</ul>
From my perspective, APWhiteHat was an excellent developer to work with. He asked good questions and was quick to answer any myself or the community had as well. His code reviews were also very comprehensive. I learned a lot from working with him and everyone else :)
<h2>OpenTracing and Prometheus Monitoring
</h2>
Placing any large server into a production environment requires extensive monitoring capabilities in order to ensure operations are running smoothly. To that effect, Dendrite has been both the addition of OpenTracing and Prometheus support. Prometheus, also used heavily in Synapse, allows a homeserver operator to track a wide range of data including endpoint usage, resource management as well as user statistics over any given range of time.
<p>In Dendrite, we are taking this one step further by introducing <a href="https://opentracing.io/">OpenTracing</a>, a language and platform-agnostic framework for tracking the journey of an endpoint call from incoming request to outgoing response, with every method, hierarchy change and database call in between. It will be immensely useful in tracking down performance issues, as well as providing insight into the most critical paths throughout the codebase and where we should focus most of our optimization efforts on. It also comes with a lovely dashboard courtesy of <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/">Jaeger</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image1.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3432" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image1-1024x527.png" alt="" width="1024" height="527" /></a></p>
<h2>Community
</h2>
We've also seen some encouraging interest and development work from the community in the past couple months. While PR review from our own side is admittedly slow due to our focus on getting the foundational work in place, that hasn't stopped both old and new developers from sending in PRs and performing code reviews. A huge thank you to everyone involved! From this we've gotten API implementations and application service fixes from @turt2live, <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1022887733931520001">an end-to-end encryption implementation from @fadeAce</a>, filtering support from @CromFr, and some PRs and numerous helpful review comments from @krombel.
<p>We've also started to see some people running Dendrite in live environments, which is incredibly exciting for us to see! While Dendrite is not considered production-ready yet (though it moves closer every day), if you are interested in giving it a go please consult the quickstart <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/INSTALL.md">installation guide</a>. We look forward to any feedback you may have!</p>

As you may know, the <a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee/FAQBot">FAQBot</a>, created and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee">Coffee</a>, uses try-matrix-now for it's data, so Coffee updated the bot to start to use some of the new fields.<br /><blockquote>The final puzzle piece needed for FAQBot has been put into place: https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/extract-web-to-org<br />This is the bit that grabs "Try Matrix Now!" and turns it into questions that FAQBot can use.<br />While I was working on that bit of code anyway, I also added support for the new 'home', 'repo', 'room' and 'language' fields. FAQBot will now give more and better information accordingly. For example, it is now possible to ask, "where is the Riot Android source code?" although it is generally better to just ask "where can I find Riot Android?" which combines several fields into a single answer.<br />4 of 7 items are now completed: https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/FAQBot/issues/2<br />and the remaining 3 items before FAQBot's release are just the final review and integration tests.</blockquote>
<h2 id="newdiscordbridgemaintainer">New Discord Bridge Maintainer</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has been working stridently on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">Discord Bridge</a> lately, and the project has now attracted a second maintainer:
<blockquote>We've got a new member of the maintainer crew in discord bridge land (bringing the total count to 2.) I'd like to welcome Sorunome :). They are going to be helping review the influx of PRs, chew some issues and be a point of contact in the community. They've already filled my PR queue up and it's going to help us move even faster!</blockquote>
In other Bridge news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> 1.5.0 is out now, uses the latest matrix-js-sdk and matrix-appservice-node, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/master/CHANGES.md">contains a lot of changes</a>.
<h2 id="brunounittests">Bruno unit tests</h2>
Bruno, the latest and greatest addition to the [riot-web] team, has been working on configuring end to end unit tests. His scripts now install synapse from the metal, install riot and then run a test suite. Take a look at the animation below to get the idea!

<h2 id="fractal3295">Fractal 3.29.5</h2>
<a href="@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre Franke</a> tells us about new features in Fractal 3.29.5, and how the project has benefited from <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a> contributors:
<blockquote>Fractal got a big new release 3.29.5, which includes Eisha's multi-line input (with markdown syntax highlighting) and Julian's room details redesign, as well as his refactor on avatar code which leads to a perf boost.</blockquote>
<h2 id="ananacegrafanawebhookformatrixnotifications">Ananace: Grafana webhook for Matrix notifications</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/ananace/">Ananace</a>, always working on sysadmin tooling with matrix, comes back with a new tool: <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-grafana-matrix">Grafana webhook for Matrix notifications</a>. This release is described as "the very first 'It doesn't crash instantly' version", but this is surely a useful project.

<h2 id="quaternionlibqmatrixclientsupportlocalecho">Quaternion / libQMatrixClient support local echo</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> had a surprising week while working on his QMatrix projects:
<blockquote>/me accidentally found a year-old feature branch in his Git and thought of rebasing it in order to <em>eventually</em> continue working on it. As a result, libQMatrixClient and Quaternion master branches support local echo from today. Too bad the same trick doesn't work for E2EE.</blockquote>
Too bad indeed!
