<h3 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h3>
<p>Huge update from Andrew:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week‚Äôs stats for Dendrite are in! <strong>4 authors</strong> have pushed <strong>11 commits</strong> to master and <strong>11 commits</strong> to all branches. On master, <strong>48 files</strong> have changed and there have been <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/compare/master@%7B1564757067%7D...master">676 additions and 146 deletions</a>.</p>
<p>Of note are the following merged PRs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/693">Implement client single event retrieval - #671</a>
<ul>
<li>You can now request a single event from Dendrite‚Äôs DB, assuming you have permission to view it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/513">Account data events filtering database API</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/438">State events filtering database api</a>
<ul>
<li>Very old PRs from CromFR have been updated and finally merged! These lay the groundwork for providing filters across various API endpoints (used in search, /sync, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/692">Add typingserver service to docker-compose</a>
<ul>
<li>Another fairly old PR by <a href="https://github.com/viccuad">viccuad</a> (their first for Dendrite!) finally reviewed and merged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/706">Fix permission and 404 response for alias deletion - #654</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/774">Replace membership and visibility values with constants</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/726">Implement profile retrieval over federation - fixes #651</a> (this one is very useful), and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/772">Fix transaction IDs in transaction cache have global scope</a>
<ul>
<li>A myriad of changes and fixes by cnly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have a number of PRs that were moved forward but not merged. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/405">Add auth fallback endpoint</a> (our oldest PR at the moment!) which we mentioned last week is so very close, but not quite there in time for this TWIM.</p>
<p>In terms of passing Sytests, Dendrite now passes <strong>172 tests</strong>, up from <strong>167</strong> last week. This is out of <strong>761 tests</strong> in total. So just a small bump (0.6%), but note that things that are crucial for Dendrite development at the moment, such as federating, only cover a small subset of tests, so each passing one can bring us much closer to getting Dendrite usable day-to-day.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>From Neil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The big news this week we‚Äôve landed some massive DB improvements (https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/5706) which should make message sending on matrix.org (and any other server) feel noticeably snappier. :) It'll be in the next release.</p>
<p>Outside of perf, we‚Äôve also been continuing with our privacy project, sydent now supports hashing third party identifiers instead of storing the raw form, and in the coming week we‚Äôll look at minimising the meta data we store. You can track our progress across the full project here (<a href="https://vector-im.github.io/feature-dashboard/#/plan?label=privacy-sprint&amp;repo=matrix-org/synapse&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-web&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-ios&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-android&amp;repo=vector-im/riotX-android&amp;repo=matrix-org/matrix-doc&amp;repo=matrix-org/sydent">https://vector-im.github.io/feature-dashboard/#/plan?label=privacy-sprint&amp;repo=matrix-org/synapse&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-web&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-ios&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-android&amp;repo=vector-im/riotX-android&amp;repo=matrix-org/matrix-doc&amp;repo=matrix-org/sydent</a>)</p>
<p>Work continues on our installer to make it easier to configure Synapse and we‚Äôll be looking for some community feedback rsn. The room directory revamp is now very close and we hope to have something live on matrix.org in about a week.</p>
<p>Finally we‚Äôre working on improving the efficiency of smaller instances sending messages into large rooms, we‚Äôre still at the design stage, but it will make a huge difference for anyone self hosting.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you fancy running highly experimental software on your homeserver which might break things, I have two things for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-key-server">matrix-key-server</a> ( #matrix-key-server:t2bot.io ) is an implementation of a Matrix key server with notary support. Although it follows the specification, it has not been tested against Synapse. It is however fully featured: check it out on the federation tester ( <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/#keys.t2host.io">https://federationtester.matrix.org/#keys.t2host.io</a> ) or by querying it yourself ( <a href="https://keys.t2host.io/_matrix/key/v2/query/matrix.org">https://keys.t2host.io/_matrix/key/v2/query/matrix.org</a> ).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-room-directory-server">matrix-room-directory-server</a> ( #matrix-room-directory:t2bot.io ) is less experimental than the key server but is still very early days. Currently it only offers the ability to manipulate the federated public room directory for your server, but in future it is planned to be its own standalone directory server (room aliases without having to run a whole homeserver). Check it out by searching the t2bot.io room directory from your client.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been making big updates to two of his bridges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> can now bridge formatting, mentions, replies and reactions in both directions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also a logout command now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>'s switch to <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python">mautrix-python</a> is nearly finished (i.e. it didn't cause any errors for the past few days when testing in production). The main reason for the switch is using one Matrix library for all my python bridges. It also means the bridging code like double puppeting and command handling I shared between mautrix-facebook and mautrix-hangouts is now also used in mautrix-telegram.</p>
<p>Visible changes directly caused by using mautrix-python:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logs are now colorful.</li>
<li>Python 3.5 is no longer supported.</li>
<li>The bridge will refuse to start without access to the base config file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes that happened during the switch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telegram &quot;Saved Messages&quot; can now be bridged even when using double puppeting.</li>
<li>Mentions on Telegram are marked as read when using double puppeting (messages were already being marked as read, but mentions weren't).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, this actually happened last week and the week before that, but anyway: I've moved the CI and docker registry of my active projects to a self-hosted GitLab at <a href="https://mau.dev">mau.dev</a>.
Specifically, the CI/docker registry for all four mautrix bridges and maubot and automatic builds for gomuks have been moved. My maubot plugins also have automatic .mbp builds in the CI. For the docker registry, prepending <code>dock.mau.dev/</code> to the existing image names will work.
The old places (docker hub, dl.maunium.net) won't get new builds anymore. The repos on GitHub are still the &quot;canonical&quot; repos, but they're mirrored more or less instantly with <a href="https://github.com/tulir/maumirror">maumirror</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> will probably get some sort of history filling in the near-ish future</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm going to add some way to put bridged rooms into personal communities for filtering purposes. Not yet sure if it'll be fully built into the bridges or some kind of an external script</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've just released <a href="https://github.com/devture/email2matrix">Email2Matrix</a> - an SMTP server that can relay incoming messages over to Matrix based on mappings defined in a configuration file.</p>
<p>While it can also be installed standalone and work with any Matrix homeserver (see its documentation), the simplest way to install it is using <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-email2matrix.md">guide for Email2Matrix installation</a>.</p>
<p>The configuration process (users, rooms, mappings) is quite manual, but it's simple and has worked well for me for the past year and a half.
I've only just polished it up a bit, released and integrated with the Ansible playbook, so others could benefit from it too.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@progserega:rsprim.ru">progserega</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I develop matrix Bot, which converting voice messages to text. It use Yandex Speech API and Yandex API cloud (some as aws) for temporary store voice-data before converting. <a href="https://github.com/progserega/voice2textMatrix">https://github.com/progserega/voice2textMatrix</a>
Bot have such logic:</p>
<ol>
<li>user add bot to room (for example room with whatsapp bridge users - now bridge support adding bot to such rooms)</li>
<li>bot listen room, and when get voice-message - send it to Yandex-cloud for translate (now support only Russian language).</li>
<li>When translating is success - bot get result text and show it in room as notice, such: &quot;Username said: text&quot;</li>
<li>Bot also receive some command, which allow disable it in this room, or disable translating for user, which send command..</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing this, I wondered, &quot;y tho?&quot;, luckily progserega was able to explain with a graphic! They say a picture paints a thousand words, and it's clear from the conversation below why he'd want to have speech-to-text capabilities.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@joepie91:pixie.town">joepie91</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lots of news about <a href="https://neo.pixie.town/app/">Neo</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li>There's now an additional maintainer (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@joepie91:pixie.town">joepie91</a>)!</li>
<li>A lot of the internals have been refactored, so they should be more maintainable and reliable going forward. Also some future work planned on refactoring the state handling using Redux, which should make it <em>much</em> faster to fix issues and add new features in the future. There are even some ideas already for a future plugin API!</li>
<li>Display has been improved in a lot of places. Error messages are now more clearly formatted, images in reply-quotes are now shown as thumbnails rather than just a filename, and the reply-to popup now shows the full event that you're replying to properly. The chat window now correctly sticks to the bottom when you're scrolled to the end and receive new messages, even when an image or video loads - though per-room scroll position restoration isn't done yet.</li>
<li>There's now an experimental compact mode! It uses a more IRC-client-like layout for messages, and generally just fits more content onto the screen. It can be enabled with an <a href="https://git.pixie.town/neo/neo#experimental-features">experimental flag</a>. A screenshot of the compact mode can be found <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2dLyQ49.png">here</a>.</li>

            <p>Today we release Synapse 1.2.1 as a critical security update. It contains patches relating to redactions and event federation. The patches address long standing bugs, and are not regressions specific to the previous version (1.2).  <strong>All admins, regardless of current version, should upgrade asap</strong>.</p>
<p>This release includes <em>four</em> security fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent an attack where a federated server could send redactions for arbitrary events in v1 and v2 rooms. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5767">#5767</a>)</li>
<li>Prevent a denial-of-service attack where cycles of redaction events would make Synapse spin infinitely. Thanks to <code>@lrizika:matrix.org</code> for identifying and responsibly disclosing this issue. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/0f2ecb961">0f2ecb961</a>)</li>
<li>Prevent an attack where users could be joined or parted from public rooms without their consent. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dylangerdaly">Dylanger</a> for identifying and responsibly disclosing this issue. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5744">#5744</a>)</li>
<li>Fix a vulnerability where a federated server could spoof read-receipts from
users on other servers. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dylangerdaly">Dylanger</a> for identifying this issue too. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5743">#5743</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the following fix was in Synapse <strong>1.2.0</strong>, but was not correctly
identified during the original release:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was possible for a room moderator to send a redaction for an <code>m.room.create</code> event, which would downgrade the room to version 1. Thanks to <code>@/dev/ponies:ponies.im</code> for identifying and responsibly disclosing this issue! (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5701">#5701</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>We had a great demo session this afternoon, unfortunately the recording quality for some of the items was not good enough to share - and it was interesting stuff too! I cut everything from the RiotX and Riot iOS sections - but we'll make it up to you by getting more news from those projects soon.</p>

<p>Matthew informed the community:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're getting more and more folks reaching out for paid help setting up smaller self-hosted Matrix deployments. The core team has its hands full currently with helping out with larger deployments; so if anyone reading this wants to offer paid support to those getting up and running on Matrix then please make us aware so we can potentially route inquiries to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great step for Matrix, and a great opportunity for you the reader! There are already several people prepared to start work on Matrix-related endeavours, but the fact that there is <em>more work coming in than we can currently route</em> is amazing. If you'd like to be on an informal shortlist, <a href="mailto:support@matrix.org">contact support@</a>, or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">come chat to me directly</a>.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>So said Neil, who oversees the Synapse-makers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we shipped two new versions, 1.2 (<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/25/synapse-1-2-0-released">https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/25/synapse-1-2-0-released</a>) and 1.2.1(<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/26/critical-security-update-synapse-1-2-1-released">https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/26/critical-security-update-synapse-1-2-1-released</a>). 1.2.1 contains critical security updates, the bugs are long lived and not regressions introduced in 1.2 so all admins are encouraged to upgrade asap.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also been having some success in improving database performance and hope to ship that rsn so everyone can benefit.</p>
<p>Next week</p>
<p>We‚Äôll continue on db perf, improving logging verbosity (through recategorising some log lines) and generally looking to improve the experience for those admins running on smaller instances.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The GSoc project ‚ÄúMatrix Visualisations‚Äù has continued its progression during the second period:</p>
<p>A ‚Äúmulti-view‚Äù has been implemented for the frontend application. It means that it is now possible to independently view multiple DAGs at the same time in the same canvas. It can be useful for observing the same DAG but on different HS‚Äôs, at the same time. The only current limitation is that you have to use the same backend for every view (with CS API or with the backend talking to a Synapse PostgreSQL database). This change took a long time as it required to make a lot of changes in the code.</p>
<p>The implementation of the support of the Federation API within the backend is in progress. It is slowly progressing as it needed some discussion before starting the work on it and its implementation requires me to become familiar with a lot of new things, regarding the federation process and the authentication of requests between HS‚Äôs.</p>

<p>I've been playing with Pattle 0.10 and have to say, it feels silky smooth to scroll with. It's really making me look again at Flutter development.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a>, project lead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version has been pushed to F-droid and TestFlight!</p>
<p>Note that for TestFlight the new version will be available in a few days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve scrolling through chat messages!
<ul>
<li>Messages are now paginated under the hood, before the whole message list was rebuild when loading more messages, causing a jittery scrolling experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support typing notifications!
<ul>
<li>Typing notifications are shown and send while typing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add chat settings screen
<ul>
<li>Currently you can see the chat name, avatar, description and members. More will be added in the future.</li>
<li>You can go to the chat settings screen by clicking on the title of the chat. This'll probably change in the future (at least to be easier).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reverse swipe direction of images (thanks Nathan!)</li>
<li>Fix ripple not showing on send button</li>
<li>Make UI refreshing more efficient</li>
<li>The App Store (iOS) name is now 'Pattle' instead of 'Pattle IM'</li>
<li>When a chat is open, the UI will only be rebuild if <em>that</em> chat has updates.</li>
<li>Lot's of code clean ups and improvements, mostly in the SDK</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What's coming up?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A release on Google Play!</li>
<li>A release on the official F-droid repo!</li>
<li>Remove Cupertino specific styling on iOS
<ul>
<li>Will now use Material Design, but altered for iOS. Having the discrepancy between Cupertino and Material was also the reason why some things didn't show up in iOS or why some things would be blue instead of the Pattle red.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@SolarDrew:matrix.org">SolarDrew</a> and I have been working on re-writing our <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/skill-picard">Picard Bot</a> for a conference next week. Picard helps you bridge between a slack team and a matrix community.</p>
<p>This second version of Picard adds support for reacting to creation of new rooms on slack in real time as well as implementing a set of commands for creating new bridged rooms from either matrix or slack. In addition to this, Picard has matrix commands for inviting you to all the bridged rooms in the communtiy and automatically inviting you to new rooms as they are created. Finally, we have added support for sending welcome messages to all new members of your slack team or matrix community in a DM with the bot, which we are using to explain the chat setup to users and giving them a private place to issue commands.</p>
<p>This is uses <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/skill-picard">matrix-appservice-slack</a> for actually sending events in bridged rooms, and PIcard itself is a skill for the <a href="https://opsdroid.readthedocs.io/">opsdroid</a> bot framework #opsdroid-general:matrix.org  and uses the <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/database-matrix/">matrix-database</a> plugin for opsdroid which uses matrix room state to back the opsdroid memory.</p>

<p>It's all coming together now. While all pieces of the puzzle were roughly there, now they are put into the big picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/pull/111">bridge SDK PR</a> has been merged to develop, now providing bridges the benefit of error reporting. The modifications to the SDK are non-breaking, but activation of the feature requires small changes to the bridge using it. But be warned, everything is still under an unstable prefix and rightly so ‚Äì the implementation is still subject to change.
&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The MSC didn't get much love in public, but the concepts required to evolve it are taking shape. It was contemplated to piggyback on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1410">MSC 1410: Rich Bridging</a> and to add a retry mechanism. So heads up for more to come on this front.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3246">display of bridge errors</a> in Riot Web is now a PR and in the state of getting its last few kinks removed. It will start to be available under a lab flag soon.</p>
<p>With everything getting to play together nicely, there will be the first rooms enabling bridge errors to test the code in the wild. Stabilizing the code for everyday use and getting the MSC into a respectable form are the next goals for the project. Those will help in fostering broader adoption among bridges and clients.</p>

        <div>
            <p>It was drawn to our attention this afternoon that there is a bug in our GDPR data portability tooling that resulted in the data dump including some events that should not have been included.</p>
<p>This tooling has recently been updated (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/baf081cd3b040926e2d14dfd1c555307bba59245/synapse/handlers/admin.py#L98">here is the new code</a>), and the bug only affects reports generated with the updated tool. So far we have generated one report using the updated tooling.</p>
<p>The bug affects events which:</p>
<ul>
<li>were sent in rooms in which, at the point at which the message was sent, the message visibility was set to 'shared' or 'world readable', and</li>
<li>were pulled in over federation from another server after the data subject left the room</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, 'shared' message visibility means <em>anyone in the room can view the message, from the point in time at which visibility was set to 'shared'</em> and 'world readable' means <em>anyone can read the messages without joining the room, from the point in time at which visibility was set to 'world readable'</em>.</p>
<p>Events are pulled onto a homeserver over federation when a user on that homeserver tries to access events which, for whatever reason, their homeserver does not already have a local copy. This most often happens when their homeserver is offline for any period of time, but can also happen when a user is the first user from their homeserver to join a room with active participants on other homeservers.</p>
<p>We're still analysing the data but so far it looks like the bug resulted in only a small number of events that were not publicly-accessible being shared (there were also publicly-accessible events mistakenly included). At this stage we have identified 19 events from 4 users across 2 rooms (the dump contained ~3.5 million events). This is not to diminish the severity of the bug - just to reassure that the scale of its impact appears to be extremely limited.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that any encrypted events erroneously included in the dump will not have been decryptable (since the data subject would not have had access to the keys).</p>
<h3 id="update-2019-08-06">Update (2019-08-06)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In our original analysis we stated that 19 events were shared erroneously. On closer analysis we missed 5 other timeline events - the correct figure is 24 timeline events originating from 4 users over 2 rooms. However, this figure focused on timeline data and does not take into account all state events (such as user joins, parts, topic changes etc). When considering these too, a further 56 state events were erroneously shared, referencing 64 users across these 2 rooms (mainly detailing when users had joined/left the room after the requesting user themselves had left). These membership events contained avatar &amp; display name details which may not have been public (but in practice, the vast majority appear to be public data).</p>
<p>Aside from the events referenced above, the full dump contained ~20,000 events that also ought not to have been included; however <strong>these events were already publicly accessible due to being part of publicly accessible rooms</strong> (eg Matrix HQ) and so we do not consider them a breach of data.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-caused-the-bug">What caused the bug?</h2>
<p>Events that are pulled in over federation are assigned a negative 'stream ordering' ID. This is designed to avoid their being sent down the sync (where they would likely be out of sequence). In normal operation (accessing your homeserver via a Matrix client) these events would be appropriately filtered, but a bug in the data dump tooling caused them to be included.</p>
<p>The bug was introduced as a result of two factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The event filtering code assumes that the user is currently in the room - this was not intuitive, and was not called out in the documentation</li>
<li>When we fetched the events from the database, we tried to limit to events sent before the user left the room. On reflection, we used the wrong ordering mechanism (stream ordering instead of topological ordering), resulting in the inclusion of events that were fetched from a remote server after the data subject had left</li>
</ul>
<p>We are working to fix the bug, and we'll update here when it is resolved. As a reminder, please do report security bugs responsibly as per the <a href="https://matrix.org/security-disclosure-policy/">Security Disclosure Policy</a> so we can validate the issue and mitigate abuse.</p>
<p>As is standard practice for any data breach, we have notified the ICO.</p>

            <p>As a step towards implementing Terms of Service for Sydent Identity Servers (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2140">MSC2140</a>), we're rolling out a couple of changes to the two Identity Servers run by New Vector (running at vector.im and matrix.org):</p>
<ol>
<li>We have erased all of the data where there is any chance that the data subject didn't understand how, why or with whom their data was being shared.</li>
<li>We've made a change to Sydent so that it no longer persists new associations relating to users on homeservers not run by New Vector.</li>
</ol>
<p>The impact of these changes is that users on homeservers not run by New Vector will no longer be discoverable by their email or telephone number via the Identity Servers running at vector.im and matrix.org. As we roll out the rest of the changes for Terms of Service for Identity Servers, this functionality will again be made available for users who make an informed choice to opt in.</p>
<h2 id="registration-with-email-and-password-reset">Registration with Email and Password Reset</h2>
<p>In the short term, the New Vector Identity Servers will continue to support registration with email (signing up with an email address as well as a matrix username) and password reset. However, as we continue to improve Identity Server data hygiene practices, we will phase out their use in registration with email and password reset entirely. We have already made the change to Synapse to support password reset without relying on an Identity Server (though this can optionally be re-enabled).</p>
<p>Once Synapse can support registration with email without relying on an Identity Server <strong>we will announce a schedule for disabling registration with email and password reset in our Identity Servers entirely</strong>. After this point, homeserver administrators will have to make sure their homeservers are configured to send email to keep registration with email and password reset working. More details on this to follow - please watch this space.</p>

We have a number of community PRs still with active members, but most are waiting for reviews, which <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> is working towards.</p>
<h4 id="the-plan">The Plan</h4>
<p>A couple TWIMs ago we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/05/this-week-in-matrix-2019-07-05">teased</a> that Dendrite had a plan in the works. Well one meeting later and here is the proposal:</p>
<p>It will take a while for Dendrite to become feature complete with Synapse, but we‚Äôd like people to be able to actually use Dendrite before then. Instead of waiting for feature-completeness, we propose a set of milestones for Dendrite development to reach and prioritize development for.</p>
<p>These milestones are currently listed on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/milestones">Dendrite‚Äôs github</a>. The first is ‚ÄúBot Hosting‚Äù, which means, once complete, Dendrite would be suitable as a ‚Äúbot hub‚Äù, allowing server admins to run massive bridges on top of Dendrite while taking advantage of its horizontal-scaling capabilities. As written in the description, this goal includes basic CS API support, as well as federation with other homeservers. At this stage Dendrite should already be usable in rooms with other Synapse servers, which should make it a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>After that is several more milestones, each representing another use case that Dendrite can fill.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt be alarmed at the currently quite small percentage of completeness, as these milestones have just been built from the open issue list. We‚Äôre actually quite far along to #1 already :)</p>
<p>We also want to mention that the milestones aren‚Äôt completely built yet - there‚Äôs still a few more issues to comb through. It‚Äôs taken a few days as <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> can‚Äôt help himself to fix things as he goes along. A few open issues have also been closed as they had already been fixed earlier.</p>
<p>This is all mentioned in this week‚Äôs Matrix Live above by the way, so be sure to catch for some extra details if you‚Äôre interested.</p>
<p>We look forward to shipping you a working Dendrite soon‚Ñ¢. And as always feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!yjVgJUsMLYLAONsoii:jki.re?via=matrix.org&amp;via=privacytools.io&amp;via=ru-matrix.org">#dendrite-dev:matrix.org</a> for discussion.</p>

<p>I've written a <a href="https://github.com/Madic-/Scripts/tree/master/Linux/sendtomatrix">linux shell script</a> with which you can send (multiline) messages to a matrix room. It only needs a username / password or access token, server fqdn and roomid as argument or provided by a configuration file. Arguments can overwrite settings from the file, for e.g. using same credentials but different channel. If no access token is provided, a new one will be requested and used to send the message. You can use the script for e.g. cronjobs, nagios notifications or ci pipelines. An example for a cronjob and a nagios notification script is also provided.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve been looking for a way to have you own Matrix homeserver without having to run it yourself, you may be interested to hear that <a href="https://modular.im">Modular</a> (the Matrix hosting provider run by <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a>, the startup which hires many of the Matrix core team) is now offering a personal-sized small homeserver hosting service, supporting a minimum size of 5 user servers.</p>
<p>A lot of recent performance work on Synapse has been driven by the need to make smaller dedicated servers more efficient to run - and so if you run your own homeserver you‚Äôll be benefiting from all this work too :)  Meanwhile, if you choose to outsource your server hosting to Modular, you‚Äôll be indirectly supporting core Matrix and Synapse development, given most of the core Matrix team work for New Vector - it‚Äôs through buying services like this which lets us keep folks able to hack on Matrix as their day job.</p>
<p>See more details <a href="https://modular.im/personal-hosted-homeservers">over at the Modular blog post</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A bit of everything this week, we‚Äôve made changes to support the upcoming edits and reactions release, worked on soft log out, experimented with improving general perf for small homeservers, landed open tracing support, improved db query load.<br />
Next week we‚Äôll see about landing the small homeserver perf improvements, work on id hashing in sydent, fix some e2ee bugs (made easier to track down with OpenTracing), do some more database performance work and start gradually rolling out the new Sygnal instance.</p>

<p>Jason back on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix, <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">Construct</a> made the crazy-loading mode of client sync the default. Crazy-loading is an approach to initial sync that goes beyond lazy-loading for a better UX. It's even backwards compatible with clients that don't support lazy-loading.</p>
<p>Construct also made significant progress on implementing version 3 and 4 rooms during the week. This is nearly complete, and should be ready for testing by the weekend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good to know there is progress with new room versions as more and more rooms start to be moved over to v4. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#zemos-test:matrix.org">#zemos-test:matrix.org</a> for testing and more info.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Work continues on the major revamp of ruma-events mentioned in the last update.<br />
...<br />
There are also a few modules that are somewhat blocked on an issue in ring. Some of the types in ruma-events contain types from ruma-signatures which don't implement Clone and PartialEq because they contain types from ring which don't.<br />
...<br />
Rust 1.36 was released, and it includes stabilization of the Future trait, one of the long-awaited building blocks for first-class async support in Rust. [...] the biggest reason for Ruma's development hiatus is waiting for async networking in Rust to mature, and this is one of the final pieces of foundational support we've been waiting for. The remaining pieces are async/await syntax, which is expected in either the next version or the one following it, and finally, waiting for important libraries like Hyper and Tokio, as well as web frameworks, to adopt the new stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack">the slack bridge</a> has had another RC release this week 0.3.0-rc2 which has been deployed onto matrix.org :). In other news, we are nearly done with the port of the bridge to Typescript (slated for the 0.4 release) which has allowed us to clean up the codebase significantly and <strong>splat</strong> a lot of bugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm for any movement toward TypeScript - seems to be a winner in the JS-world. Says Half-Shot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm a bit fanatical about Typescript, it's objectively better to write things in TS than JS if you have the freedom to do so. It's also allowed us to keep the bug count down on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">Discord bridge</a>, so I'm starting to look at the other bridges for typescript support too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The new Spec proposal <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2162">MSC2162: Signaling Errors at Bridges</a> landed! It is about adding permanent errors: The ability of bridges to mark events as not delivered to all participants. While there is already code supporting the feature, the Spec process is important for getting everyone on board and finding potential problems with the current approach.</p>
<p>In spite of being a relatively small proposal, there were already a lot of suggestions and directions in which it can evolve. Shoutout and thanks to everyone who already contributed to it with their comments!</p>
<p>Meanwhile on the more practical front a <a href="https://github.com/V02460/matrix-react-sdk/tree/reliable_riot">fork of Riot Web</a> was extended to now support the actual visual display of bridge error markings on messages.</p>

Continuum also loads previews for http image links in text messages automatically. The usual http cache control rules are still followed in those cases.</p>

This release will have reactions and message editing enabled via configuration on riot.im once it stabilises.<br />
Self-hosted installs that wish to do the same would need to alter their config.json in similar fashion. This is because these features currently depend on unstable APIs, and we don't want to move them out of labs and fully on by default until that is resolved.</p>

<p>I had/stole the idea to create a bot which uses message edits to send frames of an ASCII-art animation.

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>'s work on <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> is interesting for bot or other client devs, and there is a new guide available: <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-matrix-bot-sdk">http://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-matrix-bot-sdk</a></p>
