<p>This week has mostly been spent trying to improve stability and to fix bugs ahead of the beta release, which is so far still planned to go ahead in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Room version 6 is now the default for newly created rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soft-fail of events that aren't allowed by the current room state is now implemented</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Federated joins will now continue being processed even if the client gives up on the join due to a HTTP timeout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backoff code has been refactored a bit more, and now correctly affects device list syncing</p>

<p><code>/make_join</code> now errors correctly if a federated user tries to join a room which all members have left</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where a single user could start multiple simultaneous federated joins to the same room has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some initial (but unfinished) support for the <code>/key/v2/query</code> notary endpoint has been added</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signature verification has been updated to not fail if the event <code>origin</code> field is missing (although it still requires a signature from the domain of the <code>sender</code> field)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of places where we use SQL transactions have been updated with safe wrappers (thanks <a href="https://github.com/samcday">samcday</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A couple of error codes on invite endpoints for room version 6 JSON violations have been fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly for federation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 77%, up from 74% last week</p>
</li>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/22/synapse-1-20-0-released">1.20.0</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.1">1.20.1</a>) highlights include shadow banning support and including unread message counts in the sync response. This will help client developers and is a precursor to improving notification support.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also been looking at adding monitoring to get a better sense of which rooms are most expensive from a state resolution perspective, we also want a better way to track federation lag.</p>
<p>Up next we‚Äôll move all background tasks away from the main process and try it out on matrix.org, we are hoping for a 10-15% saving in CPU. Event persistence sharding, specifically the new stream token format is on hold slightly while we work on a nasty race condition on start up of the event persister. We hope to get back to the main sharding project next week.</p>

<h3 id="the-construct">The Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jason:zemos.net">Jason</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix concludes a summer of Construct where several transformative rounds of optimization took place. I'd like to talk about these achievements and why they are important for
future directions.</p>
<p>Over the summer, Construct introduced new vector extensions to the project. As server software, our primary target is the datacenter which (for now) is dominated by x86 hardware. The latest features of x86 chips include AVX-2, AVX-512, and on-die GPU. These advancements are important because they help mitigate current limitations of hardware, such as the cubic relationship between a processor's frequency and its power consumption. These limitations mean that CPU cores aren't completing more cycles-per-second every iteration of their development -- they're not getting much faster.</p>
<p>The problem with threads is that they can introduce a lot of complications to a project. Construct is able to forego multi-threading as a network server because it is primarily IO-bound. The benefits to a single-thread design in both performance and simplicity cannot be overstated. This is why Construct stands to benefit the most from features which allow more work to be accomplished at every individual computing cycle.</p>
<p>Construct undertook several endeavors over the summer which directly leverage platforms featuring SSE, AVX, AVX-512, etc. As an added bonus, our approach is designed to effortlessly port to ARM's Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) as it becomes available (inside datacenters too!). Our focus has been JSON, Unicode, and finally Base64. Detailed explanations for each of these will need to be discussed in their own posts, but in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Matrix specifies a canonical form of JSON which is not necessarily the same as the JSON the server receives. Therefor it is imperative that Construct is liberal with what JSON it accepts and correct with its transformation into canonical JSON. Over the summer, a portion of Construct's canonical transform received some optimization to go beyond the default method of character-by-character read-modify-write. As seen in [1], a streaming hardware-accelerated transform now processes at least 16 characters at a time (with more possible) without forward branching except for the parts where transformation needs to occur. One of these transformations is UTF-16 to UTF-8 surrogate conversion, which leads into the second endeavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construct introduced a completely branch-free Unicode toolset in [2]. Among the functions offered is a custom transform of UTF-16 surrogate pairs to UTF-8 sequences. Using the new vector registers, Construct can transform two UTF-16 surrogates in parallel to output two UTF-8 sequences, or two UTF-16 surrogates in a pair to output one UTF-8 sequence. Unfortunately, these specific functions were written at fixed vector widths, so more work needs to be done to really take advantage of the widest hardware. Each surrogate is 6 bytes, and a surrogate pair is 12 bytes; therefor we cannot make use of the last 4 bytes of a 16 byte vector. However, with a little more work this approach can be extended to a 64 byte vector, capable of decoding 5 surrogate pairs and 10 individual surrogates in parallel!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professor Daniel Lemire recently published a paper about fast Base64 from hardware acceleration in [3]. This approach is extremely elegant on the 64-byte-wide AVX-512 system. Prior to Construct's implementation of this in [4], the Boost library base64 encoding and decoding took roughly 20 and 25 cycles per character respectively. Our implementation on the same system, an old system with only SSE2 (not even AVX-512!) yields 5 and 6 cycles per character!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this helps lay a foundation for Construct to introduce Federated Media Rooms sometime in the future. Currently, Construct stores media in a separate database. Recently there's been work on a separate branch at [5] which stores actual file block inside events using Base64. It is for this reason sub-cycle and branchless JSON parsing and Base64 encoding is essential for maximum performance. The result is worthwhile, as the latency for querying the media database is slower than parsing and decoding the event content already in-hand.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Construct is available at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct</a> and don't forget to idle and perform <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:maunium.net">#construct:maunium.net</a></p>

<p>This week we put out a new release candidate <a href="https://staging.element.io">1.7.8-rc.1</a> highlights include:-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Secure Backup has been moved out of the registration flow to a toast when you first encounter an E2EE room, which simplifies the new user experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added options to hide various UI features when hosting a custom Element
...along with various smaller fixes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from that the work to improve the widget experience continues with modal widget next on the agenda.</p>
<p>Next week we will continue to improve widgets and add some more instrumentation into the app.</p>

<p>Polyjuice Client v0.3.0 has been released.  This release includes many breaking changes.  (&quot;Breaking&quot; in the sense of API changes, rather than the sync process suddenly failing to work, which was already featured in a previous release.)  This release also includes many changes, such as the client managing more bookkeeping, detecting if it got logged out, and supporting more Matrix features.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I present you a new project I've been working on for some time. It's a bot that allows you to use the admin API through matrix, by typing commands to the bot. The inspiration comes from the OperServ-like bots that allow IRC operators to administrate an IRC server.</p>
<p>The bot exposes some of the available admin APIs and aims to provide some more high level commands by combining different APIs. There is currently one &quot;high level command&quot;, <code>!room garbage-collect</code>, which allow you to purge from your HS all rooms without local users.</p>
<p>The project is written in crystal and is my first project in this language. It should be stable in normal conditions, but don't hesitate to fill issues. A Docker image is provided for more convenience.</p>
<p>I hope you will find this project useful üôÇ</p>

<p>Soru made a new thing, <a href="https://gitlab.com/Sorunome/matrix-gotify">matrix-gotify</a>. It is a <a href="https://gotify.net/">gotify</a> plugin to receive matrix notifications. This means, you can now receive matrix push notifications on your android phone self-hosted without the need of google services! That is why putting the full event in the push notification is actually not a privacy leak in this case.</p>
<p>This plugin could also be used to receive push notifications on any other kind of device that gotify supports.</p>
<p>Please note that this is independent of any matrix client - you don't even need to run one to be able to use this!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked whether an <a href="https://bubu1.eu/openpush/">OpenPush</a>-like solution be
built on top of this , and Sorunome responded that someone had already
started working on just that! https://github.com/gotify/android/pull/115</p>
<p>This would allow other matrix clients on your phone to get their push
notifications through your gotify client, instead of needing to run a process
each. Great for battery life without proprietary Google blobs!</p>

<p>I have been through the perils of setting up a TURN server and having VoIP continue to fail, whilst spending hours scratching my head and staring at Wireshark without getting anywhere. When I was given free reign over project choice last year during my internship, I chose to start a tool that tests your homeserver's VoIP configuration, hoping it would be useful to both me and the community at large.</p>
<p>It saw some progress but I never managed to iron out some of the 'last few things' or put a pretty front on it ‚Äî until about 2 weeks ago, when I got some more time to do it.</p>
<p>There are known issues ‚Äî such as the scores being very arbitrary, wrong and misleading; it crashes Chromium every time (on my machine) and it completely misbehaves in Brave Browser (on my machine). It may also not be the prettiest (but hopefully it is at least somewhat inoffensive). I hope to work on these annoying issues soon.</p>
<p>I have deployed a test instance at <a href="https://test.voip.librepush.net">https://test.voip.librepush.net</a> ‚Äî it can be tried in a WebRTC-supporting browser (probably Firefox if you want half a chance). Please don't take it to heart if you get a Fail or Poor score ‚Äî it's probably not your fault. :)</p>

<p>Oliver was interning with us at Element this Summer. Fixing up and releasing
this VoIP tester was part of it, but he's still working on it in his spare

            <p>Synapse 1.20.0 is here!</p>
<p>Highlights of 1.20.0 include:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Shadow ban support.</li>
<li>Unread message counts in the sync response to help our client developers, this is a precursor to improving notification support.</li>
<li>No less than 28 async/await PRs, so we can finally share all the hard work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also take note that in a future release, we will be dropping support for accessing Synapse's Admin API using the <code>/_matrix/client/* prefixes</code>. More details follow in the changelog.</p>
<p>Get the new releases from any of the usual sources mentioned at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md. 1.20.0 is on github <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.0">here</a>, and 1.20.0rc4 is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.0rc4">here</a>.</p>
<p>The changelog for 1.20.0 is as follows:</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-20-0-2020-09-22">Synapse 1.20.0 (2020-09-22)</h1>
<p>No significant changes since v1.20.0rc5.</p>
<h2 id="removal-warning">Removal warning</h2>
<p>Historically, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/master/docs">Synapse Admin API</a> has been accessible under the <code>/_matrix/client/api/v1/admin</code>, <code>/_matrix/client/unstable/admin</code>, <code>/_matrix/client/r0/admin</code> and <code>/_synapse/admin</code> prefixes. In a future release, we will be dropping support for accessing Synapse's Admin API using the <code>/_matrix/client/*</code> prefixes. This makes it easier for homeserver admins to lock down external access to the Admin API endpoints.</p>

            <p>This is part of a series of reports on the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696"><em>six</em> projects</a> assigned to Matrix for Google Summer of Code 2020.</p>
<p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696/#5911643604647936">View project: Moving <code>matrix-ircd</code> to async/await and <code>futures</code> 0.3</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The goal of this project was to port <code>matrix-ircd</code> from the outdated combinators style of <code>futures</code> 0.1 to the new-and-improved style of <code>futures</code> 0.3. As initially proposed, this greatly improves code readability and removes the convoluted compiler errors that were pervasive in <code>futures</code> 0.1</p>
<h2 id="matrix-ircd">matrix-ircd</h2>
<p>The matrix-ircd project functions as a bridge between two chat platforms: Internet relay chat (irc) and Matrix. matrix-ircd lets you use any standard IRC Client to communicate with Matrix chatrooms and direct messages.</p>
<h2 id="mentors">Mentors</h2>
<p>This project is mentored by Philipp Mandler (<a href="https://github.com/phlmn">@phlmn</a>) and Jonas Platte (<a href="https://github.com/jplatte">@jplatte</a>). I would like to thank them for the helpful advice and code reviews they have given me over the course of GSoC 2020.</p>
<h2 id="project-results">Project Results</h2>
<p>Since much of the code was written in late 2016, there were many portions of the code that were unidiomatic and produced compiler errors. The first step I made was to remove all compiler errors from <code>cargo</code> and <code>clippy</code> in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/pull/64">#64</a>.</p>
<p>Additional tests were then written in various parts of the codebase to ensure that the upgrade would produce the same results. These changes were made in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/pull/65">#64</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/pull/66">#66</a>.</p>
<p>Since the project master branch currently used a custom http implementation, I moved it to use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hyper">hyper</a>, a fast and correct http implementation that already supported async/await. Additionally, I moved the module that most utilized http, <code>matrix</code>, to async-await and the new <code>hyper</code> code. Not only did these changes shrink the code by ~700 lines, they also removed a lot of unnecessary complexity. These changes were made in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/pull/67">#67</a>.</p>
<p>The last large module remaining, <code>irc</code>, was then ported to <code>irc</code>, along with its dependencies in <code>stream_fold.rs</code> and its upstream user in the <code>bridge</code> module. The most exciting part of these changes was the removal of the <code>futures</code> 0.1 dependency. All code was now running in <code>futures</code> 0.3! These changes also moved away from <a href="https://github.com/erikjohnston/tasked-futures">tasked-futures</a> which further improved code readability. This PR was in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/pull/71">#71</a>.</p>
<p>Since the bulk of the changes were now complete, I moved onto bug fixes. As <a href="github.com/jplatte">@jplatte</a> mentioned in #71, the current single threaded approach to the application was not ideal. In <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/pull/72">#72</a> I updated all code to be multithreaded-compatible.</p>
<p>Lastly, In <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/pull/77">#77</a> I included more tests to functions with heavy changes, added additional logging, removed unnecessary complexity that was introduced to keep code as &quot;1:1&quot; as possible, and added TLS support to <code>hyper</code> so that https would work. This patch also fixed a rather difficult bug regarding the irc TCP streams and the buffer they were reading into.</p>
<h2 id="remaining-work">Remaining Work</h2>
<p>Based on my personal testing there is <em>no additional work</em> to be done in the realm of updating to async/await. All tests pass and the IRC server and matrix bridge function as expected. @jplatte kindly announced in the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix#matrix-ircd---call-for-testing">This Week In Matrix</a> blog that we will be conducting public testing of the <code>async_await</code> branch on github. Barring any issues the async/await code should be merged into the master branch in the next few weeks.</p>

At the very least ensure that you have upgraded to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.19.2">1.19.2</a> which is a security release but you may as well go the whole hog and upgrade to the hot off the press <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.19.3">1.19.3</a>. We will release 1.20.0 early next week.</p>
<p>Aside from that we continue to work on performance analysis and the sharding of the event persister continues - it‚Äôs proving to be a really tough job but we are getting there. We‚Äôve also been making progress on the room knocking implementation</p>
<p>This week we say goodbye to Oliver (reivilibre) as a leaving present he fixed a long standing bug that prevented servers catching up after a federating outage and as we speak is furiously trying to finish a service to test TURN configuration. Thanks Oliver!</p>

<p>Welcome back! This week we made some groundbreaking progress - this is not a joke, we found a bug in Synapse while breaking multiple Matrix rooms, causing the Matrix team a lot of unnecessary stress. Let me explain:
The good news is that Conduit is starting to federate now. This means that you should be able to join all public rooms of the Matrix network and exchange messages. Note that Conduit does not do all the checks it should be doing yet making it stop sending messages from time to time as well as that advanced features like loading the history, syncing temporary data like read receipts or accepting invites are not implemented yet.</p>
<p>The bad news is that, while Synapse is happy to accept Conduit's messages when it is already part of the room, joining into one of the rooms Conduit servers are part of didn't work because of an event validation bug. The Matrix team did an excellent job at fixing this bug and releasing a Synapse patch the same day, but the damage has been done making a few rooms inaccessible to old Synapse servers.
Thanks to everyone who supports me on &quot;Liberapay&quot; (https://liberapay.com/timokoesters) or Bitcoin!</p>

This means that Synapse is now easily installable on any operating system that supports pkgsrc (which is many, e.g. NetBSD, Linux, macOS, Solaris, AIX, Haiku, ‚Ä¶). And while at it, I also ported mautrix-hangouts + dependencies (in pkgsrc as <code>chat/mautrix-hangouts</code>).</p>

<p>Hey bridge developer enthusiasts! Myself and ChristianP (bridge crew of matrix.org) have been working hard on freshening up the matrix-appservice-bridge library. It's no secret that it was using &quot;classic&quot; Javascript rather than ES6 syntax, was poorly documented in places and there were no types at all to make use of.</p>
<p>But that's all changed now, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/2.0.0-rc1">2.0.0-rc1</a> release brings fresh types, new convenience methods, a total swichover from Bluebird Promises to native Promises and much much more. If you are looking to quickly get set up writing bridges, it's never been easier.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi encryption fans. This week the bridge team has been churning away at adding support for encrypted rooms in the <code>matrix-appservice-bridge</code> library, to enable support in <code>matrix-appservice-irc</code>, <code>matrix-appservice-slack</code>, and anyone else using the library. This is probably the most exciting feature the library has seen in a long time! </p>
<p>The feature will be a simple config toggle, so existing bridges will have to do very little work to support it.</p>
<p>The first phase plans to use <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a> with bridge users syncing like real users, but eventually the hope is that this will be all built into the library.

<blockquote>
<p>0.6.3 and 0.6.4 were released this week, and I'm now working on desktop notifications support and push rules control.</p>
<h4 id="added">Added</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add a <strong>system tray icon</strong>.</p>
<p>A left click will bring up the Mirage window, 
middle will quit the application and right will show a menu with these </p>
<p>options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>closeMimizesToTray</code> setting to the config file, defaults to <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Controls whether closing the Mirage window will leave it running in the 
system tray, or fully quit the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a discrete <strong>read marker indicator</strong> to messages, shows how many people </p>
<p>have this event as their last seen one in the room.<br />
A way to see who read the message and when will be added in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: add <code>chat.message.localEcho</code> and <code>chat.message.readCounter</code> color properties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>zoom</code> setting, defaults to <code>1.0</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>lexicalRoomSorting</code> setting, to sort rooms by their name instead of</p>
<p>recent activity.<br />
A restart is needed to apply changes to this setting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restrict Mirage to a single instance per config folder, trying to launch a</p>
<p>new window will instead focus the existing one.<br />
The <code>MIRAGE_CONFIG_DIR</code> and <code>MIRAGE_DATA_DIR</code> environment variables can be</p>
<p>set to run different &quot;profiles&quot; in parallel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the visible lag when opening a chat page, switching rooms should be </p>
<p>a lot smoother</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When using the <code>focusPreviousMessage</code> and <code>focusNextMessage</code> keybinds, if no</p>
<p>message is focused and the timeline has been scrolled up, 
focus the message in the center of the view instead of returning to the </p>
<p>bottom of the timeline and focusing the last one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't re-center the room list on clicks by default.</p>
<p>This prevents the list from jumping around every time a room is selected.<br />
The previous behavior can be restored with the new <code>centerRoomListOnClick</code></p>
<p>setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show a better terminal error message than &quot;Component is not ready&quot; when the </p>
<p>window creation fails, giving details on what went wrong in the code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an account's access token is invalid (e.g. our session was signed out </p>
<p>externally), say so with a popup and cleanly remove it from the UI, 
instead of spamming the user with errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename message context menu option &quot;Debug this event&quot; to just &quot;Debug&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unify up/down and (shift+)Tab navigation for the account Sessions page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to the UI scale/zoom via keybinds are now persisted across restarts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: <code>uiScale</code> is now bound to <code>window.settings.zoom</code>.</p>
<p>This change is necessary to keep the zoom keybinds working.</p>

<p>Hemppa gained a small but big feature for making fediverse better: per-room Mastodon tooting support. This means that you can set up a Mastodon account in your room and anyone with moderator rights can toot to that account. This way you and your roommates can super easily send toots to the world directly from Matrix. Mastodon (unlike the big alternative) supports RSS feeds out of the box so it's very easy to subscribe to users and hashtags with stock RSS bot.  Toot #hemppathebot if you like it!

<p>Normally the ping shows how long other servers take to receive the sending-server's message. Some servers receive it quickly, some take hours. All this flows into the statistic of the sending server. I wrote a small program that's the other way around. Instead of measuring the sending-server's ping, it associates each measurement with an echo-bot (instead of the sending server), so this plot shows which maubots are the fastest to respond (it's probably not accurate at all, because most of the pings were started on conduit servers this week, but it's interesting nevertheless):</p>

<hr />
<p>Wow the summer has flown by, it feels like just yesterday I was learning how to rebase and what exactly it is Ruma does. I exaggerate slightly, but it is a big library with lots of public API surface. I have learned more in the last few months than in two years of school. I have been able to observe and participate in a project with a community growing around it, been a part of discussions about design and best practices, given and received numerous code reviews as well as learned the process of addressing the feedback, and working from a specification. In short, this has been an amazing opportunity to gain experience in all the things that are hard to obtain in a classroom.</p>
<p>My project goal was to improve the existing macros in ruma-events-macros and ruma-api-macros. It became clear early on that this would include some major API changes and that improving the macros as they were was pointless without also moving to a new public API. While improving the durability and readability of the macro code I also rewrote entire sections to accommodate the new design.</p>
<p>A quick overview of the Matrix protocol for reference: a client sends content that is interpreted by the server as events. The server distributes those events out to other clients and other servers (the server case is known as federation). Ruma groups these events by kind Message, State, Ephemeral, ToDevice and Basic which are represented as generic structs (<code>StateEvent&lt;C&gt;</code>). Each event kind needs to be able to hold many different content types, for state events there is room creation, room name, and membership events to name a
few. Using the macros, enums are generated to represent all state event possibilities, so a variant for membership, room name, etc. These types exist to support the core API request and response types for each endpoint that is defined by the Matrix specification.</p>

<p>One of my personal goals was to become more familiar with git. With the help of my mentor I now feel more confident using this tool that is so essential to developers. I became fairly adept at merging, rebasing, and navigating all the headaches that come with that. I learned plenty of new commands. A few highlights: <code>cherry-pick</code> and specific uses of <code>reset</code> to avoid copy-pasting fixes and adding more commits. I used the <code>reset</code> command to craft good commits, splitting work into appropriate chunks. I am glad that I had the opportunity to hone my git skills. I feel like I have accomplished my goal and then some!</p>
<p>I am proud of the work that I have done: Being part of moving ruma-events much closer to the <code>0.22</code> release and creating macros to generate types specific to the Matrix specification. Working with the community that has grown around Ruma has been rewarding and I plan on sticking around.</p>

<p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696/#5751467312414720">View project: HTML Embeddable Matrix Chat Rooms</a></p>
<hr />
<p>My name is <a href="https://github.com/arnav-t/">Arnav Tiwari</a> and I am a prefinal year undergraduate student from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/">IIT Kharagpur</a> and I wanted to share my amazing journey with Matrix. I am a budding open-source enthusiast and this was my first experience with Google Summer of Code. For the past few months, I had been working on a project to develop an <a href="https://github.com/arnav-t/riot-embedded">HTML embeddable chat client</a> under the GSoC program for Matrix. Matrix provides a highly versatile SDK for making custom clients that can be leveraged for a variety of applications, one of which is using Matrix to power an embeddable chat client. A chat client itself can have numerous forms, whether it being a live chat to a simple comments section. This project was intended to provide an easy-to-use and yet highly customizable client that can be deployed on a website with minimal effort.</p>
<p>My goal for the project was to have a useable project by the end of the coding period, however, as it turned out, the project was going to be tested in the real world far sooner than that. The need for an embeddable client and the feasibility of the project to fulfill this role was demonstrated during the second month of the coding period itself. The client was <a href="https://2020.commcon.xyz/live/">deployed on the website of CommCon 2020</a>, a virtual conference on communication technologies (an apt place to be tested, coincidentally). On the days leading up to the conference and during the conference itself, I helped the organizers to set up, integrate, and troubleshoot the client when required. While the process went mostly without any hiccups, there was one small incident when the client broke during production. Since the project was still pretty early in development, I didn‚Äôt expect it to be bug-free and had anticipated the possibility of this happening. I was keeping an eye on things, which proved to be a prudent decision as I was able to fix this problem quickly and with minimal downtime. The rest of the conference went smoothly and the client performed quite well even when the number of users was quite large (A testament to Matrix‚Äôs scalability). Getting to experience this was a pleasant surprise since I never expected to have real users so soon, much less so many at once. Seeing the client being used out in the wild was a very fulfilling thing to witness. I also gained some very valuable feedback, courtesy of Dan, CommCon‚Äôs master of ceremonies. </p>
<p>Over the next month or so, I kept on steadily adding features and building up the client. The next big break for the project came in the form of another conference. <a href="https://akademy.kde.org/2020">KDE Akademy 2020</a>. This was a big surprise as I genuinely didn‚Äôt expect to see another large conference using the project so soon. The conference was scheduled to be held after a week or so after the end of the coding period. This time, however, the integration was almost completely handled by the conference organizers themselves since it had to be integrated with their version of BigBlueButton, a web conferencing system. As the conference drew nearer, things seemed to be working out well and there was no sign of trouble. When the day of the conference finally came, however, many things seem to break simultaneously due to an apparent incompatibility with BBB. In the end, despite the numerous attempts by the conference organizers and myself to remedy the issues, they had to roll back to an older version of the chat since the risk would be too great. The organizers were understandably disappointed since they had spent a while working on the integration and had seen the great potential of using this client in place of their old chat system.. Even though It was a sad conclusion to the journey, there were still many lessons to be learned. Most importantly, even though the client might work well in standalone circumstances, ease of integration might have some room for improvement. Open-source development never truly stops and I don‚Äôt intend to give up on this project. I look forward to constantly improving it and seeing more people adopt it.</p>
<p>These past few months were a spectacular experience. Even before starting this journey, I knew I would learn a lot but this still managed to exceed all my expectations. I got to learn things I never would have thought I would be able to experience under GSoC. I met some awesome people along the way, I‚Äôm extremely grateful to my mentors Ben Parsons and Travis Ralston for being the best mentors anyone could ever ask for. They were always approachable and friendly throughout the entire program and I never hesitated before asking for their help. Without their guidance, all of this would‚Äôve certainly not been possible. Lastly, I want to express my gratitude to Matrix for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to undertake this project. The Matrix community is full of talented people who will go the extra mile if you ask them for help. It has truly been a pleasure working with them and I hope to continue working with them in the future. Cheers and hope to see continue seeing you all!</p>

<p>This week we put out a new release candidate for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.0rc3">Synapse 1.20.0</a>, highlights include shadow ban support, more async/awaiting and unread message counts being added to sync responses to support upcoming notifications work. </p>
<p>Aside from that Erik has been continuing to get event persistence sharding ready for shipping. He already has a working version, but currently all workers will run at the speed for the slowest instance. Once that is fixed we will put it on matrix.org to see how it performs.</p>
<p>Patrick has finished up on asyncing all the things, and is now studying flame graphs to figure out where all the cycles on the main process are going.</p>
<p>Andrew has been taking a look at the knocking <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC</a>, expecting concrete progress in the next few weeks. </p>
<p>Brendan has been working notifications support and is currently in VoIP land helping Dave on trying to level up our VoIP support.</p>
<p>Finally Oliver has dusted off his TURN tester from last Summer to get it working before he returns to university. The idea is that it will act a bit like the federation tester for but for TURN configuration.</p>

<p>Released 0.0.36 with end-to-end encryption enabled! üéâ<br />
Most of this week was spent on performance improvements for IE11, where asm.js runs quite slow. Decryption is run in parallel on 4 workers in that browser, giving a massive speed-up and added responsiveness (the UI would freeze for 7 seconds when opening a room prior to this). There is still some polishing to do on sharing room keys, which I will get to next week, but all in all, it should work well. Next week I also want to get started on supporting key backup, so you can also read your encrypted history from before you logged in.</p>

<p>This isn't strictly a client, but it's in the clients section.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting stuff into the spec or even implemented in Elements is very slow, so while we wait for proper native sticker packs and pickers (i.e. not in an iframe/webview), I decided to make a better sticker picker widget: <a href="https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker">https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker</a></p>
<p>The goal is to be as fast and simple as possible. The picker and sticker packs are just some static files that can be served anywhere (no compilation required). It doesn't require self-hosting anything except said static files, and it has been confirmed to work on all three Elements.</p>
<p>There's a Telegram import script that's used to reupload stickers to Matrix and generate the static sticker pack files that the picker widget uses. It's technically also possible to make the sticker pack files yourself, but there's no easy way to do that yet.</p>
<p>Due to the simplicity of the picker there's no authentication, which also means everyone sees the same sticker packs. One way to get around that limitation is to have a unique URL for each user. I'll probably write a bot to manage copies of the picker for multiple users in the future.</p>
<p>Other future improvements include remembering frequently used stickers (surprisingly, all three Elements keep localStorage for widgets), importing Telegram animated stickers and searching for stickers by emoji/name</p>
</blockquote>
<p>later more words appeared from Tulir:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the initial announcement, my sticker picker has received some more features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a slider to configure the number of stickers shown per row</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequently used stickers now show up at the top</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imported all the packs from Scalar (the default integration manager)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A model of productivity, Tulir also announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>my sticker picker has dark theme support too now</p>

            <p>This is part of a series of reports on the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696"><em>six</em> projects</a> assigned to Matrix for Google Summer of Code 2020.</p>
<p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696/#6107552447725568">View project: Enabling E2EE in Opsdroid Matrix Connector</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I'm <a href="https://github.com/Tyagdit">Tyagraj Desigar</a> and I worked on <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid">Opsdroid</a> with <a href="https://github.com/Cadair">Stuart Mumford</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew">Drew Leonard</a>. Opsdroid is a python framework for creating platform agnostic bots usable with multiple chat services including matrix.</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>
<p>The project's focus was on the interaction layer (called a connector) between opsdroid and matrix. As it stood, the connector used the deprecated <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a> and had no support for encryption. The aim was to change this by moving over to <a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a>.</p>
<p>I had planned to work on some other features as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>A database module for opsdroid using matrix state events</li>
<li>Support for unused matrix events</li>
<li>Homeserver lookup using <code>.well-known</code> API requests</li>
<li>Device verification process for the bot</li>
</ul>
<p>Porting to nio and adding encryption support was the bulk of the project, and the <strong>minimum</strong> I wanted to accomplish by the end of the project. I wanted to have a connector that worked as it did already with support for encrypted rooms which needed minimal extra configuration.</p>
<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>The process began with <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/pull/1418">This PR</a> which gave us a head start with the migration to matrix-nio. Through helping to review the PR I got to understand how matrix-nio and opsdroid work. </p>
<p>The implementation of encryption support was a little tricky in that it was tough to figure out the process required to do that in the context of the connector. One problem we faced was the installation of dependencies. Installing <code>libolm</code>, a C library which nio uses for encryption was a less than smooth process. This spawned a couple side projects that dealt with the CI, testing and installation of opsdroid. In the end we found a solution and had a working connector on our hands.</p>
<p>Next we shifted focus to the database module. It was based on <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/database-matrix">this project</a>. I rewrote it with nio and added a few features. The idea was straightforward but the implementation had many catches since we were working under some constraints for the interfacing with opsdroid. It went through several iterations before we settled on the final product.</p>
<p>The encryption and database took longer than I had initially expected which meant we didn't get to work on adding support for more events and homeserver lookups. I had a go at adding device verification steps while working on the encryption support but that turned out to be quite complicated and would introduce some breaking changes, besides cross-signing had just been introduced so we decided to drop that till nio implemented some way to leverage cross-signing.</p>
<p>Along the way some issues cropped up with the testing frameworks and CI that were hard to pinpoint and caused further delays but were solved eventually.</p>
<h2 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am extremely happy with what I've accomplished and hope that I have been able to achieve the standards set by the matrix community. It was a challenging and exhilarating experience. I have learned more in this project than I could've imagined and gained a ton of invaluable experience with software development thanks to my mentors who pushed me forward and guided me throughout. This journey was beyond amazing and I will be sure to contribute to matrix moving forward.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="whoami">whoami?</h2>
<p>I'm <a href="https://github.com/Chethan2k1">CH Chethan Reddy</a>. I'm currently pursuing Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering at the <a href="https://www.nitt.edu/">National Institute of Technology, Trichy in India</a>. In my free time I like to swim, work on projects I find interesting, watch movies and do a lot of other &quot;interesting&quot; stuff. This summer I have interned in Matrix.org for around 3-4 months under GSoC and in this blog I'll be sharing my experience.</p>
<h2 id="why-matrix-org">Why Matrix.org?</h2>
<p>Being passionate about privacy, I wanted to select an organization that actively works on that, and clearly, Matrix.org topped my list. For anyone who doesn't know what Matrix is, in simple words, It is a decentralized communication protocol that supports many awesome features like messaging, end-to-end encryption, voip/video calls support, etc. It uses simple RESTful http APIs which keeps things very simple. The best part of the protocol is, it is decentralized, so if you have a custom domain name, you can setup a synapse server in a jiffy. Knowing all these who wouldn't choose Matrix?</p>
<h2 id="my-work">My Work</h2>
<p>I worked on Desktop Client called <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a>. It is a light-weight Desktop Client that uses Qt Framework in the frontend and also uses a mtxclient library that implements Matrix-client server API written in C++. The scope of my project involved implementing Device-Verification and Cross-Signing in Nheko.</p>
<p>For people who have not used Matrix before, it is important to note that every device of a particular user is considered as a separate unit rather than user itself. For end-to-end encrypted chat to be viewable from a device, that particular device should be trusted by the sender's device. Device-verification and Cross-Signing are methods used for verifying.</p>
<p>Coming to <a href="https://chethan2k1.github.io/blog/final-report.html">the work I have implemented</a>, Device-verification is completely implemented in Nheko. As of now, SAS verification with to-device and room message verification is supported in Nheko. As far as Cross-Signing is concerned, verifying signatures of Cross-Signing keys and showing the verified status of devices have been implemented. The only remaining unfinished parts are SSSS and signing the keys after verification. After that Cross-signing should be feature-complete.</p>
<p>I wished to implement SSSS during my GSoC period, but I couldn't because I did not anticipate the additional things which came with verification while making my proposal. The additional works included : implementing the UI, changes to the userprofile dialog, working on the caching of verified users, and user keys. Moreover, due to the current pandemic, there were a few sudden changes in my academic schedule, which interrupted my work to some extent. While contributing at times I was stuck on some bugs like verifying the signatures, some random crashes in UserProfile and setting up relations in Room-Verification. However, with the help of my mentors, I was able to fix these bugs.</p>
<p>I'm really happy about the work I have done. I am hoping to further work on Nheko in the future, complete Cross-Signing and work on additional features for Nheko.</p>
<h2 id="community-and-mentors">Community and Mentors</h2>
<p>The best part of my experience this summer was the the Matrix community and the learning I had. I am really lucky to be part of the Matrix community which has many passionate people collectively working on really cool projects with clients, bridges, servers, bots and the spec. A special thanks to Uhoreg and Sorunome who have helped me in navigating through the spec.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, a big shout-out to both my mentors, Nico and red_sky, who were always there to help me with any issue in the project in spite of their personal commitments and dealt with my stupid questions with utmost patience and kindness. Without their active help and guidance this experience definitely would not have been so fun and great, they have clearly surpassed the expectations I had from mentors.</p>
