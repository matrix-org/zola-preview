            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>During the ongoing work to finalise a stable release of Matrix's Server-Server federation API, we've been doing a full audit of Synapse's implementation and have identified a serious vulnerability which we are going to release a security update to address (Synapse 0.33.3.1) on 
<b>Thursday Sept 6th 2018 at 12:00 UTC</b>.</p>
<p>We are coordinating with package maintainers to ensure that patched versions of packages will be available at that time - meanwhile, if you run your own Synapse, <strong>please be prepared to upgrade as soon as the patched versions are released</strong>.  All previous versions of Synapse are affected, so everyone will want to upgrade.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, patience and understanding while we resolve the issue,</p>

            <h2 id="introducing-client-server-api-0-4-and-the-first-ever-stable-is-as-and-push-apis-spec-releases">Introducing Client Server API 0.4, and the first ever stable IS, AS and Push APIs spec releases!</h2>
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>As many know, we've been on a massive sprint to improve the spec - both fixing omissions where features have been implemented in the reference servers but were never formalised in the spec, and fixing bugs where the spec has thinkos which stop us from being able to ratify it as stable and thus fit for purpose .</p>
<p>In practice, our target has been to cut stable releases of all the primary Matrix APIs by the end of August - effectively declaring Matrix out of beta, at least at the specification level.  For context: historically only one API has ever been released as stable - the Client Server API, which was the result of a similar sprint back in Jan 2016. This means that the Server Server (SS) API, Identity Service (IS) API, Application Service (AS) API and Push Gateway API have never had an official stable release - which has obviously been problematic for those implementing them.</p>
<p>However, as of the end of Friday Aug 31, we're proud to announce the first ever stable releases of the <a href="/docs/spec">IS, AS and Push APIs</a>!</p>
<p><a href="/docs/spec"><img src="/_matrix/media/v1/download/t2l.io/587a1a86905b1e0e8f9342d76e57ffbe" /></a>
To the best of our knowledge, these API specs are now complete and accurately describe all the current behaviour implemented in the reference implementations (sydent, synapse and sygnal) and are fit for purpose. Any deviation from the spec in the reference implementations should probably be considered a bug in the impl. All changes take the form of filling in spec omissions and adding clarifications to the existing behaviour in order to get things to the point that an independent party can implement these APIs without having to refer to anything other than the spec.</p>
<p>This is the result of a lot of work which spans the whole Spec Core Team, but has been particularly driven by TravisR, who has taken the lead on this whole mission to improve the spec.  Huge thanks are due to Travis for his work here, and also massive thanks to everyone who has <del>suffered</del> <del>endured</del> reviewed his PRs and contributed to the releases.  The spec is looking unrecognisably better for it - and Matrix 1.0 is feeling closer than ever!</p>
<p>Alongside the work on the IS/AS/Push APIs, there has also been a massive attempt to plug all the spec omissions in the Client Server API.  Historically the CS API releases have missed some of the newer APIs (and of course always miss the ones which postdate a given release), but we've released the APIs which /have/ been specified as stable in order to declare them stable.  However, in this release we've tried to go through and fill in as many remaining gaps as possible.</p>
<p>The result is the release of <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html">Client Server API version 0.4</a>. This is a huge update - increasing the size of the CS API by ~40%. The biggest new stuff includes fully formalising support for end-to-end encryption (thanks to Zil0!), versioning for rooms (so we can upgrade rooms to new versions of the protocol), synchronised read markers, user directories, server ACLs, MSISDN 3rd party ids, and .well-known server discovery (not that it's widely used yet), but for the full picture, best bet is to look at <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#changelog">the changelog</a> (now managed by <a href="https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/">towncrier</a>!).  It's probably fair to say that the CS API is growing alarmingly large at this point - Chrome says that it'd be 223 A4 pages if printed. Our solution to this will be to refactor it somehow (and perhaps switch to a more compact representation of the contents).</p>
<p>Some things got deliberately missed from the CS 0.4 release: particularly membership Lazy Loading (because we're still testing it out and haven't released it properly in the wild yet), the various GDPR-specific APIs (because they may evolve a bit as we refine them since the original launch), finalising ID grammars in the overall spec (because this is surprisingly hard and subtle and we don't want to rush it) and finally Communities (aka Groups), as they are still somewhat in flux.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the Server to Server API, there has also been a massive amount of work.  Since the beginning of July it's 
<b>tripled</b> in size as we've filled in the gaps, over the course of &gt;200 commits (&gt;150 of which from Travis).  If you take a look at the <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/unstable.html">current snapshot</a> it's pretty unrecognisable from the historical draft; with the main changes being:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adding the new State Resolution algorithm to address flaws in the original one.  This has been where much of our time has gone - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1441">MSC1442</a> for full details.  Adopting the new algorithm requires rooms to be recreated; we'll write more about this in the near future when we actually roll it out.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adding room versioning so we can upgrade to the new State Resolution algorithm.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Everything is now properly expressed as Swagger (OpenAPI), just like the CS API
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adding all the details for E2E encryption (including dependencies like to-device messaging and device-list synchronisation)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Improvements in specifying how to authorize inbound events over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document federation APIs such as /event_auth and /query_auth and /get_missing_events
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document 3rd party invites over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document the /user/* federation endpoints
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document Server ACLs
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document read receipts over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document presence over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document typing notifications over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document content repository over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document room directory over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">...and many many other minor bug fixes, omission fixes, and restructuring for coherency - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1464">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1464</a> for an even longer list :)
</li>
</ul>
However, we haven't finished it all: despite our best efforts we're running slightly past the original target of Aug 31.  The current state of play for the r0 release overall (in terms of pending issues) is:
<a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-16.56.18.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3525" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-16.56.18.png" alt="" width="576" height="214" /></a>...and you can see the full breakdown over at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/1">public Github project dashboard</a>.
<p>The main stuff we still have remaining on the Server/Server API at this point is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Better specifying how we validate inbound events. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1646">MSC1646</a> for details & progress.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Switching event IDs to be hashes. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1640">MSC1640</a> for details and progress.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Various other remaining security considerations (e.g. how to handle malicious auth events in the DAG; how to better handle DoS situations).
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Merging in the changes to authoring m.room.power_levels (as per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1304">MSC1304</a>)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Formally specifying the remaining identifiers which lack a formal grammar - <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1598">MSC1597</a> and particularly room aliases (
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1607">MSC1608</a>)
</li>
</ul>
The plan here is to continue speccing and implementing these at top priority (with Travis continuing to work fulltime on spec work), and we'll obviously keep you up-to-date on progress.  Some of the changes here (e.g. event IDs) are quite major and we definitely want to implement them before speccing them, so we're just going to have to keep going as fast as we can. Needless to say we want to cut an r0 of the S2S API alongside the others asap and declare Matrix out of beta (at least at the spec level :)
<p>In terms of visualising progress on this spec mission it's interesting to look at the rate at which we've been closing PRs: this graph shows the total number of PRs which are in state ‘open' or ‘closed' on any given day:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-00.56.38.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3526" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-00.56.38-1024x722.png" alt="" width="1024" height="722" /></a></p>
<p>...which clearly shows the original sprint to get the r0 of the CS API out the door at the end 2015, and then a more leisurely pace until the beginning of July 2018 since which the pace has picked up massively.  Other ways of looking at include the number of open issues...</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3527" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-1-1024x691.png" alt="" width="1024" height="691" /></a>
...or indeed the number of commits per week…</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.02.27.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3528" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.02.27-1024x195.png" alt="" width="710" height="135" /></a>
...or the overall Github Project activity for August.  (It's impressive to see Zil0 sneaking in there on second place on the commit count, thanks to all his GSoC work documenting E2E encryption in the spec as part of implementing it in matrix-python-sdk!)</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.03.57.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3529" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.03.57-1024x925.png" alt="" width="744" height="672" /></a>
Anyway, enough numerology.  It's worth noting that all of the dev for r0 has generally followed the proposed <a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">Open Governance Model for Matrix</a>, with the core spec team made up of both historical core team folk (erik, richvdh, dave &amp; matthew), new core team folk (uhoreg &amp; travis) and community folk (kitsune, anoa &amp; mujx) working together to review and approve the changes - and we've been doing MSCs (albeit with an accelerated pace) for anything which we feel requires input from the wider community.  Once the Server/Server r0 release is out the door we'll be finalising the open governance model and switching to a slightly more measured (but productive!) model of spec development as outlined there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Matrix 1.0 gets ever closer.  With (almost) all this spec mission done, our plan is to focus more on improving the reference implementations - particularly performance in Synapse, 
UX in matrix-{'{'}react,ios,android{'}'}-sdk as used by Riot (especially for E2E encryption), and then declare a 1.0 and get back to implementing new features (particularly Editable Messages and Reactions) at last.</p>
<p>We'd like to thank everyone for your patience whilst we've been playing catch up on the spec, and hope you agree it's been worth the effort :)</p>
<p>Matthew &amp; the core spec team.</p>

            <h2 id="the-spec">The Spec</h2>
<p>As many know, we've been aiming for the end of August to cut the first ever stable releases of the remaining APIs in the spec which have up to now been marked unstable - i.e. providing a snapshot of the spec which correctly matches the reference implementations (other than implementation bugs) and which can be used in isolation to develop production grade implementations of clients, servers, etc without need to reference any other implementations. There's been a massive sprint to pull this together, and as of the time of writing there are still <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr">PRs and commits</a> landing every few minutes.  We'll post a full update on our progress on Monday; meanwhile you can see a sneak peek over at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/1">August 2018 r0</a> project board.</p>
<p>Spec work has completely precluded any other backend dev this week.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been working on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> bridge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>now bridges a lot more stuff, such as formatting, media and replies. I'm also almost done with desegregating users so that Matrix users join the same group chat portals rather than everyone having their own portal to the same chat</p>

<h3 id="zulip-chat-bridged-by-zulip">Zulip chat, bridged by Zulip</h3>
<p>Matthew discovered there is a Matrix-Zulip bridge on the Zulip side. So if you're running a Zulip server (for some reason), and want to bridge with Matrix <a href="https://zulipchat.com/integrations/doc/matrix">check out the integration docs here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="irc-connection-tracker">IRC Connection Tracker</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> created a new component to enhance the reliability of IRC-Matrix bridging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/irc-conntrack">IRC Connection Tracker</a> is a thing now. It's a project to separate out the IRC connections from the appservice so the two can be run independently, so that restarting the appservice doesn't affect the IRC connections. It's hopefully going to allow bridge stuff to run faster when it's done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This project is still really early stage. You can take a look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NZRdUYHWltq9rh-nFZeSp3FYwtQQh5vBxa6Lw8YNtCo/">Proposal document here</a>.</p>

            <p>Thank you to Half-Shot for all your work on Bridges over the last months and beyond. Today is your last day, but I'm sure we'll see you again before long. Text below is from Half-Shot.</p>
<hr />
<p>Today marks my last day of my 3 month internship at New Vector (the startup which hires many of the core Matrix team). For those of you who haven't been reading Ben's fabulous blog posts, I've been working exclusively on bridges; in particular the IRC bridge.</p>
<p>Tasked with the goal of making it crash less and run faster, I hope that the evidence is visible and people are generally having a better experience on it!</p>
<p>Some stats pulled from the matrix-appservice-irc repo:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>39 PRs closed (4 remain open)</li>
 	<li>27 issues closed, 27 issues opened.</li>
 	<li>334 commits, averaging 7.6 commits a PR.</li>
</ul>
Commits this year:
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3506" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/commits_year.png" alt="Commits this year" width="751" height="179" />
<hr />
<p>But aside from showing off some stats, I wanted to mention all the new features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Replies on Matrix translate well to IRC, or as well as IRC allows.</li>
 	<li>People mentioning your IRC nick now ping your matrix user, finally!</li>
 	<li>So. Many. Metrics. Everything you wanted to know about the internals of the bridge, but were too afraid to <code>--inspect</code>.</li>
 	<li>Not spamming homeservers with join requests on startup (it makes for a happy ops team).</li>
 	<li>No longer are IRC users shackled to a "(IRC)" extension on their displayname, you can be who you want
with group flairs!</li>
 	<li>Support for node 4 has been dropped, and support for 6,8 and 10 has been assured.</li>
</ul>
On the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> side, I optimised some calls to cache locally and avoid hitting the homeserver too often, and disabling presence for homeservers that don't support it.
<p>There are future plans to make bridging more visible to Matrix Clients as a first class citizen. Ideas like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1410">speccing a state event (MSC1410)</a> so that bridges can interact with each other properly and clients can create full bridge management views which are still decentralised from an integration manager.</p>
<p>I'd like to give a shoutout to Travis who has reviewed nearly all my changes that have made their way into the bridge, on top of all the other tasks he has on his plate. And of course a thank you to all of the Matrix team who have been very supportive during my time here.</p>

<h2 id="shared-secret-auth-and-matrix-corporal">Shared Secret Auth and Matrix Corporal</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> has been working on several operations tools for Synapse. Firstly <strong><a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth">Shared Secret Auth</a></strong> password provider module for Matrix Synapse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It allows external systems (which know the shared secret) to easily obtain access tokens for any user hosted on the homeserver. This is incredibly useful for all sorts of automation (no more pre-generated access tokens or plain-text passwords).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this tool, you can pass a mxid, and get back an access_token for that user. With this, you can do whatever actions would normally be done with a token. For example, you for a new starter at a company, you could join a set of rooms known to be needed by new starters.</p>

<p>Next, he has released <a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal">Matrix Corporal</a>, reconciliator and gateway for a managed Matrix server:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a way to take control of Matrix (Synapse) in a corporate (or other such) environment.<br />Based on a configuration policy (generated by an external system, like your intranet), it can auto-create and auto-disable users, keep their profile and authentication details to date, auto-join/leave users to communities and rooms, etc.<br />It's also meant to sit in front of the Matrix Synapse Client API, inspecting and allowing/denying requests, in accordance with the configuration policy (preventing people from leaving certain rooms/communities, preventing them from messing around with their profile details, etc.)</p>

<p>I was extremely young when I first read and understood Larry Wall's explanation about the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris">virtue of laziness</a>, but I did not expect it to lead here. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> has created (I think inspired by an idea from <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>), a &quot;<a href="https://github.com/Cadair/skill-twim">twimbot</a>&quot;. This bot works in conjunction with <a href="https://opsdroid.github.io/">opsdroid</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/connector-matrix">opsdroid connector-matrix</a> - it works by storing selected messages from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> in room state. In this way, it either assists the author by making it easier to produce the blog post you're reading, or it coldly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45240758">replaces the author</a>, leading to his sacking and penury.

<blockquote>
<p>Released matrix-appservice-bridge 1.6.0 which contains mostly things I was writing for the irc bridge and factored out instead. There's a couple of goodies like automatic caching of profiles/events, and getEvent as a way to fetch events from the homeserver without fiddling with context.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some <code>Intent</code> operations now cache requests that would otherwise fall through
to the homeserver which can be expensive. This is configurable for <code>Intent</code>s
via the <code>opts.caching.ttl</code> and <code>size</code> options.
AgeCounters now allow you to set your own time period buckets.
Added a new function <code>Intent.getEvent</code> which will fetch events
from the homeserver without any context information, which should
be quick.
<code>MembershipCache</code> is now exposed to let folks read and write to the cache
while also letting the bridge access it.</p>
<p><code>a</code> release: Fix issue where <code>roomState</code> would fail.
<code>b</code> release: Fix issue where we were calling this.intent <em>inside</em> intent like fools!
<code>c</code> release: Fix issue where some stole js-sdk code was not checked thoroughly.</p>

<p>It uses the <a href="https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp">go-whatsapp</a> library to talk with the WhatsApp Web API. Using the web API means that you'll still need WhatsApp on your phone connected to the internet, but it also means you won't get banned for using the bridge.<br />The bridge is still very alpha, but basic message bridging and some advanced features already work.

<p>Jason writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Construct has advanced to fully asynchronous disk IO in a single-threaded environment.<br />RocksDB is a highly configurable and customizable database with a very large callback surface to support many different environments, which is good to connect it with something like AIO.<br />Normally RocksDB gets its performance from concurrent standard POSIX system calls (blocking IO) with multiple threads. The callback surface and its internals are not specifically suited for deviating from the pthread model. However I hacked RocksDB and tricked it into believing that my userspace contexts, which mimic the <code>std::thread/pthread</code> interface, are threads.<br /><a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/blob/ac3b45604a8e7c6e4a8d3b3d84d62bfbc1070c46/ircd/db.cc#L4336">This is an example of a RocksDB callback to read from a file</a>, it expects this callback to return immediately (i.e as soon as the kernel returns from a blocking read(2).) Except, where I call <code>fs::read()</code> that is actually a stack-suspension which makes a request to linux AIO where the stack resumes after AIO has called back with the data (see: <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/blob/master/ircd/aio.cc">https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/blob/master/ircd/aio.cc</a>)<br />No modifications to the internals of RocksDB were necessary.

<h2 id="spec">Spec</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> continues to plow through work in documenting, clarifying and confirming the spec. You can check out his project on Github: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/1">August 2018 r0</a>, which should give an idea of both the scale of the project and the amount of work which has been done. Rather than list out individual items as I have been, please take a look at that project, and come chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> if you'd like to contribute.</p>

<p>Some exciting things on Riot Web this week!</p>
<p>Bruno has merged his work on lazy loading room members lists, which should mean we see some big performance improvements, especially in larger rooms. You can expect to see that released on <a href="https://riot.im/develop">/develop</a> soon.</p>
<p>He has also <em>just</em> started to work on the riot redesign, and has begun on some of the more visible changes like resizeable panels:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass">Seaglass</a>, the MacOS-native client, now has <a href="https://bintray.com/neilalexander/Seaglass/Seaglass#files">automatically generated builds available on bintray</a>.</p>
<p>Seaglass is now a very usable and stable client on macOS. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">neilalexander</a> has been very active this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seaglass has had various updates, including the groundwork for joining and leaving channels, LOADS of crashes fixed, some more work done on avatars and E2E encryption has been fairly well road-tested now
Still need to complete UI for device verification and setting E2E but it works fine in existing channels</p>

<h3 id="quaternion">Quaternion</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has been working on <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quaternion has gained a new way to highlight mentions - with tinted background instead of colored text. Also, the majority of work on rooms grouping is done, and the current master branch features the roomlist grouped by tag (but rooms under each tag are pretty much out of order so it's not really ready for daily use yet).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quaternion is looking for a macOS packager - if someone has the chance to help out in this area, speak to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!PCzUtxtOjUySxSelof:matrix.org">#QMatrixClient</a>.</p>
<h3 id="palaver">Palaver</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@arne:matrix.localtoast.de">Arne</a> came at us with the v0.2.1 release of <a href="https://gitlab.com/MrCustomizer/palaver">Palaver</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few days back Palaver has been moved to Gitlab. And I have since released v0.2.0 and v0.2.1. A runnable jar-file of the latest release can be downloaded at <a href="https://gitlab.com/MrCustomizer/palaver/tags/v0.2.1">https://gitlab.com/MrCustomizer/palaver/tags/v0.2.1</a>. The biggest changes in v0.2.x are the replacement of all the web views with native JavaFX components (as I don't feel comfortable embedding a whole browser stack in a desktop application) and support for read markers. There is a short YouTube video demonstrating the read marker implementation:</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> is continuing to make progress on his Java-focused collection of APIs and SDKs, he's eagerly awaiting the r0 release of the spec (aren't we all!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeon (https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon) (client2server and application api) has released on the Maven Central Repository with version 0.4.1. The next goal: the stable release of all apis 1.0.0 after the Matrix spec will be released (I hope it will be soon :))
Jmsdk (https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk) the client and bot SDK have released on the Maven Central Repository.
Gene (https://github.com/ma1uta/gene) the lightweight api for android has released on Maven Central Repository with 0.2.1 version.
So, everyone can use this libraries without additional settings and additional repositories.
Matrix-Jabber-Bridge (https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-jabber-java-bridge) the double-pupped bridge between the Matrix and Jabber. I am still working on it and I think it will be released in a few weeks.</p>

<h3 id="mautrix-appservice-go">mautrix-appservice-go</h3>
<p><a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has a new, yet-to-be-revealed project, and in support of this he's been working again on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-appservice-go">mautrix-appservice-go</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-appservice-go">mautrix-appservice-go</a> is a bit more active again: it now has an initial intent API similar to the one in <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-appservice-python">mautrix-appservice-python</a> (which in turn is based on the intent API from matrix-appservice-bridge).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>No release this week, but Synapse has been progressing:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Python 3 port continues at pace, we expect to have a beta to test in monolith mode rsn (Hawkowl leads this)</li>
 	<li>Erik has been working on some federation API refactoring to make matrix.org snappier and hopes to have the new state resolution algo ready to go if not deployed late next week</li>
 	<li>Richvdh has been looking at performance, as well as spec PRs/ Next week will be r0 work</li>
</ul>
Many Synapse maintainers are also doing huge lifts on development of the spec.
<h2 id="matrix-support-now-in-ntfy">Matrix support now in ntfy</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> took a rare 30-minute window away from bridge maintenance to add Matrix support to <a href="https://github.com/dschep/ntfy">ntfy</a>. ntfy describes itself as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A utility for sending notifications, on demand and when commands finish</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but in fact, you also send notifications whenever you like by calling <code>ntfy send</code> from anywhere you'd normally execute shell commands. This will make it really easy to integrate Matrix notifications into any other application!</p>
<h2 id="matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> brought updates to matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:</p>

Non-Matrix-related aside: as a lazy Brit, I was vaguely aware of the cultural weight language carries in the history of Scandinavia, but didn't realise that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language#Bokm%C3%A5l_and_Nynorsk">Norway still has some fundamental differences</a> ongoing.</p>

<h3 id="quaternion-new-redacted-message-handling-options">Quaternion: new redacted message handling options</h3>
<p>Many of you will have seen the incredible volumes of spam plaguing Freenode over the last few weeks. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">Kitsune</a> has added new features to <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> to help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In response to the recent spam deluge from Freenode Quaternion has got an option to tidy up your timeline after all the spam-cleaning: you can hide all redacted messages or just those that came from recently joined users (along with the join message). So as long as the spammer gets moderated, it can become inexistent for you.
The experimental code doing that will eventually be moved to <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> for the benefit of <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/matrique-go">Matrique</a>, <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a> and other clients based on the library.</p>

<p>vabd, from the <a href="https://github.com/Informo/">Informo</a> project, arrived to say they have produced &quot;a set of SaltStack states that includes deploying fully working Synapse homeservers: <a href="https://github.com/Informo/salt-states">https://github.com/Informo/salt-states</a>&quot;</p>
<p>They introduce the Informo project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Informo's a project (still a work in progress, currently) that aims at bypassing censorship of information on the Internet, by basically having news items go through a decentralised and federated network made of Matrix homeservers. Since we need to host nodes to this network (at least for testing purposes), we've worked on a working and automated infrastructure using <a href="https://saltstack.com/salt-open-source/">SaltStack</a>, which involved hand-writing a few SaltStack states, including states handling the installation and configuration of working Synapse homeservers. In the spirit of giving back to the community, we're publishing all of those hand-written states (available at the GH link above) under the GPLv3 license. If you want to discuss with us about what we're doing, or this topic specifically, please join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discuss:weu.informo.network">#discuss:weu.informo.network</a> ?
The project is still pretty much a WIP and the technical specifics (even the ones we already implemented in our projects) are still under discussion and subject to changes (as mentioned in the GH repo's readme). All I can add for sure to what we already say is that we'll be working in partnership with NGOs to promote the project in countries where the press is heavily censored, and we're planning on implementing a cryptographic verification chain of some sort to reduce the risk of intentional disinformation.</p>

<h2 id="room-tagging">Room Tagging</h2>
<p>This is not from this week at all, other than that it was new information to me. Actually it's ancient, matrix-wise, but I think it's interesting for those who don't know! Although Riot doesn't have an interface for adding custom room tags (&quot;Favourites&quot; and &quot;Low Priority&quot; come by default), Matrix supports arbitrary strings as room tags, and will display them if you add them via another CS API call. To facilitate this <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> created <a href="https://gist.github.com/turt2live/697d5b3781fb7ab7e11d704ea90e3dbe">a small script, tag_room.sh</a>, which makes it very simple to set your own room tags.</p>
<h2 id="fin">FIN</h2>
<p>That's all folks! Remember, lots of progress is happening with the Spec, if you want to be involved or follow along the best place to start is by joining <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>No Matrix Live this week due to vacation and general scheduling fun; sorry!</p>
<p>If you have documentation or articles related to matrix, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">let me know</a>!</p>
<p>We'll meet again!</p>

            <p>Folks, it's release time, Synapse 0.33.2 has landed.</p>
<p>The release focuses on performance, notable highlights include reducing CPU consumption through speeding up state delta calculations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3592">#3592</a>) and reducing I/O through lazily loading state on the master process (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3579">#3579</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3581">#3581</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3582">#3582</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3584">#3584</a>)</p>
<p>Separately work continues on our python 3 port and we hope to have something concrete to trial very soon - we're really excited about this and expect step change improvements in CPU and memory use.</p>
<p>Finally we have some ground work for upcoming room membership lazy loading, there is nothing to see here as yet, but rest assured we will make a lot of noise as soon as it is ready. Stay tuned.</p>
