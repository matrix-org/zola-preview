<p>Some points of note regarding current proposals:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1466">MSC1466</a></strong> Erik proposes a <code>soft_logout</code> field to be added to the body of 401 responses, to better help handling of encryption keys. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/soft_logout/proposals/1466-soft-logout.md">Check the proposal notes</a></li>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We're going with pinned messages (option 2) and room tags (option 5) as that seems to be where the consensus is: it re-uses existing bits of the spec and room tags also help clients that don't know about this specific room tag to handle the room the right way</p>

<h2 id="updates-on-irc-bridges-from-half-shot">Updates on IRC bridges from Half-Shot</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has been working tirelessly on the IRC bridge lately, so I wanted to update on his recent successes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've recently been working on mitigating the effects of a netsplit on the IRC bridge, and optimising it to start and run faster. This week I trimmed down the heap usage (where the memory usually goes) to just under a gigabyte on my 10,000 matrix user test bridge. Previously it could spike to as much as 3.5GB. This optimisation is still in a testing phase but results are looking positive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For reference here is the memory usage of the Freenode process during startup:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-current.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3445" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-current.png" alt="" width="853" height="268" /></a></p>
<p>And here are the results of my local test bridge before and after the change:</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-before.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3446" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-before.png" alt="" width="860" height="385" /></a></p>
<p>After:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-after.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3444" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-after.png" alt="" width="861" height="381" /></a></p>
<p>We also made some internal changes to the appservice-bridge to cache the joined state of all the bridge users and therefore avoiding joining rooms which saves us some time on startup.</p>
<h2 id="matrix-for-grafana-and-more-from-ananace">Matrix for Grafana, and more from Ananace</h2>
<p>In his regular spot, <a href="https://github.com/ananace/">Ananace</a> has made progress on his Matrix sysadmin/ruby suite:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-grafana-matrix">Grafana alerting ingester</a> supports images, plus more per-task configuration options.</li>
 	<li>The <a href="https://github.com/ananace/matrix-synapse/">K8s-optimized docker image for Synapse</a> has been updated to 0.33.1</li>
 	<li>The <a href="https://github.com/ananace/matrix-releasetracker/">release tracker</a> has gotten multiple performance improvements.</li>
 	<li>the <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby SDK</a> continues to be slowly worked on.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/2018/08/02/security-update-synapse-0-33-1/">Synapse 0.33.1</a> is out now as a security update release. Please update if you haven't already - it fixes two issues concerning event visibility where if you knew the event ID of an event you could read it even if you didn't have access to it; we don't believe these have been exploited in the wild, but you will definitely want to upgrade now.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Python 3 port is progressing well (all sytests now pass in Python 3, i think!), and intrepid folks are starting to experiment with running it in production.</p>
<h2 id="decentralised-web-summit-matrix-live">Decentralised Web Summit &amp; Matrix Live</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Matthew &amp; Amandine have been in San Francisco for the 2018 <a href="https://decentralizedweb.net">Decentralised Web Summit</a> - so this week's Matrix Live is live from SFO and gives a quick overview of the sort of things we got up to!  Some of the sessions are already online thanks to the (somewhat unreliable) live stream (e.g. here's Muneeb (Blockstack), Amandine, Danielle (Dat), and Zooko (Zcash) talking about their respective governance models &amp; growing pains over the last 2 years: <a href="https://youtu.be/tsz3ffrJDpw?t=12133">https://youtu.be/tsz3ffrJDpw?t=12133</a>).  The summit was a massive success, with lots of discussions about decentralised reputation, UI/UX for decentralised apps, metadata-resistance, the balance of P2P versus decentralised-servers, etc.  Hopefully some of the conversations we had will result in some major improvements to Matrix in the future!</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-01-DWeb-1.pdf">Here are the slides</a> for our &quot;<a href="https://decentralizedwebsummit2018.sched.com/event/Fhlb/workshop-diving-into-decentralized-communication">Diving into Decentralised Communication</a>&quot; workshop, for those interested in a comparison between Matrix/SSB/Mastodon/Status/Vuvuzela/Briar.  They're pretty minimal, as they just formed a framework for discussion, but might still be of interest.</p>

            <p>Following on from the previous post, we have an update from zil0 on his <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6091058287476736/#5468043765874688">GSoC project</a>, which entailed implementing E2E support in the Matrix Python SDK.</p>
<hr />
<p>The goal of my project is to implement Matrix's end-to-end encryption protocol in Python, as part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a>. My mentors are Richard van der Hoff (richvdh) and Hubert Chathi (uhoreg).</p>
<p>It was easy to get started on the project, since the simple parts came first (adding API calls), and then the whole process to follow is documented in an <a href="/docs/guides/e2e_implementation.html">implementation guide</a>, while there is also the reference implementation in JavaScript. And most importantly, the community is nice. :)</p>
<p>Some parts of the work consist in wrapping around the cryptographic primitives implemented in <a href="https://git.matrix.org/git/olm/">libolm</a> (via <a href="https://github.com/poljar/python-olm">Python bindings</a>), in order to handle encrypted events. Others are less straightforward, such as tracking device lists of users, or finding the right way to persist keys and related data between startups.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of this project is that I am working on a new part of the Python SDK, while also having to integrate with existing code, which is a cool balance between freedom and guidelines.</p>
<p>As the encryption documentation is a bit outdated and incomplete, one (fun) difficulty is to look for information across old issues, Gdocs and source code (and asking my mentor when in doubt). For anyone trying to implement E2E, it should be better by the end of the project, as I am currently working on documenting the missing bits.</p>
<p>I have had a great experience so far. Working on an open source project differs from my previous coding experiences, as people are actually going to use what I write! I have learnt to think about the best design from a usability point of view, discuss different approaches, and I had to write tests and document my code, which sadly is not something I do on personal projects. I enjoyed reviews, and the discussions they led to. And of course I have learnt quite an interesting lot about the E2E voodoo, along with some new Python tricks.</p>
<p>Currently, the implementation is in a working state. Some of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3AZil0">code</a> is merged, and some is awaiting review. It is possible to try it <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk/issues/100#issuecomment-402508438">here</a> before everything is merged.
The project will be finished in about one week, after some tidying up and when I release device verification and key sharing, which should be the last missing features compared to Riot.</p>

            <p>As you may know, for the last few months anoa (Andrew) and APWhiteHat have been working on Dendrite, the next generation Matrix homeserver, written in Go. We asked for an update on their progress, and Andrew provided the blog post below. Serious progress has been made on Dendrite this summer!</p>
<hr />
<p>Hey everyone, my name is Andrew Morgan and I've been working full-time over the summer on Dendrite, our next-generation Matrix homeserver. Over the last two months, I've seen the project transform from a somewhat functioning toy server to a near-production-ready homeserver that is working towards complete feature support. I've appreciated the thought put into the project since day one, and enjoy the elegance of the multi-component design. Documentation is fairly decent at the moment, but comments are plentiful throughout the codebase, while the code itself tends towards simple and maintainable rather than complex and unmanageable.</p>
<h2 id="application-service-integration">Application Service Integration</h2>
<p>The main focus of my time here has been on the implementation of application service support for Dendrite. Application services are external programs that act as privileged extensions to a homeserver, allowing such functionality as bots in rooms and bridges to third-party networks. Supporting application services requires a few different bits and pieces to be set up. Currently all planned features have a PR for them, with the bold items already merged:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Sending events to application services</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Support user masquerading for events</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Support editing event timestamps</strong></li>
 	<li>Support room alias querying</li>
 	<li>Support user ID querying
</li>
 	<li>Support third party lookup proxying
</li>
</ul>
As you can see a decent portion of the functionality is already in master! The rest will hopefully follow after some further back and forth.
<h2 id="google-summer-of-code">Google Summer of Code</h2>
<p>I certainly haven't been going at this all on my own. Alongside extensive help from Erik, who's been mentoring me, our resident Google Summer of Code student, APWhiteHat, has been tackling feature after feature in Dendrite wherever he can find them. Application services received a good deal of help on client-server endpoint authentication side, however, APWhiteHat has mostly been focusing on federation and some other very useful pieces. While his GSoC period still has a week or so before its conclusion, he has so far implemented:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Idempotency to roomserver event processing to prevent duplication
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Username auto generation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Tokens library based on macaroons
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Lots of left-over federation stuff: state API & get missing events being the major ones
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">AS support to clientapi auth
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Typing server: handling of PUT /typing by clientapi
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">More typing server stuff on its way
</li>
</ul>
From my perspective, APWhiteHat was an excellent developer to work with. He asked good questions and was quick to answer any myself or the community had as well. His code reviews were also very comprehensive. I learned a lot from working with him and everyone else :)
<h2 id="opentracing-and-prometheus-monitoring">OpenTracing and Prometheus Monitoring</h2>
<p>Placing any large server into a production environment requires extensive monitoring capabilities in order to ensure operations are running smoothly. To that effect, Dendrite has been both the addition of OpenTracing and Prometheus support. Prometheus, also used heavily in Synapse, allows a homeserver operator to track a wide range of data including endpoint usage, resource management as well as user statistics over any given range of time.</p>
<p>In Dendrite, we are taking this one step further by introducing <a href="https://opentracing.io/">OpenTracing</a>, a language and platform-agnostic framework for tracking the journey of an endpoint call from incoming request to outgoing response, with every method, hierarchy change and database call in between. It will be immensely useful in tracking down performance issues, as well as providing insight into the most critical paths throughout the codebase and where we should focus most of our optimization efforts on. It also comes with a lovely dashboard courtesy of <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/">Jaeger</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image1.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3432" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image1-1024x527.png" alt="" width="1024" height="527" /></a></p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>We've also seen some encouraging interest and development work from the community in the past couple months. While PR review from our own side is admittedly slow due to our focus on getting the foundational work in place, that hasn't stopped both old and new developers from sending in PRs and performing code reviews. A huge thank you to everyone involved! From this we've gotten API implementations and application service fixes from @turt2live, <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1022887733931520001">an end-to-end encryption implementation from @fadeAce</a>, filtering support from @CromFr, and some PRs and numerous helpful review comments from @krombel.</p>
<p>We've also started to see some people running Dendrite in live environments, which is incredibly exciting for us to see! While Dendrite is not considered production-ready yet (though it moves closer every day), if you are interested in giving it a go please consult the quickstart <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/INSTALL.md">installation guide</a>. We look forward to any feedback you may have!</p>

<p><a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been working away on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>, and has a major breakthrough:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It means you can log in to the bridge with your Matrix account to make messages you send from other Telegram clients appear from your Matrix account.</p>
<p>It can also be used to enable bridging of ephemeral events, which synapse doesn't send to appservices (read receipts, typing notifications, presence).</p>
<p>Also, the bridge has a new HTML parser which should be much better than the old one. It might have caused some new bugs though (like m.emote bridging breaking)</p>

<h2 id="coffee-and-the-faqbot">Coffee and the FAQBot</h2>
<p>I've been slowly working on matrix.org the last couple of months, updating the FAQ, updating content and UI/appearance of <a href="/blog/try-matrix-now">try-matrix-now</a>. As you may know, the <a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee/FAQBot">FAQBot</a>, created and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee">Coffee</a>, uses try-matrix-now for it's data, so Coffee updated the bot to start to use some of the new fields.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The final puzzle piece needed for FAQBot has been put into place: https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/extract-web-to-org<br />This is the bit that grabs &quot;Try Matrix Now!&quot; and turns it into questions that FAQBot can use.<br />While I was working on that bit of code anyway, I also added support for the new 'home', 'repo', 'room' and 'language' fields. FAQBot will now give more and better information accordingly. For example, it is now possible to ask, &quot;where is the Riot Android source code?&quot; although it is generally better to just ask &quot;where can I find Riot Android?&quot; which combines several fields into a single answer.<br />4 of 7 items are now completed: https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/FAQBot/issues/2<br />and the remaining 3 items before FAQBot's release are just the final review and integration tests.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We've got a new member of the maintainer crew in discord bridge land (bringing the total count to 2.) I'd like to welcome Sorunome :). They are going to be helping review the influx of PRs, chew some issues and be a point of contact in the community. They've already filled my PR queue up and it's going to help us move even faster!</p>

<p>In other Bridge news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> 1.5.0 is out now, uses the latest matrix-js-sdk and matrix-appservice-node, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/master/CHANGES.md">contains a lot of changes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bruno-unit-tests">Bruno unit tests</h2>
<p>Bruno, the latest and greatest addition to the [riot-web] team, has been working on configuring end to end unit tests. His scripts now install synapse from the metal, install riot and then run a test suite. Take a look at the animation below to get the idea!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/me accidentally found a year-old feature branch in his Git and thought of rebasing it in order to <em>eventually</em> continue working on it. As a result, libQMatrixClient and Quaternion master branches support local echo from today. Too bad the same trick doesn't work for E2EE.</p>

            <h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates!</h2>
<p>First of all: we've just released the first draft of the proposal for our next generation State Resolution algorithm as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">MSC1442</a> (State Resolution: Reloaded).  This is the result of a massive amount of work from Erik - if you are at all interested in the problems that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1953">state resets</a> have plagued us with, then you will want to <strong>read the proposal and please comment on it</strong>!</p>
<p>The next step on State Resolution: Reloaded (once approved) is to be able to actually roll it out - and to this end, richvdh has proposed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1425">MSC1425 (Room Versioning proposal)</a>. This was published at the beginning of the week but we haven't had any feedback yet - again, please read &amp; give feedback as the intention is to start working on this as soon as possible!  Matthew's also been updating the Lazy Loading proposal (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1227">MSC1227</a>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Matrix Spec is now awash with activity, lots of work from <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> and others to accelerate progress. Take a look at the <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">proposals list</a> to stay up to date, or straight to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc">matrix-doc</a> repo and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> room to get the raw activity.</p>
<p>Finally, discussions relating to the spec proposal process itself have attracted attention: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1426">MSC1426</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1421">MSC1421</a>, and we're already trialling the new process (using Github PRs rather than Google Docs) in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">MSC1442</a> (State Resolution: Reloaded) already.</p>
<h2 id="nheko-0-5-x">nheko 0.5.x</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> 0.5.1 is out, and it's great! Get a version for your platform from <a href="https://bintray.com/mujx/matrix/nheko/">bintray.com</a>. I've been using it for the last week or so (on macOS) and found it very stable and usable. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mujx:matrix.org">mujx</a> commented that &quot;highlights were encryption support &amp; desktop notifications on all platforms&quot;, but you can get much more thorough notes from the <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko/releases">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="plasma">Plasma</h2>
<p>It's been several weeks since we mentioned <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/">Plasma</a>, but work on the C2S parts of the spec implementation have been happening quietly behind the scenes. Project lead <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/">Nico</a> said recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've updated the CI test server with the latest snapshot version of plasma. <code>createRoom</code> and <code>invite</code> C2S endpoints are fully implemented and should work as expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find the full list of implemented endpoints <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/blob/master/README.md">in the readme</a>, and also read the <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/blob/master/docs/architecture.md">architecture overview</a>.</p>

<p>For those who (want to) use Foonetic IRC channels, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> is here for you! Previously this bridge had been down due to invalid certificates, but this is now resolved.</p>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Synapse 0.33 landed on Thursday, boasting 2x speed-ups for /sync and (briefly) meaning that the matrix.org homeserver felt impressively snappy and fast!  Ironically traffic levels promptly grew again such that the synapse master process is now the bottleneck once more, but between incremental state res, python 3 and upcoming room-sharding work we should see the performance fixes continuing to come!  Meanwhile, lots of PRs in the queue for Synapse 0.34 - including Lazy Loading support as per (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1227">MSC1227</a>), and a whole new set of stats functionality for tracking per-room and per-user stats.</p>
<h2 id="riot">Riot</h2>
<p>Lots of activity in the build up to Riot/Web 0.16 - merging the new Slate rich text editor to /develop (try it now!), upgrading Jitsi and turning it on by default (at last!! - again, try it on /develop, although you'll have to enable it in Labs).  We'd be particularly interested in how Jitsi is behaving, as so far for us it's been unrecognisably improved over the previous deployment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, lots of work on Lazy Loading members on Riot/Web and Riot/iOS, and lots of stability perf work in general across mobile.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We've just released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.0">Synapse 0.33.0</a>!  This is a <strong>major performance upgrade</strong> which speeds up /sync (i.e. receiving messages) by a factor of almost 2x!  This has already made a massive difference to the CPU usage and snappiness of the matrix.org homeserver since we rolled it out a few days ago - you can see the drop in sync worker CPU just before midday on July 17th; previously we were regularly hitting the CPU ceiling (at which point everything grinds to a halt) - now we're back down hovering between 40% and 60% CPU (at the current load).  This is actually fixing a bug which crept in around Synapse 0.31, so please upgrade - especially if Synapse has been feeling slower than usual recently, and especially if you are still on Synapse 0.31.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-19-at-13.00.01-1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3406" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-19-at-13.00.01-1-1024x639.png" alt="" width="813" height="507" /></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile we have a <strong>lot</strong> of new stuff coming on the horizon - a whole new algorithm for state resolution (watch this space for details); incremental state resolution (at last!) to massively speed up state resolution and mitigate extremities build up (and speed up the synapse master process, which is now the bottleneck again on the matrix.org homeserver); better admin tools for managing resource usage, and all the Python3 porting work (with associated speedups and RAM &amp; GC improvements).  Fun times ahead!</p>
<p>The full changelog follows below; as always you can grab Synapse from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.   Thanks for flying Matrix!</p>

<h2 id="fluffychat-for-ubuntu-touch">fluffychat for Ubuntu Touch</h2>
<p>New to me, <a href="https://github.com/ChristianPauly/fluffychat">fluffychat</a> is a &quot;Simple Matrix Messenger for <a href="https://ubports.com">Ubuntu Touch</a>&quot;. The design philosophy for this app is focused on simplicity, and the hope is for it to complement <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a>, another Ubuntu Touch client.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are you not just contributing to uMatriks?
uMatriks is great and it's superb, that someone has created a Matrix Client for Ubuntu Touch. But sometimes you have a so detailed vision of a user interface, which you want to implement, that you can not just contribute to an existing project. However, I would like to work with the uMatriks developers together. We could use the same push gateway for example.</p>

            <p>Folks, Synapse 0.32.0 is an important security update: please upgrade as soon as you can.</p>
<p>The release focuses on security; fixing several federation bugs and adding new features for countering abuse. Notably it includes the ability to blacklist &amp; whitelist servers allowed to send events to a room on a per-room basis via the new 
m.room.server_acl
state event: see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aiuROf1__7ZFkJvDdAZQfBNxyzjYd-ijiRAcHJYqJCM/edit">MSC1383</a> for details.  This also closes out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/709">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/709</a> - one of our oldest feature requests from users who wish to be able to limit the servers allowed to participate in a given room.</p>
<p>It's important to understand that server ACLs only work if all the servers participating in the room honour them.  In future this will be handled better (as part of ongoing work in making it easier to incrementally version and upgrade the federation protocol).  This means that for the ACLs to work, any servers which don't yet implement ACLs (e.g. older Synapses) have to be ACL'd from the room for the access control to work.  
<b>Therefore please upgrade as soon as possible to avoid this problem.</b></p>
<p>This ongoing flurry of security work is in general all part of moving towards the long-awaited stable release of the Server-Server API. In parallel we've been working on the other main outstanding point: State Resets (i.e. scenarios where you get unexpected results when resolving conflicts between different servers' copies of a room).  There will be a few more major changes and upgrades on the horizon as we fix these, but then we'll finally be able to cut an r0 release of the Server-Server API and Matrix will be one massive step closer to being out of beta!</p>
<p>As always, you can get the new update from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.32.1">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.32.1</a>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ananace/">Ananace</a> has been working on configuration files for Synapse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So now the K8s stuff has configuration examples for Synapse + Riot + mxisd + coturn, all runnable on your very own Kubernetes cluster - though with some manual tinkering required at the moment.<br />I've updated the Kubernetes configuration examples to include everything you need for a full Matrix stack; Synapse + Riot + mxisd - using the built-in K8s ingress<br />And + coturn of course, not to forget</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://t2bot.io">t2bot.io</a> is now running <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> as the primary Telegram bridge. Feel free to join the other 10k users on the bridge and bridge your own Telegram group to your room: <a href="https://t2bot.io/telegram/">https://t2bot.io/telegram/</a>.</p>

<p>We should give a big shout of thanks to <a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> for his consistent and continued work on mautrix-telegram.</p>

<h2 id="google-summer-of-code">Google Summer of Code</h2>
<p>The second evaluation for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a> is nearly here, so we have some updates from the student participants:</p>
<h2 id="apwhitehat-is-working-on-dendrite"><a href="@apwhitehat:matrix.org">apwhitehat</a> is working on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite updates for TWIM (before GSoC 2nd eval):
This month we've got most of the federation APIs working on Dendrite. These are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>State APIs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/486">#486</a></li>
 	<li>Get missing events API <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/516">#516</a></li>
 	<li>Query user devices <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/498">#498</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We still need to figure out pagination for backfill API.</p>
<p>On applications services, we've got a lot of APIs working, thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>. Authentication now acknowledges App services, though lot of other stuff is under review. I am eagerly waiting for it to land.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the same topic, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've had a PR from fadeAce/dirichlet_zby for the server-side implementation of end-to-end encryption support in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>. Will be looking forward to seeing that land as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an explanation of the endpoints required for this <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.3.0.html#end-to-end-encryption">in the CS API docs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="zil0-is-working-on-e2e-in-the-python-sdk">Zil0 is working on E2E in the Python SDK</h2>
<p>Sounds like <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Zil0:matrix.org">Zil0</a> has been going great guns on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Encryption in matrix-python-sdk should now work fairly well.<br />The biggest parts to write were device tracking and key persistence. All the PRs are now opened, and the code is fully tested and documented.<br />It is possible to try out the implementation before it lands by referring to instructions written here.<br />Also a special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/poljar">poljar</a> for some great work on new Olm bindings, which allowed the project not to get stuck with packaging issues.<br />Further work include encrypted attachments, device verification and key sharing.</p>

<h2 id="koma-kotlin-client">koma, kotlin client</h2>
<p>Last week I mistakenly referred to <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">Koma</a> as being written in Rust, then Java. This was all incorrect, though being written in Kotlin, Koma does run on the JVM and use JavaFx.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sideboat:matrix.org">sideboat</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">koma</a>, we are improving the room info window used for viewing and editing the name, icon, and aliases of a room. In the upcoming release, user power levels will be taken into account, so that editing options will only be shown when the user has enough power.</p>

<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Neil says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've just cut the next release candidate for Synapse: 0.32.0rc1.<br />The upcoming release focuses almost entirely on security; fixing federation bugs and adding new features for countering abuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="riot">Riot</h2>
<p>This week we welcome Bruno to the Riot team, he's off and away working on getting integration tests set up.</p>
<p>Otherwise:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>More work on the Jitsi integration</li>
 	<li>More work troubleshooting E2E failures</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases/tag/v0.15.6">v0.15.6</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases/tag/v0.15.7-rc.1">v0.15.7-rc.1</a> now available</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="self-reference">Self-reference</h2>
<p>This week was only six days long, but to make up for it we'll have a bumper eight day edition next time! Come join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#TWIM:matrix.org</a> and share what you've made.</p>
