<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we've released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6.1">Dendrite 0.6.1</a> which contains a number of fixes and improvements. This release includes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roomserver inputs now take place with full transactional isolation in PostgreSQL deployments</li>
<li>Pull consumers are now used instead of push consumers when retrieving messages from NATS to better guarantee ordering and to reduce redelivery of duplicate messages</li>
<li>Further logging tweaks, particularly when joining rooms</li>
<li>Improved calculation of servers in the room, when checking for missing auth/prev events or state</li>
<li>Dendrite will now skip dead servers more quickly when federating by reducing the TCP dial timeout</li>
<li>The key change consumers have now been converted to use native NATS code rather than a wrapper</li>
<li>Go 1.16 is now the minimum supported version for Dendrite</li>
<li>Local clients should now be notified correctly of invites</li>
<li>The roomserver input API now has more time to process events, particularly when fetching missing events or state, which should fix a number of errors from expired contexts</li>
<li>Fixed a panic that could happen due to a closed channel in the roomserver input API</li>
<li>Logging in with uppercase usernames from old installations is now supported again (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/hoernschen">hoernschen</a>)</li>
<li>Federated room joins now have more time to complete and should not fail due to expired contexts</li>
<li>Events that were sent to the roomserver along with a complete state snapshot are now persisted with the correct state, even if they were rejected or soft-failed</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance, as measured by Sytest, currently sits at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 65%</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 94%</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, you can join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for Dendrite discussion and announcements.</p>

<ul>
<li>Versioned releases (no more<code>latest</code> docker tags or such)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/locmai">locmai</a> added dependencies (NATS JetStream, Postgres)</li>

<p>It's FOSDEM! Don't forget to checkout my 5 min ramble about custom stickers and emotes in Matrx: https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/matrix_custom_stickers/</p>
<p>In preparation for FOSDEM, I've also been working on some goodies so that you can participate using Nheko in a limited manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previews for rooms are now fetched for spaces using the hierarchy API</li>
<li>Widgets for the talks should be shown below the topic as links</li>
</ul>
<p>While this isn't grand, it should be good enough for some to participate using Nheko. You will need the latest master (some commits aren't even pushed at the time of writing!), but if you are just watching, this should give you an easy way to fetch the talk link for each room. You will still have to watch the actual talk in your browser though.</p>
<p>LorenDB also added a big, fat, red offline indicator. If your server dies because of FOSDEM, now Nheko will tell you.</p>
<p>I hope you all will have a great time and I hope I see you around!</p>

<p>A Social Annotation Tool Powered by Matrix</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="viewer-updates">Viewer Updates</h3>
<p>Here's a big populus viewer update! Since last time, I've been mostly working on improving the user experience and onboarding for non-experts, as well as making my teaching-assistant bot a little smarter - this work is ongoing. But I have had time for a few new features üòÅ</p>
<ul>
<li>Populus now implements <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3592">MSC3592 - Markup locations for PDF documents</a>, a proposal building on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3574">MSC3574 - Marking up resources</a>, so there's a documented format for interoperable PDF annotations (though this is not the final draft, see below!)</li>
<li>I've reworked the sidebar for the PDF view, improving the aesthetics and allowing for a &quot;fullscreen&quot; view of PDF content.</li>
<li>I've added user-directory search and improved the usability of the invite modal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason that MSC3574 is not a final draft is that I'm increasingly looking at the w3c's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">web annotation data model</a> as a compelling foundation for annotations on Matrix. Stay tuned for a upcoming MSC, or come over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opentower:matrix.org">#opentower:matrix.org</a> to talk about the future of annotation on Matrix!</p>
<h3 id="populus-philarchive">Populus-Philarchive</h3>
<p>I've also been working on a proof-of-concept for one Matrix use-case that I'm hoping Populus can help fill. Social annotation can be a good tool for getting feedback on works in progress, or for discussing new research with your team or lab. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just pop open a paper on a preprint archive and start commenting, or say &quot;hey friends, I'm reading this paper, what do you think?&quot; And wouldn't it be nicer if you could do that and host the discussion on your university or team's Matrix server?</p>
<p>Here's a first pass at that idea: https://opentower.github.io/populus-philarchive/</p>
<p>At the moment works by just pasting in paper codes from <a href="https://philarchive.org/">philarchive.org</a> - it'll preview bibliographic information and give you a list of discussions taking place around a given paper, with the option to create a  new one. Sessions are shared with populus-viewer, and pdfs continue to be hosted by the original archive. There are a number of clear upgrade paths, by integrating with a preprint archive that has an open search API, or even by adding an OAI-PMH metadata harvester to the backend, to combine the metadata from a bunch of open paper archives. I'm really excited to see where this work goes.</p>

<p>A KRunner plugin to list joined rooms and possibly other things from nheko.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lorendb:matrix.org">LorenDB</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been working on a little project over the last week: <a href="https://github.com/LorenDB/nheko-krunner">nheko-krunner</a>. nheko-krunner is a <a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner">KRunner</a> plugin that loads rooms from nheko, displays them to the user, and allows the user to activate said rooms. How does it do this? Well, I've also been creating a D-Bus API for nheko! This code has not been merged yet, but once it is, you will be able to create your own plugins that access nheko via D-Bus!</p>
<p>The current functionality of nheko-krunner is simply (1) search and switch to rooms that you are in (not unlike the Ctrl-K switcher), and (2) join rooms from their aliases.</p>
<p>If you want to try out nheko-krunner, you will need to build from the <code>dbus</code> branch in my personal fork of nheko and then install nheko-krunner from the above repo.</p>
<p>I hope that somebody finds this useful and I am excited to see what other D-Bus plugins may show up in the future!</p>

            <p>Today the European Parliament, the European Council and the European Commission will meet again for a discussion about the Digital Markets Act (DMA). This is the second of three of these meetings, appropriately called trilogues, where each party exposes their stance on a proposed law and the group tries to agree on the final version.</p>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">The DMA</a> is a groundbreaking step forward in shaking the hold a few gatekeepers have on users and the market, in particular because it looks to (among others):</p>
<ul>
<li>Require gatekeepers to allow other services to interoperate with their services</li>
<li>Prevent them to treat their own services and products more favourably (for example by ranking) </li>
<li>Require them to allow users to uninstall any pre-installed software or app</li>
</ul>
<p>The interoperability obligation is obviously the one on which we‚Äôve kept a particularly close eye, as if it lands well it could take the success of Matrix to the next level completely overnight.</p>
<p>However, whilst in our mind interoperability automatically implies ‚Äúopen standard‚Äù, there are actually different ways of implementing it, depending on how far one wants to go. Typical debates here have been between whether to force gatekeepers to maintain open and well documented APIs, or whether to go full swing and mandate an open standard, and every shade in between.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve been lucky to have had the opportunity to talk to policy advisors from different European member states, and it has been pretty fascinating to realise that it was always the same arguments which were being presented back at us, straight from the gatekeepers partyline.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve ended up just listing them in a quick, high level, Myth Debunking exercise and thought it would be useful to actually publish them for everyone to access, so here they are!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MYTH #1 -</strong> &quot;It is impossible to have a standard that is open, decentralized and secure at the same time&quot;<br />
‚áí <strong>false</strong>: HTTPS did it, Matrix did it.</li>
<li><strong>MYTH #2 -</strong>&quot;It is difficult and expensive to make existing services compatible with a standard&quot;<br />
‚áí <strong>false</strong>: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix#how-do-you-make-an-existing-chat-system-talk-matrix">Gitter was integrated into Matrix in less than a month</a>, with a single developer</li>
<li>**MYTH #3 - **&quot;Interoperability is incompatible with end-to-end encryption&quot;<br />
‚áí <strong>false</strong>: services just have to speak the same language, email has proved this with S/MIME and PGP - where different vendors can and do interoperate with E2EE. It‚Äôs even better when the protocol is E2EE by default.</li>
<li>**MYTH #4 - **&quot;It may work for messaging, but less so for social networks&quot;<br />
‚áí <strong>false</strong>: it's still about managing content and users. Even though social networks have more varied content, it is already well modelled for their own APIs, ready to be expressed in a common language. The key is in the fallback option on unsupported features, as well as the ability to have moderation tools (more on that later).</li>
<li>**MYTH #5 - **‚ÄúInteroperability is not compatible with data privacy‚Äù<br />
‚áí <strong>false</strong>: Interoperability gives the ability to users to choose who is hosting their data and as such choose providers they trust. Besides, the DMA doesn‚Äôt live in a vacuum: it will exist alongside horizontal regulations like the GDPR and the Data Act, which give people sufficient control over their data to rectify their choices if they are not happy. Because the possibility of interoperability is there, it does not mean it will become mandatory for users to use it: they will still have their own threat models and will make decisions accordingly, just as they do today. But enshrining interoperability in law will at least ensure gatekeepers need to provide recourse for people to have further control over their data, which will be an improvement from the landscape today. </li>
<li>**MYTH #6 - **&quot;There is no user need&quot;<br />
‚áí <strong>false</strong>: most haven't had a taste of interoperable chat/social media (but they know email), others are demanding bridges between services: <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-10451559/One-four-people-struggle-friends-using-apps.html">25% users of 2 communication apps lose contact with friends because they are using too many apps</a>. And this figure doubles for people using more than 5 apps. There was no demand for cars when they were created: people only wanted faster horses.</li>
<li>**MYTH #7 - **&quot;There is no demand from European companies&quot;<br />
‚áí <strong>false</strong>: The fact it is so hard for European companies to remain competitive enough to stay alive means there are few of them to complain about what is killing them! However these companies are gathering to push for interoperability (like the <a href="https://competitivedigitalmarkets.eu/">Coalition for Competitive Digital Markets</a>). It will enable them to be more innovative in the product they develop by benefiting from an existing open network rather than being slowed down by having to build one from scratch. Companies will compete on the value they add rather than the size of their network. An open standard also gives an open field for innovation from a business model perspective. The Web is an excellent example of how much an open network fuels innovation and growth.</li>
<li>**MYTH #8 - **&quot;It is better to require providers to have open and stable APIs than define a single open standard&quot;<br />
‚áí <strong>false</strong>: this is the best way to leave gatekeepers at the center of the ecosystem as it means that each player has to multiply its effort to interface with every single other player, but every player will only have the resources to interface with a few of its counterparts and will logically default to the bigger ones, effectively not solving the problem. In addition, if providers are not aligned on which encryption to use it will just break end-to-end encryption and create risk for the user in every bridge. In practice the DMA is about forcing the gatekeepers to interoperate only, but we strongly believe that <em>everyone</em> should be interoperating if we are about improving the user‚Äôs experience and control, and giving more space to companies to innovate. Limiting it to the gatekeepers is a first step, but only a defensive one.</li>
<li>**MYTH #9 - **‚ÄúAn open standard limits innovation if it defines a lowest common denominator‚Äù<br />
‚áí <strong>false</strong>: the lowest common denominator should match what users consider as table stakes in a messaging or social media app. Providers can innovate on top by providing different features which go beyond table stakes, for example by targeting niche use cases, like messaging services focused on elderly and disabled users, or focused on healthcare, warehouse workers, or integrated in a CRM for call centers, or creatives‚Ä¶  Providers also can implement a profile of the standard which is a subset of its full scope, ensuring the standard remains a highest common denominator..</li>
<li>**MYTH #10 - **‚ÄúIt will be impossible to moderate social networks built on an open standard‚Äù<br />
‚áí <strong>false</strong>: decentralised networks actually have driven the adoption of much more sophisticated moderation techniques than the coarse approaches of centralised silos. Appropriate moderation means have to be part of the open standard definition, and some are already used in Matrix. It would also empower victims who today have no choice but get in touch with providers one by one. Each provider will also have control over their own users, and users can select providers whose T&amp;Cs are aligned with their ethics. The world is not black and white, unlike what Silicon Valley tries to make us believe.</li>
<li>**MYTH #11 - **‚ÄúIt will take years before being able to define an open standard‚Äù<br />
‚áí <strong>you don‚Äôt have to</strong>: You could leverage existing technologies which are being used by the industry. Matrix, XMPP and ActivityPub exist today. For instance, Matrix has been managed by its own standard body (The Matrix Foundation) and could be ratified by a more established one like IETF, ETSI or W3C if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously the devil will be in the details of the way the final text is formulated, as well as the limits, obligations and controls put in place, but overall it should be an improvement for all European users and companies and we‚Äôre looking forward to seeing how today‚Äôs trilogue goes!</p>

        <div>
            <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>Welcome to the second installment of our quarterly spec releases. If it feels like it hasn‚Äôt been long since our last release, you‚Äôre not alone! Our <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">last release</a> was just 3 months ago, introducing the new platform and world we build within.</p>
<p>This improvement in speed might seem <em>too</em> fast, but fret not: implementations are not expected to update as soon as the new spec is published. Rather, it is more realistic to expect that the ecosystem gradually update over the course of the following few months/year. Particularly after the massive release that was v1.1.</p>
<p>So, what‚Äôs new in v1.2? With 18 MSCs merged there‚Äôs a lot to cover - we‚Äôve picked some notable highlights and recommend the full changelog at the bottom for a complete idea of what‚Äôs been going on.</p>
<h2 id="rearchitecting-with-spaces">Rearchitecting with Spaces</h2>
<p>Spaces launched into beta <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/17/the-matrix-space-beta">last May</a>, redefining how we can use rooms on Matrix to represent different data structures. Described mostly as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a>, Spaces are simply rooms with a specific <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.2/client-server-api/#rooms-1">type in their m.room.create event</a>. With state events being used to define which other rooms (meaning Spaces too) are part of that Space, the possibilities for tree-like structured data become endless.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs still quite a lot of work to do in the Spaces space (hah), though we‚Äôre excited to see it all land. For instance, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3216">MSC3216</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2962">MSC2962</a> target power level syncing, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3219">MSC3219</a> aims for flair, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3089">MSC3089</a> looks at file structures using Spaces. We might even be able to replace the public room directory with a server-wide space, making writing clients a little bit easier.</p>
<h2 id="public-but-not-too-public-join-rules">Public, but not <em>too</em> public, join rules</h2>
<p><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.2/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms">Restricted rooms</a> are new in this release from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083</a>. In these rooms (<em>and therefore Spaces too!</em>), the join rules can be configured such that a member of another room can join without needing an invite. In a typical setup, this means that a Space could be set as invite-only, but all the rooms and Spaces underneath that Space could allow joins for members of the parent Space. When someone wishes to explore the universe you‚Äôve laid out in your Space they can simply join the interesting rooms without having to ask for invites <em>constantly</em>.</p>
<p>This feature changes how membership events are authorized, so is only available in room versions 8 and 9 (both introduced in this release). Room version 9 fixes a relatively rare bug from version 8, so we‚Äôd recommend using v9 if you‚Äôre planning an upgrade for this functionality.</p>
<p>Further work in this area involves figuring out how to keep membership lists perfectly in sync between the rooms, which is currently done by external tooling. For example, evicting someone from the parent Space could (optionally) evict the user from all the subsequent rooms and Spaces too.</p>
<p>We also need to figure out how to support both knocking and restricted rooms at the same time (oops). <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3613">MSC3613</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3386">MSC3386</a> both tackle this problem in different ways and timescales.</p>
<h2 id="matrix-a-uri">Matrix: A URI</h2>
<p>A massive shoutout goes to kitsune and the whole community for working on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2312">MSC2312</a>, giving us a URI we can pass around outside of Matrix to bring us back in. The early work on this <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/455">dates all the way back to 2014</a>, the very beginning of Matrix‚Äôs development, and has since been <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/matrix">marked Provisional</a> by the IANA.</p>
<p>The full spec is available <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.2/appendices/#uris">here</a> - feel free to discuss it at <a href="matrix:r/matrix-spec:matrix.org">matrix:r/matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> ;)</p>
<h2 id="the-full-changelog">The full changelog</h2>
<p>MSCs are how the spec changes in the way it does - adding, fixing, and maintaining features for the whole ecosystem to use. The blog post can‚Äôt cover them all, but that doesn‚Äôt make them any less important! Check out the full changelog below, and the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals/">Spec Change Proposals</a> page for more information on how these MSCs got merged (hint: they submitted a proposal, which anyone can do - take a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkZz60RRfc">Matrix Live episode</a> where Matthew covers the proposal process).</p>

            <p>Element Desktop 1.9.6 and earlier depend on a vulnerable version of Electron, leading to a <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-desktop/security/advisories/GHSA-mjrg-9f8r-h3m7">High severity vulnerability</a> in Element Desktop, relating to its functionality for opening downloaded files. If successfully exploited, the vulnerability allows an attacker to open an arbitrary file path on the user's machine using the platform's standard mechanisms, but without the ability to pass additional arguments or data to the program being executed.</p>
<p>However in certain platform configurations, the same vulnerability could allow an attacker to open an arbitrary URL with an arbitrary scheme instead of a file path, again using the platform's standard mechanisms. There <a href="https://positive.security/blog/url-open-rce">has been research demonstrating</a> that the ability to open arbitrary URLs can sometimes lead to arbitrary code execution.</p>
<p>The attack requires user interaction and the exploit is complex. To the best of our knowledge, the vulnerability has never been exploited in the wild.</p>
<p>Patched in 1.9.7 with further hardening done in 1.9.9 to ensure it's harder to exploit even in light of new Electron vulnerabilities. Please upgrade to 1.9.9 as soon as possible. The vulnerability has been assigned <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23597">CVE-2022-23597</a>.</p>

<p>Kudos to Aaron for adding a GitHub action to matrix.org's repository to check for typos, and taking the time to fix them all! Worry not fellow proofreaders, our post-publication TWIM proofreading tradition is not extinct: some typos are not caught by the CI, such as misspelling of proper nouns (e.g. <em>Devianart</em>) or articles (e.g. &quot;an proofreader&quot; won't make the CI upset)</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The release of Matrix v1.2 is right around the corner, and is expected to go out on <strong>February 2nd</strong>. This is in line with our quarterly release cycle for the spec going forwards.</p>
<p>Please reach out to us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> if there are any last-minute MSCs that haven't started/finished Final Comment Period that you believe should be included!</p>
<p>Otherwise there was a lot of discussion surrounding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2781">MSC2781: Remove the reply fallbacks from the specification</a>. I'll let the other spec updates in TWIM speak to that though :)</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2291">MSC2291: Configuration to Control Crawling</a>!</p>
<p>A concept similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard">robots.txt for the web</a>, but for Matrix! Currently the way to inform room-crawling bots in Matrix today is by banning/kicking them from the room. However, this doesn't allow you to blanket prevent bots from joining - nor does it only inform bots that they should access <em>some</em> of the room's data. It's a binary switch.</p>
<p>Consider if you wanted your room to be crawled, but the room topic to not be indexed. This MSC could help with that! Give it a read/review if you're interested.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever pinged someone by accident, because you replied to a message with their name in it or maybe even a whole room mention? Or are you avoiding replies for that reason? Did the quote of a messages suddenly vanish when someone edited their message in a client? Or are you just in general unhappy with replies only showing what type of message was replied to, instead of showing the actual image being replied to (on mobile for example)? Were you annoyed, that you could only reply with a text message, but not an emote message, an image, a sticker or even a video?</p>
<p>I spent a bunch of time trying to remove the blocker for that in the Matrix specification, you can find the proposal here: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2781</p>
<p>As it turns out, it is not quite as simple, because notifications for replies to your messages rely on a bunch of implicit interactions, which is why I also wrote another MSC to fix that: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3664</p>
<p>I'm a bit unhappy with replies across the matrix ecosystem at the moment and I hope this is a small step towards improving things. It's certainly not as exciting as spaces, voip, threads or stickers, but it is something which affects me every day and I think those small papercuts need some attention too.</p>
<p>I hope some of you share my love for the less exciting stuff!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jboi:jboi.nl">Jonathan</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To add onto Nico's efforts, I think that mentions today are based on too many &quot;false-positives&quot; (ping on displayname or username mention), and i kinda wish for the &quot;just mention them&quot; UX of discord, telegram, whatsapp, and so many other messengers.</p>
<p>So I've also made a proposal that tries to bring some explicitness in that, a new push rule that'll fire on &quot;mention&quot;; https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3517</p>
<p>It'll look for any <code>@</code>-MXID mention in the plaintext, or look for an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>-mention &quot;pill&quot; in the HTML. It is a hack, but it is the most correct way of determining if you've been pinged in matrix, at the moment.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In terms of reply fallbacks - the Spec Core Team gave an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2781#issuecomment-1016853716">overwhelming thumbs up</a> to removing reply fallbacks via MSC2781... but given practically this causes a cascade of other work (defining and implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3664">push_rules for replies</a>, and defining and implementing push_rules for threads (MSC TBD)) and so as a temporary transitional measure we've instead made reply fallbacks best effort (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc3676/proposals/3676-transitioning-away-from-reply-fallbacks.md">MSC3676</a>).  This means that clients can now reply using non-textual events, and we can use replies as a fallback for threads for non-thread-capable-clients/ASes once <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> lands.  To be clear, the intention is still to incorporate all of Nico's excellent contributions on MSC2781 and MSC3664 however.</p>

<p>Hello TWIM! Last week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/01/25/synapse-1-51-released">released Synapse 1.51</a>. This is a great release which includes lots of performance work around sending aggregations down /sync. It also makes Spaces much more reliable: we tracked down <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11773">a bug</a> with caching which could cause some sub-spaces to randomly appear empty when queried over federation. We also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11695">removed the 50 result limit</a> when listing the contents of a Space.</p>
<p>We're also starting to see some promising results experimenting with ways to make room joins faster (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775</a>). It's not <em>quite</em> ready to demo, but we should have something to show off before too long. ü§û</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">neilalexander</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We know that it has been a while coming but today we have released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6">Dendrite 0.6</a>! This version contains a number of significant changes, including switching away from Kafka to NATS JetStream and refactoring a number of other components. We have been making architectural changes recently to help Dendrite scale better in the future and to fix a number of race conditions that were present before. Federation in particular is much smoother and better behaved in this release, with overall lower CPU and memory usage and less resource spikes.</p>
<p>The full changelog is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/CHANGES.md">available on GitHub</a> but the highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>NATS JetStream support, deprecating Kafka and Naffka</li>
<li>The roomserver now being responsible for fetching missing events and state instead of the federation API, which fixes some race conditions</li>
<li>Strict ordering and asynchronous input support in the roomserver input API, which smooths out incoming federation significantly</li>
<li>Consolidated federation API, including functionality from the now-deprecated federation sender and signing key server components</li>
<li>Database-backed device list synchronisation, which is now more reliable</li>
<li>Correct gap checking when fetching missing events and state</li>
<li>Better behaviour and lower resource usage by the <code>/event_auth</code> endpoint</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance, as measured by Sytest, currently sits at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 65%</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 94%</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a highly recommended update so if you are running a Dendrite server, please upgrade! As always, you can join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for Dendrite discussion and announcements.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Next to spec work, progress on porting Nheko to 100% qml continues. This week I ported the login and registration pages. I also did some minor cleanups on them and prep work for future improvements (like buttons for each SSO provider or providing email address and registration token inline instead of in a separate popup, if the server requires it). Logging in or registering is often the first thing a user does on a client or maybe even the first thing they do on Matrix! As such I should really spend more effort optimizing that feature, that usually falls off the priority list because I don't use it often!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/qjaQfwuJRnkZxDdIpXYOqVhF.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Once Nheko is 100% Qml we should also see lower memory usage again, here is a screenshot from a Nheko instance with over 100 rooms, that's been running for a few days of active use on Windows:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/SWwRTvWLLmJeJrFDjvomjdXj.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where Nheko could crash the notification service, because it sent images not following the Freedesktop notification specification and tasty spent some time further improving the man page.</p>

<p>A decentralized and federated way of annotating the web based on Matrix.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@daniel:matrix.danilafe.com">Daniel</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrix highlight got experimental support for Firefox! It's still a bit crashy, but it shouldn't be much harder to stabilize it, and get the tool working properly there, too. Firefox is my personal browser of choice, and others have requested it, so it's nice that it's on the horizon :)</p>
<p>Also, after the discussion in Matrix Live and with some minor tweaks, I was able to get the extension to play nice with conduit! So that's now a viable alternative if you want to use Matrix Highlight with your own, self-hosted server.</p>

<p>E2E encrypted social networking built on Matrix. Safe, private sharing for your friends, family, and community.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cvwright:matrix.org">cvwright</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://kombuchaprivacy.com/circles">Circles</a> is a project to build a secure, end-to-end encrypted social network using Matrix technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This week the primary focus was on updating Circles to work with the latest Matrix iOS SDK.  I also successfully built and packaged the first beta release from an Apple M1 Mac.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next step is to develop and integrate a new, more secure password-based login based on the <a href="https://tobtu.com/blog/2021/10/srp-is-now-deprecated/">BS-SPEKE</a> protocol.  This will replace Circles' current approach, which is described in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3265">MSC3265</a>.  Hopefully the new login flow will also be of interest to the broader Matrix community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our search continues for an Android developer to help us bring Circles to the world's largest mobile device platform.  If you are excited about working with Matrix, Android Studio, and Jetpack Compose, send a resume and cover letter to jobs@futo.org.</p>

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a> version 1.1.0 has been released! It adds support for room key backup, which makes developing a matrix client a lot more comfortable.</p>
<p>Here is the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added key backup support!</li>
<li>RoomService::getAll() returns a reactive list of reactive rooms instead of a reactive list of rooms. This allows to implement huge room lists without performance losses in the UI.</li>
<li>Some reactive data can be accessed in a non reactive way. Note that you will then only get a snapshot of the data.</li>
<li>Prevent sending room keys as to device messages, when they cannot be encrypted (e.g. due to missing one time keys).</li>

<blockquote>
<p>https://github.com/elokapina/bubo</p>
<p>Bubo is a friendly little owl (bot) that helps maintain your community. It's been over a year since cutting the last release, so the changelog contains a bunch of things, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added command to set power levels in rooms.</li>
<li>Added users command to list and create users in a configured Keycloak. Optionally send invites via <a href="https://github.com/elokapina/keycloak-signup">keycloak-signup</a>, a web app that allows self-registering with Keycloak via short lived tokens.</li>
<li>Add logging to a Matrix room.</li>
<li>Bubo admins and coordinators can now be set based on room memberships.</li>
<li>Add command to make Bubo unlink and part itself from a room.</li>
<li>Add command to list rooms Bubo maintains but is not admin in.</li>
<li>Add command to recreate a room. This follows the upgrade room functionality, but does it without needing admin permissions (basically almost everything except a tombstone event). Useful if for example you have accidentally lost admin in a hundred or so rooms in your community. Which may have happened üòÖ</li>
<li>The communities command is now deprecated (support for spaces coming in the next version).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally some other changes and fixes, see changelog for full details.</p>
<p>Plans for next up features include syncing with Discourse to replicate spaces from Discourse groups and populate space members from Discourse group memberships (when Discourse shares the same Keycloak SSO provider with the homeserver).</p>

<blockquote>
<h2 id="reaching-another-feature-milestone-submitting-images-via-matrix-art">Reaching another feature Milestone ‚Äì Submitting images via Matrix Art.</h2>
<p>Matrix Art now supports logging in with any account (well-known not supported yet. You need to provide the full server address) and submitting images through the interface.
You can now either just log in (No benefit though at this time as comments and follows are missing) or create a Matrix Art Profile.</p>
<p>An Account can also be created later. An Account would create a Profile room at <code>#&lt;mxid&gt;</code> on your server if it doesn't exist.
This currently is only possible by doing a logout and login in again with the box checked. A better way will be added soon.
Editing the Profile is not yet implemented at this time.</p>
<p>These 2 changes should allow some people to experiment with this. Mobile design is not tested at this time.
Submits should work. If you were previously logged in, you will need to log out and back in for some variables to get set correctly.</p>
<p>Registration is still WIP as there is some more moderation prep needed before the server accepts the registrations.</p>
<p>I hope people cheer in and post their images :)
(Also, please use the nsfw flag if required. This will make them hidden on the front page but shown in your profile page. I will block people that don't use it from the instance otherwise. Please be sensible.)</p>
<h2 id="other-changes">Other Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Form readability increased</li>
<li>Search engine getting filled in the background (Self hosted https://meilisearch.com instance gets used) when submitting</li>
<li>Loading indicator gets correctly positioned</li>
<li>Images without thumbnails or html caption don't break anymore</li>
<li>Directory Database was switched to SQLite</li>
<li>Roboto font was replaced with Inter font</li>
<li>Directory Endpoint got secured using the OpenID module in Matrix</li>
<li>&quot;Devianart&quot; typo got replaced with correct &quot;Deviantart&quot;</li>
<li>Logout state management got improved</li>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.51.0">Synapse 1.51</a> is out! Here's what's new with this week's release.</p>
<h2 id="deprecation-of-the-webclient-listener">Deprecation of the <code>webclient</code> listener</h2>
<p>A long time ago, Synapse used to serve a very basic web Matrix client (named &quot;console&quot;) that could be used to connect to the homeserver. Server administrators could chose to make it available to their users by configuring a <code>webclient</code> listener.</p>
<p>This web client was removed in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.34.0">Synapse 0.34</a> back in 2018, but the <code>webclient</code> listener stayed, instead allowing server admins to serve the web client of their choice (or redirect to it) through the <code>web_client_location</code> configuration file.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.53 will remove the <code>webclient</code> listener, as well as the ability to set <code>web_client_location</code> to a static directory (instead of a HTTP(S) URL). See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1510">upgrade notes</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="aggregations-and-sync">Aggregations and sync</h2>
<p>The concept of server-side aggregation in Matrix is defined in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> and is the ability for homeservers to extend the information included in an event using other events that relate to it. This allows, for example, clients to quickly retrieve the reactions associated with a given message, or its latest edit.</p>
<p>This release includes a number of notable performance improvements to calculating aggregations when responding to <code>/sync</code> requests. We continue to measure and investigate potential performance improvements in this area, which should end up greatly benefiting <code>/sync</code> response times.</p>
<h2 id="fosdem">FOSDEM</h2>
<p><a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a>, one of the biggest gatherings around free and open-source software in the world, is happening next week! Just like last year, the conference will happen online and will be hosted on Matrix. And just like last year, it will be packed with super interesting Matrix-related (but not only) talks.</p>
<p>One new addition this year is the presence of a whole devroom dedicated to Matrix. It will be hosted on February 6th, and you can already find its whole schedule of talks <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/matrixorg_foundation_and_community/">right here</a>.</p>
<p>The Synapse team will be giving a couple of talks during the day: <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/matrix_events_uninitiatied/">Events for the Uninitiated</a> by Shay at 11:10, and <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/matrix_extend_synapse/">Beyond the Matrix: Extend the capabilities of your Synapse homeserver</a> by yours truly at 16:40 (all times CET). Come say hi! üôÇ</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release includes a couple of spaces-related bug fixes, specifically related to the <code>/_matrix/client/v1/room/{roomId}/hierarchy</code> API. One of them in particular targets a bug in spaces that include more than 50 rooms, and should make it much easier to look for a specific room inside a space.</p>
<p>The <code>synapse_review_recent_signups</code> script, which allows homeserver administrators to review recent signups (e.g. in the event of a spam attack), was also improved with an option to exclude virtual users belonging to an application service from the results. See <code>synapse_review_recent_signups --help</code> for more information.</p>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.51.0/CHANGES.md">release notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular order) <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/br4nnigan">br4nnigan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blastrock">Philippe Daouadi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dsonck92">Dani√´l Sonck</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AndrewFerr">AndrewFerr</a>.</p>

<p>Work on preparing the release of Matrix v1.2 is currently underway. As of today, the Spec Core Team is aiming for a release of Matrix v1.2 on <strong>February 2nd</strong>.</p>
<p>If you know of any MSCs which you believe should be included in Matrix v1.2, but haven't started/finished Final Comment Period yet, please bring them up in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a>, and we'll take a look. Thanks!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3635">MSC3635: Early Media for VoIP</a>!</p>
<p>When I first came across this MSC, I didn't know what &quot;Early Media&quot; as a concept referred to. Even after skimming the MSC... I still didn't really know. But I'll demystify it here in case it peaks your interest and you would like to learn more.</p>
<p>Early media is essentially any media that is exchanged between the moment you start a call, to the moment the other side picks up (a connection is established). For instance, the ringing you hear while waiting for someone to pick up (called &quot;ringback tones&quot;), or the &quot;busy&quot; tone you hear when the line is busy. Those audio bits are known as &quot;early media&quot;. Video can also fall into this category (though that's less common).</p>
<p>This MSC would essentially allow Matrix to introduce these concepts in Matrix-only calls (though these days the client just plays sounds while connecting), but more crucially would allow Matrix to interoperate with other protocols (like SIP) that expect to handle these features.</p>
<p>So yay, more interoperability and bridge compatibility!</p>

The big thing you need to be aware of is that we're turning off support for Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6, including Linux distributions which ship with those versions by default (like Ubuntu 18.04 LTS). Please make sure your infrastructure is up-to-date.</p>
<p>I'm personally very excited that we tracked down <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11729">a bug</a> which could cause device list updates to get lost when being sent over federation. When device lists fall out of sync, it can cause failures when attempting to decrypt messages, since the keys may not have been sent to all of the user's devices.</p>
<p>We've also made quite a lot of progress in allowing Application Services to support end-to-end encryption via the still-experimental <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3202">MSC3202</a>.</p>
<p>For MSCs which <em>have</em> been merged into the Matrix Spec, we now implement <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a>, allowing guests to send state events into rooms, and we now use stable identifiers for cross-signing and fallback keys per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1756">MSC1756</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2732">MSC2732</a>. </p>
<p>Looking to the future: We're aiming to release 1.51 next week so it has plenty of time to burn in before we host <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/">FOSDEM 2022</a>. This is a pretty quick turnaround from 1.50, but we'll return to our usual fortnightly release cadence for subsequent releases. To that end, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.51.0rc1">1.51.0rc1</a> is out today; give it a shot. üòâ</p>

<p>Hello again! In the last week we continued to optimize the rocksdb backend and Conduit in general, trying to get it as memory efficient as possible. Using valgrind we could see that memory was not getting released in some cases.</p>
<p>We found out that switching to the <code>jemalloc</code> allocator completely got rid of this problem and memory usage seems to be a lot more stable now!</p>
<p>All of this is currently available on the <code>next</code> branch. We are preparing to make a v0.3.0 release soon!</p>

<p>Note that, as per our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.50/deprecation_policy.html">platform dependency deprecation policy</a>, Synapse no longer supports Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6 as of this version. As a result, we have also stopped shipping Debian packages for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver), as it ships with Python 3.6.</p>
<p>As a reminder, please note that Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo) reaches its own end of life <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2021-December/000275.html">on January 20, 2022</a>. Past this date we will stop producing new packages for Ubuntu 21.04.</p>

This is especially useful for bridges, as it allows them to register and puppet multiple users on the homeserver to replicate activity from other platforms.</p>
<p>One of the main shortcomings of application services currently is that they do not support end-to-end encryption. This means that messages sent through a bridge are never encrypted and always visible by the homeserver.</p>
<p>We've recently started work to tackle this issue in the form of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3202">MSC3202</a>. A first part of implementing this MSC (allowing application services to masquerade as specific devices) has landed in this release of Synapse; work is still ongoing towards a full implementation, so watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="improved-reliability-on-device-list-updates">Improved reliability on device list updates</h2>
<p>While working on this release, we identified a long-standing bug that could prevent Synapse from sending device lists update over federation if the server had a high number of active users and/or users with a lot of devices connected to their account.</p>
<p>This bug was introduced back in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.0.0">Synapse 1.0.0</a>, and meant that the homeserver would miss some device list updates when communicating with other homeservers if the amount of updates to send was too high. In practice, this means users on remote homeservers could see outdated device information for other users (including outdated device verification statuses).</p>
<p>Synapse 1.50 includes a fix to this bug. This should contribute towards making the propagation of device list updates more reliable.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release introduces support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a>, which allows guest users to send arbitrary state events into a room. This will be especially useful to the ongoing work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3401">group VoIP calls</a>, which involves having users send new state events into the room to signal their participation in a call.</p>
<p>We've also stabilised identifiers for cross-signing and fallback keys now that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1756">MSC1756</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2732">MSC2732</a> have been merged into the Matrix spec.</p>
<p>On the documentation side of things, the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.50/turn-howto.html">page</a> on setting up and configuring a TURN server has been updated to feature instructions on how to deal with NATs. This is a much welcome addition as configuring TURN is something a lot of Synapse admins struggle with!</p>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.50.0/CHANGES.md">release notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/itchychips">Donny Johnson</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AndrewFerr">AndrewFerr</a>.</p>

<p>Note: An issue preventing client logins (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11763">#11763</a>) was identified immediately following the release of Synapse 1.50.0. We released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.50.1">Synapse 1.50.1</a> the same day with a fix for this issue.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Hot on the heels (relatively speaking) of v1.1 of the Spec being released in November, v1.2 is now on the horizon! As a reminder, we're working towards quarterly releases of the spec going forwards - no hard dates yet though.</p>
<p>While this is certainly an improvement in speed, when it comes to writing software and updating implementations: quarterly spec updates may actually seem <em>too fast</em>. This is OK; implementations of the spec are <strong>not</strong> expected to update as soon as a new spec release is published. Rather, it is more realistic to expect that the ecosystem updates gradually over the course of the next few months/year after the release.</p>
<p>Look forward to more concrete dates soon!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2702">MSC2702: Specifying semantics for Content-Disposition on media</a>!</p>
<p>This looks like a small, but useful improvement to the spec that never really received much love. Feel free to give it some!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy Friday everyone! Today the Synapse team has <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.50.0rc2">released Synapse 1.50.0rc2</a>. It fixes a particularly nasty federation-breaking regression that crept in during 1.50.0rc1. If you're currently running 1.50.0rc1, we implore you to update to 1.50.0rc2 as soon as possible!</p>
<p>In other news, a reminder that as of Synapse 1.50.0rc1, we have ended support for Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6 as per our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/deprecation_policy.html">dependency deprecation policy</a>, as upstream has marked them as end-of-life.</p>
<p>We'll let the community test 1.50.0rc2 over the weekend to ensure that no other regressions have emerged (please test if you can)! If not, expect Synapse 1.50 to land sometime early next week.</p>

<p>It has been a long time since my last TWIM post, so here's a summary of all exciting news:</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>We now support RocksDB as a backend. Migrating to RocksDB improved both my memory and IO usage a lot.</li>
<li>You can select the database backend at runtime. No need to recompile a special version anymore.</li>
<li>Lazy loading works. This means initial syncs are significantly faster (1-2 minutes instead of an hour!)</li>
<li>Voice calls are now supported (requires configuring a TURN server)</li>
<li>The report feature is now implemented and sends a report into the admin room</li>
</ul>
<p>Improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Much faster state resolution</li>
<li>Batch inserts for events</li>
<li>Better appservice docs</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is currently available on the <code>next</code> branch. We are preparing to make a v0.3.0 release soon!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.10.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>RELAYMSG sending support üöÄ</li>
<li>Allow forwarding all IRC noise to network room ü§´</li>
<li>Support ZNC self-message caps ‚úÖ</li>
<li>Support CHGHOST caps (prevents leave+join on host change) ‚úÖ</li>
<li>Fix owner auto-registration (regression) üêõ</li>
<li>Upgrade to Mautrix 0.14 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è</li>
</ul>
<p>Sending RELAYMSGs have been requested for a while so now we do support that if the cap is added to request list. This makes plumbs on networks that support it work nicer. Receiving RELAYMSGs has not been implemented yet so they show up as external like before.</p>
<p>If you prefer keeping your IRC rooms clean without any IRC noise (mode changes etc.) you can now use a new FORWARD command in the network room to make all such events happen in the network room instead. This affects in-room commands as well.</p>
<p>ZNC users can now enjoy messages coming from your own clone in IRC rooms (including PMs!) if you wish so by keeping the znc.in/self-message cap enabled. This isn't extremely well tested yet but feedback welcome.</p>
<p>Not a breaking change but the caps support will cause connections to networks that ignore CAP requests take a few seconds longer unless you remove all the default caps for said network and it will never try requesting them again.</p>
<p>Mautrix 0.14 upgrade bumps the minimum version as well so packages beware.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We're about to release 0.2.23 after somewhat of a release hiatus. We've been working on two fronts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the SDK out! Hydrogen was always meant to be easy to embedded, reuse in parts, and make customized versions of. But until now, actually doing that was quite challenging. Now that the SDK is out, you can use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hydrogen-view-sdk"><code>hydrogen-view-sdk</code></a> package in your projects and use parts of Hydrogen in your application. It's still early days, and we're still working out what symbols should be exported (finding a balance between APIs we want to support and utility), etc. Expect updates in the coming weeks. We're also not yet promising API stability for now, some APIs will very likely still change. Once we hit 1.0, we won't change things from underneath you anymore without increasing the major version. </li>
<li>Rich reply previews: as part of providing minimal support for threads (representing them as replies), we're switching from using the embedded reply fallback and actually looking up the replied-to message. One benefit is that reply previews will now updated when they are redacted (and edited, once we support that :).</li>
<li>Also fix some minor other things, like loading images when they are only partially visible, and a very basic location tile.</li>

<p>Additional thanks go out to the nice people submitting PRs on GitHub and the members of the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruby-matrix-sdk:kittenface.studio">#ruby-matrix-sdk:kittenface.studio</a> room.</p>

<p>Use Matrix as a backend for local-first applications with the Matrix-CRDT Yjs provider.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just open sourced a library called Matrix-CRDT: https://github.com/yousefED/matrix-crdt - feedback very welcome! It allows you to use Matrix as a backend for decentralized, local-first collaborative apps. Above you see a <strong>collaborative rich text editor (like Google Docs)</strong> powered by Matrix!</p>
<p>You can try the Rich text editor here: https://bup9l.csb.app (see also the links in the repo, e.g. there is also a collaborative todo-list example)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have a distributed data structure and an algorithm that ensures all participants end up with the same result when their actions are combined, then that's effectively a CRDT as well. For Matrix, there a few research papers like https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06488 which examine the CRDT-like properties.</p>

<p>The worst (according to its author!) but simplest webhook bot for GitHub and Matrix.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@me:jae.fi">Jae Lo Presti</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First stable release of the <a href="https://github.com/Jaedotmoe/gh-bot">gh-bot</a> which is a simple webhook to Matrix bot made in Python.
As of now, the bot supports webhooks from Github, Gitlab and Gitea (although support for this one is very light).
Some other projects might do that way better than this bot but this is a learning project, to learn step by step how client interact with servers.
The next step would be to add a CRT.sh integration to get notified when a certificate is issued for a certain range of domains (which is something we want since we saw an IRC bot do the same).</p>

<p>A Devianart Fork based on Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev">MTRNord (they/them)</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrix-Art is a new social network prototype on Matrix.</p>
<p>It is a direct Devianart style clone. It currently has a focus on only images but is going to get extended to other media types eventually.
I am doing this as a toy project, so it may sometimes have slow progress. The goal is covering the main functions Devianart provides (Posting, Sharing, Profiles, Following, Collections, Comments) as well as integrations to other social networks on matrix using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3639">MSC3639</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of things are currently still missing, but I am trying to get uploading working next :)</p>
<p>An instance is hosted at https://art.midnightthoughts.space/ and the code is at https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-art</p>
<p>Currently, the interface is limited to viewing basic data from a matrix room. In the future, there are plans to have an open registration as well as login with any account to use it. :)</p>
<p>Note however that I suggest against using your personal account just yet, even though the login works, as it may have unexpected room joins at this time. This is known and expected, but not production ready.</p>
<p>Also, at this time, there are no plans of e2ee support. This may get added after the main features are finished.</p>

<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for <del>this week</del> the last little bit, we've been working on getting MSCs merged into the formal spec itself in preparation for v1.2 this quarter. We expect the release to happen quite soon and to contain <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3610">Spaces</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3387">room versions 8 and 9</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">refresh tokens</a> (no spec PR yet) in addition to all the other wonderful stuff which has landed.</p>
<p>The merged MSCs can be seen over at <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/">https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/</a> where they're queued up for the next release. Look out for <code>Added in v1.2</code> labels throughout the spec, denoting what is new and exciting.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>The random MSC this week is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2192">MSC2192: Inline widgets</a> (I promise it was random, after a few re-rolls). Inline widgets are a concept that allows for rich functionality in the timeline without needing to necessarily specify an explicit event type. For example, video embeds, minigames, etc could all be represented by inline widgets instead of dedicated event types.</p>
<p>The MSC needs updating to handle <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767: Extensible Events</a> (and friends), but once there it could be a very powerful bit of functionality, with free fallback thanks to Extensible Events. </p>

<p>Sliding sync (aka sync v3) is described in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3575">MSC3575</a> - it's still very early days for the proposal which means a lot can change: and YOU can be a part of that. Please take a look at the MSC and provide any and all feedback, be it on the names of keys, format of JSON objects, or the kinds of operations that can be performed. I'm particularly interested in feedback from client developers who have complex room list sort orders or room list filtering requirements and bot/bridge developers who typically don't have a visible room list UI.

<p>A multi purpose multi platform bridge, formerly known as matrix-github</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Howdy folks, it is the time of the year where everyone scarpers! Anyway, perfect time to announce that <strong>matrix-hookshot has gotten it's first major release!</strong>. 1.0.0 is here!</p>
<p>For those not in the know, the hookshot bridge is used to bridge GitHub, GitLab, JIRA and Generic Webhooks into Matrix rooms. It doesn't just bridge into existing rooms, but can also spawn dynamic rooms based on aliases, send you your notifications in a DM and do lots of other wonderful things!</p>
<p>The notable changes from the 0.1.0 release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridge has now been renamed from matrix-github to matrix-hookshot.</li>
<li>Now supports JIRA and Generic Webhooks in addition to GitHub and GitLab.</li>
<li>Includes new commands and metrics reporting.</li>
<li>Includes <a href="https://half-shot.github.io/matrix-hookshot">complete documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get involved and start playing with it by checking out the release <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.0.0">here</a></p>
<p>And that will be my last TWIM entry of the year. Have a good one and stay safe all üê∂</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was in 2021! <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> is back in 2022 with more news</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks! It was only last year we released the 1.0 release of hookshot, after many years of work to get it that far. I'm happy to announce that this week we've got <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.1.0">another release</a>. There are a number of buxfixes and improved documentation pieces landing (special shoutout to HarHarLinks for ensuring the docs are competent). The highlights are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Figma webhooks. this also means the archival of my old project <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-figma">matrix-figma</a></li>
<li>Support GitLab wiki page change events.</li>
<li>Added a new script <code>validate-config</code> which allows you to check your config file for simple errors. Handy for people writing ansible roles!</li>
<li>Add support for a html key on generic webhooks to set the HTML content of a Matrix message.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project can be found over at https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot/, with pretty pretty docs at https://half-shot.github.io/matrix-hookshot. We're also in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#hookshot:half-shot.uk">#hookshot:half-shot.uk</a> if you prefer using Matrix to learn about these things!</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heisenbridge roundup!</p>
<p>Release <del>v1.8.0</del> <del>v1.8.1</del> <del>v1.8.2</del> v1.9.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>Spaces support üåÉ</li>
<li>Sort NAMES reply nicks üî§</li>
<li><code>UNPLUMB</code> network command to force unplumbing without being in the room</li>
<li>Proper SASL external with CertFP with mechanism override option (see notes)</li>
<li>Disconnect and cleanup from networks that have no rooms open ‚ôªÔ∏è</li>
<li>Reply (and reject) DM requests to ghosts with <code>QUERY</code> command ‚Ü™Ô∏è</li>
<li>Try to keep IRC users in the room at all costs if they are on the IRC channel</li>
<li>Fix assumption of all IRC replies to have arguments</li>
<li>Prevent accidental namespace changes to cause mayhem</li>
<li>Finally convert from homegrown Matrix API stuff to Mautrix</li>
<li>Bump Mautrix requirement to 0.12=&gt;0.14</li>
<li>Conduit support was broken in 1.8.x but fixed again in 1.9.0, sorry</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally there's network level spaces support with a new <code>SPACE</code> command. This creates a new bridge controlled space for the network and automatically manages rooms in and out. There's an issue/feature with Element that all rooms that have been converted to DMs with <code>/converttodm</code> will appear in all bridge spaces. The workaround is to convert them back to regular rooms.</p>
<p>CertFP SASL has been updated to do SASL external flow by default. If you are upgrading and have used CertFP with OFTC you need to run <code>SASL --mechanism=none</code> for it to connect again.</p>
<p>Abandoned networks where the user has left all rooms including the network room will now automatically disconnect and cleanup. This is more in line what people would expect and prevents idle connections from hanging around.</p>
<p>Get your third vaccination from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We just released 0.9.1!</p>
<p>This is a small bug fix release. If you reported an issue, there is a 15% chance it is fixed now! This release also supports pinned messages, although those will only show up after someone changed the pinned messages in a room currently (we didn't want to force a full resync just for such a small feature). The spaces list is also now nested, Nheko offers you quick access to your recently used reactions and Nheko will show you your direct chats in the sidebar. Apart from that there are quite a few bugfixes and smaller improvements, you can find the full changelog and downloads here: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases/tag/v0.9.1</p>
<p>Thank you everyone, who helped shape this release!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now is a lot more efficient. We now use one Threadpool instead of 3, got rid of more than 60% of the allocations when scrolling through messages, layout half as much content when scrolling, blurhashes decode in 10% of the time and jdenticons allocate ~10% as much temporary buffers. We also deleted around 1000 lines of unused code. Tooltips also shouldn't steal the mouse focus when scrolling anymore, which could lead to sudden stalls when scrolling.</p>
<p>Additionally edits now replace existing notifications, tastytea added a manpage and fixed blurry or incorrectly sized custom emoji, you can now send custom emotes via the inline completer using ~ and completers now show a scrollable list with more Elements than before. Advanced users can also now opt into an insecure client side secrets storage via a hidden setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're baaaaack! Anyway, last week Drake just translated all of Nheko into Spanish, you can now zoom in and pan in the image viewer, emojis shouldn't split up into their segments anymore and Nheko should always be sending the qualified version of it (according the to the unicode test files, not by just appending FE0F). Blurhashes should be even faster still and we now have support for running the call event loop on macOS and Windows (although call support is still disabled there for now). </p>
<p>We are also now working to restructure our README. It has a lot of outdated stuff in it and you really want to see screenshots pretty early in the README! You can sneak a peak here: https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/nheko/-/tree/README_updates</p>

<p>Cactus Comments is a comment system for the open web, built on Matrix.</p>
<p>We released version v0.11.0 of the client!</p>

But mainly, this release brings a bunch of CSS improvements: introducing automatic dark mode, and making it easier to change colors with CSS variables.</p>
<p>Here's the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relicense from GPLv3 to LGPLv3.</li>
<li>Rewrite large parts of the stylesheet to use flexbox.</li>
<li>Introduce CSS variables to the stylesheet.</li>
<li><code>.dark</code> and <code>.light</code> CSS classes with default values for dark/light mode.</li>
<li>Bugfix: &quot;View More&quot; button no longer blinks when auto-refreshing short comment sections.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> has had a v0.6.0-beta.3 release with beta support for crypto! It even includes documentation!</p>
<p>The crypto is considered beta quality at the moment: good enough to use for somewhat unimportant bots, but not fully recommended for production just yet. With that being said, I'm interested in bugs you run into - please use the issue tracker if you run into crypto not working.</p>
<p>Tutorials for the crypto setup are at https://turt2live.github.io/matrix-bot-sdk/tutorial-encryption.html</p>
<p>Note for appservice support to work then you'll need a Synapse with these PRs enabled (may require manual merge too):</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11538</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11617</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11215</li>
</ul>
<p>For non-linux platforms, the rust-sdk will try to build itself which means you might need a working Rust stack. The Rust SDK repo itself has more information: </p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/travis/node-bindings/crates/matrix-sdk-crypto-nodejs/README.md</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/travis/node-bindings/README.md</li>

<p>Bots and appservices don't automatically support encryption, but adding encryption <em>should</em> be easy. The Rust SDK dependency is required in either case, sorry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don't think we've previously had any <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix/NixOS/nixpkgs</a> related entries in TWIM, so I'll start ^^</p>
<p>The current unstable channel has extended its Matrix ecosystem support to also include <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge">Heisenbridge</a> and <a href="https://conduit.rs/">Conduit</a> packages and modules. This makes it super easy to deploy any of those services: For example, my configuration for Heisenbridge is 21 lines long, and Conduit is only 11 lines. You can browse the available configuration options online: <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&amp;query=services.matrix-conduit"><code>services.matrix-conduit</code></a>, <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&amp;query=services.heisenbridge"><code>services.heisenbridge</code></a> (note that some of them are freeform and simply forward to the upstream configuration).</p>
<p>For those that are not into NixOS, a module is the code that turns the declarative configuration files into your running system setup. As an example, if you enable <code>services.heisenbridge</code> the following things are done for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new <code>heisenbridge</code> user and group for the service</li>
<li>Create and manage the registration file for the homeserver (i.e. automatically regenerate it after the configuration changed)</li>
<li>Create a systemd service that runs the <code>heisenbridge</code> command with the requested bridge configuration. The unit also sets a few systemd security hardening options.</li>
</ul>

<p>At <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>, we believe that 2022 will be the year of the non-Synapse Matrix server!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Dekker1">Jip J. Dekker</a> did the <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/pull/818">initial work</a> of adding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a> support to the playbook back in January 2021. Lots of work (and time) later, Dendrite support is finally ready for testing.</p>
<p>The playbook was previously quite <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a>-centric, but can now accommodate multiple homeserver implementations, with Synapse still remaining the default.</p>
<p>To learn more, see <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#dendrite-support">our changelog entry about Dendrite</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mattcen">Matthew Cengia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shreyasajj">Shreyas Ajjarapu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> can now bridge to <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/twitter">mautrix-twitter</a> bridge. </p>
<p>Note: the playbook already supports another Twitter bridge - <a href="https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-twitter">mx-puppet-twitter</a>.</p>
<p>To get started with this bridge, see <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-twitter.md">Setting up Mautrix Twitter bridging</a> in our documentation.</p>
<p>This brings the total number of bridges supported by the playbook up to 22. See all supported bridges <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook.md#bridging-other-networks">here</a>.</p>
