<p>You may have seen that <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> been working fearlessly and tirelessly on bridges for many, many months. In this episode of Matrix Live Half-Shot chats with Matthew about his work, progress and achievements, with a focus on recent <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a> and XMPP work. Audio is not amazing, but worth listening to get acquainted with recent work.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B0faoVdw0ak" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p>As a note from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a> bridge gained a XMPP specific backend for better performance when you want to do just xmpp bridging. It's rather quick right now, and needs dogfooding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> has received early support for application services. Similar to the official <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">matrix-js-sdk</a>, the bot-sdk uses an Intent-based model for making bridges easier to write. Check out the simple example <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk/blob/master/examples/appservice.ts">here</a> for more information on how it works.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just a head's up that I've increased the storage capacity of the database. With current projections, the server should be good for another year or two.</p>
<p>The database is also 1ms closer to Synapse and has a faster CPU in it. It probably won't make a dent in speed on federation, but it is a step forward.</p>
<p>I'll be rolling out python 3 to the homeserver this week too, which should help a little bit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.34.0">0.34.0</a>! This release recommends Python 3 for production and brings with it huge performance improvements. If you've been putting upgrading off upgrading your Synapse, now is the time to do so. For more details <a href="/blog/2018/12/21/porting-synapse-to-python-3/">here is a post</a> that explains what you should expect and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad3oqEo5leM">recent Matrix Live interviews</a> Amber (hawkowl) on the subject.</p>
<p>Aside from that we are working furiously towards federation R0 and have a bunch of MSCs to get us ever closer. You can <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/2">track our progress here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite's internal audit is progressing very well and is getting very close to its end.<br />What's left to do for me is check the implementation status of a few Matrix features, and translate those into tagged GitHub issues so that everyone can have as clear of a view as possible on what's left to work on.<br />I'm on holiday all of next week, but hopefully will have some good news about that the following week.</p>

            <p>Folks this is a big day for us at Matrix Towers, because today we release 0.34.0.</p>
<p>The big news for 0.34.0 is that we now <strong>recommend Python 3 for production use</strong> and have been running matrix.org under Python 3 for the past month.</p>
<p>Performance improvements have been marked, in some contexts we have seen 50% reductions in RAM and CPU usage. Here are some illustrative graphs to get you going but look out for a dedicated post delving into much more detail on the port. You can also see a Matrix Live interview with the project lead Amber (hawkowl) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad3oqEo5leM">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3822 size-large" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image2-1024x296.png" alt="" width="1024" height="296" /></a></p>
<p>Matrix.org federation reader workers, the big drops signify roll over to python 3</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image1.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3824" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/image1-1024x237.png" alt="" width="1024" height="237" /></a></p>
<p>Synapse master on matrix.org, again the drop in RAM signifies the roll over to python 3</p>
<p>Many thanks to Amber for leading the effort, Rich and Erik for providing support as well as Notafile and Krombel from the community for pushing this effort right from the early days of the project.</p>
<p>If that wasn't enough, 0.34.0 also all the usual bug fixes and perf improvements. In particular the media repository now no longer fails to decode UTF-8 filenames when downloading remote media and auto joining rooms now work on servers with consent requirements enabled.</p>
<p>As ever, you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.34.0">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>. Note, Synapse is now available from PyPI, pick it up <a href="https://pypi.org/project/matrix-synapse/">here</a>. Also, check out our new <a href="/docs/guides/installing-synapse">Synapse installation guide page.</a></p>
<p>In particular, if you want to run Synapse 0.34.0 on Python 3 take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v0.34.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v0340">upgrade notes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="synapse-0-34-0-changelog">Synapse 0.34.0 changelog</h3>
<p>Synapse 0.34.0 is the first release to fully support Python 3. Synapse will now run on Python versions 3.5 or 3.6 (as well as 2.7). Support for Python 3.7 remains experimental.</p>
<p>We recommend upgrading to Python 3, but make sure to read the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v0.34.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v0340">upgrade notes</a> when doing so.</p>

<p>We don't often get to feature news from <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">Ruma</a>, but this week there is an updated <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/this-week-in-ruma-2018-12-09/">This Week in Ruma</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ruma is not dead, however, and small improvements have continued over the last year. The Matrix spec has advanced quite a bit and many of the blocking issues for Ruma have been resolved. Rust's maturity is another story. async/await is still under development and this is the most significant blocking issue to progress on Ruma.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been working on tooling for <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>maubot got a command-line tool for building plugins and managing maubot instances. I also added some server-side stuff for easy registration of accounts in the management interface using synapse shared secrets, but the UI for that isn't ready.
Also, I'm planning on adding some kind of small Matrix client in the management interface for manually managing the added bot clients. That might lead to a separate library that could be used in other projects or embedded in websites.</p>

<p>Before, there was a jarring cut when new messages were loaded, but now you can just scroll upward and older messages are loaded continuously.<br />The part I'm most excited about is the new &quot;new message divider&quot;. When the user opens a room they can directly start reading the conversation from the last seen message and they don't need to search for the new message divider. Not only has the UX gotten a lot better, but also the underlying code is much cleaner now.<br />I also spent some time on making message rendering faster. I replaced the RegExp with more efficient code, this made the rendering much faster (from ~10ms to ~ 1ms) for every single message.<br />In summary, all of these things improve Fractal's UX a lot and make it feel more like a modern messaging app.</p>

<h2 id="informo">Informo</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Informo">Informo</a> is a project to create a specification and implementation for distributing information and news. This week they have been working on merging changes to the specification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Work on the Informo specifications has slowed down a bit in the last couple of weeks, though since the last update we did manage to get some relatively big SCSs merged into the specs, including <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/9">SCS #9</a> (rendered <a href="https://specs.informo.network/information-distribution/article/">here</a>) which specifies how information sources must publish their information through the federation, and <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/11">SCS #11</a> (rendered <a href="https://specs.informo.network/information-distribution/source/">here</a>) which describes how sources must register themselves in order to be picked up by clients, and handle localisation. ?<br />There's still a couple of big items to take care of before we can cut a 1.0 release of the Informo specs but this is definitely a huge step towards this goal.</p>

<p>Last night Half-Shot &amp; Neil &amp; Brendan went to see the <a href="https://redecentralize.org/">Redecentralize</a> folk at their meetup:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beer! And pizza! And also Redecentralize<br />We chatted to a nice bunch of folks both demoing their decentralized projects and talked to the likes of scuttlebutt, BBC, IPFS and more. Was a interesting experience having around 8 minutes to quickly explain to newcomers what Matrix is and why they should use it in a speed dating format. We chatted (and demoed) bridges, <a href="https://riot.im/experimental/">new-riot</a> and generally how it all fits together. There were a lot of very interesting people with different profiles and backgrounds, and diversified questions which lead to a lot of interesting discussions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><small>Note for the confused: the <em>format of the meetup</em> was comparable to speed dating. There is no suggestion that Matrix should be used at regular speed dating.

<h2 id="zerophone">ZeroPhone</h2>
<p>This week we learned about ZeroPhone, a fairly mature project aiming to <a href="https://wiki.zerophone.org/index.php/Main_Page">build a working cellphone on top of a Raspberry Pi Zero</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an open-source smartphone that can be assembled for 50$ in parts. It is Linux-powered, with UI software written in Python.
Currently, ZeroPhone is based on Raspberry Pi Zero, SIM800L GSM modem and 1.3&quot; OLED screen and button interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@adam:thebeckmeyers.xyz">&amp;Adam</a> was the first to bring it to our attention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I stumbled across this blog post which mentions a matrix app in a project to create an open, hackable phone out of a raspberry pi. It's old news at this point I guess, but I don't think I've seen it mentioned here, so I thought it might be a neat thing worth featuring: <a href="https://zerophone.github.io/newsletter/ZeroPhone-Weekly-No.-16/">https://zerophone.github.io/newsletter/ZeroPhone-Weekly-No.-16/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creator of the Matrix app, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@derivmug:matrix.org">derivmug</a> also arrived to tell us about his work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey everyone, I have been suggested to post about the <a href="https://wiki.zerophone.org/index.php/Main_Page">Zerophone project here</a>. I have written a basic matrix client for it. It's basically a simple phone based on a raspberry pi zero, focused on privacy, security and hackability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The client app is built using the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a>, I'm also hoping to chat to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@derivmug:matrix.org">derivmug</a> as part of a future Matrix Live. <a href="https://github.com/ZeroPhone/ZPUI/tree/devel/apps/matrix">Take a look at the code here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:feneas.org">Jason Robinson</a> is passionate about Federated technology, and has been working on his site at <a href="https://the-federation.info/">https://the-federation.info/</a> for some time. He recently added Matrix to the list of protocols he scrapes and lists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrix (or more specifically, Synapse) servers are now visible on the The Federation info website at <a href="https://the-federation.info/matrix%7Csynapse">https://the-federation.info/matrix%7Csynapse</a>. The website collects lists of servers for various federation protocols (like Matrix, ActivityPub, Diaspora, etc). If a server outputs usage information, it also shows some historical information for servers and projects. Currently the information available from Synapse on the site is just version, availability of registrations and (obviously) domain name. If you want to register your server, check https://the-federation.info/info for more details. Tips also welcome on how to register other Matrix server projects and how to get more data out of servers.</p>

<p>matrix-appservice-discord received a lot of work these past days.
Not only the usual small bugfixes, but also some rather big changes:
The parsers for both Discord-&gt;Matrix sending and Matrix-&gt;Discord sending were re-written completely to properly handle things (and thus, at the same time, crunch a bunch of edge-case bugs!).
In addition, the long-awaited highlighting issues with @ everyone and @ here (on discord) and @ room (on matrix) were addressed.
Some of these things are still in PR stage, but expected to be merged soon!</p>

<h2 id="spec-foundation">Spec &amp; Foundation</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Two workshops happened with the Foundation lawyers to work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318">MSC1318</a> - basically fleshing out a proposal for the details of the foundation governance in terms of how the Guardians (i.e. directors of the foundation board) should interact with the Core Spec Team to act as a back-stop - and working out how to port the MSC (once finished) into formal Articles of Association & adjunct documents. We'll get the workshop notes written up as a rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318">MSC1318</a> very shortly.</li>
 	<li>New MSCs from vdH on:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1721">MSC1721</a> Rename m.login.cas to m.login.sso</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1730">MSC1730</a> Mechanism for redirecting to an alternative server during login</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>…and an alternate to MSC1730: MSC1731 Mechanism for redirecting to an alternative server during SSO login.</li>
 	<li>These three SSO-related MSCs are derived from work being done for a large-scale Matrix deployment for a New Vector customer which we should be able to talk about in future. Improving SSO and other auth/identity work in Matrix is vital, and needless to say we're trying to ensure all the resulting work ends up in the spec to the benefit of the whole ecosystem :)</li>

Until now, the playbook was only suited for setting up a private server, but with this, setting up public servers is now a possibility. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/anadahz">@anadahz</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm quite happy that the playbook is getting more contributions from others now and is improving in such diverse ways!</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com">#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com</a> support room in Matrix is now bridged to the <code>#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</code> IRC Freenode channel, making it easier for people to get support when they don't have a working homeserver.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tijder/SmsMatrix">SMSMatrix</a> now has a room (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#smsmatrix:matrix.org">#smsmatrix:matrix.org</a>).

<p>I had a very quick play with this tool and it works great - a good way to quickly bridge SMS to Matrix.</p>

            <p>Well here you are then, the 9th episode in the Synapse 0.33.x series.</p>
<p>Features wise, 0.33.9 contains a change to the way that GDPR consent works under the hood. It is now plumbed in to the login flow (rather than following immediately afterwards) such that it does not inadvertently break on-boarding. This is part of a broader set of changes that span Synapse and Riot to improve initial first impressions of using matrix.</p>
<p>Separately we now have support for room version upgrades which is pre-requisite for rolling out the new state resolution algorithm, come and join us in #teststateresv2:jki.re if you would like to help us test.</p>
<p>Finally we've spent a bunch of time further improving perf especially in and around reducing device ids federation traffic.</p>
<p>I know I say it every time, but full python 3 support is really really close now, matrix.org is now running entirely on py3 and seeing some amazing perf improvements - the remaining blocker is getting py3 deb packages ready and then we'll ship an official python 3 release. There will also be a blog post to explain what we've been up to and what to expect perf wise.</p>
<p>As ever, you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.9">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.

<p>TWIM (but actually over the last few weeks), thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://github.com/d3m3vilurr">a new contributor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack">matrix-puppet-slack</a> v1.7.0 and v1.8.0 have been released, fixing a number of old and new issues and adding support for new types of Slack events, including bidirectional @-mentions, Slack-to-Matrix typing notifications, fixing Slack-to-Matrix image/file uploads with comments, and more!
The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-bridge/">matrix-puppet-bridge</a> projects have gotten relatively quiet over the past year or so, but there's still plenty of bridges with plenty of features to implement and plenty of bugs to fix (and, even more importantly, bugs to <em>report</em>!) for any would-be-contributors who'd like to use a trusted Matrix homeserver as their double-puppetting Slack/iMessage/Facebook/GroupMe/iChat/Skype/Hangouts/Signal/Tox client from which to brag to their friends on the other platforms about how great Matrix is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The maubot management UI has progressed well, but isn't quite ready yet. I think it should be usable by Next Week in Matrix.
It can be used to set up and configure a maubot instance and plugins. Once it's ready, it should be possible to do everything except installing maubot itself through the UI: installing and updating plugins, adding matrix clients, configuring plugin instances, viewing logs, etc.</p>

<h2 id="hk-bot-is-an-anti-abuse-bot">HK Bot is an anti-abuse bot</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee">Coffee</a> continues his streak of TWIM mentions by bringing a new bot to combat abuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/HKBot">HK Bot</a> is an anti-abuse bot for public <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a> chatrooms.
This is a bot that really shouldn't exist, but since some people just like to make others' lives more difficult, here we are.
The purpose of this bot is twofold. It can automatically oversee rooms and respond to abuse, based on programmable pattern rules, providing a stop-gap measure in case no human moderators are nearby. It can also automate some tedious tasks via its command interface, the primary one being the complete redaction of all of an abuser's messages.
HK Bot is still under construction and contains dangerous features. Use with caution.</p>

This bot essentially lets you use ASCII characters to get an output in IPA. The advantage of this is that you can much more easily type and transmit pronunciation (because you don't need to find the characters).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll just have to make it a bit more configurable, but then I'll throw the source up
When making constructed languages and talking about linguistics, it's nice to get an easily readable IPA representation of a word, but it's really hard to write IPA, which is why x-sampa exists as a way to input IPA with a normal keyboard!</p>

<p>Alex has managed the invaluable <a href="https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php">https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php</a> for some years, but in two weeks time will be making some changes to the page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just wanted to let everyone know that changes are coming to the server list: I've put up a notice on the site that starting Nov 16th I will only show a curated list of servers I would recommend to join.<br />This reduces the workload for me quite a bit and avoids me becoming some kind of arbiter on what encompasses the Matrix universe… I think it is also more useful for users who are looking for a server to join.<br />And there is always <a href="https://matrixstats.org">matrixstats.org</a> for those who are looking for a more complete-ish list of known homeservers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a> management API I mentioned last week is now mostly ready. It should be possible to use it to set up a maubot instance and plugins without filling the database manually. There's no UI yet though, so it still means <code>curl</code>ing manually.<br />The management API also supports the fancy plugin reloading stuff which was the &gt; reason I rewrote maubot in python: You can <code>POST</code> an updated plugin to the API and it'll install it without having to restart.<br />I also made a bunch of plugins while working on the API that I used to test the API: a <a href="https://github.com/maubot/dice">dice rolling/calculator bot</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/maubot/media">bot that replies with the MXC URI of images you send it</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/maubot/echo">simple echo/ping bot</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/maubot/xkcd">xkcd bot</a></p>

<p><a href="/blog/2018/11/01/synapse-v0-33-8-is-here/">Synapse 0.33.8 was released</a>, and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrew:shadura.me">andrewsh</a> made sure it was updated on Debian. <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixdotorg/synapse/">Docker packages</a> are also updated.</p>
<h2 id="mxisd-v1-2-0-rc-1">mxisd v1.2.0-rc.1</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> has updates on mxisd, Identity Server for Matrix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mxisd <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.2.0-rc.1">v1.2.0-rc.1</a> is out with support of all features for the <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/blob/master/docs/stores/exec.md">Exec Identity Store</a>, allowing connectivity to totally custom/arbitrary backends. Feedback is extremely welcome!</p>

<h2 id="half-shot-interfaces-with-libpurple">Half-Shot interfaces with libpurple</h2>
<p>It's a job that someone needed to do, and that someone was <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> (who else?)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been reviving node-purple (a library for communicating with libpurple) and making a brand new bridge service to make use of it called <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a>. Today I got it to the point where you could link your XMPP account to your matrix user and have it bridge PMs over.<br />Work is ongoing to make it bridge group chats, profiles, contacts lists and support other protocols better in the coming weeks</p>

<h2 id="nsfw-image-detection-api-on-matrix">NSFW image detection API (on Matrix)</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> is often found working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a> (previously 'Matrique'.) This week, he has been building <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nsfw:encom.eu.org">@nsfw:encom.eu.org</a>, which is a bot designed to give scores for how likely an image should be classified as NSFW. It's a simple mechanism, you give it an image, it gives you a JSON object with the result. For example:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nsfw-bot.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3734" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nsfw-bot.png" alt="" width="936" height="1004" /></a></p>
<p>My avatar returned less than 1% probability of being NSFW, which I was actually a little offended by.</p>
<p>To talk more about the bot and it's development, chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nsfw:encom.eu.org">#nsfw:encom.eu.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gaming-discord-bridging">Gaming Discord bridging</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@swedneck:swedneck.xyz">swedneck</a> has been dutifully bridging channels from the Linux Gaming discord.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All but 3 channels on the linux gaming discord have now been bridged to matrix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To find these channels, join the community at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/+linux-gaming:matrix.org">+linux-gaming:matrix.org</a> and get chatting.</p>
<h2 id="other-thoughts">Other thoughts</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> is forced by his employers to use Viber, so is thinking of creating a Matrix bridge.</li>
 	<li>I spent some time this week repeatedly installing Synapse, then working with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@natrius:matrix.org">Stefan</a> to create a new, hopefully definitive installation guide (available soon). I can also personally recommend <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> project, this is a great way to get a Synapse installation (and more!) running.</li>
 	<li>lately in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> posters have been providing much clearer and atomic updates, which I like a lot</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="matrix-live-season-3-episode-2">Matrix Live, season 3 episode 2</h2>
<p>We continue the new season of Matrix Live. This re-booted season has a slightly different format to previous: in each outing, there will be a single deep-dive topic. This week, Matthew and recent-Matrix-arrival Nad discuss UX for E2E encryption key handling. This is an unsurprisingly complex design question, both in terms of how it should behave and how it should look. Nad shared his <a href="/blog/2018/11/02/user-experience-preview-end-to-end-encryption-by-default/">latest thinking in a blog post earlier today</a>, and you can watch the video below.</p>

<h2 id="farewell">Farewell</h2>
<p>Enjoy your week. We'll see you back here next week, but if you are working on something using Matrix, come chat with us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a>!</p>
