<p>MAJOR milestone for <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> this week!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Twimians! After many weeks of creativity, pain, and slack, the bridge team are proud to present our first release candidate for the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc1">slack bridge</a>. This release brings in a ton of new changes that should massively improve the slack&lt;-&gt;matrix experience. The headline features are Postgres support, Puppeting, RTM (websocket) support as well as an entirely refactored codebase written in Typescript.</p>
<p>This release has made heavy changes to the schema of the slack bridge and as such we are not recommending that anyone upgrade their existing slack bridge instances to 1.0.0-rc1. A migration script is currently being worked on, but for the time being <strong>existing installs</strong> should not be upgraded to 1.0.0 release candidates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi all! I haven't been around much because our homeserver chugs a little when federation is enabled, but I've got a few updates to share about Scylla, the Elm-based web client for Matrix:</p>
<ol>
<li>There have been a few optimization changes. The naive Elm approach leads to recomputing room names and usernames on every keystroke, which causes huge performance issues in rooms with many users (like #freenode_#haskell!). The new versions of Scylla avoid recomputing room names and message HTML, leading to much better performance in large rooms and rooms where a lot of history is loaded.</li>
<li>The recommended fixes in the spec regarding flickering have been implemented, and messages should no longer flicker.</li>
<li>&quot;m.notice&quot; and &quot;m.emote&quot; events are now supported</li>
<li>There has been a minor visual update to make the interface look a little more consistent and professional.</li>

<p>Had some free time and ideas this week, so I've improved my <a href="https://github.com/ananace/matrix-releasetracker">release tracking bot</a> to now correctly handle repos mixing full releases as well as tags (lightweight and/or annotated). GitHub's API really sucks in the tags department, so this required a rework to GraphQL queries instead, and it's looking good on that so far.
The bot currently still only handles tracking all starred repos of a given account on GitHub, but I'm working on GitLab support, as well as support for tracking arbitrary repos. And a provisioning API is also somewhere on the roadmap,</p>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>During GSoC 2019, I participated in and pushed forward the development of
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>, a high-performance, scalable <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/introduction">Matrix
homeserver</a> implementation written
in Go.</p>
<p>Like many others passionate about Dendrite, I've been eager to see the day when
it finally joins the decentralised, federated <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix
network</a>, so I worked on the project to see how much I
could do to bridge the gap between it and the current reference homeserver
implementation, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a>, in terms of
feature completeness.</p>
<p>Working on Dendrite in just one area would be insufficient to propel it, so my
work covers various
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/WIRING.md">components</a>
in the project, including the Client/Server API, Sync Server, Room Server,
and Federation Component. I also spent time refining the project's
documentation, improving its testing/continuous integration process, as well as
reviewing pull requests from Matrix.org members and the community.</p>
<p>Below is the major portion of my work presented as pull requests, categorised by
the components they belong to; a list of links to all the pull requests I
created/reviewed is also available at the end of this report.</p>
<h2 id="work-in-component-client-server-api">Work in Component: Client/Server API</h2>

<h2 id="appendix-on-dendrite-being-a-gsoc-project">Appendix: On Dendrite Being a GSoC Project</h2>
<p>I believe that Dendrite is a pretty special project to work on in the GSoC
program.</p>
<p>At its current state, Dendrite isn't a complete homeserver yet. This has left a
large portion of work on Dendrite wide open: As I worked on Dendrite, more than
often I'd find myself in a place to answer questions related to topics like
design or project architecture which, if not thoroughly thought through, might
have consequences in the future development of the project. For this reason, I
think working on Dendrite involves a set of challenges quite different from what
attempting to improve an already functioning piece of software would have
presented.</p>
<p>For the same reason, I think what Dendrite has taught me during the
summer was less about how to become more fluent in Go or more familiar with
various tools, but more about developing the mindset that powers software
projects behind the scenes. But this mindset, to myself, seems more valuable
than the former, indeed.</p>
<p>And at the end of this report, I'd like to thank my mentors
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> and
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a>, as well as everyone else
at Matrix who has answered my questions, discussed with me, and helped me
understand the code, and at the same time being super responsive. Without your
help, my GSoC experience wouldn't have been this enjoyable! :)</p>

<h2 id="the-work-done">The work done</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve been taking care of the project ‚ÄúMatrix Visualisations‚Äù during these past months. This project aimed at initiating the development of a tool which allows the real-time visualisation of the events DAG of a given Matrix room, as seen from the perspective of one or more homeservers (HS‚Äôs).</p>
<p>Regarding my initial proposal, I‚Äôve completed every task proposed and even implemented some additional functionalities. The application is not finished yet and there could be a lot of improvements added to it (especially regarding the design of the UI) but the core functionalities have been implemented.<br/>
I am going to precise what has been accomplished and then give some ideas of features to improve.</p>
<p>During GSoC, I have used two separate repositories for <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations">the frontend</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend">the backend</a>. I will keep both of them because I‚Äôm referencing PRs from them (as PRs are easier to link than lengthy lists of commits).<br/>
However, this is <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-complete">the repository</a> regrouping these two parts and this one will be moved to matrix-org for the continuation of this project.</p>
<h3 id="complete-the-implementation-of-the-cs-api-backend">Complete the implementation of the CS API backend</h3>
<p>During the application period, I wrote a prototype for this project. This prototype implemented some requests to the CS API (like <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-login">/login</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#post-matrix-client-r0-logout">/logout</a> or <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-sync">/sync</a>) but there were more requests to implement in order to be able to fully use this API:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order for the application to automatically join (and leave at the end) a room if the provided account hasn‚Äôt already joined it, I implemented the requests to <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-joined-rooms">/joined_rooms</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#post-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-join">/join</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#post-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-leave">/leave</a>.</li>
<li>The request <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-messages">/messages</a> has been implemented to allow the application to fetch previous messages.</li>
<li>For retrieving in real-time new events, I used the field <code>from</code> in the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-sync">/sync</a> request.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also did a lot of clean up in the source code from the prototype during this task. You can have more details in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/1">this PR</a>.</p>
<h3 id="implement-the-first-ui-to-interact-with-the-dag">Implement the first UI to interact with the DAG</h3>
<p>First of all, a lot of work had to be made in order to properly update the displayed DAG when adding new events to it. At this point, I previously used the <code>setData</code> method of the <code>Network</code> object of <a href="https://visjs.org/">the visjs library</a> (which is used for displaying the graph and interacting with it) each time a node was added, but it was resetting the display each time it was called.<br/>
The proper solution was to progressively add nodes and edges to the <code>DataSet</code> object passed to the constructor of the network (see the documentation of <a href="https://visjs.github.io/vis-data/data/index.html">DataSet</a> and <a href="https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/">Network</a> for more details).</p>
<p>The DAG has been set to be displayed vertically, the events with the same depth are at the same level, the deepest events are at the bottom. The events which origin is the HS on which we are making the observation are in green, those which are coming from other servers are in orange.
Here is a picture of what it looks like:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/events_display.png" alt="Events display" title="Events display" /></p>
<p>In the graph, there is a special node just after the earliest event which allows us to ask the application to load more events. Here is what it looks like:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/more_events_button.png" alt="More Events button" title="More Events button" /></p>
<p>When you double click on the node of an event, there is a text area on the right which displays its complete JSON body, like this:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/body_display.png" alt="JSON body display" title="JSON body display" /></p>
<p>I‚Äôve also implemented the possibility to choose which particular fields of the event can be directly displayed in the labels of the nodes of the displayed graph:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/fields_selection.png" alt="Fields selection" title="Fields selection" /></p>
<h3 id="synapse-postgresql-backend">Synapse PostgreSQL backend</h3>
<p>Next, I implemented a backend for retrieving events from the PostgreSQL database of a Synapse HS. It is a small HTTP server which receives requests from the frontend application and then makes queries to the Synapse database to get the requested events.<br/>
You can find details about the API for using this backend in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/blob/master/README.md">this readme</a>, in the ‚ÄúHTTP REST API‚Äù section.<br/>
You can find more details about this initial implementation: <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/1">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/2">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/3">here</a> (my mentor helped me on this one, thanks to him), and <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/5">here</a>.<br/>
I‚Äôve added the support of this backend in the frontend application, as well as a way to choose which backend to use (between this one and the CS API) in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/4">this PR</a>.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-views">Multiple views</h3>
<p>I implemented the ability to observe the same DAG of a room from multiple HS‚Äôs. This is done with ‚Äúviews‚Äù.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/backend_selection.png" alt="View selection" title="View selection" /></p>
<p>In the picture above, you can see that there is a drop down menu from which you can select the view. The fields under this line are used to control the selected view: indicate where it will be connecting, for which room (you could as well observe a different room in a different view), etc‚Ä¶<br/>
By default, there is only one view but you can add as many as you want by clicking ‚ÄúAdd a view‚Äù.</p>
<p>All the DAGs from the different views are displayed side-by-side within the same canvas, like this:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/multiple_dags.png" alt="Multiple DAGs" title="Multiple DAGs" /></p>
<p>You can have a look at the details of the implementation in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/6">this PR</a>.</p>
<h3 id="add-federation-api-support">Add Federation API support</h3>
<p>The next major task I had to do was the implementation of a backend for retrieving events via the Federation API. I thought a lot about the possible options for the location of this backend and I decided to extend the web server created for the PostgreSQL Synapse backend, so that we could launch it in a ‚Äúpostgres mode‚Äù or ‚Äúfederation mode‚Äù. But the backend would offer the same HTTP API in both modes.</p>
<p>The backend uses <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3">the Federation API</a> in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before being able to retrieve events from a certain room, the backend must join it with <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#get-matrix-federation-v1-make-join-roomid-userid">/make_join</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#put-matrix-federation-v1-send-join-roomid-eventid">/send_join</a> requests, it creates an ‚Äúimaginary user‚Äù in this room. The join event created during this process will be the one returned by the endpoint <code>/deepest</code>.</li>
<li>To get earlier events, the backend uses <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#get-matrix-federation-v1-backfill-roomid">/backfill</a> requests.</li>
<li>In order to get new events, the backend listens for pushed events from other HS‚Äôs with the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#put-matrix-federation-v1-send-txnid">/send</a> request.</li>
<li>When the observation is done, the backend makes the ‚Äúimaginary user‚Äù leave the room by sending <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#get-matrix-federation-v1-make-leave-roomid-userid">/make_leave</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#put-matrix-federation-v1-send-leave-roomid-eventid">/send_leave</a> requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full details of the implementation are in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/8">this PR</a>. My mentor also helped me get the usage of the <code>Future</code>s  right thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/7">this PR</a>.<br/>
There has been a small modification in the frontend too, because of the addition of the <code>/stop</code> endpoint in the backend‚Äôs HTTP API, these modifications are in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/7">this PR</a>.</p>
<h3 id="display-the-state-of-the-room-for-a-given-event">Display the state of the room for a given event</h3>
<p>For each event, there is a state of the room associated with it, which describes what was the state of the room at the moment this event was accepted (the name of the room, its topic, its members and parameters, etc‚Ä¶).<br/>
So I‚Äôve added a way to display this: when you have selected and displayed the JSON body of a given event, you can also request the associated room‚Äôs state. I have made it possible to use this feature with every backends: the CS API, the PostgreSQL database and the Federation API. You can have the full details of the implementation <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/9">here</a> (for the backend) and <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/8">here</a> (for the frontend).</p>
<p>You can see the result of this feature in the picture below (there is a button ‚ÄúRoom state at the selected event‚Äù, which allows to ask the application to fetch the state, and the text area under this button where the state is displayed):
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/room_state.png" alt="Room's state display" title="Room's state display" /></p>
<h3 id="additional-fixes">Additional fixes</h3>
<p>Lastly, I‚Äôve applied small fixes to the code of the backend, you can see them in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/9">this PR</a>.</p>
<h2 id="possible-improvements">Possible improvements</h2>
<p>The objective of this project was to develop the core functionalities of this application, however there are a lot of improvements to bring to it, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding the possibility to start the observation of a room from any events (provided that we have the ID of this events) instead of the latest one.</li>
<li>These hasn‚Äôt been any UI/UX work design, the CSS style sheet is minimal and the overall look isn‚Äôt beautiful or correctly organised. So there would be a lot of work to be done in this area by people with better knowledge in this field than me.</li>
<li>The timestamps of the events are not displayed in a human readable format and would be written as dates and hours to greatly improve the readability.</li>
<li>The application has been tested a lot, especially in situations of misusage. I‚Äôve fixed some bugs which occurred when I was testing it but it was far from being an exhaustive testing, so there could be many improvements regarding the overall robustness of this software.</li>
<li>The backend supports HTTPS connections but has no mechanism for controlling the access of the data behind it (in particular, it means that if you should not run on a production database as it would basically allow anyone to access any data on it). So more work would be needed to make it secure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This experience has been really rewarding for me. I could discover more about the Matrix community and how the Matrix ecosystem works (on a technical point of view). I want to thank my mentor, Erik Johnston, for his guidance during these past months, and the people in this community who gave me advice.</p>
<p>GSoC has also allowed me to further improve my programming skills in general and discover many various things: the WASM technology, how to use Rust in this context thanks to the various existing libraries/frameworks available, the practical usage of SQL requests as well as TLS certificates and how to apply cryptographic signatures.<br/>
It was sometimes challenging to use such experimental technologies (due to the lack of clear documentation) but also very exiting!</p>
<p>Mid-September, I will start my class for my second and final year of my master degree (software engineering, specialised in distributed systems and applications) at Sorbonne Universit√© so I will definitely have less free time. So I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to actively continue to contribute but I will do my best to help other people to continue the work I‚Äôve initiated.</p>

<p>This week privacy items have dominated, but we‚Äôve also been edging towards getting our room directory improvements out, shipping a new configuration creator and making further progress on the federation side bus project to improve performance of smaller instances.</p>
<p>We also deployed open tracing on matrix.org, which will help a lot in tracking down all sorts of strange behaviour in the wild and fixing some bugs in the sqlite -&gt; postgres migrator.</p>
<p>Next week we‚Äôll land the room directory improvements, much of the privacy work, and have the configuration creator ready for testing.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Construct is implementing the concept of invisibility for users:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exact mechanism for invisibility is not completely finished but there are obviously some limitations for this feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only users who are local to the server can set any kind of invisibility. Remote users are always fully listed. One day when the spec has &quot;user's rooms&quot; we would be glad to adhere to an <code>m.user.invisible</code>-etc configuration state event in such a room</li>
<li>Since there is no federation support for user's rooms list publication, the rooms list for a user is limited to what the server knows (rooms it has seen the user in).</li>
</ul>
<p>Construct is eager to implement any MSC's regarding user room and group membership listing over the federation.</p>

This is an effort to address some issues that new users hit in the first days of using Riot. See <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/projects/16#card-25137120">https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/projects/16#card-25137120</a> and Matthew talking over the details at <a href="https://youtu.be/JYsiHSL0lEA?t=710">https://youtu.be/JYsiHSL0lEA?t=710</a>. Letterboxes in the left panel will likely only be removed as part of the new community project though, as we need parts of the new community UX to keep things usable for power users.</p>

<p>Also, if you're using <a href="https://riot.im/develop">https://riot.im/develop</a> please enable the new composer in Labs, it works well and deserves testing.</p>
<h3 id="continuum-desktop-client-many-updates">Continuum desktop client, many updates</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uforia:matrix.org">yuforia</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/koma-im/continuum-desktop">Continuum</a> desktop client written in pure Kotlin, version 0.9.20:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated login page appearance</li>
<li>Added validation to user ID and server address fields</li>
<li>The server address gets automatically filled with <code>https://</code> followed by server name when user ID is being typed</li>
<li>After signing in, the token and server address are automatically saved</li>
<li>Added progress indicator when being signed in. It doesn't block user from controlling Continuum,  pressing Esc will cancel the signing-in process.</li>
<li>Speed up application start-up by drawing the window and opening the database in parallel. Now the window typically appears within half a second with its size and position on screen restored to be the same as the last time it was opened. The most recently used accounts get loaded and automatically filled within a second.</li>
<li>Added drop shadow effect to scroll-to-latest-messages button to increase contrast</li>
<li>Fix: Always retry synchronization after getting a network error. Previous versions didn't retrieve new messages in a timely manner when the network is unreliable. A delay is added if the error is not a time-out to avoid stressing the homeserver.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma-library">koma</a> the Kotlin library behind Continuum:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix suspend/hibernate detection. Synchronization is restarted automatically after the computer resumes from sleeping. The reason is that any previously opened connection is unlikely to be still alive, opening new connections reduces delay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix incorrect interface declaration that caused login to fail</p>

Mass redactions are useful for fighting spam (and bridging telegram deletions) more efficiently. Asynchronous media uploads would make it possible for bridges (like telegram) to handle messages synchronously and thus keep message ordering without blocking all messages behind some media upload.</p>

<p>Jason from Construct:</p>

<p>Construct added support for server notice rooms. As the server administrator I've placed quick access to the server control room for myself in this section.</p>
<p>Construct has also added support for the server-side commands <code>\\read &lt;room-tag&gt;</code>, for example <code>\\read m.low_priority</code> will mark all low-priority tagged rooms as read. The command <code>\\read *</code> also will mark all rooms as read.</p>
<p>Also, we now allow users to configure whether they transmit typing events by setting state events in their home-room. If a user creates an event with the <code>type</code> of <code>ircd.typing.disable.send</code> and the <code>state_key</code> of the room_id, typing events will not be sent to that room for them. Further variations exist, such as <code>ircd.typing.disable.sync</code> to prevent the client from receiving typing events for a particular room or all rooms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Slack bridge has had a whole week of care applied to it. We've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/152">switched the bridge entirely over to Typescript</a>, and overhauled large parts of the codebase to make future work easier (for ex, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/185">using the Slack node library rather than request calls</a>). If that's not exciting enough, we've also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/164">added support for the RTM API</a>, which means the bridge can use websockets when talking to slack. This gives us nice things like typing updates, and the ability to deploy without needing a webserver to listen for events. Release 1.0 is imminent, but before then we are hoping to land <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/186">Postgresql support</a> so that the bridge can scale up to meet the high demands placed upon it.</p>

<p>This week we‚Äôve been working on getting our brand new room directory implementation ready, creating a new Synapse installer, and creating a TURN server testing tool. We‚Äôve also been pushing on with the privacy project and fixing up some bugs and perf issues.<br />
Next week it‚Äôs all about getting the room directory out of the door, shipping the installer and continuing on with the privacy project. We are in the early stages of a project designed to reduce the load caused by outbound SSL connections, it is looking very promising. We‚Äôre also going to give the sqlite-&gt;postgres porting script some love as well as working on some message retention ideas, and also ways to reduce the meta data we store.</p>

<p>Progress for Dendrite this week has been a bit starved due to ongoing privacy work from the backend team. However it continues to move forwards with the excellent help of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cnly:matrix.org">cnly</a> reviewing and merging PRs.</p>
<p>We had <strong>3 authors</strong> have pushed <strong>5 commits</strong> to master and <strong>6 commits</strong> to all branches. On master, <strong>14 files</strong> have changed and there have been <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/compare/master@%7B1565369184%7D...master">298 additions and 121 deletions</a>.</p>
<p>Notably we had <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@trion129:matrix.org">trion129</a>‚Äôs work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/405">providing a fallback webpage for recaptcha authentication</a> finally merged! This was another early PR that was dragged up from the bottom of the list to be modernised and integrated into the current codebase.</p>
<p>Also this week was <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/785">some work</a> from cnly on refactoring gomatrixserverlib and exposing some more of its internal constants to deduplicate code between itself and Dendrite.</p>
<p>Finally, we had some more work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/781">an unmerged PR</a> from cnly, which adds some internal query APIs for which servers are currently joined to a room, for use by other components later down the line.</p>
<p>No new Sytests are passing this week. We‚Äôre still currently at <strong>172 tests</strong> passing out of <strong>761 tests</strong> in total.</p>

<p>Since the coming 1.3.0 release is bringing along a whole bunch of perf improvements, (and I want to test them out on my IO starved setup) I'm building K8s optimized images of the RCs. Only the debian version of the image though.</p>

<p>They expanded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's basically the regular docker image, only with some changes to make it fit nicer in Kubernetes<br />
And there's no Helm chart at the moment, was poking at that for a bit but took a break from building one as I - back then - had trouble with the amount of data that had to be generated<br />
You can only have one Synapse pod at any given time, as it's not scalable. Though you can scale it with workers (as I do myself)<br />
Database-wise, I'm personally running three node HA clusters using Stolon</p>

<ul>
<li>Synapse now no longer accepts the <code>-v</code>/<code>--verbose</code>, <code>-f</code>/<code>--log-file</code>, or <code>--log-config</code> command line flags, and removes the deprecated <code>verbose</code> and <code>log_file</code> configuration file options. Users of these options should migrate their options into the dedicated log configuration. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5678">#5678</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5729">#5729</a>)</li>

            <p>Here at Matrix we‚Äôre frequently asked for official merch. While those who choose to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/matrixdotorg">sponsor Matrix development on Patreon</a> have always been blessed with branded t-shirts, it was otherwise very difficult to obtain official merch.</p>
<p>Today, those dark times have ended, as we announce the <strong><a href="https://shop.matrix.org/">Official Matrix Merch Store</a></strong>!</p>
<p>Now available from <strong><a href="https://shop.matrix.org/">shop.matrix.org</a></strong>, we‚Äôre offering packs of Stickers, T-Shirts, and Hoodies!</p>
<p>Stickers are provided in three types: hexagonal Matrix and Riot stickers, and rectangular transparent Matrix stickers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.matrix.org/"><img src="/blog/img/2019-08-09-stickers.jpg" alt="stickers" /></a></p>
<p>T-Shirts are available in all sizes and in Unisex and Women's editions. We‚Äôre using Gildan SoftStyle t-shirts, which are popular amongst printed shirts for being both soft and durable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.matrix.org/"><img src="/blog/img/2019-08-09-shirt.jpg" alt="T-Shirt" /></a></p>
<p>Matrix-branded hoodies are something very special. Superbly embroidered, they are comfortable and stylish. On a recent trip to San Francisco, a passerby stopped a Matrix guardian in the street and asked where they could buy a Matrix hoodie <em>without knowing what Matrix was</em>.</p>
<p>You really need one of these.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.matrix.org/"><img src="/blog/img/2019-08-09-hoodie.jpg" alt="Hoodie" /></a></p>
<p>All merchandise proceeds go to the Matrix.org Foundation, which helps fund Matrix development!</p>
<p><strong>The Official Matrix Merch Store is open now: <a href="https://shop.matrix.org/">shop.matrix.org</a>!</strong></p>
