            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>*<em>libQMatrixClient was <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/issues/325">renamed</a> to libQuotient</em></p>
<p>The project aimed at adding end-to-end encryption to <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient">libQuotient</a> for future support in Qt/libQuotient-based clients like <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/quaternion">Quaternion</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/spectral">Spectal</a>, or even <a href="https://github.com/TelepathyIM/telepathy-tank">Telepathy IM</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-work-done">The work done</h2>
<p>Regarding my initial <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/wiki/_GSoC-2019-E2EE-proposal">proposal</a>, I’ve completed tasks enough for message receiving, and not finished tasks related to message sending.</p>
<p>Focused on libQuotient, I've also <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/commits/aa13q-e2ee">added changes to Quaternion client</a> to support the proposed API and test the results.
I've reused libQtOlm, which is a Qt wrapper to the matrix olm library and <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/libqtolm/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;state=all&amp;author_username=aa13q">contributed to provide better compatibility during its building and deployment</a>.
This also required to dive into the olm library itself and provide <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/commit/aa0c9ab6b51d182cb78ab4cc75c81c0054765bde">minor patch</a> for the olm CMake files too.</p>
<p>So, the basic structure of the project changed a bit, libQtOlm was added as a dependency to support libolm:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>During the coding period, I've resorted to <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest">the specification</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/end-to-end-encryption-implementation-guide">the guide</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Zil0/matrix-python-sdk/wiki">last year GSoC python implementation</a> actively. And added <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2157">minor fix for the documentation</a> about names constants at the documentation examples.</p>
<h2 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h2>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/gGykLh4mVDg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BKmhvni.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></a></p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
<p>Talking about future work, the status is going to be captured at <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/projects">libQuotient project board</a>. Next steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing devices list for users in the room</li>
<li>Sending encrypted messages</li>
</ul>
<p>While olm account management architecture and <code>device_one_time_keys_count</code> sync data handling is here, such tasks as session management after a restart and device verification still requires additional efforts. After that encrypted attachments support and key backups could also be added.</p>
<p>I'm going to take care about that, but it definitely will be harder as just a side project. I still have enthusiasm though :)</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To take part in the Google Summer of Code project was my dream. I'm very happy I've managed to took part this year, since it was the last year of my study, while I had doubts about my personal results until I've received final confirmation and the review.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the project, I've realized I'm very lucky since I've got all the chances to provide perfect results. <a href="https://github.com/Kaffeine">@Kaffeine</a> helped me a lot with my TelepathyIM contribution. He helped me to evolve my CMake, git and Qt/C++ skills and that's how I've started contributing to the libQuotient before GSoC. After that, it turns out that I've accepted and received even two mentors. <a href="https://github.com/uhoreg">@uhoreg</a> from the Matrix team, who helped me with End-to-End Encryption logic and olm/megolm understanding. And <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal">@kitsune</a> from the Quotient project, who helped me a lot with the code review, with the architecture decisions and the library logic, and even with the time management (he was the one who watched carefully about my results). The last year GSoC python implementation and guide from <a href="https://github.com/Zil0">@Zil0</a> were also here, and it turns out that Spectral developer <a href="https://github.com/encombhat">@BHat</a> provided QtOlm wrapper right before GSoC stated.</p>
<p>However, planning and updating the plan were my weak points, where I've made key mistakes, such as poor combination with my regular part-time job. And I definitely should have reserved a small vacation at least for the final period of the project to handle tasks better.</p>
<p>In the end, I've managed to debug the mistakes and provided encrypted messages receiving that could already be used at the clients. Also, I evolved my skills and dived into the megolm E2EE subject. I'm willing to continue my contribution to develop libQuotient as full-featured Qt-based Matrix library. </p>
<p>In general, I am not disappointed. I'm wishing luck to all the future students who are reading this. I'm happy to receive support and contribute to an international open project not only for myself, but also for the other developers and users.</p>

<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p>Notes from Jason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct did a round of performance work and pursued some of the easier opportunities with the most effective returns. At present, the biggest performance bottleneck Construct experiences is with I/O, specifically latency from accessing disks in a random pattern. This week a few open opportunities for prefetch pipelines were taken, allowing the server to stream data directly from the disk to the client with minimal buffering. This was implemented in several places, mostly for the <code>/media/</code> system, and also for the <code>/members</code> lists, improving the performance of requesting the members of a room like #whalepool:ericmartindale.com .</p>
<p>There is one area though that requires a special mention for being an order of magnitude more impactful than any other area where a pipelined stream was placed. We have analyzed the way Riot conducts a room change, and by the simple placement of a prefetch operation when the server receives an <code>im.vector.breadcrumb_rooms</code>, which comes early during the room change, Construct is able to populate the room's timeline significantly faster. That has a compounding effect, as the browser initiates several requests based on (and after) the received timeline data- meaning those responses come significantly faster.</p>
<p>Construct is the community driven Matrix server written in C++ for maximum performance. Swing by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net">#test:zemos.net</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/</a> for more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Presenting <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/bridges/famedly-email-bridge">famedly-email-bridge</a>, a new email bridge! It is still early in development but can already send and receive emails.</p>
<p>Features so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receive emails by a prefix (e.g. <code>matrix_sorunome@myserver.com</code>, <code>matrix_otheruser@myserver.com</code>)</li>
<li>Send emails with said prefix</li>
<li>Receiving emails parses plain body, html body and attachments</li>
<li>Sending emails collects all messages for a given amount of time. After that it creates an email based on that! Supports edits, redactions and files (image, video, audio, file)!</li>
</ul>
<p>Things planned for the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Route emails to channels based on threading (reply-chain)</li>
<li>Send emails by making a new channel and inviting an email ghost and just sending messages!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="irc-bridge-progress-postgres">IRC bridge progress: postgres</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My other news that I forgot to mention is that I have a branch of the IRC bridge that runs off postgres, rather than flat file storage. It's much less memory/cpu intensive and might even offer a bit of a speedup :)</p>
<p>For ref: The current room/user store files for the freenode bridge take up 250MB when stored to disk. The existing storage system works on the principle of loading the whole datastore into memory and periodically saving to disk. Hopefully by <em>not</em> requiring the bridge to load all the state into memory, there are savings to be made.</p>

<p>MAJOR milestone for <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> this week!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Twimians! After many weeks of creativity, pain, and slack, the bridge team are proud to present our first release candidate for the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc1">slack bridge</a>. This release brings in a ton of new changes that should massively improve the slack&lt;-&gt;matrix experience. The headline features are Postgres support, Puppeting, RTM (websocket) support as well as an entirely refactored codebase written in Typescript.</p>
<p>This release has made heavy changes to the schema of the slack bridge and as such we are not recommending that anyone upgrade their existing slack bridge instances to 1.0.0-rc1. A migration script is currently being worked on, but for the time being <strong>existing installs</strong> should not be upgraded to 1.0.0 release candidates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi all! I haven't been around much because our homeserver chugs a little when federation is enabled, but I've got a few updates to share about Scylla, the Elm-based web client for Matrix:</p>
<ol>
<li>There have been a few optimization changes. The naive Elm approach leads to recomputing room names and usernames on every keystroke, which causes huge performance issues in rooms with many users (like #freenode_#haskell!). The new versions of Scylla avoid recomputing room names and message HTML, leading to much better performance in large rooms and rooms where a lot of history is loaded.</li>
<li>The recommended fixes in the spec regarding flickering have been implemented, and messages should no longer flicker.</li>
<li>&quot;m.notice&quot; and &quot;m.emote&quot; events are now supported</li>
<li>There has been a minor visual update to make the interface look a little more consistent and professional.</li>

<p>Had some free time and ideas this week, so I've improved my <a href="https://github.com/ananace/matrix-releasetracker">release tracking bot</a> to now correctly handle repos mixing full releases as well as tags (lightweight and/or annotated). GitHub's API really sucks in the tags department, so this required a rework to GraphQL queries instead, and it's looking good on that so far.
The bot currently still only handles tracking all starred repos of a given account on GitHub, but I'm working on GitLab support, as well as support for tracking arbitrary repos. And a provisioning API is also somewhere on the roadmap,</p>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>During GSoC 2019, I participated in and pushed forward the development of
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>, a high-performance, scalable <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/introduction">Matrix
homeserver</a> implementation written
in Go.</p>
<p>Like many others passionate about Dendrite, I've been eager to see the day when
it finally joins the decentralised, federated <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix
network</a>, so I worked on the project to see how much I
could do to bridge the gap between it and the current reference homeserver
implementation, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a>, in terms of
feature completeness.</p>
<p>Working on Dendrite in just one area would be insufficient to propel it, so my
work covers various
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/WIRING.md">components</a>
in the project, including the Client/Server API, Sync Server, Room Server,
and Federation Component. I also spent time refining the project's
documentation, improving its testing/continuous integration process, as well as
reviewing pull requests from Matrix.org members and the community.</p>
<p>Below is the major portion of my work presented as pull requests, categorised by
the components they belong to; a list of links to all the pull requests I
created/reviewed is also available at the end of this report.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-on-dendrite-being-a-gsoc-project">Appendix: On Dendrite Being a GSoC Project</h2>
<p>I believe that Dendrite is a pretty special project to work on in the GSoC
program.</p>
<p>At its current state, Dendrite isn't a complete homeserver yet. This has left a
large portion of work on Dendrite wide open: As I worked on Dendrite, more than
often I'd find myself in a place to answer questions related to topics like
design or project architecture which, if not thoroughly thought through, might
have consequences in the future development of the project. For this reason, I
think working on Dendrite involves a set of challenges quite different from what
attempting to improve an already functioning piece of software would have
presented.</p>
<p>For the same reason, I think what Dendrite has taught me during the
summer was less about how to become more fluent in Go or more familiar with
various tools, but more about developing the mindset that powers software
projects behind the scenes. But this mindset, to myself, seems more valuable
than the former, indeed.</p>
<p>And at the end of this report, I'd like to thank my mentors
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> and
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a>, as well as everyone else
at Matrix who has answered my questions, discussed with me, and helped me
understand the code, and at the same time being super responsive. Without your
help, my GSoC experience wouldn't have been this enjoyable! :)</p>

<h2 id="the-work-done">The work done</h2>
<p>I’ve been taking care of the project “Matrix Visualisations” during these past months. This project aimed at initiating the development of a tool which allows the real-time visualisation of the events DAG of a given Matrix room, as seen from the perspective of one or more homeservers (HS’s).</p>
<p>Regarding my initial proposal, I’ve completed every task proposed and even implemented some additional functionalities. The application is not finished yet and there could be a lot of improvements added to it (especially regarding the design of the UI) but the core functionalities have been implemented.<br/>
I am going to precise what has been accomplished and then give some ideas of features to improve.</p>
<p>During GSoC, I have used two separate repositories for <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations">the frontend</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend">the backend</a>. I will keep both of them because I’m referencing PRs from them (as PRs are easier to link than lengthy lists of commits).<br/>
However, this is <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-complete">the repository</a> regrouping these two parts and this one will be moved to matrix-org for the continuation of this project.</p>
<h3 id="complete-the-implementation-of-the-cs-api-backend">Complete the implementation of the CS API backend</h3>
<p>During the application period, I wrote a prototype for this project. This prototype implemented some requests to the CS API (like <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-login">/login</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#post-matrix-client-r0-logout">/logout</a> or <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-sync">/sync</a>) but there were more requests to implement in order to be able to fully use this API:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order for the application to automatically join (and leave at the end) a room if the provided account hasn’t already joined it, I implemented the requests to <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-joined-rooms">/joined_rooms</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#post-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-join">/join</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#post-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-leave">/leave</a>.</li>
<li>The request <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-messages">/messages</a> has been implemented to allow the application to fetch previous messages.</li>
<li>For retrieving in real-time new events, I used the field <code>from</code> in the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-sync">/sync</a> request.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also did a lot of clean up in the source code from the prototype during this task. You can have more details in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/1">this PR</a>.</p>
<h3 id="implement-the-first-ui-to-interact-with-the-dag">Implement the first UI to interact with the DAG</h3>
<p>First of all, a lot of work had to be made in order to properly update the displayed DAG when adding new events to it. At this point, I previously used the <code>setData</code> method of the <code>Network</code> object of <a href="https://visjs.org/">the visjs library</a> (which is used for displaying the graph and interacting with it) each time a node was added, but it was resetting the display each time it was called.<br/>
The proper solution was to progressively add nodes and edges to the <code>DataSet</code> object passed to the constructor of the network (see the documentation of <a href="https://visjs.github.io/vis-data/data/index.html">DataSet</a> and <a href="https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/">Network</a> for more details).</p>
<p>The DAG has been set to be displayed vertically, the events with the same depth are at the same level, the deepest events are at the bottom. The events which origin is the HS on which we are making the observation are in green, those which are coming from other servers are in orange.
Here is a picture of what it looks like:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/events_display.png" alt="Events display" title="Events display" /></p>
<p>In the graph, there is a special node just after the earliest event which allows us to ask the application to load more events. Here is what it looks like:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/more_events_button.png" alt="More Events button" title="More Events button" /></p>
<p>When you double click on the node of an event, there is a text area on the right which displays its complete JSON body, like this:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/body_display.png" alt="JSON body display" title="JSON body display" /></p>
<p>I’ve also implemented the possibility to choose which particular fields of the event can be directly displayed in the labels of the nodes of the displayed graph:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/fields_selection.png" alt="Fields selection" title="Fields selection" /></p>
<h3 id="synapse-postgresql-backend">Synapse PostgreSQL backend</h3>
<p>Next, I implemented a backend for retrieving events from the PostgreSQL database of a Synapse HS. It is a small HTTP server which receives requests from the frontend application and then makes queries to the Synapse database to get the requested events.<br/>
You can find details about the API for using this backend in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/blob/master/README.md">this readme</a>, in the “HTTP REST API” section.<br/>
You can find more details about this initial implementation: <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/1">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/2">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/3">here</a> (my mentor helped me on this one, thanks to him), and <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/5">here</a>.<br/>
I’ve added the support of this backend in the frontend application, as well as a way to choose which backend to use (between this one and the CS API) in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/4">this PR</a>.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-views">Multiple views</h3>
<p>I implemented the ability to observe the same DAG of a room from multiple HS’s. This is done with “views”.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/backend_selection.png" alt="View selection" title="View selection" /></p>
<p>In the picture above, you can see that there is a drop down menu from which you can select the view. The fields under this line are used to control the selected view: indicate where it will be connecting, for which room (you could as well observe a different room in a different view), etc…<br/>
By default, there is only one view but you can add as many as you want by clicking “Add a view”.</p>
<p>All the DAGs from the different views are displayed side-by-side within the same canvas, like this:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/multiple_dags.png" alt="Multiple DAGs" title="Multiple DAGs" /></p>
<p>You can have a look at the details of the implementation in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/6">this PR</a>.</p>
<h3 id="add-federation-api-support">Add Federation API support</h3>
<p>The next major task I had to do was the implementation of a backend for retrieving events via the Federation API. I thought a lot about the possible options for the location of this backend and I decided to extend the web server created for the PostgreSQL Synapse backend, so that we could launch it in a “postgres mode” or “federation mode”. But the backend would offer the same HTTP API in both modes.</p>
<p>The backend uses <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3">the Federation API</a> in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before being able to retrieve events from a certain room, the backend must join it with <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#get-matrix-federation-v1-make-join-roomid-userid">/make_join</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#put-matrix-federation-v1-send-join-roomid-eventid">/send_join</a> requests, it creates an “imaginary user” in this room. The join event created during this process will be the one returned by the endpoint <code>/deepest</code>.</li>
<li>To get earlier events, the backend uses <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#get-matrix-federation-v1-backfill-roomid">/backfill</a> requests.</li>
<li>In order to get new events, the backend listens for pushed events from other HS’s with the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#put-matrix-federation-v1-send-txnid">/send</a> request.</li>
<li>When the observation is done, the backend makes the “imaginary user” leave the room by sending <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#get-matrix-federation-v1-make-leave-roomid-userid">/make_leave</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#put-matrix-federation-v1-send-leave-roomid-eventid">/send_leave</a> requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full details of the implementation are in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/8">this PR</a>. My mentor also helped me get the usage of the <code>Future</code>s  right thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/7">this PR</a>.<br/>
There has been a small modification in the frontend too, because of the addition of the <code>/stop</code> endpoint in the backend’s HTTP API, these modifications are in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/7">this PR</a>.</p>
<h3 id="display-the-state-of-the-room-for-a-given-event">Display the state of the room for a given event</h3>
<p>For each event, there is a state of the room associated with it, which describes what was the state of the room at the moment this event was accepted (the name of the room, its topic, its members and parameters, etc…).<br/>
So I’ve added a way to display this: when you have selected and displayed the JSON body of a given event, you can also request the associated room’s state. I have made it possible to use this feature with every backends: the CS API, the PostgreSQL database and the Federation API. You can have the full details of the implementation <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/9">here</a> (for the backend) and <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/8">here</a> (for the frontend).</p>
<p>You can see the result of this feature in the picture below (there is a button “Room state at the selected event”, which allows to ask the application to fetch the state, and the text area under this button where the state is displayed):
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/room_state.png" alt="Room's state display" title="Room's state display" /></p>
<h3 id="additional-fixes">Additional fixes</h3>
<p>Lastly, I’ve applied small fixes to the code of the backend, you can see them in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/9">this PR</a>.</p>
<h2 id="possible-improvements">Possible improvements</h2>
<p>The objective of this project was to develop the core functionalities of this application, however there are a lot of improvements to bring to it, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding the possibility to start the observation of a room from any events (provided that we have the ID of this events) instead of the latest one.</li>
<li>These hasn’t been any UI/UX work design, the CSS style sheet is minimal and the overall look isn’t beautiful or correctly organised. So there would be a lot of work to be done in this area by people with better knowledge in this field than me.</li>
<li>The timestamps of the events are not displayed in a human readable format and would be written as dates and hours to greatly improve the readability.</li>
<li>The application has been tested a lot, especially in situations of misusage. I’ve fixed some bugs which occurred when I was testing it but it was far from being an exhaustive testing, so there could be many improvements regarding the overall robustness of this software.</li>
<li>The backend supports HTTPS connections but has no mechanism for controlling the access of the data behind it (in particular, it means that if you should not run on a production database as it would basically allow anyone to access any data on it). So more work would be needed to make it secure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This experience has been really rewarding for me. I could discover more about the Matrix community and how the Matrix ecosystem works (on a technical point of view). I want to thank my mentor, Erik Johnston, for his guidance during these past months, and the people in this community who gave me advice.</p>
<p>GSoC has also allowed me to further improve my programming skills in general and discover many various things: the WASM technology, how to use Rust in this context thanks to the various existing libraries/frameworks available, the practical usage of SQL requests as well as TLS certificates and how to apply cryptographic signatures.<br/>
It was sometimes challenging to use such experimental technologies (due to the lack of clear documentation) but also very exiting!</p>
<p>Mid-September, I will start my class for my second and final year of my master degree (software engineering, specialised in distributed systems and applications) at Sorbonne Université so I will definitely have less free time. So I don’t think I’ll be able to actively continue to contribute but I will do my best to help other people to continue the work I’ve initiated.</p>

<p>This week privacy items have dominated, but we’ve also been edging towards getting our room directory improvements out, shipping a new configuration creator and making further progress on the federation side bus project to improve performance of smaller instances.</p>
<p>We also deployed open tracing on matrix.org, which will help a lot in tracking down all sorts of strange behaviour in the wild and fixing some bugs in the sqlite -&gt; postgres migrator.</p>
<p>Next week we’ll land the room directory improvements, much of the privacy work, and have the configuration creator ready for testing.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Construct is implementing the concept of invisibility for users:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exact mechanism for invisibility is not completely finished but there are obviously some limitations for this feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only users who are local to the server can set any kind of invisibility. Remote users are always fully listed. One day when the spec has &quot;user's rooms&quot; we would be glad to adhere to an <code>m.user.invisible</code>-etc configuration state event in such a room</li>
<li>Since there is no federation support for user's rooms list publication, the rooms list for a user is limited to what the server knows (rooms it has seen the user in).</li>
</ul>
<p>Construct is eager to implement any MSC's regarding user room and group membership listing over the federation.</p>

<p>It's not the biggest release, but a release nonetheless.</p>
<h4 id="changes">Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Separate public and personal chats</li>
<li>Use a bullhorn icon for public chats without an avatar</li>
<li>Fix sync being started multiple times on startup</li>
<li>Fix the <code>room.member_count</code> error (might require clearing of data)</li>
<li>Many SDK changes, for features in future releases</li>
</ul>

<p>I made a few spec proposals: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2244">MSC2244: Mass redactions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2246">MSC2246: Asynchronous media uploads</a>. Mass redactions are useful for fighting spam (and bridging telegram deletions) more efficiently. Asynchronous media uploads would make it possible for bridges (like telegram) to handle messages synchronously and thus keep message ordering without blocking all messages behind some media upload.</p>

<p>Jason from Construct:</p>

<p>Construct added support for server notice rooms. As the server administrator I've placed quick access to the server control room for myself in this section.</p>
<p>Construct has also added support for the server-side commands <code>\\read &lt;room-tag&gt;</code>, for example <code>\\read m.low_priority</code> will mark all low-priority tagged rooms as read. The command <code>\\read *</code> also will mark all rooms as read.</p>
<p>Also, we now allow users to configure whether they transmit typing events by setting state events in their home-room. If a user creates an event with the <code>type</code> of <code>ircd.typing.disable.send</code> and the <code>state_key</code> of the room_id, typing events will not be sent to that room for them. Further variations exist, such as <code>ircd.typing.disable.sync</code> to prevent the client from receiving typing events for a particular room or all rooms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Slack bridge has had a whole week of care applied to it. We've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/152">switched the bridge entirely over to Typescript</a>, and overhauled large parts of the codebase to make future work easier (for ex, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/185">using the Slack node library rather than request calls</a>). If that's not exciting enough, we've also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/164">added support for the RTM API</a>, which means the bridge can use websockets when talking to slack. This gives us nice things like typing updates, and the ability to deploy without needing a webserver to listen for events. Release 1.0 is imminent, but before then we are hoping to land <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/186">Postgresql support</a> so that the bridge can scale up to meet the high demands placed upon it.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Neil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we’ve been working on getting our brand new room directory implementation ready, creating a new Synapse installer, and creating a TURN server testing tool. We’ve also been pushing on with the privacy project and fixing up some bugs and perf issues.<br />
Next week it’s all about getting the room directory out of the door, shipping the installer and continuing on with the privacy project. We are in the early stages of a project designed to reduce the load caused by outbound SSL connections, it is looking very promising. We’re also going to give the sqlite-&gt;postgres porting script some love as well as working on some message retention ideas, and also ways to reduce the meta data we store.</p>

<p>Progress for Dendrite this week has been a bit starved due to ongoing privacy work from the backend team. However it continues to move forwards with the excellent help of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cnly:matrix.org">cnly</a> reviewing and merging PRs.</p>
<p>We had <strong>3 authors</strong> have pushed <strong>5 commits</strong> to master and <strong>6 commits</strong> to all branches. On master, <strong>14 files</strong> have changed and there have been <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/compare/master@%7B1565369184%7D...master">298 additions and 121 deletions</a>.</p>
<p>Notably we had <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@trion129:matrix.org">trion129</a>’s work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/405">providing a fallback webpage for recaptcha authentication</a> finally merged! This was another early PR that was dragged up from the bottom of the list to be modernised and integrated into the current codebase.</p>
<p>Also this week was <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/785">some work</a> from cnly on refactoring gomatrixserverlib and exposing some more of its internal constants to deduplicate code between itself and Dendrite.</p>
<p>Finally, we had some more work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/781">an unmerged PR</a> from cnly, which adds some internal query APIs for which servers are currently joined to a room, for use by other components later down the line.</p>
<p>No new Sytests are passing this week. We’re still currently at <strong>172 tests</strong> passing out of <strong>761 tests</strong> in total.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> got some fixes to bugs that appeared during the move to mautrix-python. It also got a <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram/wiki/Manhole">manhole</a> similar to the one in synapse, which gives admins access to an interactive Python shell inside the bridge while it's running.
The main part of the manhole (server and repl) is <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python/blob/master/mautrix/util/manhole.py">in mautrix-python</a>, so you can expect the feature to appear in mautrix-facebook, mautrix-hangouts and possibly maubot in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> and mautrix-hangouts can now automatically add rooms to a user-specific community to help with filtering. mautrix-facebook is also getting that feature in the near future.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> now has a search command, which means you can now actually initiate conversation with facebook users.</p>

<li>Privacy work continues</li>
<li>STUN fallback server for assisting with voice &amp; video call negotiation (only used when your homeserver is not configured with it’s own TURN server) changed from Google to Matrix.org server and a prompt has been added to request permission before using the fallback server</li>
<li>Many small steps towards supporting user choice of identity servers and integration managers, including no identity server at all</li>

<p>Users can now download <a href="https://gitlab.com/cy8aer/bluepill/pipelines">artifacts from my gitlab account</a> since I got an SDK container from CoDerus running, cross compiling to Sailfish-RPMs in the Gitlab-Ci.

<li>Reimplement ScrollBar for the message list view to make it more consistent with Riot Web. It has a flat appearance now and only appears when the mouse hovers over the list of messages.

<li>Rewrite the list view partially to handle lists with several types of items more efficiently. The message list has text messages, images, membership updates, etc. Each type needs to be rendered differently, but items of the same type could reuse GUI components when they scroll into and out of view.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio">Ananace</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the coming 1.3.0 release is bringing along a whole bunch of perf improvements, (and I want to test them out on my IO starved setup) I'm building K8s optimized images of the RCs. Only the debian version of the image though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They expanded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's basically the regular docker image, only with some changes to make it fit nicer in Kubernetes<br />
And there's no Helm chart at the moment, was poking at that for a bit but took a break from building one as I - back then - had trouble with the amount of data that had to be generated<br />
You can only have one Synapse pod at any given time, as it's not scalable. Though you can scale it with workers (as I do myself)<br />
Database-wise, I'm personally running three node HA clusters using Stolon</p>

<p>Anton (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@antonivan:matrix.org">@antonivan:matrix.org</a>) is working at Matrix Towers this summer for work experience. He's been learning about Matrix and <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I made a Notification/Remind-Me-Bot using Travis's bot sdk, it took me 1 and half days, and is able to - set reminder, check reminder, cancel reminder, set interval reminder, cancel interval reminder. It is also able to store multiple reminders and cancel them using the numbers 1 - ∞ .
