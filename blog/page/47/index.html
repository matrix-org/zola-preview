<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">@slavi:devture.com</a> sent great news: <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> can now set up your homeserver using the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixdotorg/synapse/">Matrix Synapse Docker</a> image. In his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using this Ansible playbook is probably the easiest way to set up a fully-functioning Matrix homeserver on your own machine. The setup includes Matrix Synapse and some related services required to actually make it useful (automatically-managed HTTPS; STUN/TURN server for audio/video calls; Postgres database for Synapse; optionally riot-web; optionally Amazon S3 storage support)</p>

<p>Helpfully named <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@zeratax:dmnd.sh">Zeratax?utf8=✓</a> has released <a href="https://github.com/ZerataX/matrix-registration">matrix-registration</a>, an application which allows you to &quot;easily create tokens to invite users on your homeserver without the need to open up public registration&quot;. There is a public demo here: <a href="https://zeratax.github.io/matrix-registration/demo.html">https://zeratax.github.io/matrix-registration/demo.html</a></p>
<p>Says <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@zeratax:dmnd.sh">Zeratax</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>my personal problem was:
i didn't want to open up registration for everyone
i didn't want to register every account manually and have to worry about seeing passwords etc
now i can just share a link, e.g:
https://zeratax.github.io/matrix-registration/demo.html?token=JargonGingerYankee</p>
<p>and my friends can register.</p>
<p>these token can be restricted as one time usable only or by an expiration date.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last week dendrite was filtering events from user's into separate queues for each application service to eventually be given. Sending these events requires batching them up into transactions and then sending them to an HTTP endpoint on the application service. I'm happy to report that from today, that functionality is now implemented, along with graceful handling of both server and application service downtime.</p>

<p><a href="http://riot.im/">Riot</a> is undergoing a visual redesign, thanks to <a href="http://helminen.co/">Jouni Helminen</a>. Take a look at <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/a-sneak-peek-at-a-whole-new-riot-im-1114df653782">the redesign work on the Riot blog</a>. The changes are not radical, but will help standardise and modernise the Riot interface. Early feedback I've seen has been mostly positive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The user can now change the following settings: Avatar, display name, add and remove email addresses and phone numbers. Also, they can see the homeserver and their own MXID.<br />We will probably make some more small changes on the way to make the UX as good as we possibly can.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>As mentioned in our last <a href="/blog/2018/05/25/gdpr-on-matrix-org/">blog post on GDPR</a>, to make sure that everyone has read and understood the important details about how their personal data is processed by the matrix.org homeserver, users who haven't yet agreed to the <a href="/docs/guides/privacy_notice.html">privacy notice</a> and <a href="/docs/guides/terms_and_conditions.html">terms and conditions</a> will be blocked from sending new messages until they have.</p>
<p>Users will continue to be able to <em>receive</em> messages, so they won't miss out on any messages sent to them before they've agreed to the terms.</p>
<p>The System Alerts room has already sent every user their unique link to review and agree, and if anyone missed that message, the latest Riot.im web and mobile will display a helpful error message guiding users who are yet to agree through the agreement process.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or difficulties, please let us know at <a href="mailto:support@matrix.org">support@matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Tom</p>

            <p>If you've connected to the matrix.org homeserver today, you'll have noticed some activity in support of GDPR compliance. The most obvious of these is an invite from <strong>System Alerts</strong> (aka @server:matrix.org):</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/system_alerts_invite.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3247" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/system_alerts_invite.png" alt="" width="227" height="66" /></a></p>
<p>We've rolled out the System Alerts feature to communicate important platform information to all of a homeserver's users. Today, we're using it to communicate the arrival of our new (and much-improved) <a href="/docs/guides/privacy_notice.html">Privacy Notice</a> and <a href="/docs/guides/terms_and_conditions.html">Terms and Conditions</a> to users on matrix.org.</p>
<p>The System Alerts service takes the form of an (unrejectable) invite to a room. We took this approach to support maximum compatibility with the myriad Matrix clients (since all Matrix clients can support conversations in a room ?).</p>
<p>When we first rolled out System Alerts, we didn't allow users leave the System Alerts room. Sorry! We got a bit overexcited - we've fixed that now (though please do provide your agreement before you leave).</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-do">What do I need to do?</h2>
<p>At some point today the System Alerts service will provide you with unique link, directing you to review the new terms and provide your agreement.</p>
<p>For us to process your personal data lawfully, it's <strong>really important</strong> that we know you understand and agree to our <a href="/docs/guides/privacy_notice.html">Privacy Notice</a> and <a href="/docs/guides/terms_and_conditions.html">Terms and Conditions</a>. For that reason, we will shortly be blocking any users who haven't indicated their acceptance, so please act quickly when you receive your link.</p>
<p>Once the block is enabled, users who haven't accepted the terms will see an error when they try and send a message, join a room, or send an invite. This message will also include the unique link to review and accept the terms, so users who haven't seen the message from System Alerts will know what to do.</p>
<p>Don't worry if you're reading this some time after May 25 - accepting the terms at any time will unblock message sending on your account, and you won't have missed any messages sent to you.</p>
<p>If you have any thoughts or suggestions on the legal documentation, you can provide comment <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/tree/master/jekyll/_posts/guides">via github</a>.</p>

<p>v0.30.0 sees the introduction of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/server_notices.md">Server Notices</a>, which provides a channel whereby server administrators can send messages to users on the server, as well as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/consent_tracking.md">Consent Management</a> for tracking whether users have agreed to the terms and conditions set by the administrator of a server - and blocking access to the server until they have.</p>
<p>In conjunction these features support GDPR compliance in the form of providing a client agnostic means to contact users and ask for consent/agreement to a Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>For more information about our approach to GDPR compliance take a look <a href="/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/">here</a> (although be aware that our position has evolved a bit; see the upcoming new privacy policy for the Matrix.org homeserver for details).</p>
<p>Additionally there are a host of bug fixes and refactors as well as an enhancement to our Dockerfile.</p>

<h2 id="changes-in-synapse-v0-30-0-2018-05-24">Changes in synapse v0.30.0 (2018-05-24)</h2>
<p>'Server Notices' are a new feature introduced in Synapse 0.30. They provide a
channel whereby server administrators can send messages to users on the server.</p>
<p>They are used as part of communication of the server policies (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/consent_tracking.md">Consent Tracking</a>),
however the intention is that they may also find a use for features such
as &quot;Message of the day&quot;.</p>
<p>This feature is specific to Synapse, but uses standard Matrix communication mechanisms,
so should work with any Matrix client. For more details see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/server_notices.md">here</a>. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/server_notices.md"><code></code></a></p>

            <p>It's release time people, not to be outdone by our friends on the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/stickers-are-here-introducing-riot-im-0-15-for-web-desktop-284c32b93acc">Riot web team</a>, Synapse v0.29.1 lands today.</p>
<p>v0.29.1 contains an officially supported docker image (many thanks to the contribution from <a href="https://github.com/kaiyou">@kaiyou</a>), continued progress towards Python 3 (thanks to <a class="user-mention" href="https://github.com/NotAFile" data-hovercard-user-id="5447747" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" aria-describedby="hovercard-aria-description">@NotAFile</a>) - as well as a heap of refactorings and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Something worth noting is a potentially breaking change in the error code that /login returns in the Client Server API. Details follow, but the change closes a gap between Synapse behaviour and the spec.</p>
<p>We'd like to give huge thanks to Silvio Fricke and Andreas Peters for writing and maintaining <a href="https://github.com/AVENTER-UG/docker-matrix">Synapse's first Dockerfile</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/allmende/docker-synapse">allmende</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jcgruenhage/docker-synapse">jcgruenhage</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ptman/synapse-docker">ptman</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ilianaw/dockerfiles/tree/master/synapse">ilianaw</a> for theirs!  The new Dockerfile from kaiyou has ended up being merged into the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/master/contrib/docker">main synapse tree</a> and we're going to try to maintain it going forwards, but folks should use whichever one they prefer.</p>
<p>You can pick it up from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.29.1">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.29.1</a> and thanks to everyone who tested the release candidate.</p>
<h2 id="changes-in-synapse-v0-29-1-2018-05-17">Changes in synapse v0.29.1 (2018-05-17)</h2>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Update docker documentation (PR <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3222">#3222</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes-in-synapse-v0-29-0-2018-05-16">Changes in synapse v0.29.0 (2018-05-16)</h3>

<p>Potentially breaking change:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Make Client-Server API return 401 for invalid token (PR <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3161" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="319022836" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3161">#3161</a>).This changes the Client-server spec to return a 401 error code instead of 403 when the access token is unrecognised. This is the behaviour required by the specification, but some clients may be relying on the old, incorrect behaviour.Thanks to <a class="user-mention" href="https://github.com/NotAFile" data-hovercard-user-id="5447747" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" aria-describedby="hovercard-aria-description">@NotAFile</a> for fixing this.</li>

<p><a href="https://brendan.abolivier.bzh/">Brendan</a> produced a <a href="https://brendan.abolivier.bzh/enter-the-matrix/">really, really informative article introducing Matrix</a>. As someone who is still very new to the project I found this writng to be very clear and informative, so thank you! The article made it to the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17063761">top of Hacker News</a>, where you can find a discussion of both the article and Matrix itself.</p>
<h3 id="presentation-about-matrix">Presentation about Matrix</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/martinkrafft">martinkrafft</a> presented about Matrix at <a href="https://wossat.nz/">wossat</a> a New Zealand Open Source show and tell meetup. His talk <a href="https://twitter.com/wossat/status/997230578385612801">can be seen here</a>, and focuses on the benefits of Matrix for users.</p>
<h2 id="spec-proposals">Spec Proposals</h2>
<p>As you may have seen from the <a href="/blog/2018/05/17/introducing-matrix-specification-changes/">previous blog post</a>, we have a new drive to advance the Matrix Specification itself. Part of this is <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a>, which lists all the spec change proposals we've accumulated so far, and describes the flow for getting new proposals merged. There is a new room, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> for discussion, please join if you want to get involved in this process. Check out the page and the blog post for more detail.</p>

Lots of excitement at the variety of independent clients and servers able to interact over the matrix protocol. The images above show <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">The Construct</a> (server) and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a> (client), and then <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a> and <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a>. A fundamental part of matrix is to be an open protocol, so it's great to see entirely independent implementations liaising together! While implementing <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> has been documenting spec omissions <a href="https://kamax.io/matrix/api/client_server/unstable.html">in a branch of the spec</a> - we're hoping he will contribute these back!</p>

...and one more community member, hopefully (just sorting paperwork currently!)</li>
</ul>
Heads up that we're consciously trying to hire a mix of folks from the Matrix community as well as those outside it - and avoid hiring the whole community, both to ensure diversity of viewpoint & experience in the core team, and also to avoid cannibalising folks who working on their own commercial projects on top of Matrix. We'd prefer Matrix to be as decentralised and heterogenous as possible, needless to say - and instead try to support folks in building on Matrix without hiring them into the core team (where we'd expect them to focus on the core project for everyone's benefit). This may change once we have Matrix set up as a separate foundation, once we've got out of beta, of course.

        <div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We've been able to start investing more time in advancing the Matrix Specification itself over the last month or so thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">Ben</a> joining the core team (and should be able to accelerate even more with <a href="https://www.uhoreg.ca/blog/20180507-1019">uhoreg joining in a few weeks</a>!)  The first step in the new wave of work has been to provide much better infrastructure for the process of actually evolving the spec - whether that's from changes proposed by the core team or the wider Matrix Community.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, we'd like to introduce <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a> - a dashboard for all the spec change proposals we've accumulated so far (ignoring most of the ones which have already been merged), as well as a clearer workflow for how everyone can help improve the Matrix spec itself.  Part of this is introducing a formal numbering system - e.g. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1228">MSC1228</a> stands for Matrix Spec Change 1228 (where 1228 is the ID of the Github issue on the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues">github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues</a> repository that tracks the proposal).</p>
<p>Please note that these are <em>NOT</em> like XEPs or RFCs - i.e. optional proposals or add-ons to the protocol; instead they are literally proposals for changes to the Matrix Spec itself.  Once merged into the spec, they are only of historical interest.</p>
<p>We've also created a new room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> to discuss specific spec proposal changes - please join if you want to track how proposals are evolving! (Conversation is likely to fork off into per-proposal rooms or overflow into <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev:matrix.org</a> or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-architecture:matrix.org">#matrix-architecture:matrix.org</a> depending on traffic levels, however).</p>
<p>Feedback would be much appreciated on this - so please head over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> and let us know how it feels and how it could do better.</p>
<p>This is also a major step towards properly formalising Matrix.org's governance model - hopefully the changes above are sufficient to improve the health of the evolution of the Spec as we work towards an initial stable release later this year, and then you should expect to see a spec proposal for formal governance once we've (at last!) exited beta :)</p>
<p>Huge thanks to Ben for putting this together, and thanks to everyone who's contributed so far to the spec - we're looking forward to working through the backlog of proposals and turning them all into merged spec PRs!!</p>

<h2 id="home-assistants">Home Assistants</h2>
<p>Wonderful things are happening and being discovered regarding IoT and Home Automation. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg:matrix.org">uhoreg</a> was the first to point us to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tinloaf:matrix.org">tinloaf's</a> project to build a Matrix Chatbot component for <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This component allows you to send messages to matrix rooms, as well as to react to messages in matrix rooms. Reacting to commands is accomplished by firing an event when one of the configured commands is triggered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(this is not the same as notify.matrix <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/notify.matrix/">https://www.home-assistant.io/components/notify.matrix/</a>, which is used to deliver messages from Home Assistant to a room.)</p>
<p>Enthusiasm for this work led to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jon:terracrypt.net">jfred</a> discussing his past adventures in Matrix, including a component for <a href="https://github.com/theschwa/sibyl">sibyl</a>, 'a python chatbot with a focus on XBMC' allowing Matrix communication.</p>
<p>All this excitement led to Cadair creating <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#homeautomation:cadair.com">#homeautomation:cadair.com</a>, which has started a more thorough discussion. I'm eager to see more non-chat applications of Matrix, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> came up with others with projects in progress.</p>
<h2 id="on-gdpr">On GDPR</h2>
<p>GDPR has been a <del>favourite</del> topic for a while now. If you didn't already, take a look at the latest thinking from the Matrix Core team here: <a href="/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/">https://matrix.org/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting that we feel that GDPR is an excellent piece of legislation from the perspective of forcing us to think more seriously about our privacy – it has forced us to re-prioritise all sorts of long-term deficiencies in Matrix (e.g. dependence on DNS; improving User Interactive authentication; improving logout semantics etc).  There's obviously a lot of work to be done here, but hopefully it should all be worth it!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="travisr-on-gdpr">TravisR on GDPR</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/">TravisR</a> has also been thinking about GDPR, and how it relates to his <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-voyager-bot">Voyager bot</a>. In his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TWIM: I've mostly been working on figuring out how GDPR affects t2bot.io for the last couple weeks. One of the things running on t2bot.io is Voyager - a bot that tries to join rooms it sees mentioned in people's messages, graphing them on <a href="https://voyager.t2bot.io">https://voyager.t2bot.io</a>. With the increase in talk about GDPR and more bots starting to wander the federation, the recurring topic of whether Voyager should change its approach to finding and listing rooms.</p>
<p>With the current approach, Voyager reads messages and tries to find room aliases to try and join. Individual people can opt-out of this tracking to stop Voyager from reading/parsing their messages (opting back in at a later time, if desired). The room moderators can kick or ban the bot to completely remove their room from the graph, and can invoke a 'soft kick' if they'd like to have their room remain listed, but don't want the bot in the room. Voyager will make sure to only show information for public rooms and will update the graph if the room flips between public and private.</p>
<p>If anyone has feedback on how this approach could be improved (or if it should be left as-is), please come by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#voyager:t2bot.io">#voyager:t2bot.io</a> on matrix to start the conversation.</p>

<h2 id="translations">Translations</h2>
<p>I was surprised and excited to learn that a Russian translation of the Matrix FAQ has been produced by a group of Russian-language users. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br />  There are a several Russian-speaking users spontaneously decided to unite and help Matrix. We created a room where translated FAQ using the embedded etherpad widget. Some of us are here: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@commagray:matrix.org">Magnolia</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@commagray:matrix.org">Fenneko is a Good Girl</a> for example.

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>As the May 25th deadline looms, we've had lots and lots of questions about how GDPR (the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation legislation) applies to Matrix and to folks running Matrix servers - and so we've written this blog post to try to spell out what we're doing as part of maintaining the Matrix.org server (and bridges and hosted integrations etc), in case it helps folks running their own servers.</p>
<p>The main controversial point is how to handle Article 17 of the GDPR: ‘
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/">Right to Erasure</a>' (aka Right to be Forgotten).  The question is particularly interesting for Matrix, because as a relatively new protocol with somewhat distinctive semantics it's not always clear how the rules apply - and there's no case law to seek inspiration from.</p>
<p>The key question boils down to whether Matrix should be considered more like email (where people would be horrified if senders could erase their messages from your mail spool), or should it be considered more like Facebook (where people would be horrified if their posts were visible <em>anywhere</em> after they avail themselves of their right to erasure).</p>
<p>Solving this requires making a judgement call, which we've approached from two directions: firstly, considering what the spirit of the GDPR is actually trying to achieve (in terms of empowering users to control their data and have the right to be forgotten if they regret saying something in a public setting) - and secondly, considering the concrete legal obligations which exist.  </p>
<p>The conclusion we've ended up with is to (obviously) prioritise that Matrix can support all the core concrete legal obligations that GDPR imposes on it - whilst also having a detailed plan for the full ‘spirit of the GDPR' where the legal obligations are ambiguous.  The idea is to get as much of the longer term plan into place as soon as possible, but ensure that the core stuff is in place for May 25th.</p>
<p>Please note that we are still talking to GDPR lawyers, and we'd also very much appreciate feedback from the wider Matrix community - i.e. this plan is very much subject to change.  We're sharing it now to ensure everyone sees where our understanding stands today.</p>
<p>The current todo list breaks down into the following categories. Most of these issues have matching github IDs, which we'll track in a progress dashboard.</p>
<h3 id="right-to-erasure">Right to Erasure</h3>
<p>We're opting to follow the email model, where the act of sending an event (i.e. message) into a room shares a copy of that message to everyone who is <strong><em>currently</em></strong> in that room.  This means that in the privacy policy (see Consent below) users will have to consent to agreeing that a copy of their messages will be transferred to whoever they are addressing.  This is also the model followed by IM systems such as WhatsApp, Twitter DMs or (
<a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3029749/facebook-zuckerberg-can-delete-old-messenger-conversations-you-cant">almost</a>) Facebook Messenger.</p>
<p>This means that if a user invokes their right to erasure, we will need to ensure that their events will only ever be visible to users who already have a copy - and must 
<b>never</b> be served to new users or the general public.  Meanwhile, data which is no longer accessible by any user must of course be deleted entirely.</p>
<p>In the email analogy: this is like saying that you cannot erase emails that you have sent other people; you cannot try to rewrite history as witnessed by others... but you can erase your emails from a public mail archive or search engine and stop them from being visible to anyone else. </p>
<p>It is important to note that GDPR Erasure is <em>completely separate</em> from the existing Matrix functionality of “redactions” which let users remove events from the room. A “redaction” today represents a request for the human-facing details of an event (message, join/leave, avatar change etc) to be removed.  Technically, there is no way to enforce a redaction over federation, but there is a “gentlemen's agreement” that this request will be honoured.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
The alternative to the ‘email-analogue' approach would have been to facilitate users' automatically applying the existing redact function to 
<i>all
</i> of the events they have ever submitted to a public room. The problem here is that defining a ‘public room' is subtle, especially to uninformed users: for instance, if a message was sent in a private room (and so didn't get erased), what happens if that room is later made public? Conversely, if right-to-erasure removed messages from 
<i>all
</i> rooms, it will end up destroying the history integrity of 1:1 conversations, which pretty much everyone agrees is abhorrent.  Hence our conclusion to protect erased users from being visible to the general public (or anyone who comes snooping around after the fact) - but preserving their history from the perspective of the people they were talking to at the time.</p>
<p>In practice, our core to-do list for Right to Erasure is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">As a first cut,  provide Article 17 right-to-erasure at a per-account granularity.  The simplest UX for this will be an option when calling the account deactivation API to request erasure as well as deactivation.  There will be a 30 day grace period, and (ideally) a 2FA confirmation (if available) to avoid the feature being abused. 
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Homeservers must delete events that nobody has access to any more (i.e. if all the users in a room have GDPR-erased themselves).  If users have deactivated their accounts without GDPR-erasure, then the data will persist in case they reactivate in future.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Homeservers must delete media that nobody has access to any more.  This is hard, as media is referenced by mxc:// URLs which may be shared across multiple events (e.g. stickers or forwarded events, including E2E encrypted events), and moreover mxc:// URLs aren't currently authorized.  As a first cut, we track which user uploaded the mxc:// content, and if they erase themselves then the content will also be erased.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Homeservers must not serve up unredacted events over federation to users who were not in the room at the time.  This poses some interesting problems in terms of the privacy implications of sharing MXIDs of erased users over federation - see “GDPR erasure of MXIDs” below.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" id="mxid_erasure">Matrix must specify a way of informing both servers and clients (especially bots and bridges) of GDPR erasures (as distinct from redactions), so that they can apply the appropriate erasure semantics.
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gdpr-erasure-of-matrix-ids">GDPR erasure of Matrix IDs</h4>
<p>One interesting edge case that comes out of GDPR erasure is that we need a way to stop GDPR-erased events from leaking out over federation - when in practice they are cryptographically signed into the event Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of a given room.  Today, we can remove the message contents (and preserve the integrity of the room's DAG) via redaction - but this still leaves personally identifying information in the form of the Matrix IDs (MXIDs) of the sender of these events.</p>
<p>In practice, this could be quite serious: imagine that you join a public chatroom for some sensitive subject (e.g. #hiv:example.com) and then later on decide that you want to erase yourself from the room.  It would be very undesirable if any new homeserver joining that room received a copy of the DAG showing that your MXID had sent thousands of events into the room - especially if your MXID was clearly identifying (i.e. your real name).</p>
<p>Mitigating this is a hard problem, as MXIDs are baked into the DAG for a room in many places - not least to identify which servers are participating in a room.  The problem is made even worse by the fact that in Matrix, server hostnames themselves are often personally identifying (for one-person homeservers sitting on a personal domain).</p>
<p>We've spent quite a lot time reasoning through how to fix this situation, and a full technical spec proposal for removing MXIDs from events can be found at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ni4LnC_vafX4h4K4sYNpmccS7QeHEFpAcYcbLS-J21Q">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ni4LnC_vafX4h4K4sYNpmccS7QeHEFpAcYcbLS-J21Q</a>.  The high level proposal is to switch to giving each user a different ID in the form of a cryptographic public key for every room it participates in, and maintaining a mapping of today's MXIDs to these per-user-per-room keys.  In the event of a GDPR erasure, these mappings can be discarded, pseudonymising the user and avoiding correlation across different rooms. We'd also switch to using cryptographic public keys as the identifiers for Rooms, Events and Users (for cross-room APIs like presence).</p>
<p>This is obviously a significant protocol change, and we're not going to do it lightly - we're still waiting for legal confirmation on whether we need it for May 25th (it may be covered as an intrinsic technical limitation of the system).  However, the good news is that it paves the way towards many other desirable features: the ability to migrate accounts between homeservers; the ability to solve the problem of how to handle domain names being reused (or hijacked); the ability to decouple homeservers from DNS so that they can run clientside (for p2p matrix); etc.  The chances are high that this proposal will land in the relatively near future (especially if mandated by GDPR), so input is very appreciated at this point!</p>
<h3 id="consent">Consent</h3>
<p>GDPR describes <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">six lawful bases for processing</a> personal data.  For those running Matrix servers, it seems the best route to compliance is the most explicit and active one: 
<i>consent
</i>.</p>
<p><i>Consent
</i> requires that our users are
<b> fully informed</b> as to exactly how their data will be used, where it will be stored, and (in our case) the specific caveats associated with a decentralised, federated communication system. They are then asked to provide their explicit approval before using (or continuing to use) the service.</p>
<p>In order to gather consent in a way that doesn't break all of the assorted Matrix clients connecting to matrix.org today, we have identified both an immediate- and a long-term approach.</p>
<p>The (immediate-term) todo list for gathering consent is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Modify Synapse to serve up a simple ‘consent tool' static webapp to display the privacy notice/terms and conditions and gather consent to this API.
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Add a ‘consent API' to the CS API which lets a server track whether a given user has consented to the server's privacy policy or not.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Send emails and push notifications to advise users of the upcoming change (and link through to the consent tool)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Develop a bot that automatically connects to all users (new and existing), posting a link to the consent tool.  This bot can also be used in the future as a general ‘server notice channel' for letting server admins inform users of privacy policy changes; planned downtime; security notices etc.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Modify synapse to reject message send requests for all users who have not yet provided consent
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">return a useful error message which contains a link to the consent tool
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Making our anonymised user analytics for Riot.im ‘opt in' rather than ‘opt out' - this isn't a requirement of GDPR (since our analytics are <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-26/">fully anonymised</a>) but reflects our commitment to user data sovereignty
</li>
</ul>
Long-term:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Add a User Interactive Auth flow for the /register API to gather consent at register
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">As an alternative to the bot:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fix user authentication in general to distinguish between ‘need to reauthorize without destroying user data' and ‘destroy user data and login again', so we can use the re-authorize API to gather consent via /login without destroying user data on the client.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">port the /login API to use User Interactive Auth and also use it to gather consent for existing users when logging in
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3 id="deactivation">Deactivation</h3>
<p>Account deactivation (the ability to terminate your account on your homeserver) intersects with GDPR in a number of places.</p>
<p>Todo list for account deactivation:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Remove deactivated users from all rooms - this finally solves the problem where deactivated users leave zombie users around on bridged networks.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Remove deactivated users from the homeserver's user directory
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Remove all 3PID bindings associated with a deactivated user from the identity servers
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Improve the account deactivation UX to make sure users understand the full consequences of account deactivation
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="portability">Portability</h3>
<p>GDPR states that users have a right to extract their data in a 
<i>structured, commonly used and machine-readable format
</i>.</p>
<p>In the medium term we would like to develop this as a core feature of Matrix (i.e. an API for exporting your logs and other data, or for that matter account portability between Matrix servers), but in the immediate term we'll be meeting our obligations by providing a manual service.</p>
<p>The immediate todo list for data portability is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Expose a simple interface for people to request their data
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Implement the necessary tooling to provide full message logs (as a csv) upon request.  As a first cut this would be the result of manually running something like <code>select * from events where user=?</code>.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<p>GDPR mandates rules for all the personal data stored by a business, so there are some broader areas to bear in mind which aren't really Matrix specific, including:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Making a clear statement as to how data is processed if you apply for a job
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring you are seeking appropriate consent for cookies
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Making sure all the appropriate documentation, processes and training materials are in place to meet GDPR obligations.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>So, there you have it.  We'll be tracking progress in github issues and an associated dashboard over the coming weeks; for now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1941">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1941</a> (for Right to Erasure) or <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-meta/issues/149">https://github.com/vector-im/riot-meta/issues/149</a> (GDPR in general) is as good as place as any to gather feedback.  Alternatively, feel free to comment on the original text of this blog post: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JTEI6RENnOlnCwcU2hwpg3P6LmTWuNS9S-ZYDdjqgzA">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JTEI6RENnOlnCwcU2hwpg3P6LmTWuNS9S-ZYDdjqgzA</a>.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that we feel that GDPR is an excellent piece of legislation from the perspective of forcing us to think more seriously about our privacy - it has forced us to re-prioritise all sorts of long-term deficiencies in Matrix (e.g. dependence on DNS; improving User Interactive authentication; improving logout semantics etc).  There's obviously a lot of work to be done here, but hopefully it should all be worth it!</p>
