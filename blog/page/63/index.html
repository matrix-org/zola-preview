            <p>This week, Matthew and myself went to the <a href="http://webrtc-conference.com/" title="WebRTC conference">WebRTC conference</a> and its related <a href="http://webrtc-conference.com/kranky-geek/" title="Kranky Geek">Kranky Geek</a> event in sunny London.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ipcortex/status/588261705144262656" title="picture credit: twitter.com/ipcortex"><img src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/matrix1.jpg" alt="Matrix at WebRTC conference London 2015" width="1024" height="579" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-799" /></a></p>
<p>Matrix had a speaker slot in both events; the first talk was &quot;Proposing an open interoperable signalling layer for WebRTC&quot; (<a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-15-Matrix-WebRTC-London.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>As I was talking to people in the tea-breaks between sessions, I was actually surprised at the amount of people who not only knew about Matrix, but who had been following eagerly since the early days, and had questions about specific features and recent developments!</p>
<p>Later in the day it was time for the Kranky Geek, and the talk then was a bit more technical: &quot;Interoperable HTTP Signalling with Matrix&quot; (<a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-15-Matrix-WebRTC-Kranky-Geek.pdf">slides</a>). The talk included a &quot;dangerous demo&quot; where we made a WebRTC call from our Matrix iOS App to our webclient for the first time - thanks to the <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenWebRTC/status/588784386440593408" title="OpenWebRTC">OpenWebRTC</a> team for helping us make the demo!</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/webrtcHacks/status/588341443363786752" title="picture credit: twitter.com/webrtcHacks"><img src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/matrix-krankygeek.jpg" alt="matrix-krankygeek" width="1024" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800" /></a></p>
<p>What's great about these kind of events is the feedback and discussion following talks; lots of people have relevant experiences and opinions that they are happy to share, and of course questions on how exactly different features actually work. </p>
<p>It's always great to meet new people and have lots of various discussions. Hopefully we have got a few more people interested in Matrix - we have already seen some new joiners in the <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a> room! </p>
<p>Next up is <a href="http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015/">Fluent</a> in San Francisco next week, where I will be <a href="http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015/public/schedule/detail/42666" title="speaking">speaking</a>.</p>

            <p>Just a quick announcement that Android Console 0.3.0 has been released on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.matrix.androidsdk.alpha" title="Google Play store">Google Play store</a>. </p>
<p>This release contains a whole lot of fixes, new features, and nicer UI - see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#changes-in-matrix-android-sdk-in-030-2015-04-10" title="changes">changes</a> file for details, but in summary:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The UI has been switched to Android's Material Design</li>
	<li>Android Lollipop is now fully supported</li>
	<li>We have added support for contacts</li>
	<li>Various accessibility and usability fixes have been contributed by Nolan Darilek (thanks!)</li>
	<li>We also have clientside GCM support thanks to Leon Handreke! We need to make some changes server-side before GCM can be used, but that's on the current ToDo-list!</li>
	<li>Lots of bugs fixed, as usual, thanks to everyone who reported an issue.</li>

            <p>This weekend was spent at <a href="http://www.idea-london.co.uk/" title="IDEA-London">IDEA-London</a> where the <a href="tadhack.com/2015/tadhack-mini-london" title="TADHack-mini London">TADHack-mini London</a> hackathon was going on. In total, there were around 18 different projects being hacked on all day Saturday and Sunday morning, before a 5-minute presentation on Sunday afternoon. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/telestax/status/586835787892842496" title="picture credit: twitter.com/telestax"><img src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tadhack.jpg" alt="tadhack" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-720" /></a></p>
<p>Four different projects used Matrix in one way or another: Matrixbot - a robot controlled through standard messages in a Matrix room - done by Scott Barstow and Anders Brownworth (project <a href="https://github.com/scottbarstow/tadhackLondon2015" title="code">code</a> and presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDIkqyxnac" title="video">video</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/587253016463564801" title="picture">picture</a>). Neil Stratford's hack included lighting up his roll of LEDs whenever a push-notification hit his Matrix webclient (<a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/587262829390123009" title="picture">picture</a> from the presentation). </p>
<p>The Co-Browsify hack by Žilvinas Račyla and Augustinas Bacvinka allows two people to browse the same webpage, with scrolling events being collected and duplicated to the other browser via Matrix (<a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/587272083106848768" title="picture">picture</a> from the presentation). Finally, Matt Williams of Metaswitch created a Project Clearwater/Matrix Gateway which enables Project Clearwater/IMS to set up WebRTC calls with any matrix user (project <a href="https://github.com/matt-williams/sprout/tree/matrix" title="code">code</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/587269326899654656" title="pictures">pictures</a> from the presentation) - this is the first time we have had a SIP-to-Matrix call (let alone IMS-to-Matrix) set up!</p>
<p>As TADHack sponsors, Matrix had two Parrot Drones to hand out as prizes, and the winners for best Matrix-related hacks are Matt Williams for the Clearwater/Matrix Gateway -  and Scott Barstow and Anders Brownworth for Matrixbot! We are also happy that the other two Matrix-related projects were rewarded with prizes from the other sponsors (<a href="http://blog.tadhack.com/2015/04/12/tadhack-mini-london-winners/" title="full list of winners">full list of winners</a>).</p>

<p>All in all it was a very productive weekend, both in terms of tech and also meeting people. Thanks to everyone who participated and especially those who worked on Matrix-related hacks!</p>

            <p>As of 9am tomorrow, somewhere in the depths of East London (and remotely from around the world), a diaspora of elite VoIP/WebRTC/Telco developers will compete to build the most innovative and impressive communications demos at <a href="http://tadhack.com/2015/tadhack-mini-london/">Tadhack Mini London</a>!  Dave, Oddvar and myself are going to be there from the core Matrix.org team, both on-site and online (at <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a>, of course) to provide support - especially to everyone who's using Matrix APIs in their solution.  And as we mentioned before, we'll even be giving away <a href="/blog/2015/03/19/tadhack-mini-london">two Parrot Bebop Drones</a> to the best hacks built using Matrix!</p>
<p>It's not too late to get involved - the more the merrier.  We reckon it's going to be a really fun weekend, so look forward to chatting to some of you soon!</p>

<p>Both the recording equipment and the video team volunteers were new this year, so some problems were encountered, which means that our lightning talk video unfortunately was lost. However, our talk in the IoT-devroom is now available:</p>
<video width="853" height="480" controls>
  <source src="http://matrix.org/video/IoT-through-Matrix.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
Your browser does not support the video tag.

            <p>Heads up that we released Synapse 0.8.1 a little while back, but we've all been too busy writing software to announce it... you know how it goes. Anyway, here are the changes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Disable registration by default. New users can be added using the included <code>register_new_matrix_user</code> script or by enabling registration in the config.</li>
	<li>Add metrics to synapse. To enable metrics use config options <code>enable_metrics</code> and <code>metrics_port</code>.</li>
	<li>Fix bug where banning only kicked the user.</li>
</ul>
Note that first one in particular: if you set up a new install, you won't be able to register new users using the API by default. This means random people on the Internet can't create accounts on your Home Server unless you actually choose to let them. Also, if you were trying to ban users and noticed that didn't work... yeah, we fixed that.
<p>Okay, back to writing software again!</p>

Matrix is sponsoring <a href="http://tadhack.com/2015/tadhack-mini-london/" title="TADHack-mini London">TADHack-mini London</a>, which is a two-day hackathon with focus on WebRTC technology, happening on April 11 and 12 at <a href="http://www.idea-london.co.uk/" title="IDEA London">IDEA London</a>. We will award a <a href="http://www.parrot.com/uk/products/bebop-drone/" title="Parrot Bebop Drone">Parrot Bebop Drone</a> (which itself can be hacked via the <a href="https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3/ARSDKBuildUtils" title="ARDroneSDK3">ARDroneSDK3</a>) to the two best hacks using Matrix, and we can't wait to see what kind of ideas people will come up with!

We strongly encourage anyone to get involved - have a look at our <a href="http://tadhack.com/2015/tadhack-mini-london/" title="Development Resources">Development Resources</a> (scroll down a bit) and have a think of what you can create within the 16-hour timeframe. The reference Matrix web client already supports WebRTC - you can play with this by registering a user via the matrix.org <a href="/beta/" title="web client">web client</a> (or you can check out the reference <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-angular-sdk" title="web client">web client</a> and run it on your own box), inviting a user to a 1-1 chat (click on their avatar and &quot;start chat&quot;) and then clicking the microphone or video camera icon in the top right to start a voice/video call. </p>
<p>We brainstormed some ideas for further WebRTC/Matrix work in our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/IDEAS.md#implementing-webrtc-support-in-mobile-apps" title="GSoC">GSoC</a> (Google Summer of Code) project proposals, for example &quot;Implementing WebRTC support in Mobile apps&quot; and &quot;Multi-way voice and video conferencing&quot;. These are very probably too extensive for the 16-hour hackathon, but might provide some ideas for smaller hacks.</p>
<p>We will be at the event to offer mentoring and help, but you can already start thinking about potential hacks - come talk to us in the <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a> room!</p>

            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>As of today you can install the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/matrix-console/id970074271">basic reference Matrix client</a> on iOS from the App Store.  We've called the app &quot;Matrix Console&quot; to try to make it clear that it's very much a developer/poweruser tool for experimenting with Matrix and showcasing the Matrix APIs and an example of how to use the iOS SDK - whilst it can be used as a great replacement to IRC, it's by no means meant to be a glossy polished app like Hangouts or Slack.</p>
<p>Meanwhile you can also get <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.matrix.androidsdk.alpha">the Android version of Console</a> at the Google Play Store as we mentioned in the last post.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/matrix-console/id970074271"><img src="http://matrix.org/img/screenie.jpg" width="375" height="667" alt="iOS screenshot" class="aligncenter" /></a></p>
<p>Needless to say, they're both entirely open-source (Apache license) and you can grab the code from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk</a> respectively if you want to play with your own copy.</p>
<p>The mobile apps currently act very similarly to <a href="http://matrix.org/beta">the reference web app</a> - providing group chat (text/images/video etc) in decentralised public and private rooms, with room history kept in sync across all your different Matrix-enabled apps.  They don't yet do VoIP, although we're working on it.  Please give the apps a go and file all your bugs and feedback into <a href="http://matrix.org/jira">JIRA</a> or <a href="/beta/#/room/#ios:matrix.org">#ios:matrix.org</a> and <a href="/beta/#/room/#android:matrix.org">#android:matrix.org</a> so we can make them even better :)</p>
<p>The iOS app in particular showcases one of the coolest new features in Matrix: the ability for homeservers to support highly configurable push notifications, ensuring you never miss messages on Matrix ever again.  The way this works is that when you install the Matrix Console app from iTunes and log in, the app tells your homeserver to send push notifications to a simple push server on Matrix.org running the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">sygnal</a> codebase (you can also run your own sygnal for your own Matrix apps).  You can then configure some excitingly comprehensive push settings in the settings page of the web client (we haven't exposed the UI to configure these on the mobile apps yet) to configure what events in Matrix should trigger push notifications - and then you will automatically receive the desired pushes even when the app isn't running.</p>
<p>We think this is incredibly powerful: there are no longer <em>any</em> client-side notification settings.  Instead, all your notifications are stored server-side - per-room, per-user, per-word and as many other extensible rules as you desire (plus some helpful common special cases).  This means that the rules that determine whether you see notifications on the desktop from the webclient are <em>identical</em> to the notifications you receive push notifications on your mobile devices.  We hope this is a huge improvement over the inflexible notification rules that iMessage, Hangouts etc push onto you (so to speak).</p>
<p>To support the new push rules we've just released a new version of the web client - 0.6.5.  This implements the new rule configuration UI - see below for example UI.</p>
<img src="http://matrix.org/img/push-settings.jpg" width="988" height="1252" alt="push settings UI" class="aligncenter" />
<p>The full list of changes in matrix-angular-sdk 0.6.5 is as per below.  We hope you enjoy the new clients and push settings - thanks for flying Matrix :)</p>
