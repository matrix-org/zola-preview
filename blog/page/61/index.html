            <p>Super-quick post just to announce that we have released a new version of the Android Matrix Console. This version fixes a problem where the Playstore wouldn't let some Android devices install the app just because they don't have a SIM card, due to a required permission that wasn't really needed anyway.</p>
<p>Grab the latest version from <a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.matrix.androidsdk.alpha">the play store</a>!</p>

            <p>We've been running an IRC gateway from Matrix to Freenode almost since day 1 - originally it was a <a href="/blog/project/perl-matrix-ircbridge/">simple perl bot</a> written by tm604 using Net::Async::Matrix; later it was rewritten by LeoNerd to be a bit more modular, and nowadays it's a full <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">IRC/Matrix Application Service</a> written in Node.js by Kegan.</p>
<p>Up until the end of last week the bridge was limited to synchronising a fixed number of channels between Freenode and Matrix (#matrix, #matrix-dev, #openwebrtc, #vuc and #hypothes.is, to be precise), as well as any PMs.  But as of Friday, with huge thanks to the admins over at Freenode, we can now bridge <em>any</em> channel in Freenode through to Matrix.</p>
<p>Doing this is trivial - you just <code>/join #freenode_#channelname:matrix.org</code> from a typical Matrix client - e.g. <code>/join #freenode_#Node.js:matrix.org</code> will give you access to all of #Node.js via Matrix, effectively using Matrix as a great big distributed IRC bouncer in the sky ;)</p>
<p>There are a few limitations in the current setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>We only incrementally synchronise the membership lists when folks speak in either IRC or Matrix.  This is to avoid flooding either IRC or Matrix with lurkers when the bridge initially joins a channel.  We have some plans to improve this in future - see <a href="/jira/browse/BOTS-53">BOTS-53</a> for some of the sordid details.</li>
<li>We don't synchronise joins/parts currently to avoid flooding Matrix with lots of IRC join/part spam.  Again, this will improve in future.</li>
<li>You can't join +k channels.</li>
<li>Kicks/bans/invites and other ACLs currently don't propagate between IRC &amp; Matrix.  (I.e. a Matrix user can be kicked from IRC, but it'll continue to sit in Matrix unless also kicked for there).  +i chanmode supported however.</li>
<li>Bridged public IRC rooms are not yet advertised in the public room list on matrix.org.</li>
<li>It should be possible to change the nickname of your IRC user by messaging <code>!nick irc.freenode.net MrFlibble</code> to @appservice-irc:matrix.org.  (This isn't actually turned on right now, but should be fixed shortly.  See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/blob/master/HOWTO.md#changing-nicks">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/blob/master/HOWTO.md#changing-nicks</a> for details.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll keep chipping away at making the IRC&lt;-&gt;Matrix mapping perfect, but in its current state it's still really usable.  It's obviously beta still, but please give it a go and let us know in #matrix:matrix.org how you get on with it!</p>

            <p>Over 800 hackers all over the world spent this weekend working on hacks and prototypes in the <a href="http://tadhack.com/2015/">Global TADHack hackathon</a>. Some were working from home, and others gathered at one of the 14 official locations. Matrix were physically present at the London and Lisbon locations, and we also handed out two prizes (a massive amount of tessel modules) to the best hacks using Matrix in some way or another.</p>
<p>After a hectic weekend, over 90 different hacks were submitted and presented. There was a live stream available (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMwLgPrscVTbcIzl4r1WvRg">archive here</a>) so that everyone could watch all the submissions. We were of course particularly interested in Matrix-related hacks, and there were several:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/maffydub">Matt Williams</a> continued his Project Clearwater/Matrix integration from <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/2015/04/13/tadhack-mini-london-completed/">TADHack-mini London</a> earlier this year; this time he added support for IM{'<->'}SIP MESSAGEs. </li>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/RobinJPickering">Rob Pickering</a> bridged his company's <a href="https://www.ipcortex.co.uk/article.rhtm/keevio-382953.html">keevio</a> system to Matrix via the AS API.</li>
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/SachaNacar">Sacha Nacar</a> and Mike Dauphinais wrote a sign-language interpreter that uses Matrix for conversations.</li>
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/pavlovigor">Igor Pavlov</a> made it possible for users of <a href="https://www.lytespark.com">Lytespark</a> to be contacted via Matrix and OpenMarket's SMS AS when they are offline.</li>
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/PhaniPasupula">Phani Pasupula</a> showed a PoC for using Matrix as a platform for starting a Dialogic XMS conference.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, we had to pick only two of these awesome hacks, which wasn't easy. We are really encouraged by seeing the Matrix ecosystem grow bigger - and more bridges to various existing systems being built; this is exactly what Matrix needs!</p>
<p>We awarded our two prizes to Igor for his use of OpenMarket's SMS AS, which adds a new and very wanted feature to <a href="https://www.lytespark.com">Lytespark</a> - and Sacha/Mike for their inventive sign-language -&gt; Matrix translator. Congrats to all of you! We were also happy to see Phani win one of Dialogic's prizes with his hack!</p>
<p>Below you can watch our two winners' presentations:</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>If things seem a bit quiet here at the moment it's because most of the Matrix team is in the 'build' phase across the board on a bunch of major new projects - including the long-awaited reusable UI component library for the Web, end-to-end encryption support, stable VoIP on mobile and a few other surprises.  The first wave of all this new work landed today in the form of a new major version release (0.1.0) of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">matrix-js-sdk</a>: our javascript SDK library.</p>
<p>The history of JS client support on Matrix is that in the original rush to get a PoC webclient out the door back in September, we jumped straight to talking to the Matrix HTTP API from Angular controllers in 'syweb'.  This then got split into an Angular SDK (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-angular-sdk">matrix-angular-sdk</a>) containing a bunch of services for handling the Matrix client state with the actual webapp sitting alongside as an example of the SDK.  This then in turn got split into a basic matrix-js-sdk (wrapping the Matrix client-server HTTP API) and matrix-angular-sdk (handling the clientside state and exposing it as Angular services) - and this is how the current demo Angular webapp works at <a href="http://matrix.org/beta">http://matrix.org/beta</a>.</p>
<p>However, this poses a major problem if you want a richer client SDK but don't want to use Angular - e.g. if you prefer another framework (or no framework at all), or are using the SDK in an Application Service or similar.  So, this has prompted a major upgrade to the matrix-js-sdk in order to extend it to act both as a simple wrapper of the Matrix Client-Server HTTP API, but also expose a full object and event model to describe the state of a Matrix client together with all the higher level functions to drive it.  To quote from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/blob/master/README.md">README</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This SDK provides a full object model around the Matrix Client-Server API and emits events for incoming data and state changes. Aside from wrapping the HTTP API, it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handles syncing (via /initialSync and /events)</li>
<li>Handles the generation of "friendly" room and member names.</li>
<li>Handles historical RoomMember information (e.g. display names).</li>
<li>Manages room member state across multiple events (e.g. it handles typing, power levels and membership changes).</li>
<li>Exposes high-level objects like Rooms, RoomState, RoomMembers and Users which can be listened to for things like name changes, new messages, membership changes, presence changes, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Later versions of the SDK will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically retry requests to send messages due to network errors.</li>
<li>Automatically retry requests to send messages due to rate limiting errors.</li>
<li>Mark events' sent status (e.g. 'not sent').</li>
<li>Handle "local echo" of messages sent.</li>
<li>Handle queueing of messages.</li>
<li>Handle pagination.</li>
<li>Expose a RoomSummary which would be suitable for a recents page.</li>
<li>Provide different pluggable storage layers (e.g. local storage, database-backed)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It also is designed to provide an API that abstracts both version 1 of the client-server API and the upcoming version 2 (which fixes various thinkos we've discovered along the way in v1).</p>
<p>This is incredibly exciting stuff as it now gives a really robust yet lightweight API for client-side and application-service development in JavaScript.  Predictably enough we're using it to develop our new reusable web UI components, and I suspect we'll see new Node-based application services making use of in the near future.  Meanwhile, it's more than topical as it should run straight on top of the <a href="http://tessel.io">Tessel</a> JavaScript hardware modules we're giving away this weekend as our prize for the best hack built on Matrix at <a href="/blog/2015/06/05/global-tadhack-hackathon/">TADHack</a> - letting the little Tessel ARM system-on-a-chip speak a very rich and native Matrix dialect!</p>
<p>The new matrix-js-sdk comes with comprehensive jsdoc detailing the new API which you can find at <a href="http://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-js-sdk/global.html">http://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-js-sdk/global.html</a>.  There are also some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/tree/master/examples">basic examples</a> available, including a new simple node-powered command-line client designed for testing the SDK.  Finally, if you're interested in reading the design process by which we've converged on the current API, all the details may be found in JIRA on <a href="/jira/browse/SYJS-5">SYJS-5</a>.</p>
<p>So: if you've been itching to get your hands on a much more powerful pure-JS Matrix SDK, now's your chance!  It's very early days for the new API so we expect to see a few incompatible changes on the horizon, but we encourage you to have a play and <a href="http://matrix.org/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">tell us what you think!</a>.</p>
<p>To find out more, go check out the project at <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk</a>, or if you're feeling daring just grab the library with <code>npm install matrix-js-sdk</code> and get hacking!</p>

            <p>Happy Friday everyone!</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, we have been hunting down some more performance issues in Synapse, as well as fixing a few potential bugs in the new backfill feature that we introduced in 0.9.1. For those that were having issues, this release should really help speed up when your server joins larger remote rooms.</p>
<p>We have also been busy hacking on end-to-end encryption, which is very exciting. Hopefully we will have more details to share about that soon!</p>
<p>Get v0.9.2 now from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.</p>
<code>
Changes in synapse v0.9.2 (2015-06-12)
======================================
<p>General:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use ultrajson for json (de)serialisation when a canonical encoding is not required. Ultrajson is significantly faster than simplejson in certain circumstances.</li>
<li>Use connection pools for outgoing HTTP connections.</li>
<li>Process thumbnails on separate threads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add option, <code>gzip_responses</code>, to disable HTTP response compression.</li>
</ul>
<p>Federation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve resilience of backfill by ensuring we fetch any missing auth events.</li>
<li>Improve performance of backfill and joining remote rooms by removing unnecessary computations. This included handling events we had previously handled as well as attempting to compute the current state for outliers.</li>
</ul>
</code>

We were racing against the deadline, but managed to join the demos at the very last minute - and even win the award for &quot;Most Entertaining Demo&quot;!</p>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mostentertainingdemo1.jpg"><img src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mostentertainingdemo1.jpg" alt="mostentertainingdemo" width="600" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1055" /></a></p>
<p>It was great to catch up with old acquaintances - and meet many new ones! There were only around 150 people at Kamailio World, but given the area of expertise is very specialised, you can pretty much start talking to anyone and have a really interesting conversation.</p>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-05-29-Matrix-KamailioWorld.pptx">Here are the slides</a> of Matthew's presentation, (<a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-05-29-Matrix-KamailioWorld.pdf">also available as .pdf</a>) and a video of the presentation:</p>

<p>A video from the dangerous demo event is available here:</p>

<p>The Parrot Drone we use in the demo has a 14 megapixel fisheye camera with advanced stabilization techniques which means that you can't actually see what happened when everybody went &quot;ooh&quot; - I assure you the &quot;flip&quot; command does exactly what you would expect!</p>
<p>Thanks to everybody who talked to us at Kamailio - and as always, come find us in the <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a> room on Matrix! </p>

            <p>In the excitement of KamailioWorld last week we completely forgot to mention that we released Synapse 0.9.1.</p>
<p>This is a pretty important performance and stability update of all the new stuff that landed in 0.9.0, as well as landing a major new feature in the form of 'backfill': we finally have the ability to correctly sync in historical conversation history over federation for newly federated rooms.  In other words, if you join a remote room you should be able to navigate its history as intended.</p>
<p>We highly recommend upgrading to 0.9.1 for all the performance improvements and backfill support - get it now from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.</p>
<code>
Changes in synapse v0.9.1 (2015-05-26)
======================================
<p>General:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add support for backfilling when a client paginates. This allows servers to
request history for a room from remote servers when a client tries to
paginate history the server does not have - SYN-36</li>
<li>Fix bug where you couldn't disable non-default pushrules - SYN-378</li>
<li>Fix <code>register_new_user</code> script - SYN-359</li>
<li>Improve performance of fetching events from the database, this improves both
initialSync and sending of events.</li>
<li>Improve performance of event streams, allowing synapse to handle more
simultaneous connected clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Federation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix bug with existing backfill implementation where it returned the wrong
selection of events in some circumstances.</li>
<li>Improve performance of joining remote rooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add support for changing the bind host of the metrics listener via the <code>metrics_bind_host</code> option.</li>
</ul>
