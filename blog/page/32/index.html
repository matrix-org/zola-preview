            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Last month at FOSDEM 2019 we gave a <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/matrix/">talk</a> about a new experimental ultra-low-bandwidth transport for Matrix which swaps our baseline HTTPS+JSON transport for a custom one built on <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252">CoAP</a>+<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049">CBOR</a>+<a href="https://noiseprotocol.org">Noise</a>+<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/compress/flate/">Flate</a>+<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc768.txt">UDP</a>.  (CoAP is the RPC protocol; CBOR is the encoding; Noise powers the transport layer encryption; Flate compresses everything uses predefined compression maps).</p>
<p>The challenge here was to see if we could demonstrate Matrix working usably over networks running at around 100 bits per second of throughput (where it'd take 2 minutes to send a typical 1500 byte ethernet packet!!) and very high latencies.  You can see the original FOSDEM talk below, or <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-03-FOSDEM-Low-Bandwidth.pdf">check out the slides here.</a></p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZBvy4abB1o" width="1280" height="720" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
</iframe></div>
<p>Now, it's taken us a little while to find time to tidy up the stuff we demo'd in the talk to be (relatively) suitable for public consumption, but we're happy to finally release the four projects which powered the demo:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/meshsim">https://github.com/matrix-org/meshsim</a> - meshsim is the network simulator which provides an interactive web interface to draw a network topology and let you spin up dockerized homeservers on a simulated network with whatever preferred latency, jitter, packet loss etc.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/meshsim-docker">https://github.com/matrix-org/meshsim-docker</a> - meshsim-docker is the custom synapse + coap-proxy Dockerfile used to define the containers which meshsim instantiates</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/coap-proxy">https://github.com/matrix-org/coap-proxy</a> - coap-proxy is the golang proxy which converts HTTPS+JSON into CoAP+CBOR+Noise+Flate and vice versa, letting you squish Matrix CS API and SS API traffic in &amp; out of CoAP.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-coap">https://github.com/matrix-org/go-coap</a> - go-coap is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/Kistler-Group">Kistler-Group</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/go-ocf/go-coap">go-ocf/go-coap</a> (in turn originally a fork of <a href="https://github.com/dustin/go-coap">dustin/go-coap</a>) which adds encryption using <a href="https://noiseprotocol.org">Noise</a>, retries, and hooks for compression.</li>
</ul>
In order to get up and running, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/meshsim/blob/master/README.md">meshsim README</a> has all the details.
<p>It's important to understand that this is very much a proof of concept, and shouldn't be used in production yet, and almost certainly has some glaring bugs.  In fact, it currently assumes you are running on a trusted private network rather than the public Matrix network in order to get away with some of the bandwidth optimisations performed - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/coap-proxy#limitations">coap-proxy's Limitations section</a> for details.  Particularly, please note that the encryption is homemade and not audited or fully reviewed or tested yet.  Also, we've released the code for the low-bandwidth transport, but we haven't released the &quot;fan-out routing&quot; implementation for Synapse as it needs a <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/">rethink</a> to be applicable to the public Matrix network.  You'll also want to run Riot/Web in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/2598">low-bandwidth mode</a> if you really wind down the bandwidth (suppressing avatars, read receipts, typing notifs and presence to avoid wasting precious bandwidth).</p>
<p>We also don't have an MSC for the CoAP-based transport yet, mainly due to lack of time whilst wanting to ensure the limitations are addressed first before we propose it as a formal alternative Matrix transport.  (We also first need to define negotiation mechanisms for entirely alternative CS &amp; SS transports!).  However, the quick overview is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>JSON is converted directly into CBOR (with a few substitutions made to shrink common patterns down)</li>
 	<li>HTTP is converted directly into CoAP (mapping the verbose API endpoints down to single-byte endpoints)</li>
 	<li>TLS is swapped out for <a href="https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html#noise-pipes">Noise Pipes</a> (XX + IK noise handshakes).  This gives us 1RTT setup (XX) for the first connection to a host, and 0RTT (IK) for all subsequent connections, and provides trust-on-first-use semantics when connecting to a server.  You can see the Noise state machine we maintain in go-coap's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-coap/blob/master/noise.go">noise.go</a>.</li>
 	<li>The CoAP headers are hoisted up above the Noise payload, letting us use them for framing the noise pipes without having duplicated framing headers at the CoAP &amp; Noise layers.  We also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-coap/blob/e156f6bb5d3c728040ceffd09685610128d3c63c/conn.go#L340-L371">frame the Noise handshake packets as CoAP</a> with custom message types (250, 251 and 252).  We might be better off using <a href="https://github.com/core-wg/oscoap">OSCORE</a> for this, however, rather than hand-wrapping a custom encrypted transport...</li>
 	<li>The CoAP payload is compressed via <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/compress/flate/">Flate</a> using preshared compression tables derived from compressing large chunks of representative Matrix traffic. This could be significantly improved in future with streaming compression and dynamic tables (albeit seeded from a common set of tables).</li>
</ul>
The end result is that you end up taking about 90 bytes (including ethernet headers!) to send a typical Matrix message (and about 70 bytes to receive the acknowledgement).  This breaks down as as:
<ul>
 	<li>14 bytes of Ethernet headers</li>
 	<li>20 bytes of IP headers</li>
 	<li>8 bytes of UDP headers</li>
 	<li>16 bytes of Noise AEAD</li>
 	<li>6 bytes of CoAP headers</li>
 	<li>~26 bytes of compressed and encrypted CBOR</li>
</ul>
The Noise handshake on connection setup would take an additional 128 bytes (4x 32 byte Curve25519 DH values), either spread over 1RTT for initial setup or 0RTT for subsequent setups.
<p>At 100bps, 90 bytes takes 90*8/100 = 7.2s to send... which is just about usable in an extreme life and death situation where you can only get 100bps of connectivity (e.g. someone at the bottom of a ravine trying to trickle data over one bar of GPRS to the emergency services).  In practice, on a custom network, you could ditch the Ethernet and UDP/IP headers if on a point-to-point link for CS API, and ditch the encryption if the network physical layer was trusted - at which point we're talking ~32 bytes per request (2.5s to send at 100bps).  Then, there's still a whole wave of additional work that could be investigated, including...</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Smarter streaming compression (so that if a user says 'Hello?' three times in a row, the 2nd and 3rd messages are just references to the first pattern)</li>
 	<li>Hoisting Matrix transaction IDs up to the CoAP layer (reusing the CoAP msgId+token rather than passing around new Matrix transaction IDs, at the expense of requiring one Matrix txn per request)</li>
 	<li>Switching to CoAP OBSERVE for receiving data from the server (currently we long-poll /sync to receive data)</li>
 	<li>Switching access_tokens for PSKs or similar</li>
</ul>
...all of which could shrink the payload down even further.  That said, even in its current state, it's a massive improvement - roughly ~65x better than the equivalent HTTPS+JSON traffic.
<p>In practice, <strong>further work on low-bandwidth Matrix is dependent on finding a sponsor who's willing to fund the team to focus on this</strong>, as otherwise it's hard to justify spending time here in addition to all the less exotic business-as-usual Matrix work that we need to keep the core of Matrix evolving (finishing 1.0, finishing E2E encryption, speeding up Synapse, finishing Dendrite, rewriting Riot/Android etc).  However, the benefits here should be pretty obvious: massively reduced bandwidth and battery-life; resilience to catastrophic network conditions; faster sync times; and even a protocol suitable for push notifications (Matrix as e2e encrypted, decentralised, push!).  If you're interested in supporting this work, please contact <code>support at matrix.org</code>.</p>

From Neil of the Synapse-team
<blockquote>Folks, in the run up to Synapse 1.0, if you are running your own homeserver now would be an excellent time to check that your TLS certificates are up to date. Point your server name at <a href="/federationtester/">https://matrix.org/federationtester/</a> and if there are errors check our handy FAQ on how to fix it. If you do not have valid TLS certificates Synapse 1.0 will refuse to federate with you.<br /><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">benpa</a> has put together a federation checker to quantify how many homeservers are 1.0 ready - <a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com">https://www.arewereadyyet.com/</a> - It currently stands at 50.5% let's try and get that to 60% over the weekend.<br /><br />Aside from all that, the team have been working on preparing for Synapse 1.0, you can <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">track our progress here</a>. We promise not to just land 1.0 out of the blue - we'll give everyone a 2 week warning to give stragglers a chance to get their certificates in order.</blockquote>
And this week we have Neil and Erik talking about this in more detail on Matrix Live

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@pztrn:pztrn.name">pztrn</a> has created a new mechanism for relaying apps that use Slack webhooks into Matrix:
<blockquote>
<p>To everyone who wonders how to connect his application to Matrix (at least for notifications of some kind) - use <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">OpenSAPS</a>! It just reached v0.1.0. <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">OpenSAPS</a> stands for Open Slack API Server and able to retransmit messages from applications (like Gitlab or everything that can send data to Slack) to somewhere else. Right now these &quot;somewhere else&quot; is a Telegram (with HTTP proxy support) and Matrix! Written in Golang to ensure minimal memory footprint. Take a look at <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps</a> Tested with Gitlab and Gitea but should work with almost any service. Join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opensaps:pztrn.name">#opensaps:pztrn.name</a> to talk with developers or get help. BTW, there is OpenSAPS instance in our room that transmits everything from gitlab.com into room! (almost) immediately after 0.1.0 comes <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps/tags/v0.1.1">0.1.1</a>, with fixed URLs parsing and fixed inability to login into servers which use .well-known for delegation. It should work [with other webhooks]. If something strange happens there is also a possibility to write own parser to make everything work :)‚ Tested with Gitlab and Gitea ATM. Share application names that work, I'll start to make a list of them. :D</p>

<blockquote>Bifrost is now starting to comfortably support gatewaying. For those that don't know, gateways allow a remote user to participate in the matrix network without prior bridging, it's very fancy. The latest changes are that XMPP clients can now ask for the public room list by querying the bridge component. There is a video on this using the Yaxim XMPP client on Android (Credit to Ge0rG). Come chat with us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#bifrost:half-shot.uk">#bifrost:half-shot.uk</a></blockquote>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Heads up that<a href="https://modular.im"> Modular.im</a> (the paid hosting Matrix service provided by <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a>, the company who employs much of the Matrix core team) launched a pilot today for paid Matrix integrations in the form of paid sticker packs.  Yes kids, it's true - for only $0.50 you can slap Matrix and Riot hex stickers all over your chatrooms. It's a toy example to test the payments infrastructure and demonstrate the concept - the proceeds go towards funding development work on Matrix.org :)  
You can read more about over on <a href="https://www.modular.im/stickers">Modular's blog</a>.</p>
<p>We wanted to elaborate on this a bit from the Matrix.org perspective, specifically:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">We are categorically <strong>not</strong> baking payments or financial incentives as a first class citizen into Matrix, and we're not going to start moving stuff behind paywalls or similar.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">This demo is a proof-of-concept to illustrate how folks could do this sort of thing in general in Matrix - it's not a serious product in and of itself.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">What it shows is that an Integration Manager like Modular can be used as a way to charge for services in Matrix - whether that's digital content within an integration, or bots/bridges/etc. 
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">While Modular today gathers payments via credit-card (Stripe), it could certainly support other mechanisms (e.g. cryptocurrencies) in future.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The idea in future is for Modular to provide this as a mechanism that <em>anyone</em> can use to charge for content on Matrix - e.g. if you have your own sticker pack and want to sell it to people, you'll be able to upload it and charge people for it.
</li>
</ul>
Meanwhile, there's a lot of interesting stuff on the horizon with integration managers in general - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1236">MSC1236</a> and an upcoming MSC from TravisR (based around <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1286">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1286</a>) proposing new integration capabilities.  We're also hoping to implement inline widgets soon (e.g. chatbot buttons for voting and other semantic behaviour) which should make widgets even more interesting!
<p>So, feel free to go stick some hex stickers on your rooms if you like and help test this out.  In future there should be more useful things available :)</p>

            <p>Well now, what have we here? Synapse 0.99.2 is the latest in the 0.99.x series as we step ever closer to 1.0.</p>
<p>0.99.2 is an incremental release including a bunch of performance improvements, enhancements to room upgrades and generally a plethora of bug fixes.</p>
<p>The most important thing that admins should know is that prior to 1.0 landing later this month, <strong>it is essential that the federation API has a valid TLS certificate - self signed certificates will no longer be accepted.</strong> For more details see our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">handy guide</a>. Failure to do this will result in being unable to federate with other 1.0 servers.</p>
<p>As ever, you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.2">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>. Note, Synapse is now available from PyPI, pick it up <a href="https://pypi.org/project/matrix-synapse/">here</a>.

<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> (master branch, and upcoming v0.0.9.4) can now open rooms by their aliases or ids upon pressing Ctrl+O, as long as those rooms are already in your room list (opening arbitrary public rooms will come in later versions). You can even paste matrix.to URIs for users (will open direct chat) and rooms in the same dialog. Navigation to known rooms inside Quaternion also works.<br /><br />libQMatrixClient 0.5 is out - with members lazy-loading, room versions and upgrades and much more: <a class="linkified" href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient/releases/tag/0.5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient/releases/tag/0.5.0</a></blockquote>

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aaron:raim.ist" rel="nofollow">Aaron Raimist</a> has made some updates to Riotic, which was a good chance for me to revisit it. It works nicely and is a great alternative to the Electron version of Riot. I also like being able to use <a href="https://riot.im/develop" rel="nofollow">https://riot.im/develop</a> as an app.
<blockquote>I've slightly tweaked Joakim Ahlen's Riot wrapper for macOS, riotic, which uses the native WKWebView instead of Electron. I updated the app to be sandboxed so it has very limited access to your system. I also updated the interface to follow macOS conventions and updated it to use the latest version of Swift.<br /><br />riotic does have some limitations though. Riot doesn't support VoIP on Safari so riotic can't support VoIP either and WKWebView doesn't support notifications as far as I can tell. Right now it uses a really old Riot icon, maybe I'll ask about using one of these community made icons <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/4474">https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/4474</a>.<br /><br />It does have some advantages over the official Riot Electron app though. The app is only ~12 MB compared to Riot which is ~180 MB, it also uses significantly less RAM. riotic also allows you to pick what Riot URL to use so you can run /develop as a desktop app.<br /><br />You can download riotic from <a href="https://github.com/aaronraimist/riotic/releases/tag/v1.1">https://github.com/aaronraimist/riotic/releases/tag/v1.1</a>.</blockquote>

<hr />
<p>Matrix is:</p>
<blockquote>an open standard for <em>interoperable</em>, <em>decentralised</em>, <em>real-time communication</em>.</blockquote>
In this article we'll benefit from all three of these attributes:
<ul>
 	<li><em>interoperable:</em> we'll see how Matrix can be made to interact with WhatsApp</li>
 	<li><em>decentralised</em>: you can perform this on your own server while still enjoying the benefits of being connected to the rest of the Matrix federation</li>
 	<li><em>real-time communication</em>: we'll see how to send and receive messages in real-time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installyourhomeserverandinstallmautrixwhatsappthewhatsappbridge">Install your homeserver and install mautrix-whatsapp, the WhatsApp bridge</h2>
Firstly, you need to have a Matrix homeserver installed. If you don't currently have one, take a look at the instructions at <a href="/docs/guides/installing-synapse">Installing Synapse</a>, and also in the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse README</a>.
<p>Next, install <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> by following the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp/wiki">mautrix-whatsapp/wiki</a>.</p>
<p>If you are starting from scratch, I suggest you take a look at <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>, as this project will enable you to deploy Synapse, <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> and other components easily.</p>
<p>For example, if you have an existing deployment using <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>, you can add <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> simply by adding the following line to your configuration file:</p>
<pre><code class="yaml language-yaml">matrix_mautrix_whatsapp_enabled: true
</code></pre>
<p>... and re-running the setup:</p>
<pre><code class="unix language-unix">ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all
</code></pre>
<p>Either way, you will soon have a functioning Matrix Synapse homeserver and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> installed with it. Next, we will set up an Android VM.</p>
<h2 id="setupanandroidvm">Set up an Android VM</h2>
The best way to run an Android Virtual Machine is to use the Android Studio tools from Google. First, <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/install">install Android Studio</a>, making sure to follow the post-install steps, as they will install additional tools we need, including AVD Manager.
<p>Once installed, run AVD manager by choosing <code>Tools -&gt; AVD Manager</code> from the menu.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to create a new virtual machine, in this example I have a Nexus 5X running Android 9, but almost any configuration is fine here. Make sure that you give the device access to the Play Store.</p>
<img src="/docs/img/avd.png" alt="" />
<h2 id="installwhatsappandsignin">Install WhatsApp and sign-in</h2>
Launch the Virtual Device, the open the Play Store and sign in. Now use the Play Store to install WhatsApp on the Virtual Device.
<p>You will be asked to verify your phone number, use your number on another device to complete this step.</p>
<center>
<img src="/docs/img/nexus5.png" /></center>
<h2 id="setupmautrixwhatsappbridge">Setup mautrix-whatsapp bridge</h2>
Now that you have WhatsApp working in a VM, and Matrix working on your server, it's time to bridge them together!
<p>Per the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp/wiki">mautrix-whatsapp/wiki</a>, you must start a new chat with <strong>@whatsappbot:<em>&lt;yourdomain</em>&gt;</strong>. Type <code>login</code> to begin the authentication process.</p>
<p>mautrix-whatsapp operates by using the WhatsApp Web feature of WhatsApp - which means it uses a QR code that you must now scan on the device running WhatsApp - which in your case is the AVD. In order to scan the presented QR code, set your AVD camera to passthrough the camera device on your host machine - see the images below.</p>
<img src="/docs/img/camera1.png" alt="" />
<img src="/docs/img/camera2.png" alt="" />
<p>Once this is complete, you can type <code>sync</code>, to start bridging contacts, and <code>sync --create</code> to automatically create room invites.</p>
<p>And that's it! You may need to take a little time to watch the sync happen, particularly if you have a very large number of chats on the WhatsApp side, but there is no further configuration needed.</p>

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@red_sky:ocean.joedonofry.com">red_sky</a> has continued to work on nheko, and shared a general roadmap in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko-reborn:matrix.org">#nheko-reborn:matrix.org</a>:
<blockquote>The remainder of 0.6.x is expected to be bug fixes. This includes bug fixes in mtxclient as well as nheko.<br />0.7.0 will be the next feature release. The end goal here is to add some of the capabilities that people have been requesting, and other things that people haven't been requesting.<br />AFTER 0.7.0 releases, I will then focus on updating the encryption to include more than just text messages.</blockquote>
<h2 id="libqmatrixclientprojectquaternion">libQMatrixClient project, Quaternion</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has been writing the codes this week, <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> now supports room upgrades and more:
<blockquote>Master branch of <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> can now store access token in your secure storage/keychain, better integrating into frameworks of GNOME and KDE, as well as macOS and Windows.<br />Also, you can see the room version and upgrade rooms in Quaternion (just like Matthew said on FOSDEM ;) ) - this feature is enabled by <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a>, so other clients are welcome to support room versions/upgrades too!<br /><br />All this is within the work on the upcoming release of libQMatrixClient 0.5 and Quaternion 0.0.9.4 - stay tuned!</blockquote><br />Oh we will. <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a> support for these new features when?<br /><h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2><br />Neil:<br /><blockquote>With all the interest generated through Riot 1.0 we've seen a surge of new and returning users on matrix.org. So we've spent much of the week investing in stability and performance. We'll ship a new point release (0.99.2) next week.<br />Once again a <strong>big flashing advert</strong> that Synapse admins should no longer be using self-signed certificates for their federation API. <strong>Synapse 1.0 is scheduled in early March and will not accept self signed certs</strong> - so servers that do not update will lose the ability to federate with 1.0 servers. Updating your certs is straight forward, see our guide <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">and FAQ</a> for more info.</blockquote><br /><h2 id="matrixrubysdk">Matrix Ruby SDK</h2><br />Ananace has continued his work on <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby Matrix SDK</a>:<br /><blockquote>Just tagged and pushed a new version (0.0.4) of the Ruby SDK, since I've completely forgotten to do that for a while now.</blockquote><br />What's new?<br /><blockquote>A whole bunch of small stuff I did, mostly just additional exposed methods and parameters, and some fixed issues as well. I did add support for HS URL discovery using both SRV and .well-known though, which I think is probably the largest new feature.</blockquote><br />As if all this wasn't enough, a room on Matrix!<br /><blockquote>Created a discussion room for the Ruby SDK - since it seems like there are now people who have actually used it apart from me; <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruby-matrix-sdk:kittenface.studio">#ruby-matrix-sdk:kittenface.studio</a></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has been working on federation workers:</p>

 	<li>Make all ui depended calls async, we should NEVER block ui</li>
 	<li>Offload heavy js logic to c++</li>
 	<li>Cleaner UI, with less crust</li>
 	<li>Async everything</li>
 	<li>Merge our WIP call support</li>
 	<li>Finish impl of call support (maybe move to a standalone webrtc module)</li>

We <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/the-big-1-0-68fa7c6050be">linked to the announcement last week</a>, and have been using it for even longer, but somehow I missed a great labs feature that shipped with Riot 1.0: "room breadcrumbs", which you can enable from the Labs page of Riot settings. This gives you a series of quick links with the history of rooms you were most recently in. So if you're like me, clicking between rooms all day, you can get where you're going a little faster.
<h2 id="mautrixwhatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</h2>
There is no big news about mautrix-whatsapp this week, other than that I installed it on my own server and found that it works really <em>really</em> well. I'd love to switch to this as a main interface for my less-decentralised friends, but like others, I've been stung by <a href="https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp/issues/98">this issue in an upstream project</a>. If there are go-fans reading (and I know there are), I wonder if it's an issue which can be fixed?

All good things must come to an end - and here we are!
<p>Matrix is getting a lot of attention recently (has it been on the front page of HN every day this week? I remember that I used to be excited seeing that happen), and seeing a lot of growth as well.</p>
<p>If you have something to say here, something to add, come chat to us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> - I love that this is a supportive and engaged project ecosystem, so come share what you have!</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We're very excited to officially welcome the KDE Community on to Matrix as they announce that <a href="https://dot.kde.org/2019/02/20/kde-adding-matrix-its-im-framework">KDE Community is officially adopting Matrix</a> as a chat platform, and kde.org now has an official Matrix homeserver!</p>
<p><a href="https://dot.kde.org/2019/02/20/kde-adding-matrix-its-im-framework"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4015" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kde-matrix-1-1024x355.png" alt="" width="653" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>You can see the full announcement and explanation over at <a href="https://dot.kde.org/2019/02/20/kde-adding-matrix-its-im-framework">https://dot.kde.org/2019/02/20/kde-adding-matrix-its-im-framework</a>.  It is fantastic to see one of the largest Free Software communities out there proactively adopting Matrix as an open protocol, open network and FOSS project, rather than drifting into a proprietary centralised chat system.  It's also really fun to see Riot 1.0 finally holding its own as a chat app against the proprietary alternatives!</p>
<p>This doesn't change the KDE rooms which exist in Matrix today or indeed the KDE Freenode IRC channels - so many of the KDE community were already using Matrix, all the rooms already exist and are already bridged to the right places.  All it means is that there's now a shiny new homeserver (powered by <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a>) on which KDE folk are welcome to grab an account if they want, rather than sharing the rather overloaded public matrix.org homeserver.  The rooms have been set up on the server to match their equivalent IRC channels - for instance, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#kde:kde.org">#kde:kde.org</a> is the same as #kde on Freenode; <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#kde-devel:kde.org">#kde-devel:kde.org</a> is the same as #kde-devel etc.  The rooms continue to retain their other aliases (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#kde:matrix.org">#kde:matrix.org</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#freenode_#kde:matrix.org">#freenode_#kde:matrix.org</a> etc) as before.</p>
<p>There's also a dedicated Riot/Web install up at <a href="https://webchat.kde.org">https://webchat.kde.org</a>, and instructions on connecting via other Matrix clients up at <a href="https://community.kde.org/Matrix">https://community.kde.org/Matrix</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-20-at-01.56.40.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4020" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-20-at-01.56.40-1024x898.png" alt="" width="832" height="730" /></a></p>
<p>This is great news for the Matrix ecosystem in general - and should be particularly welcome for Qt client projects like <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko-Reborn</a>, who may feel a certain affinity to KDE!</p>
<p>So: welcome, KDE!  Hope you have a great time, and please let us know how you get on, so we can make sure Matrix kicks ass for you :)</p>

As you may have seen, Matrix Live this week features Neil and Matthew <a href="/blog/2019/02/15/publishing-the-backend-roadmap/">discussing the newly announced backend roadmap</a>.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LfyQ6cNGbLk" width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p>We also have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.1.1">Synapse v0.99.1.1</a> available, as the race to Synapse v1.0 gets closer and closer and closer!</p>
<p>Brendan also said, regarding low-bandwidth:</p>
<blockquote>Some of the week has been spent finalising the components used in <a href="https://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/matrix.webm">the low-bandwidth demo we did at FOSDEM</a>. This required polishing some internal developments, which are now almost ready to be published to the wide world! This should happen in the next few days so stay tuned :)</blockquote>
<h2 id="riot100andhotfix101">Riot 1.0.0, and hotfix 1.0.1</h2>
If you're following Matrix much at all, you will surely have seen it by now: Riot, the most popular client, has <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/the-big-1-0-68fa7c6050be">announced the v1.0 milestone</a>. I won't reiterate the features and improvements here, but do check out the blog post, or just head over to <a href="https://riot.im/app">https://riot.im/app</a> and see for yourself!
<p>Particularly exciting is the new encryption verification process, involving sharing a list of emojis out-of-band:</p>

. . .which seems to me not boring at all - we can expect, in the next few months, another Matrix Client with E2EE support, and on mobile!
<p>In my role as editor of this particular blog post, I enjoy certain luxuries that others might envy. For example, today, I tried a new preview build of FluffyChat. This I installed on my barely-repaired OnePlus One running Ubuntu Touch 16.04.</p>

<h2 id="matrixarchivekeyring">matrix-archive-keyring</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been working on new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>:
<blockquote>I've paused porting Synapse to OpenBSD this week, while I attempt to both fix and <em>revert</em> some security issues caused by <code>sudo apt-key add</code> for Matrix.org and Riot.im packages for Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution users.<br /><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4609">matrix-org/synapse PR #4609</a> was my first attempt to fix the problem, however I fell short this time in ease-of-use and my implementation had other issues. (Read: The <code>repo-key.asc</code> downloaded from Matrix.org Debian repository should go to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>, and must not be added by <code>apt-key add</code> or added to <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d</code> directly. I attempted the latter with my first PR; but that would've allowed the Matrix.org signing key to also be used to verify packages from Debian's main repositories. Yikes!)<br />As my second attempt, I'm now creating a new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>. There's multiple things this package intends to do:
</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>A post-install script to remove any previously added Matrix.org package signing keys from <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg</code>. (This is the file <code>apt-key add</code> most commonly uses, and the most commonly found bad advice on the Internet.)</li>
 	<li>Convert <code>repo-key.asc</code> to a de-armorized <code>.gpg</code> format, understood better by apt(8). (Essentially, <code>gpg --dearmor</code>.)</li>
 	<li>Install the converted <code>.gpg</code> key to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>.</li>
 	<li>Make sure <code>apt(8)</code> uses the newly added key for Matrix.org repository only?</li>
 	<li>Deliver any updates to <code>repo-key.asc</code> directly to you via <code>apt upgrade</code>. Your operating system might then also do it automatically for you if <code>unattended-upgrades(8)</code> is installed on your system. ?</li>
 	<li>Make sure everything goes away when this keyring package is uninstalled. No more <code>sudo sh -c 'apt-key del C35EB17E1EAE708E6603A9B3AD0592FE47F0DF61; rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> to get rid of the repository.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
I have one more interesting enhancement to disclose.<br />We can ask you with <code>debconf</code> if you want to install <code>deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian $(lsb_release -cs) main</code> to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> while you're installing the new keyring with <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code>.<br />You'll most likely notice the difference in install instructions, as a result of this package. Before and after:</blockquote>
<pre><code># Before
sudo apt install -y lsb-release curl apt-transport-https
echo "deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian `lsb_release -cs` main" |
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list
curl "https://matrix.org/packages/debian/repo-key.asc" |
    sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
<pre><code># After
sudo apt install matrix-archive-keyring
sudo sh -c 'apt update &amp;&amp; apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
<blockquote>If you are a Debian or Ubuntu user and Synapse homeserver operator using Matrix.org repositories, I'll be towncrying when this package becomes available as much as I can. All you should need to do then is <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code> and it should patch the security holes in your operating system if you've formerly installed packages from Matrix.org or Riot.im! (The command may change a bit, because next Debian operating system release "Buster" has entered soft-freeze just today (2019-02-12) and not accepting new packages into that release.)<br />PS: I'm at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#debian-matrix:matrix.org">#debian-matrix:matrix.org</a>, please come talk to us if Debian packaging interests you!</blockquote>
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For the eager early testers not afraid of building from source, <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code> version <code>2015.12.09+debian0.10</code> is available for early testing (attached).
<pre><code># Something like this!
sudo apt install devscripts
tar -xfvJ matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10.tar.xz
cd matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10
debuild -us -uc
sudo dpkg -i dpkg -i ../matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10_all
</code></pre>
Please follow <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=922155">Debian Bug#922155</a> for updates. Debian binary packages will be available later sometime this/next week from Debian's <code>unstable</code> distribution (<code>contrib</code>), if all goes well and there are no remaining Debian policy violations or serious bugs.

        <div>
            <p>Good people, </p>
<p>2019 is a big year for Matrix, in the next month we will have shipped:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Matrix spec 1.0 (including the first stable release of the Server to Server Spec)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Synapse 1.0
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Riot 1.0
</li>
</ul>
This is huge in itself, but is really only the beginning, and now we want to grow the ecosystem as quickly as possible. This means landing a mix of new features, enhancing existing ones, some big performance improvements as well as generally making life easier for our regular users, homeserver admins and community developers.
<p>Today we are sharing the Matrix core team's backend roadmap. The idea is that this will make it easier for anyone to understand where the project is going, what we consider to be important, and why.</p>
<p>To see the roadmap in its full glory, <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/9">take a look here</a>.</p>
<h3>What is a roadmap and why is it valuable?
</h3>
A roadmap is a set of high level projects that the team intend to work on and a rough sense of the relative priority. It is essential to focus on specific goals, which inevitably means consciously not working on other initiatives.
<p>Our roadmap is not a delivery plan - there are explicitly no dates. The reason for this is that we know that other projects will emerge, developers will be needed to support other urgent initiatives, matrix.org use continues to grow exponentially and will require performance tweaking. </p>
<p>So simply, based on what we know now, this is the order we will work on our projects.</p>
<h3>Why are we sharing it?
</h3>
We already share our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">day to day todo list</a>, and of course our commit history, but it can be difficult for a casual observer to see the bigger picture from such granular data. The purpose of sharing is that we want anyone from the community to understand where our priorities lie. 
<p>We are often asked ‘Why are you not working on X, it is really important' where the answer is often ‘We agree that X is really important, but A, B and C are more important and must come first'. </p>
<p>The point of sharing the roadmap is to make that priority trade off more transparent and consumable.</p>
<h3>How did we build it?
</h3>
The core contributors to Synapse and Dendrite are 6 people, of 5 nationalities spread across 3 locations. After shipping the <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.1.html">r0 release of the Server to Server spec</a> last month we took some time to step back and have a think about what to do after Synapse 1.0 lands. This meant getting everyone in one place to talk it through. 
<p>We also had Ben (benpa) contribute from a community perspective and took input from speaking to so many of you at FOSDEM.</p>
<p>In the end we filled a wall with post-its, each post-it representing a sizeable project. The position of the post-it was significant in that the vertical axis being a sense of how valuable we thought the task would be, and the horizontal axis being a rough guess on how complex we considered it to be.</p>
<p>We found this sort of grid approach to be really helpful in determining relative priority.</p>
<p>After many hours and plenty of blood, sweat and tears we ended up with something we could live with and wrote it up in the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/9">shared board</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_2247.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3996" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_2247-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_2245.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3990" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_2245-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<h3>And this is written in blood right?
</h3>
Not at all (it's written in board marker). This is simply a way to express our plan of action and we are likely to make changes to it dynamically. However, this means that at any given moment, if someone wants to know what we are working on then the roadmap is the place to go.
<h3>But wait I want to know more!</h3>
Here is a video of myself and Matthew to talk you through the projects
