<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you haven't already seen it, we wrote a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/15/dendrite-2020-progress-update">Dendrite 2020 Progress Update blog post</a> detailing our year in Dendrite. It also includes an announcement for our new public <code>dendrite.matrix.org</code> homeserver, which is open for registration!</p>
<p>Today we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.4">Dendrite 0.3.4</a>, which is a performance and bug-fix release, including the following changes from the last two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The stream tokens for <code>/sync</code> have been refactored, giving PDUs, typing notifications, read receipts, invites and send-to-device messages their own respective stream positions, greatly improving the correctness of sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new roominfo cache has been added, which results in less database hits in the roomserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prometheus metrics have been added for sync requests, destination queues and client API event send perceived latency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event IDs are no longer recalculated so often in <code>/sync</code>, which reduces CPU usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync requests are now woken up correctly for our own device list updates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device list stream position is no longer lost, so unnecessary device updates no longer appear in every other sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A crash on concurrent map read/writes has been fixed in the stream token code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver input API no longer starts more worker goroutines than needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver no longer uses the request context for queued tasks which could lead to send requests failing to be processed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new index has been added to the sync API current state table, which improves lookup performance significantly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client API <code>/joined_rooms</code> endpoint no longer incorrectly returns <code>null</code> if there are 0 rooms joined</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver will now query appservices when looking up a local room alias that isn't known</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The check on registration for appservice-exclusive namespaces has been fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="github-gitlab-bridge">GitHub / Gitlab bridge</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone! It's been ages since I've talked about a personal project on here. I've been working on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-github">matrix-github</a> bridge, which is an all singing all dancing service to connect you to Github AND Gitlab. (Yes, it's now poorly named).</p>
<p>I've landed the initial bits to make GitLab work, so that you can join issues and MRs as rooms in the UI but there is more work to do to make that solid and more interactive. The thing I am most looking forward to is notifications for GitLab so I can get away from emails.</p>
<p>ALSO, off the back of TravisR's fantastic widget work, I've landed initial support for widgets in admin rooms and soon issue/PR rooms. The idea here being that widgets give you a nicer UI to control the bridge or render details like commits going past or diffs. All the groundwork for authenticating widgets against the bridge and rendering them is done, now it just needs features.</p>
<p>That's the highlights this week. I'm hoping to really tighten the documentation to get more people spun up on it as the notifications features have turned out to be a killer feature for me :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-12-18-x7YaI-image.png" alt="2020-12-18-x7YaI-image.png" /></p>
<p>I've been using this (the bridge, rather than the upcoming widgets) for a couple of months now and find it really really powerful. I'm not in GitHub most of the day, so getting notifs piped direct into Matrix is great!</p>

<h3 id="gitter">Gitter</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org">Eric Eastwood</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few updates to the Gitter bridge itself this week handling Matrix edits outside of the 5 minute edit window on Gitter and fixing up @mentions being mangled by <code>:</code> colons on the Gitter side when someone mentions you from Element. We also strip the redundant Matrix reply quote when it goes into a Gitter threaded conversation because it's already easily viewable in the thread.</p>
<p>We're also getting started on some of the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Element feature parity with Gitter issues</a>. First directly tackling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">backfilling existing message history</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In celebration of the cross-signing MSC being finally merged, Nheko master now supports cross signing other users and your own devices. üéâ The UX is currently not final, you have to manually fetch the cross signing keys in the settings, if you don't have them after a verification. You are also not yet prompted to verify new logins and can't bootstrap cross-signing from Nheko, but the functional bits and bobs are there now. We are also still investigating, if prompting for your recovery key/passphrase is less confusing by using just one input field or if we should prompt for them separately. Currently Nheko just asks you to unlook and will accept whatever you input (if it can decrypt the secrets with it). FluffyChat does that and I think it is really nice!</p>
<p>There are also a few smaller features added recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now uses the icon from your theme on the login page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can react instead of reply with a (very) short text using /react</p>

<p>A few improvements(?) regarding whitespace and code rendering.</p>

<p>Today, we can announce the web/desktop variant of SchildiChat is <strong>out of beta</strong>!</p>
<p><a href="https://schildi.chat/">SchildiChat</a> is a fork of Element, which focuses on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list for both direct messages and groups, which is a more familiar approach to users of other popular instant messengers.</p>
<p>Since the last announcement on TWIM, we have not only fixed most of the layout bugs caused by the message bubbles, but can also report the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Settings for layouts work, so you can also use SchildiChat if you only want the unified overview and no message bubbles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All information about desktop is now on our new website: https://schildi.chat/desktop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hosted instance is now here: https://app.schildi.chat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Linux, SchildiChat is now available from AUR, apt repo for debian, flathub and as AppImage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's a portable Windows version now too</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fluffychat">FluffyChat</h3>
<p><a href="https://fluffychat.im">FluffyChat</a> is a cute cross-platform matrix client. It is available for Android, iOS, Web and Desktop.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">krille</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FluffyChat 0.24.0 is released with new features and fixes.</p>
<p>What is new:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new public room discovery page, where you can find and join public rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental bootstrap support for cross-signing and keybackup and something really weird that is named SSSS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced power level managing for rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minor design changes like a new icon set</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beside of that we have of course a lot of bug fixes and stability improvements. All languages should now also work on iOS.</p>
<p>Also we are looking forward to publish the app in the AppStore for iOS but we will do this under the hood of Famedly. Btw. FluffyChat will soon move to the Famedly GitLab project and we will move the app in the PlayStore to the Famedly account too. This doesn't mean that anything will change there. It is just that Famedly will now handle the legal stuff for us and may offer paid customer support for businesses, which have interest in FluffyChat. But the app will still be available under the same AGPL3 license. This will just make it easier for us to publish the app in the official stores as we don't need to pay so much for the developer accounts.</p>

            <p>One of the goals on the core team is to reduce friction for new users joining Matrix. A challenge we regularly face is all the factors which make Matrix flexible and powerful as an open, secure decentralised protocol also increase the difficulty of getting started.</p>
<p>As one example‚Äî to create a healthy, vibrant ecosystem and put power back into the hands of end users, it‚Äôs critical multiple clients exist, and that users ultimately have control over which one to use. However, needing to choose a client before getting going is counter-intuitive, and adds cognitive load which proprietary services simply don‚Äôt have.</p>
<p>Striking this balance is tricky, and one we‚Äôre aiming to improve with the latest version of <a href="https://www.matrix.to">Matrix.to</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-matrix-to">What's Matrix.to?</h2>
<p>Matrix.to is a simple URL redirection service which lets users share links to rooms, users and communities. It isn‚Äôt tied to any client, and for end users it serves as a landing page for many as their first touch to Matrix. And until the matrix:// URI scheme is deployed commonplace (we finally <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/matrix">registered it with IANA</a> a few months ago!) it is the only client-agnostic way to link to content in Matrix.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs privacy preserving, with no information stored server side, with all calculation done in client-side JavaScript. It started life years ago as a temporary minimum viable hack by Matthew which then hung around untouched for years being‚Ä¶ minimally viable. But we‚Äôve recently given it a huge upgrade in usability and functionality at last!</p>
<h2 id="what-s-new">What's new?</h2>
<p><img src="https://matrix.org/blog/img/2020-12-17-matrix_to.png" alt="The matrix.to room, on the new matrix.to!" /></p>
<p>We‚Äôve re-written matrix.to from scratch, giving it a visual upgrade and refocused the experience around:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Helping new users find the best client for them to easily get going.</strong> By default, links will prioritise showing clients which are compatible with the platform the link is being viewed from, including mobile platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optionally, remembering your preferred client for future visits.</strong> This also includes deeplinking into native apps for Element Desktop &amp; Element Mobile (and in future, other clients too, of course).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fetching useful previews.</strong> One of our main observations when testing with new users is a lack of confidence trying out a new service without personalised, contextual information on the rooms or people they‚Äôre heading to. Matrix.to now displays room metadata like avatars, names and topics directly (fetched via matrix.org by default, asking for permission).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>We‚Äôve baked in the ability to specify clients and deployments within links, allowing sharing to give the option of a specific destination to guarantee a predictable experience. For instance, Mozilla might share matrix.to links which recommend using chat.mozilla.org, if you don‚Äôt already have a preferred Matrix client configured. We‚Äôve yet to implement this feature in Element, but we‚Äôll be researching and experimenting with different implementations soon and will recommend best practises when we have them.</p>
<p>We plan to evolve matrix.to over time, including eventually evolving it to better support the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2312">Matrix URI scheme</a>. As before, you can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to">on GitHub</a> and please go ahead and submit pull requests to get your Matrix client listed.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think over in the matrix.to room, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix.to:matrix.org">linked to via matrix.to</a>!</p>

            <p>It's been a year since Dendrite development picked up again and it's certainly
been a busy one at that! We started off 2020 by sprinting to complete the FOSDEM P2P
demo and, since then, we have continued to develop Dendrite into a more featureful
and stable homeserver.</p>
<p>In October, we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">moved Dendrite into beta</a>,
and have since released a number of releases. We've also seen quite a lot of interest
from the community, so I'm here today to write about some of the fun things that have
been going on in Dendrite-land.</p>
<h2 id="announcing-dendrite-matrix-org">Announcing dendrite.matrix.org</h2>
<p>I'm happy to announce that we've finally deployed our own public Dendrite instance at
<strong>dendrite.matrix.org</strong>! It's running the latest Dendrite code and is open for
registration, so if you have been looking for an opportunity to play with Dendrite
without hosting your own deployment, here's your chance!</p>
<p>There are still bugs and missing features, but overall the server is quite usable, so
please feel free to register and try it and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">let us know how you get on</a>.</p>
<p>This is the first deployment that we've built for any kind of scale, so we are cautious
of the fact that there may be performance bottlenecks still. That said, over the last
few weeks, a number of performance-improving changes have been merged, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Around 20x performance improvement on the State Resolution v2 algorithm, which is used
in room versions 2 and above</li>
<li>Significantly reducing the amount of time spent recalculating event reference hashes
and event IDs in the roomserver and sync API, reducing CPU usage</li>
<li>Optimised memory usage and reduced database hits in the federation sender, which helps
particularly in large rooms with lots of resident servers</li>
</ul>
<p>We're optimistic that running this deployment will help us to identify scaling pain
points and to make Dendrite leaner in the long run. Feel free to sign up and give it
a spin! :-)</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, we've added a number of new features, including but
not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Room versions support for all currently specced versions (v1-v6), including support
for State Resolution v2</li>
<li>SQLite storage support in addition to PostgreSQL, largely useful for the P2P demos</li>
<li>Support for database schema upgrades, making updating Dendrite significantly easier</li>
<li>Early end-to-end encryption support, including device list syncing and send-to-device
messages, although with key backup and cross-signing still to come</li>
<li>A number of federation features, including invites, retries and backing off unreachable
homeservers</li>
<li>User-interactive authentication (UIA), which is used in password changes and deleting
devices from your device list</li>
<li>Support for local pagination, backfilling over federation and fetching missing events</li>
<li>Redaction of events both locally and over federation</li>
<li>Entirely new microservices for managing server signing keys, E2E keys, user and device
management</li>
<li>Lots of great contributions from the community - including all of Read Receipts (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a>) and Read Markers (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a>)!</li>
</ul>
<p>...and of course <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">entered Beta</a> in October!</p>
<h2 id="spec-compliance">Spec compliance</h2>
<p>Of course, Dendrite also needs to be able to fulfill the promise of being a usable
next-generation Matrix homeserver at the same time as being a sci-fi development
platform. We have spent much of the last year working specifically on this. Today,
Dendrite's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">Sytest</a> compliance sits at:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>59%</strong> compliance for Client-Server APIs, up from 33% in May 2020</li>
<li><strong>83%</strong> compliance for Server-Server APIs, up from 26% in May 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, these are significant leaps in the numbers of tests passing against
Dendrite. </p>
<h2 id="experimental-mscs">Experimental MSCs</h2>
<p>We have been increasingly trying to use Dendrite for the development and testing of
some new Matrix feature proposals. Recently we've seen early support added for
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2753">Peeking (MSC2753)</a> and there
is work in progress on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2444">Peeking over Federation (MSC2444)</a>.</p>
<p>Peeking enables temporarily subscribing to a room for real-time events without joining
the room. This will only be possible with rooms that are world-readable, but it reduces
the overhead of looking into a room significantly as there is no need to update the room
state for each peeking user/device.</p>
<p>In addition to that, we've also been working on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2836">Threading (MSC2836)</a>
support, which is the gateway to building some pretty new and interesting Matrix
experiences. Twitter-like or Reddit-like social prototypes like this have traditionally
been difficult to build on top of Matrix as the <code>m.reference</code> relation type from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849">MSC1849</a>
had never really been fleshed out.</p>
<p>Threading adds <code>m.relationship</code> fields for embedding these relationships, and also
specifies an additional <code>/event_relationships</code> API endpoint for finding other events
related to a given event in either direction. This makes it possible to build threads.</p>
<h2 id="p2p-matrix">P2P Matrix</h2>
<p>Dendrite has also been our primary development platform for P2P Matrix. This year we
have released multiple P2P Matrix demos, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://p2p.riot.im">p2p.riot.im</a>, which uses libp2p rendezvous and embeds a full
Dendrite homeserver into an in-browser Service Worker</li>
<li><a href="http://testflight.apple.com/join/Tgh2MEk6">Element iOS P2P</a>, available on TestFlight,
which embeds a full Dendrite homeserver into the Element iOS app, initially using
QUIC over <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io">Yggdrasil</a> as a transport for federation
traffic, but with more recent versions using QUIC over the experimental Pinecone protocol</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/tree/master/cmd/dendrite-demo-libp2p">dendrite-demo-libp2p</a>,
a standalone binary which formed the basis of the FOSDEM 2020 P2P demo, using libp2p and
local multicast discovery as a transport for federation traffic</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/tree/master/cmd/dendrite-demo-yggdrasil">dendrite-demo-yggdrasil</a>,
another standalone binary like above, but using QUIC over Yggdrasil connectivity instead
of libp2p as the transport for federation traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>Each experiment teaches us more about potential issues that need to be resolved in order
to bring P2P Matrix closer to being reality, and we are continuing to use Dendrite for
this work. We'll be announcing more information in the New Year about our latest efforts
and the Pinecone routing scheme that we are developing.</p>
<p>It's also worth highlighting that all of the other experimental work taking place right
now, including Threading and Peeking, also work over P2P!</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What's next</h2>
<p>We'll be taking a short break for Christmas, but will then be continuing work on
Dendrite in 2021, with the main aims being to add new features, improve spec compliance
further, fix bugs and eventually exit beta. We'll also be continuing further experimental work in the
P2P and Threading areas, as well as supporting the development of new MSCs such as
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2787">Portable Identities (MSC2787)</a>.</p>
<p>We'd like to say thank you for the community support and interest, and also to send
out a special thanks to our community contributors who have contributed a number of
fixes and features in recent months! We always welcome code contributions via
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">GitHub</a> if you are an interested developer.</p>

<p>Lots of things to talk about! Firstly I'm very happy to say that <em>spaces are happening</em>, you can keep track of them here: https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/15930.</p>
<p>Next <a href="https://matrix.org/open-tech-will-save-us/9">Open Tech Will Save Us</a>, was great this month, and you can also get a great introduction to Matrix Spaces there too.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mschopen:uni-bielefeld.de">Marcus Schopen</a> shared his love for Matrix by showing us the Matrix-branded mugs he has had printed:</p>

<p>Hello, friends! On Wednesday we released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/09/synapse-1-24-0-and-1-23-1-released">Synapse 1.24.0 and 1.23.1</a>, which include security fixes. Please upgrade! (Also, if you've installed Synapse from source, be sure to <code>pip install 'cryptography&gt;=3.3'</code> in your virtualenv to address the recent <a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20201208.txt">OpenSSL CVE</a>).</p>
<p>This is our last full release for the year, as we don't want to do anything that might risk the stability Santa's federated command and control centre at the North Pole, but we're looking forward to lots of new features and improvements in the new year ‚Äî more details on that next week.</p>
<p>We'd also like to remind you that we're planning on removing support for Python 3.5 early next year (a formal announcement and timeline will accompany the 1.25.0 release), and we'd appreciate and comments or concerns in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8782">this GitHub issue</a>.</p>

<p>Just updated my Synapse K8s-optimized image and Chart to 1.24.0, planning on deprecating the image at some point soon though, instead pointing people to upstream - or platform-optimized - images as I should be able to move all the Kubernetes-specific things into the chart itself to make it more compatible.</p>
<p>The image in question started off as a plain docker image, before there were official ones. I've since rebased it onto the official Matrix image with just the modified scripts and volume points.</p>
<p>My plan is to move all the Kubernetes-specific scripts into configmaps (which are a K8s way of storing text files/environment variables/etc), and then build my own launch arguments through the chart to get it to run on any image that has a Python interpreter and the Synapse modules available in the Python search path.</p>
<p>With all that done, it means I won't be a bottleneck in pushing updated image tags for people to be able to update, and I won't have to finagle multi-arch images üòÉ</p>

<p>In terms of bridge progress, we added support for <code>m.emote</code> status messages which means your <code>/me says hi</code> messages will bridge back and forth properly.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kaiyou:tedomum.net">kaiyou</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a first update regarding a very small project named &quot;axon&quot;, aimed at operating the synapse admin API from Python, either as a library or a CLI tool. It is currently in use everyday on our synapse instance for managing users and looking for suspicious rooms, and is being integrated into a prototype Web interface for managing synapse.</p>
<p>Admin API coverage is currently about 50%, mostly focusing on users and rooms management (get, list, update, delete). It is still enough to delete a user, edit an offensive avatar, or run as a cron to periodically purge remote media.</p>
<p>Our main repository: https://forge.tedomum.net/tedomum/axon</p>
<p>Github project mirror for contributing: https://github.com/kaiyou/axon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked if there was a GUI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not currently, but we are integrating it with another of our tools named &quot;hiboo&quot;, which is a general indie hoster user manager (provides SAML &amp; OIDC authentication with config templates for many projects including synapse, and integrates the account workflows and moderation features). Currently it provides room navigation and purging, plus deleting accounts either on moderator decision or when the user deletes her SSO account.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, maybe it's about time for &quot;synadm - a CLI frontend to Matrix-Synapse admin APIs&quot; to be announced more officially. As the name implies it's a CLI tool that eases the usage of admin API commands for Synapse admins. It currently covers everything the room and user API's can do: https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#implementation-status--commands-list</p>
<p>It can be configured interactively and/or using a config file in yaml format: https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#configuration</p>
<p>It's configurable whether the responds of the API are shown in pretty printed JSON or in a table format (using Python tabulate).</p>
<p>It's well documented via it's online help and supposed to be quite self-explanatory to the admin.</p>
<p>Any thoughts, ideas, feature-requests are very welcome in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at">#synadm:peek-a-boo.at</a> or as usual by filing PR's or issues in the project repo https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm.</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.24.0">Synapse 1.24.0</a> is now available!</p>
<p>This release fixes a denial of service vulnerability (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-hxmp-pqch-c8mm">GHSA-hxmp-pqch-c8mm</a> / <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-26257">CVE-2020-26257</a>) in which a malicious homeserver could send malformed events into a room which would then break federation of that room.</p>
<p>This follows the disclosure of a denial of service vulnerability in OpenSSL (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20201208.txt">CVE-2020-1971</a>). If you have installed Synapse from source, please ensure your host is up to date and then execute <code>pip install 'cryptography&gt;=3.3'</code> inside your Synapse virtualenv.</p>
<p>We've also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.1">Synapse 1.23.1</a> which includes that security fix and a small patch to maintain Python 3.5 compatibility. It is otherwise <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/compare/v1.23.0...v1.23.1">identical to 1.23.0</a>. Note that Synapse 1.24.0 includes backwards incompatible changes which may affect a small number of users. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1240">notes on upgrading</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.24.0 brings a pair of new Admin APIs, including a way to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.24.0/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#login-as-a-user">log in as users</a> and to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.24.0/docs/admin_api/rooms.md#delete-room-api">forcibly purge</a> rooms when deleting them. We've also made numerous bug fixes and improvements to SSO support, especially around OpenID Connect and SAML providers.</p>
<p>This release includes an optional change to push notification badges: currently, the number in the badge is based on the count of <em>rooms</em> with unread messages. However, in some specialized cases you may want the badge to show the count of <em>all</em> unread messages, even if there are multiple unread messages in the same room. This behavior can now be toggled with a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8820">new configuration setting</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, for server admins, the deprecated <code>/_matrix/client/*/admin</code> Admin API endpoints <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8785">have been removed</a>. If you have tools which target these endpoints, please update them to use the <code>/_synapse/admin</code> URL prefix instead.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.24.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> for more.</p>
<p>Installation instructions are available <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md">on GitHub</a>, as is the <code>v1.24.0</code> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.24.0">release tag</a>.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>It‚Äôs been just over 2 months since we revealed that <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/30/welcoming-gitter-to-matrix">Gitter was going to join Matrix</a> - and
we are incredibly proud to announce that Gitter has officially turned on true native Matrix connectivity:
<strong>all public Gitter rooms are now available natively via Matrix, and all Gitter users now natively exist on Matrix.</strong>
So, if you wanted to join the official Node.js language support room at <a href="https://gitter.im/nodejs/node">https://gitter.im/nodejs/node</a>
from Matrix, just head over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nodejs_node:gitter.im">#nodejs_node:gitter.im</a> and *boom*, you‚Äôre in!</p>
<p>This means Gitter is now running a Matrix homeserver at gitter.im which exposes all the active public rooms - so if you go to the the room directory in Element (for instance) and select gitter.im as a homeserver, you can jump straight in:</p>
<p><img src="https://matrix.org/blog/img/2020-12-07-gitter-roomdir.png" alt="Gitter room directory" /></p>
<p>Once you‚Äôre in, you can chat back and forth transparently between users on the Gitter side and the Matrix side, and you no longer have the ugly ‚ÄúMatrixbot‚Äù user faking the messages back and forth - these are ‚Äòreal‚Äô users talking directly to one another, and every public msg in every public room is now automatically exposed into Matrix.</p>
<p><img src="https://matrix.org/blog/img/2020-12-07-gitter-matrix.gif" alt="Gitter and Matrix going native!" /></p>
<p>So, suddenly all the developer communities previously living only in Gitter (<a href="https://gitter.im/scala">Scala</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/nodejs/home">Node</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/webpack">Webpack</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/angular">Angular</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/rails">Rails</a> and thousands of others) are now available to anyone anywhere on Matrix - alongside communities bridged from Freenode and Slack; the native Matrix communities for Mozilla, KDE, GNOME communities etc. We‚Äôre hopeful that glueing everything together via Matrix will usher in a new age of open and defragmented dev collaboration, a bit like we used to have on IRC, back in the day.</p>
<p>This is also great news for mobile Gitter users - as the original mobile Gitter clients have been in a <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/issues/2281">holding pattern for over a year</a>, and native Matrix support for Gitter means they are now officially deprecated in favour of Element (or indeed any other mobile Matrix client).</p>
<h2 id="what-features-are-ready">What features are ready?</h2>
<p>Now, this is the first cut of native Matrix support in Gitter: much of the time since Gitter joined Element has been spent migrating stuff over from Gitlab to Element, and it‚Äôs only really been a month of work so far in hooking up Matrix. As a result: all the important features work, but there‚Äôs also stuff that‚Äôs yet to land:</p>
<p>Features ready today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to join rooms from Matrix via¬†#org_repo:gitter.im</li>
<li>Bridging Edits, Replies (mapped to Threads on Gitter), Deletes, File transfer</li>
<li>Bridging Markdown &amp; Emoji</li>
</ul>
<p>What remains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to send/receive Direct Messages</li>
<li>Ability to plumb existing Matrix rooms into Gitter natively</li>
<li>Ability to view past Gitter history from Matrix. This is planned thanks to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716</a></li>
<li>Synchronising the full Gitter membership list to Matrix. Currently the membership syncs incrementally as people speak</li>
<li>Turning off the old Gitter bridge</li>
<li>Bridging emotes (/me support) (almost landed!)</li>
<li>Bridging read receipts</li>
<li>Synchronising room avatars</li>
<li>Bridge LaTeX</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuff we‚Äôre not planning to support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to join arbitrary rooms on Matrix from Gitter. This could consume huge resources on Gitter, and we‚Äôre not in a rush to mirror all of Matrix into Gitter. This will get addressed when Gitter merges with Element into a pure Matrix client.</li>
<li>Bridging Reactions. Gitter doesn‚Äôt have these natively today, and rather than adding them to Gitter, we‚Äôd rather work on merging Gitter &amp; Element together.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, we strongly recommend checking out the <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitterHQ/-/epics/10">native Matrix epic on Gitlab</a> for the unvarnished truth straight from the coal-face!</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-make-an-existing-chat-system-talk-matrix">How do you make an existing chat system talk Matrix?</h2>
<p>In terms of the work which has gone into this - Gitter has been an excellent case study of how you can easily plug an existing large established chat system into Matrix.</p>
<p>At high level, the core work needed was as simple as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add ‚Äòvirtual users‚Äô, so remote Matrix users can be modelled and represented in Gitter correctly: <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2027/diffs">https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2027/diffs</a>.
<ul>
<li>This can be accomplished by simply adding a <code>virtualUser</code> property to your chat message/post/tweet schema which holds the mxid, displayName, and avatar as an alternative to your <code>author</code> field. Then display the <code>virtualUser</code> whenever available over the <code>author</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add an application service to Gitter to bridge traffic in &amp; out of Matrix: <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2041/diffs">https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2041/diffs</a>
<ul>
<li>This &quot;application service&quot; comes pre-packaged for you in many cases, so for example you can simply drop in a library like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> in a Node.js application, and all of the Matrix talking complexity is handled for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Polish it!</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, Eric (lead Gitter dev) laid out the waypoints of the full journey:</p>
<ol>
<li>First big step was to add the concept of virtual users to Gitter. We could also have created a new Gitter user for every new matrix ID that appears, but tagging them as virtual users is a bit cleaner.</li>
<li>Figuring out how to balance the Matrix traffic coming into/out of Gitter.
<ol>
<li>Spreading the inbound load comes for free via our existing load-balancer setup (ELB) where we already have 8 webapp servers running the various services of gitter.im. We just run the Matrix bridge on those servers alongside each web and api process, and then the load-balancer‚Äôs <code>matrix.gitter.im</code> spreads out to the servers.</li>
<li>Events from Matrix then hit the load balancer and reach one of the servers (no duplication when processing events).</li>
<li>If something on Gitter happens, the action occurs on one server and we just propagate it over to Matrix (no duplication or locking needed).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>We have realtime websockets and Faye subscriptions already in the app which are backed by Mongoose database hooks whenever something changes. We just tapped into the same thing to be able to bridge across new information to Matrix as we receive it on Gitter.</li>
<li>Hooking up the official Matrix bridging <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> library to use Gitter‚Äôs existing MongoDB for storage instead of nedb.</li>
<li>Figuring out how to namespace the mxids of the gitter users:
<ol>
<li>It‚Äôs nice to have the mxid as human readable as possible instead of just the numerical userId in your service.</li>
<li>But if people can change their username in your service, you can‚Äôt change your mxid on Matrix. In the future, we‚Äôll have portable accounts in Matrix to support this (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2787">MSC2787</a>) but sadly these are still vapourware at this point.</li>
<li>If you naively just switch the user‚Äôs mxid when they rename their username, then you could end up leaking conversation history between mxids(!)</li>
<li>So we went with <code>@username-userid:gitter.im</code> for the Matrix ID to make it a bit more human readable but also unique so any renames can happen without affecting anything.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For room aliases, we decided to change our <code>community/room</code> URI syntax to underscores for the room aliases, <code>#community_room:gitter.im</code></li>
<li>Figuring out how to bridge features correctly;
<ol>
<li>Emoji - mapping between <code>:shortcode:</code> and unicode emojis</li>
<li>Mapping between Gitter threaded conversations &lt;-&gt; Matrix replies</li>
<li>Mapping between Matrix mentions and Gitter mentions</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Keeping users and room data in sync
<ol>
<li>We haven‚Äôt gotten there yet, but the data comes through the same Mongoose hook and we can update the bridged data as they change on the Gitter end.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, the Matrix side of gitter.im is hosted by <a href="https://element.io/matrix-services">Element Matrix Services</a> and is a plain old Synapse, talking through to Gitter via the Application Service API. An alternative architecture would be to have got Gitter directly federating with Matrix by embedding a ‚Äúhomeserver library‚Äù into it (e.g. embedding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>). However, given Dendrite is still beta and assumes it is storing its data itself (rather than persisting in an existing backend such as Gitter‚Äôs mongodb), we went for the simpler option to start with.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs been really interesting to see how this has played out week by week in the Gitter updates in This Week in Matrix: you can literally track the progress and see how the integration came to life between <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/09/this-week-in-matrix-2020-10-09#gitter">Oct 9</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/23/this-week-in-matrix-2020-10-23#gitter">Oct 23</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/06/this-week-in-matrix-2020-11-06#gitter">Nov 6</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/27/this-week-in-matrix-2020-11-27#gitter">Nov 27</a> and finally <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/04/this-week-in-matrix-2020-12-04#gitter">Dec 4</a>.</p>
<p>Huge thanks go to Eric Eastwood, the lead dev of Gitter and mastermind behind the project - and also to Half-Shot and Christian who‚Äôve been providing all the support and review from the Matrix bridging team.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What‚Äôs next?</h2>
<p>First and foremost we‚Äôre going to be working through the ‚ÄúWhat remains‚Äù section of the list above: killing off the old bridge, sorting out plumbed rooms, hooking up DMs, importing old Gitter history into Matrix, etc. This should then give us an exceptionally low impedance link between Gitter &amp; Matrix.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/30/welcoming-gitter-to-matrix">as per our original announcement</a>, the plan is:</p>
<p><em>In the medium/long term, it‚Äôs simply not going to be efficient for the combined Element/Gitter team to split our efforts maintaining two high-profile Matrix clients. Our plan is instead to merge Gitter‚Äôs features into Element (or next generations of Element) itself and then - if and only if Element has achieved parity with Gitter - we expect to upgrade the deployment on gitter.im to a Gitter-customised version of Element. The inevitable side-effect is that we‚Äôll be adding new features to Element rather than Gitter going forwards.</em></p>
<p>Now, that means implementing some features in Matrix/Element to match...</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant live room peeking (less than a second to load the webapp into a live-view of a massive room with 20K users!!)</li>
<li>Seamless onboarding thanks to using GitLab &amp; GitHub for accounts</li>
<li>Curated hierarchical room directory</li>
<li>Magical creation of rooms on demand for every GitLab and GitHub project ever</li>
<li>GitLab/GitHub activity as a first-class citizen in a room‚Äôs side-panel</li>
<li>Excellent search-engine-friendly static content and archives</li>
<li>KaTeX support for Maths communities</li>
<li>Threads!</li>
</ul>
<p>...and this work is in full swing:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a proposal for fast peeking (via lazy-loading state over federation) at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2775/proposals/2775-lazy-loading-over-federation.md">MSC2775</a> and the new peek APIs at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2753/proposals/2753-peeking-via-sync-v2.md">MSC2753</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2444/proposals/2444-peeking-over-federation-peek-api.md">MSC2444</a> (and even implemented by Dendrite)</li>
<li>Social Login for seamless onboarding via GitLab, GitHub &amp; friends is almost landed in Element: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/5426">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/5426</a></li>
<li>Spaces gives a curated hierarchical room directory: <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/2">https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/2</a></li>
<li>KaTeX support landed in Element Web a few weeks ago thanks to <a href="https://github.com/akissinger">akissinger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thosgood">thosgood</a></li>
<li>Threads are on the horizon, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2836">MSC2836</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only bits which aren‚Äôt already progressing yet are tighter GL/GH integration, and better search engine optimised static archives.</p>
<p>So, the plan is to get cracking on the rest of the feature parity, then merge Gitter &amp; Element together - and meanwhile continue getting the rest of the world into Matrix :)</p>
<p>We live in exciting times: open standards-based interoperable communication is on the rise again, and we hope Gitter‚Äôs new life in Matrix is the beginning of a new age of cross-project developer collaboration, at last escaping the fragmentation we‚Äôve suffered over the last few years.</p>
<p>Finally, please do give feedback via <a href="https://gitter.im/matrix-org/gitter">Gitter</a> or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-org_gitter:gitter.im">Matrix</a> (or <a href="mailto:matrix@matrix.org">mail</a>!) on the integration and where you‚Äôd like to see it go next!</p>
<p>Thanks for flying Matrix and Gitter,</p>

<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.2">version 0.3.2</a>, which contains some bug fixes. Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Checking if a server is allowed to see an event has been optimised somewhat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to disable federation has been added</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application services are now sent correctly formatted client events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>create-account</code> has been simplified so that you can just point it to your Dendrite config</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/unpeek</code> support has been added (for MSC2753)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event IDs are now calculated far less often in the roomserver, since this is an expensive operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federation sender now caches events in memory to reduce load on the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;since&quot; parameter is now checked more thoroughly in the sync API, which led to a bug that could cause forgotten rooms to reappear (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kaniini">kaniini</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The polylith now proxies signing key requests through the federation sender correctly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>

<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>This was actually just the beginning, the ground work needed to lay the foundations for A Better Future. We already have <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;state=opened">a bunch of other merge requests</a> to continue down that path. Hopefully there shouldn‚Äôt be such large ones in the (near) future. So what‚Äôs next? The work that landed this week was a switch to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/">the SDK</a> for almost all endpoint queries. Now need to handle the syncs with it. Later on, we will use it to handle storage, and then enable E2EE as well, but that will take quite some time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Big progress from Fractal here! Will be good to hear more from the Fractal club to see what the ETA is for storage and E2EE.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I've actually not had much time to work on Nheko, I did at least fix most of the UTD (Unable to decrypt) issues, when sending encrypted messages. This has been a long standing annoyance, but it should now finally not be an issue anymore (well... at least it should not be caused by Nheko as often anymore)! With this there are only a few tickets left to finally bring E2EE out of beta in Nheko (SSSS and bootstrapping cross-signing, as well as a general review for potential issues).</p>
<p>And while I have actually not been doing much work, we actually had more Pull Requests (and merged them too) this week than I have ever seen before in Nheko! Thank you very much to everyone who contributed. A short summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now uses the Nheko icon from your system theme, if available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can finally look at avatars in their full resolution!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Megolm sessions are now lazily loaded from disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The registration page now also has nice inline error messages, hinting at why a specific input is unacceptable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updates to the russian translation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The README now lists all required GStreamer plugins for voice and video calls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It feels super great, when you have so many people contributing, I love it! &lt;3</p>

<p>On behalf of the Americans on the Synapse team: Happy Thanksgiving! This past week saw us land some improvements to the OpenID Connect SSO provider, bringing it closer to parity with the SAML provider. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8801">#8801</a> made it possible to gracefully handle username collisions when creating a new account over SSO.</p>
<p>We've also merged a pull request (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8785/">#8785</a>) from @dklimpel which removes deprecated paths for the Synapse Admin APIs. As of the next Synapse release, all Admin APIs will be accessibly only under the <code>/_synapse/admin/v1</code> path prefix.</p>
<p>Otherwise, much of our time has been spent on getting pull requests like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6739">#6739</a>, implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</a>, ready to merge.

<p>There were also quite a few cleanups, most of them done by Kirillpt! Some spacing here and there, saturation changes, the login page should now be less confusing, when you don't enter a valid mxid and toggles should now not get stuck in confusing intermediate states.

<p>In addition to boring stuff like being able to persist events (hopefully) right, so we don't have to initial-sync every launch, I've been making a start towards multi-account support!</p>
<p>You can sign in as multiple users and switch between the &quot;active&quot; user you want to send messages as - iit's a bit flaky for now, esp. when scrolling up to read past messages, but hey it's a start I guess</p>

<li>
<p>We're discussing a policy for ending support for old versions of Python and PostgreSQL. If you have opinions, please <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8782">let us know on GitHub</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>We've been looking at ways to improve the efficiency of state resolution, and Erik has managed to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622#issuecomment-729620021">devise some algorithmic improvements</a> that yield an order of magnitude speedup for a handful of pathologic cases. We hope to have a better idea of how this might work for real world workloads soon.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, we'd like to take this opportunity to remind you to <strong>please regularly upgrade your Synapse.</strong> Especially if you're not yet on 1.20.0, as we'll be disclosing a denial of service issue which affects older versions on Monday.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Profiles should now open again on older versions of Qt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've been slowly rewriting the message are to be qml, to make it easier to do fancy styling. As a result emojis in the emoji-completer are now colorful and the avatars in the username completer now match the avatars used in the timeline. It also open up a few other improvements, like finally sending mentions as links instead of plain text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have now CI running on our <a href="https://nheko.im">self hosted gitlab instance</a>. We will probably switch of the travis CI, once this is more battle tested. Repositories are now also automatically mirrored between gitlab and github.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug, where we tried to read the internal world group on your server instead of keeping that to ourself.</p>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è  Possible breaking change: <a href="https://gitlab.com/olegfiksel/home-assistant-bot/-/issues/4">change behavior how messages are matched</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before: messages were matched only if a message starts with <code>!</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this version: the whole message is matched. This means in v2.0.0 this will work <code>Hey, please !turnon light1</code></p>
<ul>
<li>You can override this by using <code>^</code> in the config for. For example: <code>regex: &quot;^!turnon&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This allows one bot trigger another. See this TWIM video for details. üòâ</p>
