            <p>Synapse 1.41.0 is out now!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We anticipate publishing a <strong>security release</strong> next Tuesday, the 31st of August.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.41.1 will contain fixes for two moderate severity issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Synapse 1.41 includes changes to forward proxies, template settings, and media workers which may require your attention. Please see the  <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.41/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1410">Upgrade Notes</a> for details.</p>
<p>Also, this release <strong>removes support for Ubuntu 20.10</strong> (Groovy Gorilla), which reached End of Life last month. Support for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) and Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo) will be withdrawn near the end of this year under our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.41/deprecation_policy.html">platform deprecation policy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="promoting-restricted-rooms">Promoting Restricted Rooms</h2>
<p>Synapse 1.41 includes experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: Room version capabilities</a>, which indicates to clients that they should use Room Version 8 when creating <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>. For example, Element's clients will use the MSC3244 metadata, which is on by default in Synapse 1.41, to determine whether to show end users the UI for creating restricted rooms.</p>
<p>Room Version 6 will remain the default for newly created rooms which do not explicitly request the restricted room capabilities at creation time. This strikes a balance between the broad compatibility of an older default room version, while still making newer features available upon request.</p>
<h2 id="new-mscs">New MSCs</h2>
<p>This version of Synapse implements experimental support for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3266">MSC3266: Room summary API</a> which provides a simple way to obtain information about a specific room, such as its join rules, room type, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3288">MSC3288: Add room type in store invite</a> which lets identity servers differentiate between invitations to rooms and invitations to Spaces.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: Room version capabilities</a> as described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also added pagination to the Spaces Summary API based on updates to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946</a>.</p>
<p>Work towards implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms</a> continues, with several related pull requests landing in this release.</p>
<h2 id="more-admin-apis">More Admin APIs</h2>
<p>Synapse now has an Admin APIs to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.41/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#delete-media-uploaded-by-a-user">Delete media uploaded by a user</a> from your homeserver's local media storage.</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.41/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#create-or-modify-account">Edit the external ids</a> associated with a user by Single Sign-On / OpenID Connect providers.</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.41/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#check-username-availability">Check if a username is available</a>, which behaves similarly to the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.0#get-matrix-client-r0-register-available">related client-server API</a> in the Matrix Spec, but the Admin API version works even when registration is disabled on a homeserver.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>In addition to the usual boosts to performance and reliability like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10119">#10119</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10513">#10513</a>, this release includes several notable improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>/createRoom</code> endpoint can now be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10564">handled by workers</a>.</li>
<li>Synapse can now route outbound federation requests, remote media downloads, and public key fetches through a <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.41/setup/forward_proxy.html">forward proxy</a>.</li>
<li>Custom template configuration has now been centralized into a single <code>custom_templates_directory</code> <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.41/templates.html">configuration setting</a>.</li>
<li>Matrix clients which allow users to <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#id64">set a <code>status_msg</code> with their presence</a> will find that Synapse no longer arbitrarily unsets the message when a user goes offline. Instead, each user's <code>status_msg</code> will persist until it is deliberately cleared by their client.</li>
<li>The extension module API now exposes a function, <code>get_userinfo_by_id</code>, which accepts an MXID and returns a <code>UserInfo</code> object. This should simplify writing extension modules like spam checkers.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just the highlights; please see the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.41/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1410">Upgrade Notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.41.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>

<p>Half-Shot's bridge notes this week</p>
<ul>
<li>GSOC! abbyck/Abhinav's email bridge</li>
<li>Bridge team has been busy, on the EMS side we've released Signal/WA for early bird testing.</li>
<li>Landmark changes in bridge libraries: we've released 3.0.0-rc1 of matrix-appservice-bridge. Both the IRC bridge and the Gitter bridge have tested it with great results.</li>
<li>Tadzik has been making massive gains on the IRC bridge, formatting tweaks and bugs being nailed.</li>
<li>Finally, I have a car!</li>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>

<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>

</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>Don't be mistaken by the rather empty list above, there were many PRs to the contents of the spec flying around this week! These include some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3336">further</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3343">contributions</a> from lukaslihotzki, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3339">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3340">clarifications</a> from dkasak and some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3350">spec</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3353">contributions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3349">tooling</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3351">documentation</a> additions from richvdh. Also a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3337">clarification</a> from uhoreg.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone for your PRs!</p>
<p>Otherwise, there has been a small amount of activity across the spectrum of MSCs this week. One MSC to call out is https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3283, which could do with some more input from the wider community.</p>
<h4 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h4>
<p>And finally, something fun. I've written <a href="https://github.com/anoadragon453/pick-a-spec">a small script</a> to pick a random MSC that people may or may not want to have a look at.</p>
<p>And this week we've got 🥁...</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2437">MSC2437: Store tagged events in Room Account Data</a>!</p>
<p>Have a look if you haven't already, or take another look again if you have 😀</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week, we tagged the v0.5.0 release candidate, which contains two major advancements on the encryption front: support for server-side key backups and support for cross-signing. The addition of these features makes Dendrite significantly more user-friendly, as it is now possible to log out or share keys across devices without losing your conversations.</p>
<p>We'll be aiming to finalise this release next week. Stay tuned in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Sytest compliance currently sits at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 65%, up from 61% last time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 92%, same as last time</p>

<p>We are on track to release Synapse 1.41 next week. This version will use an unstable property proposed by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: Room version capabilities</a> to advertise to clients that they may create restricted rooms using Room Version 8, despite the default room version remaining at 6 for the time being.</p>
<p>This strikes a balance between the broad compatibility of an older default room version, while still making newer features available <em>when requested</em> at room creation time. However, from next week you are more likely to encounter v8 rooms, so please do ensure your homeserver is running at least 1.40.</p>
<p>I'd also like to tip my hat to Element employee Olivier, who has put in the work to ensure that tagged Sygnal releases are automatically built and uploaded to Docker Hub via GitHub Actions. Thanks, Olivier!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/">Heisenbridge</a> is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Automatic queries (DM rooms) from IRC users can now be disabled and a query opened manually if needed (messages appear in network rooms)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plumbs can now be set to not do disambiguation or ZWSP injection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small cleanups and fixes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Heisenbridge is now considered stable and v1.0.0 has been released! 🍻 🥳</p>
<p>Focus is shifting to v2.0.0 which will be a major refactor. The 1.x series will at least receive bug fixes if not features. Do note that if you are using the master branch or latest tag for Docker it may cause a breaking change in the future when the work starts being merged. Highly suggest moving to version tags regardless of the deployment method. If you are using <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> it has been updated to v1.0.0 as of writing so pulling the latest master there is advised.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the car wasn't enough, I bring more news! Our matrix.org bridge library, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> has had a total shakeup. Version <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/3.0.0-rc1">3.0.0-rc1</a> is out and with it comes the migration from the matrix-js-sdk to the matrix-bot-sdk. This is a massive change underneath that should result in faster performance, better typings and hopefully lower memory footprints too.</p>
<p>I'd encourage everyone using this library to update and see how well it works for you! The IRC and Gitter bridges have already experimented with this change and have seen good results, so I look forward to hearing feedback :)</p>

The highlights are that <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/810">rooms are now sorted by activity</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/811">room members now have a <code>power-level</code> property</a>. The other ones (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/815">!815</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/816">!816</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/817">!817</a>) are maintenance and code quality related.</p>
<p>Julian Hofer also contributed a code quality change by <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/818">making every subclass use <code>Default</code></a>.</p>
<p>Shout out to Julian Sparber, who’s still busy with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/288">his upstream work in the Rust SDK</a>, and managed to review and merge all the above contributions.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@carl:kde.org">Carl Schwan</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week Janet improved receiving files in NeoChat. Now downloading a file can be stopped, a file type icon is displayed and it looks better! Other than that Felipe Kinoshita made some small visual improvements to the day separator in the timeline and Tobias continued working on E2EE inside Quotient.</p>
<p>Tomorrow Tobias and I will be doing a small presentation/demo of NeoChat at frOSCon in German. It's online so you don't have any excuse to not watch it: https://programm.froscon.de/2021/events/2711.html</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now shows you the verification status of all devices in a room as well as in the memberlist. This is important so you can tell, if an unverified device may get access to a message, if you send it. You can always disable sending messages to unverified devices for extra peace of mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>callum's work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">Token Authenticated Registration</a> got merged! 🎉</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manu's room directory (finally) got merged. This means you can now discover public rooms on your server and join them by clicking the room directory button, that Nheko had for 3 years but was disabled until now! Support for the room directories of other servers as well as filtering by network should come in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is now an &quot;Allow them in&quot; button on pending knocks in the timeline, joins via room membership in a different room now tell you, what user's server was used to sign off on the join and you can set a room to restricted or knock only. (You currently can't change the list of allowed servers though).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dialogs should now have a close button again on Windows, the emoji search field now clears on closing the emoji picker and we added a workaround for stickers not showing on Element iOS, because iOS can't display stickers without a thumbnail, even if a thumnail makes no sense for stickers. (We just copy the sticker url into the thumbnail url.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko can now download encryption keys from online key backup. Uploading to online key backup will come soon(tm).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are interested, I will talk about Nheko tomorrow (21.08. starting 16:10) at FrOSCon in the Matrix dev room. Make sure you check out the other talks too, if you speak German! https://programm.froscon.de/2021/events/2706.html</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Phew, that was a mouthful.</p>

<h3 id="element-clients">Element Clients</h3>
<p>Updates from the teams</p>
<p><strong>Delight team</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This week, our web, iOS and Android engineers are all enjoying some time off. </li>
<li>On backend, we’ve completed pagination of the Spaces Summary. This week, we’ve been looking at performance improvements to the Summary API.</li>
<li>We intend to mark room Version 8 as the preferred version for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083 restricted rooms</a> on matrix.org and in Synapse 1.41 (due for release next week) via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244</a>. Once this change is made, Element clients will show UI to create restricted rooms within a Space, and prompt users to upgrade rooms if necessary when making them restricted.</li>
<li>Our design team is exploring some tweaks on how to make Spaces a little bit clearer and easier to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Web</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We released 1.8.1 which fixed some regressions with calls - sorry for any failed calls!</li>
<li>Work on our threads prototype continues. We’re hoping to have something to look at internally next week.</li>
<li><a href="https://sentry.matrix.org/sentry/riot-web/">Sentry</a> submission support has been added to Rageshakes. We expect to enable this on https://app.element.io next week.</li>
<li>We’ve been fixing some bugs around cross-signing, Windows font rendering, and image blur hashing.</li>
<li>Our new triage process has been published <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/wiki#issue-triage">on the wiki</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Element Alpha work is complete. This is a new app for internal testing. A QR code is available on every PR like this <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/pull/4635">one</a> to install the build on a device. Only devices registered in the Element Apple Developer account can install this app. </li>
<li>Improved notification content: No more “Message” notification.</li>
<li>Fixed some timeline layout issues.</li>
<li>Media upload sizing: We added a prompt when sending video to select the resolution of the sent video. Media size prompt can be disabled in settings.</li>
<li>URL preview work has started.</li>
<li>App Navigation improvement: Working on room navigation to prepare the ground for threading.</li>
<li>On the performance side, we are working on room messages lazy loading to improve application speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix authenticated jitsi not working in release (proguard issue)</li>
<li>Handle call ended reasons (busy, invite timeout).</li>
<li>Working on Olm fallback key support</li>
<li>Work on call ui and call tiles is finished, waiting to be reviewed</li>
<li>Start working on extracting API client from the SDK</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca">uhoreg</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Polyjuice Client v0.4.2 has been released.  This release features more functions for creating messages, including file and media messages (thanks to multi prise), replies, reactions, and edits.  Polyjuice Client can also now be considered a serious Matrix library as it has a new function to generate rainbow-coloured messages! 🌈  Multi prise has also added support for registering a new user, redacting messages, and searching the user directory.</p>
<p>Polyjuice Util v0.2.1 (an Elixir library for Matrix features that can be used on both the client-side and server-side) was also recently released.  The main feature for this release is support for handling Matrix URIs, and supports <code>mxc:</code>, <code>matrix.to</code>, and <code>matrix:</code>-style URIs.</p>

<p>Some of the changes are shown below:</p>
</blockquote>
<table><thead><tr><th>Version 1</th><th>Version 2</th><th>Summary</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>bot.add_message_listener(example_handler)</code></td><td><code>@bot.listener.on_message_event</code><br />or<br /><code>@bot.listener.on_custom_event</code></td><td>In version 1, each the <code>bot.add_message_listener</code> method was used on message handler functions for them to react to messages. In version 2, this has been replaced by a decorator, <code>@bot.listener.on_message_event</code>. A similar decorator, <code>@bot.listener.on_custom_event(event)</code> can be used to react to other events. For information on supported events, refer to the <a href="https://matrix-nio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nio.html#module-nio.events.room_events">matrix-nio docs</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>creds = botlib.Creds()</code></td><td><code>creds = botlib.Creds(&lt;br /&gt;    homeserver=&quot;https://example.org&quot;, &lt;br /&gt;    username=&quot;username&quot;, &lt;br /&gt;    password=&quot;password&quot;, &lt;br /&gt;    session_stored_file=&quot;session.txt&quot;&lt;br /&gt;    )&lt;br /&gt;</code><br />or<br /><code>creds = botlib.Creds(&lt;br /&gt;    homeserver=&quot;https://example.org&quot;, &lt;br /&gt;    login_token=&quot;MDA..gZ2&quot;&lt;br /&gt;    session_stored_file=&quot;session.txt&quot;&lt;br /&gt;    )&lt;br /&gt;</code></td><td>In version 1, the only way to login to a homeserver was to use a combination of a username and password. In version 2 it is also possible to login using a SSO login token as well. As before, the homeserver argument is required, and the session_stored_file argument is optional.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>match.args #For message &quot;one two three&quot;, returns &quot;two three&quot;</code></td><td><code>match.args #For message &quot;one two three&quot;, returns [&quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;]</code></td><td>In version 1, <code>match.args</code> returned a string. In version 2, <code>match.args</code> returns a list of strings.</td></tr>

<p>These changes are only some of the most important changes between versions 1 and 2, and there are more changes in addition to these. I apologize for the delays in releasing version 2.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev">MTRNord</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since element now landed voice message support I build a small maubot plugin which prevents audio and voice messages as those cannot yet get restricted by power level.</p>
<p>It starts by warning you via replies, after a configured amount of warnings goes over to kicking and after a certain amount of kicks it will ban you in the room the event was sent in.</p>
<p>The counter is global so if a user in room A runs out of warnings and the same user sents a voice message in room B where the bot is present the bot will ban the user also in room B without further warnings.</p>

<p>Howdy folks, it's been aaaaages since I've done mad little project but I had some LEGO and was bored on a Sunday. I present to you <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-poweredup">matrix-poweredup</a>! This is a little bot that connects to any LEGO PoweredUp devices (using the node-poweredup library). You can then start controlling the motors via Matrix, and have the sensors report back into the Matrix room. It's currently limited to a RC buggy I picked up over the weekend but it's very extendible. It also includes a web application to control things via a gamepad, if that's your bag.</p>
<p>There will be a little demo at the end of Matrix Live, so watch this space</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/circles-ios">Circles</a> is an iOS app for end-to-end encrypted secure social networking and sharing, built on top of Matrix.  Its goal is to provide a safe and convenient way for close friends and families to share things that they wouldn't post publicly -- e.g. for parents to safely share pictures of their kids.  You can also use it to share updates with your friends, without a creepy advertising company data mining every word.</p>
<p>Circles features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social &quot;wall&quot;-like functionality and timeline of friends' posts for each of your social circles, e.g. Friends, Family, Neighbors, Coworkers, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypted photo galleries</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recent updates to the Circles beta include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for use with any Matrix homeserver, including a new encrypted recovery and key backup mechanism that should be compatible with other Matrix clients like Element.  (<strong>Please note</strong>: For use with standard Matrix accounts, be sure to select &quot;Advanced options&quot; at login and enter your passphrase for key backup / recovery.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emoji reactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown formatting for text posts and image captions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better support for larger screens (iPad)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The latest beta build of Circles (v0.91) is available from Apple on <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/cWuDwqpG">TestFlight</a></p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>Work on Spaces continues with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946</a> (Space Summary API), specifically revolving around how to paginate the summary. This has called into question how <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1898#issuecomment-896717689">pagination across Matrix works in general</a>, which is a prime target for refactoring - perhaps an upcoming consistent pagination MSC? :)</p>
<p>Otherwise, as listed above, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289</a> (room v8) has merged! It brings with it the ability to grant the ability to join a room based on one's membership in another room. While the was originally conceived for allowing users that are part of one Space to be allowed to join rooms, it has been built upon in other creative ways. Such as in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3325">MSC3325</a>, where it could be used to make room upgrades more seamless!</p>
<p>And finally, a special thanks to Lukas Lihotzki for all of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Alukaslihotzki+sort%3Aupdated-desc+">their spec PRs</a> this week. They're been stellar!</p>

<p>Big news! <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/08/10/synapse-1-40-0-released">Synapse 1.40 is out</a> and it comes with support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">Room Version 8</a>! Version 8 includes &quot;<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>&quot; which are only visible and joinable by members of a specific Space (or via direct invitation). This finally makes it <em>useful</em> to use Spaces as containers for private rooms, like you might with a company, guild, or open source community. Once invited to the parent Space, members can join and discover the otherwise private rooms within. No more <code>/invite</code> spam every time you bring someone on board!</p>
<p>Also: If you've received any push notifications in Element Android or Element iOS this week, they've come via our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/releases/tag/v0.10.0">shiny new stateless release of Sygnal</a>!

<p>Exciting update this week on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> front for backfilling historical messages into existing rooms! All of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10245">big</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10498">pieces</a> are now merged for full-fat federated historical messages in Synapse 💪</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> was also consolidated and updated to propose the <code>/batch_send</code> implementation we're using in Synapse. There is also a plan for how this can be backwards compatible with existing room versions so no need for those pesky room upgrades. This will help us be able to jump in early and use this for Gitter as soon as the new event types become stable. Go jump in on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> to give feedback and read up on the details 😀</p>

<h3 id="ement-el">Ement.el</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alphapapa:matrix.org">alphapapa</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el">Ement.el</a>, a Matrix client for Emacs, continues to improve.  Some of the changes in the past week:</p>
<p><em>Additions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Messages may now be written in Org-mode syntax (a format similar to but more powerful than Markdown).  Internally, it's automatically converted to HTML and sent as the message's formatted body.  This supports nearly any HTML feature that Org-mode can export to, including rich text, bulleted and numbered lists, and even tables (this message is being written directly in Org syntax; see a table of new bindings at the end of this list).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An optional pop-out compose buffer makes writing and editing long messages easier (also being used for this message).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read/fully-read marker lines are now displayed after the last read message, and these are synced with the server and other clients.  These lines can also be placed with a command, making it easy to return to a certain event later, even on other clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usernames at the beginning of messages may optionally be colored to match the addressee's username.  This especially helps following conversations in busy rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ement.el is confirmed to work with Pantalaimon, the E2EE-aware reverse proxy, making encrypted rooms work transparently.  Once Pantalaimon is installed and configured, connecting through it with Ement.el is trivial, and this step is documented in the readme.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Improvements</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Per-user displayname and message colors have improved (and configurable) contrast ratio with the background color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reactions are sorted by the number of users who have sent each one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unread rooms are displayed more prominently in the room list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New default bindings make it quick to jump to the mentions and notifications buffers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync timeouts are handled more gracefully and Ement.el re-syncs automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various minor fixes and enhancements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And here's the new-bindings table, written directly in Org syntax and sent automatically as HTML:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Binding</th><th>Command</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>S-SPC</td><td>Scroll up</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-SPC</td><td>Move to last-read marker</td></tr>
<tr><td>C-k</td><td>Delete message</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-g M-l</td><td>Switch to room list buffer</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-g M-m</td><td>Switch to mentions buffer</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-g M-n</td><td>Switch to notifications buffer</td></tr>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You now get notified, if someone reuses a megolm session index, because that in theory could be used by an attacker to send seemingly verified messages. We also now render decryption errors more nicely and users can now explicitly request decryption keys (in addition to the automatic key requests in the background that already existed). We also fixed an issue, that could corrupt the database when using the flatpak and if you lost your network connection, Nheko should now reconnect faster instead of potentially waiting 17 minutes for a TCP timeout. The storage for cross-signing secrets should now be more reliable, you can close image popups with the &quot;Escape&quot; key, close the current room by double clicking it and a few more miscellaneous bugfixes.</p>
<p>You can track the remaining E2EE bits, before we declare our E2EE support as stable, in this comment now: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/23#issuecomment-894689158</p>

<p>I find &quot;read it later&quot; services like Pocket extremely useful, but fail hard at actually keeping my read it later list at a sane level. For me it's hard to maintain the list and actually read through things as choosing which one to process feels overwhelming due to the amount of items.</p>
<p>Randomization to the rescue! I made a Pocket plugin for Maubot which gives me a random article from my list and allows me to easily archive it. Now I don't need to decide which article to pick, the computer does that for me!</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.40.0 is out now!</p>
<h2 id="support-for-room-version-8">Support for Room Version 8</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse includes stable support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">Room Version 8</a>! Version 8 codifies a concept of &quot;<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>&quot; which are private rooms joinable only by direct invitation or by being a member of other, designated Spaces / rooms.</p>
<p>This means you can create a Matrix Space for your company, team, or guild, and instead of inviting people to the Space <em>and</em> directly to a bunch of private rooms, you can simply configure your private rooms such that membership in the Space <em>automatically</em> confers access to the private rooms.</p>
<p>This is a major improvement to access control in Matrix, and we can't wait to use it ourselves.</p>
<p>Note that client support for managing restricted rooms is still forthcoming, and you'll want to ensure that your users are on homeservers which support v8 before upgrading existing rooms. To ensure compatibility across federation, the default for newly created rooms remains at v6 for the time being.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>A few other items worth calling out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synapse can now optionally recycle PostgreSQL connections after a specified number of transactions (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10440">#10440</a>), which may mitigate slow memory leaks in the database. Thanks to GitHub user hifi.</li>
<li>We have a whole new documentation page explaining <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.40/development/room-dag-concepts.html">Room DAG Concepts</a> like depth, stream ordering, extremities, outliers, and state groups.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.40/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#list-accounts">Admin API for listing accounts</a> now returns a <code>creation_ts</code> property indicating when an account was created. Thanks to work by dklimpel.</li>
<li>Synapse should better detect character encodings in URL previews thanks to a contribution by srividyut.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to further work towards implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716: Incrementally Importing History into Existing Rooms</a>, we've landed support for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2033">MSC2033</a>: The <code>/account/whoami</code> endpoint now includes the <code>device_id</code> associated with the access token used to make the request.</li>
<li>(Experimental) <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244</a>: The <code>/_matrix/client/r0/capabilities</code> endpoint may include metadata about which room versions support which capabilities (like knocking on restricted joins).</li>
<li>(Experimental) <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2285">MSC2285</a>: Clients may mark messages as read on the server without updating their externally visible read receipts, implemented by SimonBrandner.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just the highlights; please see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.40.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hifi">hifi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SimonBrandner">SimonBrandner</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/srividyut">srividyut</a>.</p>

            <p>Hello TWIM!</p>
<p>I'm taking over hosting This Week In Matrix again to give Ben a well-deserved break. Your favourite TWIM host will of course be back next week, but in the mean time, let's see what Matrix goodness has happened this week!</p>

<p>It's demo week again this week! We've got three great demos to share with you this month:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robert, the latest addition to the Matrix VoIP team, gives us a sneak peek at his experiments with implementing native full mesh video calls in Matrix</li>
<li>Gil, from the Element iOS team, gives us an update on the implementation of Spaces in the app</li>
<li>and finally Ryan, who's been exploring ways to use Matrix beyond chat, shows us his shiny new full stack integration test solution for Matrix client and servers</li>
</ul>
<p>And I hear there might also have been a bonus demo that managed to sneak its way lower down this post 😉</p>

<p>Room version 8 is due to land soon - which will bring restricted rooms to the masses. This is most useful in the context of Spaces, which allows granting access to rooms in a space based on a user's membership of that space (or another space!).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today in not-Synapse news, we're getting ready for a new release of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a>, our reference implementation of a Matrix push notification gateway, early next week. The most significant change is that Shay, one of our Outreachy interns, has determined that Sygnal can function completely statelessly, removing the need for a SQLite or PostgreSQL database. This clears the path for proper horizontal scaling and high availability deployments of Sygnal.</p>
<p>On the Synapse side of the world, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289: Room version 8</a> entered Final Comment Period (FCP) and we expect it to be merged into the Matrix spec over the weekend. If that occurs, we'll be on track to include support for this room version in Synapse 1.40 next week. Tune in next week to find out how that went!</p>

<p>Almost all features are on the master branch already, so please try to deploy your own Conduit now and try to find bugs. See https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit</p>
<p>State res has been tested a lot, so it's okay to join any public rooms (room version 6 preferred).</p>
<p>The barebones DEPLOY.md is the easiest and most tested way to install Conduit. We also have docker images, but I think the documentation still needs to be improved (please contribute if you can!)</p>
<p>Please open a gitlab issue for any problem you run into.</p>

It's currently using the public Microsoft Graph API, which comes with some limitations, but feature support is being improved.</p>
<p>Focus is currently on Chats (one to one, group chats, etc) rather than the main Teams rooms.</p>
<p>Still a fair amount of work to do, but it would be great to get feedback and comments from anyone who is interested.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heya, we are very grateful for all the awesome translators helping us translate FluffyChat! Unfortunately, we aren't the best at managing such a huge effort as translating such a large app into so many different languages. As a result, suggestions went un-reviewed on weblate for long, people weren't able to submit translations, etc. We are very sorry for that, but want to work on fixing that! As, well, we are only really programmers with little time, we thought of asking for help from the community (you all!)! That is why we are looking for a translation manager for FluffyChat. No programming experience at all is required, it'd mostly be about managing our weblate and answering translation-related questions. If you are interested, please plop into our room <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fluffychat:matrix.org">#fluffychat:matrix.org</a> and say so! (And ping <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a> if you don't get answers). Looking forward to a where translations are managed better, and thank you again for everyone who did bite through all this and contributed translations so far!</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I added a sticker/emoji pack editor to Nheko. This means you now don't need to create packs manually in /devtools anymore, but you can create and edit packs much more conveniently. There are still some rough edges, but we expect to sort those out in the near future. Make sure you check out the demo video I recorded!</p>
<p>Furthermore LorenDB has been busy porting more of the remaining dialogs to Qml, dialogs should now float properly on Wayland and have a proper close button on KDE. We also fixed a few more encryption bugs, which means we should be able to mark E2EE as stable in Nheko soon and we cleaned up old cruft in the codebase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if that's not enough for you, since it's demo week, Nico's also showing off Nheko's brand new sticker goodness!</p>

You can even reply to messages from any room in the Notifications buffer, which makes it easy to follow multiple rooms at once, rather than having to switch between rooms.

<h3 id="hydrogen">Hydrogen</h3>
<p>A minimal Matrix chat client, focused on performance, offline functionality, and broad browser support. https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my absence, the rest of team Hydrogen has been hard at work to bring you the ability to send replies, thanks to Daniel, and to open the member panel when clicking through from the member list, thanks to Midhun. If all goes well, this should get released tonight. Next up, Midhun will start working on SSO login support, a feature a few people have asked about in the past 🎉</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo K.</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A collaborative whiteboard based on the [matrix] protocol. <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard">github</a></p>
<p>A lot has happened this week. The biggest task was the switch to a proper build system (the project now is based on yarn and webpack). This gave the opportunity to do lots of refactoring and code cleanup. Additionally there is now a spec for the whiteboard events which got implemented this week. For the ones who are curious, here is the file: <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard/blob/main/spec.md">spec</a></p>
<p>There are also a couple of new features and fixes. Most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Text tool</strong> was added. Text in different colors and sizes can be added to the whiteboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Image tool</strong> was added. Images are uploaded and than rendered on the canvas (not yet published but will be available in a couple of days)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The styling was improved. There are less gray areas which I did not like and the corners are less round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the repository got a lot of love with more details in the <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard/blob/main/readme.md">readme</a> and better code/folder structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is now also a matrix room for feedback, issues and ideas: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TheBoard:matrix.org">#TheBoard:matrix.org</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to try it at: https://toger5.github.io/TheBoard/ (preferable not with your main matrix account)</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cvwright:matrix.org">cvwright</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/circles-ios">Circles</a> is an iOS app for end-to-end encrypted secure social networking and sharing, built on top of Matrix.  Its goal is to provide a safe and convenient way for close friends and families to share things that they wouldn't post publicly -- e.g. for parents to safely share pictures of their kids.</p>
<p>Recent updates to the Circles beta include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for use with any Matrix homeserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emoji reactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown formatting for posts and photo captions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better support for larger screens (iPad)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The latest beta build of Circles (v0.90) is available from Apple on <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/cWuDwqpG">TestFlight</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've also added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE 1</strong> - If you're using an existing account, you'll need to tap the &quot;Advanced Options&quot; on the login screen so you can give it your password for SSSS / encrypted key backup / recovery / etc.  Otherwise Circles will try to use a login password that it generates with <a href="https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/matrix-doc/blob/single-password-SSSS/proposals/3265-login-and-ssss-with-single-password.md">MSC 3265</a> so it can do everything safely using just a single password.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 2</strong> - Circles is NOT RECOMMENDED for use on an account that you're already using for Matrix chat, for the above reason and more.  If you do this, prepare to see lots of extra, weird rooms in Element / Fluffy / Nheko / whatever chat client you're using.  Also if you decide to try this anyway, please let me know how it goes.  :-)</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 3</strong> - Circles is not available yet in France.  Sorry.  I gotta update my encryption compliance documentation with Apple.</p>

<p>I've been working on a <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK/dendrite-helm">helm chart</a> for Dendrite (polylith/monolith (untested)), since i was sick of creating a single deployment for each component.
For now it's working as expected, but since I'm pretty new to creating helm charts, please let me know if there's something wrong/bad practice.</p>
<p>NOTE: Polylith is not yet supported by the developers!</p>

<p>While a quiet week for MSC state changes (shown above), there's still plenty of work and collaboration happening!</p>
<p>Spaces work marches forward as MSC3083 has been merged - allowing for users to join a room in a space based on their membership in a space. We think this will really help with the management of Spaces that contain lots of rooms that are otherwise invite-only.</p>
<p>Otherwise <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3291">MSC3291</a> (Muting in VoIP calls) has been receiving positive feedback this week!</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289</a> (room v8) is ticking along as the implementation is tested in Synapse and Complement tests.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/29/synapse-1-39-0-released">Synapse 1.39.0</a> is out! </p>
<p>Of all the pull requests we landed, my hat is off to MadLittleMods and his Graphviz prowess in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10250">#10250</a>, which moves us one step further down the path toward <em><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a>: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms.</em> Mmm. Graphs.</p>
<p>But back to Synapse! You should check out the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/29/synapse-1-39-0-released">release announcement</a>, but the bulk of the work this cycle went into internal cleanups. Synapse should also be slightly more performant, reliable, and should log fewer spurious errors. Of note, ShadowJonathan did a lot of work with <code>pyupgrade</code> and <code>com2ann</code> to move the entire codebase to more modern Py3.6+ conventions and inline type annotations; thanks, ShadowJonathan!</p>
<p>Synapse 1.39 also continues our march toward unifying Synapse's interface for extension modules, and we've now exposed plugin hooks for the <code>account_validity</code> option, and experimentally implemented hooks for third party event rules.</p>
<p>Lastly, special thanks to kroeckx who has submitted 17 pull requests against our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">SyTest test suite</a> in the past month, mainly arising from running SyTest against <a href="https://conduit.rs/">Conduit</a>. Thank you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello! This week, I created a <a href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/matrix-synapse-backend">matrix 1-click app</a> on the DigitalOcean marketplace. It's basically a pre-baked droplet image that is pre-configured with synapse, element-web, caddy, postgres, plus some setup and moderation tools. My intent was to make self-hosting a Matrix system as easy as pointing some DNS records and running a single script. It makes a lot of sense for smaller, more casual Matrix homeservers, and can serve as a good starting point! It also includes some small utility scripts - <code>./reset-password</code>, <code>./new-user</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Secrets like the postgres password and registration password are generated on first boot, there's no sensitive data baked into the image. Of course, it would be nice to be able to verify this - the source code used to build the image is being open sourced. I'm just waiting for some internal processes to finish. It will show up at https://github.com/digitalocean/marketplace-matrix somewhat soon!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lazy joining of IRC users (see below)</p>

</ul>
<p>The biggest impact feature this time around is configurable lazy joining IRC users which improves the experience of joining massive IRC channels by not flooding the homeserver with join events. This is now the default and can be changed globally by the bridge admin or overridden per room by users.</p>
<p>Many fixes here and there. Still a few issues left before 1.0 and a lot of testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ajbura:matrix.org">ajbura</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cinny is a web-based matrix client focusing primarily on simple, elegant and secure interface.</p>
<p>The story started when a friend of mine introduced me to matrix and even after his help it was too difficult for me to get around with Element. I guess it was because Element is too different from other popular chat apps. Then I tried to find a good alternative for web but no success.</p>
<p>That's when me and my friend thought about creating Cinny. For the few weeks we were doing it for fun but when we shared a screenshot of the prototype, the response from people was surprising and that's when things got interesting. We got to know that a lot of people out there are looking for a simple and modern client and so we started building it.</p>
<p>Screenshot on Chrome desktop (see below)</p>

<p>This summer's gone by so fast it feels like it's only been a week! Here's a summary of what's happened with Ruma the past few weeks:</p>
<p>We have had a productive summer with our two Google Summer of Code students, Adam Blanchet and Devin Ragotzy. Adam finished implementing the last of our Identity Service API endpoints, bringing us to 100% implementation of all the Matrix API endpoints! (And we promise there are no bugs because &quot;Rust,&quot; right?)</p>
<p>Besides improving the Matrix ecosystem, Devin has been helping the Rust ecosystem at large by writing some Clippy lints to improve our codebase and upstreaming his additions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I made <a href="https://github.com/davidmehren/maubot-ldap-inviter">maubot-ldap-inviter</a>, a maubot plugin that (surprisingly) invites users into Matrix rooms, according to their membership in LDAP groups.</p>
<p>We are switching from RocketChat to Matrix in the next round of a software engineering course where students work on software projects in small groups.</p>
<p>RocketChat has a LDAP sync, which we previously used to auto-add students and tutors to the chatrooms they need to be in (global announcement room, helpdesk, chat for their group etc.).
As there was no such feature for Matrix, I built the bot over the last few days.</p>
<p>It's still somewhat specific to our LDAP setup, but if anyone wants to use the bot and has questions, just open an issue in the repo!</p>

<p>No more suffering! Because now the <a href="https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/miounne">Mother Miounne</a> exists and it does 2 things (for now): handles of web/html forms (sends it to matrix room) and handles invite tokens (integrates with <a href="https://github.com/ZerataX/matrix-registration">matrix-registration</a>)</p>
<p>We use it as backend of etke.cc service for some time, but still consider it as unstable, so try it yourself, hope it can help you 😉</p>

<h3 id="theboard">TheBoard</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a personal project I started a couple of weeks ago. I was dreaming of a good open source solution for OneNote or GoodNotes far a long time. There are already great projects, like<a href="https://xournalpp.github.io/">Xournal++</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lovasoa/whitebophir">Whitebophir</a>. But, they do not include the extent of possibilities to flexible host, collaborate and structuring the notes I have wished for.</p>
<p>Recently, I was thinking about the exact requirements I wanted for such a whiteboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Real time synchronization (cloud storage)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authentication/account infrastructure (to invite and collaborate on one whiteboard)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding/Removing ppl to a whiteboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliable hosting (when having cloud storage, I don't want to trust a one-man project to continue hosting. And a lot of ppl won’t self-host.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structuring whiteboards in categories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Viewing history and display which part has been drawn by which person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annotating other whiteboards with new layers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hosting for media like PDF's and images</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at this list, Matrix was such an obvious choice. I could comment every point but basically with: &quot;A whiteboard should be a Matrix room&quot; everything is said.</p>
<p><strong>TheBoard (probably not the final name) is exactly that.</strong> The frontend is not done yet, but already in an okay looking and usable state.</p>
<p><strong>Before trying it out:</strong> It takes really long to log in with an account with lots of rooms. So, I highly recommend to NOT use your main Matrix account.
Additionally, it is necessary to tag rooms as whiteboards. (really un-intuitive UX that will be improved) But for now the + button needs to be pressed and a (empty (not necessary but recommended) AND UNENCRYPTED) room needs to be selected.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I just (on Friday) finished initial spaces support to categorize the whiteboard in notebooks (aka spaces). They can only be create within a matrix client that supports spaces. But they will be displayed properly in TheBoard. (see screenshot)</p>
<p>Any problems, ideas and feedback is highly welcome as a github issue or in the matrix channel #TheBoard:matrix.org.</p>
<h4 id="tldr">TLDR:</h4>
<p>This project is whiteboard (similar to OneNote) which is</p>
<p>using Matrix as its backend. All your drawings are stored in matrix rooms
on your matrix server and are accessible to anyone who is invited.</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.39.0 is now available!</p>
<p>We've done quite a bit of work this release on Synapse's new interface for extension modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synapse's <code>account_validity</code> option has been extracted into a built-in <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.39/modules.html#account-validity-callbacks">extension module</a>. If your configuration previously enabled <code>account_validity</code>, it will continue working as before, but it is now easier to override and customize.</li>
<li>The third party event rules callbacks have also been <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.39/modules.html#third-party-rules-callbacks">experimentally ported</a> to the new module interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also improved the Space Summary API to list all rooms which a user could join (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10298">#10298</a>). This is especially important with the pending standardization of Room Version 8, which includes <em><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083</a>: Restricting room membership based on membership in other rooms.</em></p>
<p>MadLittleMods landed several pull requests on the path to implementing <em><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a>: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms</em> (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10250">#10250</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10276">#10276</a>).</p>
<p>More than anything else, this release contains an absolutely enormous load of internal cleanup. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>ShadowJonathan ran <code>pyupgrade</code> on the entire codebase, bringing it up to modern Py3.6+ conventions, then separately used <code>com2ann</code> to move us from legacy <code># type: foo</code> type hints to more modern inline annotations.</li>
<li>We finished converting several integer columns in our database to bigint as a precautionary measure.</li>
<li>We've made innumerable improvements to our CI configuration; including moving completely to GitHub Actions.</li>
<li>Countless small improvements to performance, reliability, and error logging.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that's not all! Synapse 1.39 also allows for setting credentials for HTTP proxy connections thanks to work by dklimpel; previously, Synapse was only able to provide authentication for HTTPS proxies.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.39/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1390">Upgrade Notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.39.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this rele ase.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/andir">andir</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ilmari">ilmari</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LukeWalsh">LukeWalsh</a>, <a href="https://github.com/moritzdietz">moritzdietz</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ShadowJonathan">ShadowJonathan</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/xmunoz">xmunoz</a>.</p>

            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Big news today: Element, the startup founded by the team who created Matrix,
just raised $30M of Series B funding in order to further accelerate Matrix
development and improve Element, the flagship Matrix app. The round is led by
our friends at <a href="https://protocol.ai">Protocol Labs</a> and <a href="https://metaplanet.com">Metaplanet</a>,
the fund established by Jaan Tallinn (co-founder of
Skype and Kazaa).  Both Protocol Labs and Metaplanet are spectacularly on
board our decentralised communication quest, and you couldn't really ask for
a better source of funding to help take Matrix to the next level.  Thank you
for believing in Matrix and leading Element's latest funding!</p>
<p>You can read all about it from the Element perspective over at the
<a href="https://element.io/blog/element-raises-30m-as-matrix-explodes">Element Blog</a>,
but suffice it to say that this is enormous news for the Matrix ecosystem as a
whole.  In addition to transforming the Element app, on the Matrix side this
means that there is now concrete funding secured to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>finish building out <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/06/introducing-the-pinecone-overlay-network">P2P Matrix</a>
and get it live (including finishing Dendrite, given our P2P work builds on Dendrite!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1419820122143961093">native decentralised E2EE voip/video conferencing</a> for Matrix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fully build out our
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">relative decentralised reputation system</a>
in order to combat abuse in Matrix.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously this is in addition to all the normal business-as-usual work going
on in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting <a href="https://element.io/blog/spaces-the-next-frontier/">Spaces</a> out of beta</li>
<li>adding Threading to Element (yes, it's finally happening!)</li>
<li>speeding up room joins over federation</li>
<li>creating 'sync v3' to lazy-load all content and make the API super-snappy</li>
<li>lots of little long-overdue fun bits and pieces (yes, custom emoji, we're looking at you).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're wondering whether Protocol Labs' investment means that we'll be
seeing more overlap between <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> and Matrix, then yes -
where it makes tech sense to do so, we're hoping to work more closely
together; for instance collaborating with the libp2p team on our P2P work
(we still need to experiment properly with gossipsub!), or perhaps giving
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/travis/msc/ipfs/proposals/2706-IPFS.md">MSC2706</a>
some attention.  However, there are no plans to use cryptocurrency incentives
in Matrix or Element any time soon.</p>
<p>So, exciting times ahead!  We'd like to inordinately thank everyone who has
supported Matrix over the years - especially our Patreon supporters, whose
donations pay for all the matrix.org infrastructure while inspiring others to
open their cheque books; the existing investors at Element (especially <a href="https://notion.vc">Notion</a>
and <a href="https://automattic.com">Automattic</a>, who have come in again on this round); all the large scale
Matrix deployments out there which are effectively turning Matrix into an
industry (hello <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/21/germanys-national-healthcare-system-adopts-matrix">gematik!</a>) -
and everyone who has ever run a Matrix server, contributed code, used the
spec to make their own Matrix-powered creation, or simply chatted on Matrix.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Matrix wouldn't exist without you: the protocol and network
would have fizzled out long ago were it not for all the people supporting it
(the matrix.org server can now see over 35.5M addressable users on the
network!) - and meanwhile the ever-increasing energy of the community and the
core team combines to keep the protocol advancing forwards faster than ever.</p>
<p>We will do everything we possibly can to succeed in creating the long-awaited
secure communication layer of the open Web, and we look forward to large
amounts of Element's new funding being directed directly into core Matrix
development :)</p>
<p>thanks for flying Matrix,</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix core team.</p>

            <p>It's only been two weeks since Dendrite 0.4 landed, but there's already a
significant new release with Dendrite 0.4.1 (it's amazing how much work we
can do on Dendrite when not off chasing low-bandwidth and P2P Matrix!)</p>
<p>This release further improves memory performance and radically improves
state resolution performance (rumour has it that it's a 10x speed-up).
Meanwhile, SS API sytest coverage is up to 91%(!!) and CS API is now at 63%.</p>
<p>We're going to try to keep the pressure up over the coming weeks - and once
sytest is at 100% coverage (and we're not missing any big features which sytest
doesn't cover yet) we'll be declaring a 1.0 :)</p>
<p>If you're running Dendrite, please upgrade.  If not, perhaps this would be a
good version to give it a try?  You can get it, as always from,
https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.1.  The changelog
follows:</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for room version 7 has been added</li>
<li>Key notary support is now more complete, allowing Dendrite to be used as a notary server for looking up signing keys</li>
<li>State resolution v2 performance has been optimised further by caching the create event, power levels and join rules in memory instead of parsing them repeatedly</li>
<li>The media API now handles cases where the maximum file size is configured to be less than 0 for unlimited size</li>
<li>The <code>initial_state</code> in a <code>/createRoom</code> request is now respected when creating a room</li>
<li>Code paths for checking if servers are joined to rooms have been optimised significantly</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>A bug resulting in <code>cannot xref null state block with snapshot</code> during the new state storage migration has been fixed</li>
<li>Invites are now retired correctly when rejecting an invite from a remote server which is no longer reachable</li>
<li>The DNS cache <code>cache_lifetime</code> option is now handled correctly (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a>)</li>
<li>Invalid events in a room join response are now dropped correctly, rather than failing the entire join</li>
<li>The <code>prev_state</code> of an event will no longer be populated incorrectly to the state of the current event</li>
<li>Receiving an invite to an unsupported room version will now correctly return the <code>M_UNSUPPORTED_ROOM_VERSION</code> error code instead of <code>M_BAD_JSON</code> (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/meenal06">meenal06</a>)</li>
</ul>

Specifically, new Element Android sessions were unable to decrypt messages in end-to-end encrypted conversations.</p>
<p>⚙️ Otherwise, we've been doing quite a lot of internal / infrastructure work. Notably, we've completed the move from three separate CI systems to just one: GitHub Actions. We're also, for the first time, publishing Debian packages for our Release Candidates. We hope these changes move us towards a more reliable and seamless release process.</p>

<p>A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<hr />
<p>This week brings plenty of usability improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is now the <code>list-contacts</code> bot command to--you guessed it!--list the Matrix puppets of all of your contacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's now possible to sync a chat with a LINE user by inviting their Matrix puppet to a DM, instead of having to wait for someone to send you a message in LINE for the bridge to auto-sync it. This is especially useful with <code>list-contacts</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LINE group chats that haven't been used recently are now included in the set of chats that get bridged on a <code>sync</code> operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of chats to sync at startup time &amp; on-demand is now configurable, as a bridge config setting &amp; a parameter to the <code>sync</code> command, respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes make it possible to sync LINE chats/groups that previously may not have gotten synced, due to the intricacies of how LINE on Chrome handles chat history (especially on first use of the bridge).</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LorenDB has rewritten the invite dialog as well as the memberlist in Qml. This means they work now much more reliably and show the users in appropriate colors and a few other small improvements.</p>
<p>Apart from that, Nheko now has support for sending stickers! This is based on Sorunome's awesome <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2545">MSC2545</a>, so no integration manager is needed and it is trivially easy to share your sticker packs (just invite someone into the same room!). You can use stickers from your account data or upload stickers into a room so every room member can use it. If you found a sticker pack you like, you can enable a pack from a room globally by going into Nheko's room settings. You can check my current preferred set of stickers here: matrix:r/nico's-stickers:neko.dev</p>
<p>Currently you can't edit a sticker pack yet from Nheko. Support for that will come in the near future. Until then you can use either FluffyChat, Element's DevTools or <a href="https://github.com/deepbluev7/stickerpicker">my hack to import Telegram sticker packs into a room</a>. Note that Nheko's sticker pack support is incompatible with integration server based sticker packs like the one Element uses. On the other hand, you don't need an integration manager to use them! Custom emote support based in the image packs MSC is coming in the future to Nheko too.</p>
<p>Furthermore we fixed some bugs to move E2EE in Nheko out of Beta. We are close now and we have a plan!</p>
<p>That's all, don't get your hands too sticky!</p>

As for their mentor, Julian, he changed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/795">member loading so it only happens once a room is opened</a>, to improve performances. He also changed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/796">Matrix event handling to use <code>SyncRoomEvent</code></a>, which paves the way for display of various message types in the timeline of a room.</p>
<p>Giuseppe offered two nice additions to the login view:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in the form, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/783">one can now type enter to login</a> (it previously required to click on the button in the headerbar)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/791">errors are now displayed</a>, providing useful feedback on why the login may have failed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And to conclude this summary, we welcome 🎉 newcomer Veli Tasalı who fixed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/issues/802">a papercut I reported</a>: <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/787">when typing long messages, buttons next to the message entry were expanding along with the entry and now they keep nicely aligned</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>VoIP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Call event tiles for 1:1 calls merged, for better summaries of call history.</li>

<h3 id="beeper-update">Beeper update</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="desktop">Desktop</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New keyboard shortcuts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigating room list with arrow keys when there's no room open (and esc to close the current room)</li>
<li>Global shortcut to open Beeper</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rooms are opened where you left off (like Telegram, WhatsApp, etc) instead of at the bottom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated unread room indicators: a colored circle around the room avatar <em>(screenshot here)</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bridges">Bridges</h4>
<h4 id="linkedin">LinkedIn</h4>
<p>We've integrated the LinkedIn bridge into Beeper. The bridge is in beta and is generally ready for use. Since the last update, we moved it to <a href="https://gitlab.com/beeper/linkedin">GitLab</a>, added a Docker image, and implemented reaction and redaction handling in both directions! We also fixed a bunch of bugs across the board to improve reliability.</p>
<h4 id="android-sms">Android SMS</h4>
<p>The Android SMS bridge mentioned in the last update is progressing. It should be ready for self-hosted use in a few weeks, so our next update will probably include that.</p>
<p>Related to the SMS bridge, I've made <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-syncproxy">mautrix-syncproxy</a>, which is a microservice to do the <code>/sync</code>ing required for end-to-bridge encryption (to-device events and such) in the cloud and forwarding the data to the normal appservice transaction endpoint. When combined with <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-wsproxy">mautrix-wsproxy</a>, it allows the SMS bridge to only have a websocket connection, which uses significantly less battery than a HTTP request every 30 seconds. The sync proxy partially implements <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3202">MSC3202</a> and the to-device part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> (partially because it only does individual users rather than all appservice-owned users).</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@felix:haecker.io">Felix</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several GNOME contributors and I have been following TWIM and really enjoyed the concept. Since open source is about <del>stealing</del> sharing ideas, we wanted to deploy something similar for GNOME.</p>
<p>I gave this room's beloved <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/twim-o-matic">twim-o-matic</a> a try and fiddled a bit with the code. But I soon found that it is too specialised for matrix.org. That's when I decided to write a project agnostic TWIx bot based on matrix-rust-sdk called <a href="https://github.com/haecker-felix/hebbot">Hebbot</a>!</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://thisweek.gnome.org/posts/2021/07/twig-1/">how it looks in practice with a companion website for GNOME</a>. If you’re interested in how it looks behind the scenes, <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/haeckerfelix/2021/07/16/introducing-this-week-in-gnome/">have a look at this blog post which explains how it works</a>.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/haecker-felix/hebbot/releases/tag/v1.0">released a first version</a> on July 17, but I’m already working on making it smarter for a next release. In the meantime you can already use it for your project!</p>

<p>Love it, though I wish twim-o-matic had more of my attention! Maybe we can retire it and use Hebbot..?</p>

<h3 id="matrix-plugin-for-octoprint">Matrix Plugin for OctoPrint</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I have developed a new plugin for <a href="https://octoprint.org/">OctoPrint</a> which is a tool for controlling and monitoring 3D printers, which sends notifications about your prints and status of your 3D printer to matrix. The existing OctoSlack plugin also has Matrix support but fell foul of the /sync response changes in Synapse 1.38, and also sent the images from the camera to Matrix as inline images rather than m.image events, so they didn't render on some clients.</p>
<p>My new plugin can send messages on most events supported by OctoPrint, but the core events which are configurable through the OctoPrint web UI are print started, paused, completed and failed as well as print progress notifications. If you want Matrix notifications for your 3D prints, you can install the plugin through the official <a href="https://octoprint.org/">OctoPrint plugin repository</a> or by installing from the <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/octoprint-matrix-notifier-plugin">GitHub repository</a>. If you have any feature requests or pull requests, contributions to the plugin are very welcome.</p>
<p>Here is a preview of a print progress notification from something I was printing last night:</p>
