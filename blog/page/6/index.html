<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>The Spec Core Team had another retro this week, and part of what we talked about was how most of the spec PR writing falls to just a few people. Starting this week, we're going to try and diversify that work across the Spec Core Team, both for reducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> and increasing bandwidth of spec PRs. Hopefully the results of that will be noticeable!</p>
<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3783">MSC3783: Fixed base64 for SAS verification</a>!</p>
<p>For those that don't know, &quot;SAS verification&quot; refers to the act of two devices verifying each other through the use of Short Authentication Strings (SAS). This is the backbone of emoji verification when you verify with another user or one of your own devices.</p>
<p>It turns out that libolm, the olm and megolm encryption library, originally incorrectly encoded the base64 output of the message authentication code (MAC) calculation, which is a values that's passed between devices. Due to trying to maintain backwards-compatibility with older clients, this has not been fixed in newer clients yet.</p>
<p>This MSC proposes bumping the MAC algorithm identifier (which is agreed upon between devices when verifying) to a something new, which allows newer clients to know when to use the new or old (and incorrect) method of calculating the base64 encoding of MAC values.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this has no security implications. It's just unfortunate to have incorrect base64 encoding when interfacing with other, non-libolm, implementations of olm and megolm.

<p>The Synapse team is hard at work making Synapse faster and leaner. Work continues
apace on faster room joins over federation, and it seems that the work might land
sooner rather than later, although there are no solid dates yet.
In other news, profiling work is being done to determine ways to hopefully increase
the speed of local room joins and DM creation. Stay tuned for more information in the future on that.
Finally, it was an RC release week. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.65.0rc2">Synapse 1.65.0rc2</a> was released, and it contains some fun features and bugfixes. Check it out!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.2">Dendrite 0.9.2</a> which contains the following updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite now supports history visibility on the <code>/sync</code>, <code>/messages</code> and <code>/context</code> endpoints
<ul>
<li>It should now be possible to view the history of a room in more cases (as opposed to limiting scrollback to the join event or defaulting to the restrictive <code>&quot;join&quot;</code> visibility rule as before)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The default room version for newly created rooms is now room version 9</li>
<li>New admin endpoint <code>/_dendrite/admin/resetPassword/{userID}</code> has been added, which replaces the <code>-reset-password</code> flag in <code>create-account</code></li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> binary now uses shared secret registration over HTTP to create new accounts, which fixes a number of problems with account data and push rules not being configured correctly for new accounts</li>
<li>The internal HTTP APIs for polylith deployments have been refactored for correctness and consistency</li>
<li>The federation API will now automatically clean up some EDUs that have failed to send within a certain period of time</li>
<li>The <code>/hierarchy</code> endpoint will now return potentially joinable rooms (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/texuf">texuf</a>)</li>
<li>The user directory will now show or hide users correctly</li>
<li>Send-to-device messages should no longer be incorrectly duplicated in <code>/sync</code></li>
<li>The federation sender will no longer create unnecessary destination queues as a result of a logic error</li>
<li>A bug where database migrations may not execute properly when upgrading from older versions has been fixed</li>
<li>A crash when failing to update user account data has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition when generating notification counts has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition when setting up NATS has been fixed (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/brianathere">brianathere</a>)</li>
<li>Stale cache data for membership lazy-loading is now correctly invalidated when doing a complete sync</li>
<li>Data races within user-interactive authentication have been fixed (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/tak-hntlabs">tak-hntlabs</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This brings our current test compliance figures to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 90%</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 95%</li>
</ul>

<p>Announcing <code>matrix-appservice-discord</code> 3.0.0!</p>
<p>What? Another week, another major release?
Yes, we want to make breaking changes obvious, and the bridge now requires Node.js 16+.</p>
<p>The release fixes the outdated <code>yarn.lock</code> file. Thanks to the package maintainers of NixOS to point this out! üëã
Furthermore, mentioning Matrix users in Discord got fixed.</p>
<p>And, for the fans of containers, we've re-added the release of Docker images. üê≥
The URL changed and we don't plan to update <code>halfshot/matrix-appservice-discord</code> on Docker Hub.
The image can be pulled from <code>ghcr.io/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-discord:v3.0.0</code>.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now shows you a pretty preview for rooms you are trying to join. This uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3266">MSC3266</a>, which you might need to enable in your synapse config, if you want to see more than the roomid of the room you are trying to join. It tries to fall back to the /hierarchy endpoint, but that won't work over federation.</p>
<p>Similarly you can now somewhat edit what rooms are in a space. I grew up with Windows 98, so this is a very nested right click menu. We are still discussing some of the wording choices for the options there, so if you have any opinions about it, feel free to give feedback about it! This is part of the bigger goal to be able to manage your communities from within Nheko, so stay tuned for more features coming in that area.</p>
<p>red_sky (nheko.im) also improved our notifications code on macOS. You can now disable the notification sound in the system settings, which for some reason requires badge permissions to show that option... macOS will always remain a mystery to us! Similarly we fixed the source text for notifications on Windows, which should now not show a stray %1 anymore as well as a few other cleanups.

<li>That‚Äôs not the only exciting update in EleWeb/Desktop this week, including the newly extended voice messages! Instead of voice messages capped at 2 minutes, users are now able to send a voice note of up to 15 minutes long. Go forth and record üé§</li>
<li>In upcoming releases we‚Äôre also looking at how to improve a user‚Äôs first few days in Element. We know that it can be daunting to stare at an empty screen and wonder how to get going, which is why we‚Äôve designed and built a checklist for new users.

            <p>TL;DR: we‚Äôve just launched <a href="https://areweoidcyet.com">areweoidcyet.com</a> to track the project to adopt OpenID Connect (OIDC) as <em>the</em> authentication method used by Matrix. It has a load of useful resources (<a href="https://areweoidcyet.com/#faqs">FAQs</a>, <a href="https://areweoidcyet.com/#when">status</a> etc.) so do please check it out!</p>
<p>Hey folks,</p>
<p>As you may know, there is a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861">proposal</a> and project afoot to change the way authentication is done in Matrix‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Currently Matrix uses a <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#client-authentication">custom authentication protocol</a> baked into the Matrix spec. This poses a number of drawbacks. To overcome these drawbacks the project proposes migrating to use the industry standard authentication protocol OpenID Connect (OIDC) instead.</p>
<p>In terms of why this is a good idea: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/hughns/delegated-oidc-architecture/proposals/3861-delegated-oidc-architecture.md">MSC3861</a> has all the details - please check it out! </p>
<p>The bottom line is that Matrix should focus on being a decentralised communication protocol - <strong>not</strong> an authentication protocol‚Ä¶ and by adopting a dedicated authentication protocol we can benefit from all sorts of goodies such as easy 2FA and MFA, passwordless-auth via WebAuthn, Login via QR-code, alternative CAPTCHAs and so much more.</p>
<p>In support of this the proposal extends to the Matrix.org Foundation joining the OpenID Foundation as a non-profit member to support the work that the OpenID Foundation is doing to build a robust and audited ecosystem for open authentication.</p>
<p>Whilst this project proposes a significant change to the Matrix ecosystem that would take some time to migrate to, we believe that it will better support the continued growth and adoption of Matrix in the years to come.</p>
<p>Today we are launching the <a href="https://areweoidcyet.com/">areweoidcyet.com</a> website which is packed with information and resources on the project:</p>

<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.0">Dendrite 0.9.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.1">Dendrite 0.9.1</a>. There are quite a few big changes, including an all-new caching model and several optimisations. This release also moves our baseline supported Go version up to Go 1.18.</p>
<p>The following changes are included across both releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite now uses Ristretto for managing in-memory caches
<ul>
<li>Should improve cache utilisation considerably over time by more intelligently selecting and managing cache entries compared to the previous LRU-based cache</li>
<li>Defaults to a 1GB cache size if not configured otherwise</li>
<li>The estimated cache size in memory and maximum age can now be configured with new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/e94ef84aaba30e12baf7f524c4e7a36d2fdeb189/dendrite-sample.monolith.yaml#L44-L61">configuration options</a> to prevent unbounded cache growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for serving the <code>/.well-known/matrix/client</code> hint directly from Dendrite
<ul>
<li>Configurable with the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/e94ef84aaba30e12baf7f524c4e7a36d2fdeb189/dendrite-sample.monolith.yaml#L67-L69">configuration option</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refactored membership updater, which should eliminate some bugs caused by the membership table getting out of sync with the room state</li>
<li>The User API is now responsible for sending account data updates to other components, which may fix some races and duplicate account data events</li>
<li>Optimised database query for checking whether a remote server is allowed to request an event over federation without using anywhere near as much CPU time (PostgreSQL only)</li>
<li>Database migrations have been refactored to eliminate some problems that were present with <code>goose</code> and upgrading from older Dendrite versions</li>
<li>Media fetching will now use the <code>/v3</code> endpoints for downloading media from remote homeservers</li>
<li>HTTP 404 and HTTP 405 errors from the client-facing APIs should now be returned with CORS headers so that web-based clients do not produce incorrect access control warnings for unknown endpoints</li>
<li>Some preparation work for full history visibility support</li>
<li>Upgrades a dependency which caused issues building Dendrite with Go 1.19</li>
<li>The roomserver will no longer give up prematurely after failing to call <code>/state_ids</code></li>
<li>Removes the faulty room info cache, which caused of a number of race conditions and occasional bugs (including when creating and joining rooms)</li>
<li>The media endpoint now sets the <code>Cache-Control</code> header correctly to prevent web-based clients from hitting media endpoints excessively</li>
<li>The sync API will now advance the PDU stream position correctly in all cases (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/sergekh2">sergekh2</a>)</li>
<li>The sync API will now delete the correct range of send-to-device messages when advancing the stream position</li>
<li>The device list <code>changed</code> key in the <code>/sync</code> response should now return the correct users</li>
<li>A data race when looking up missing state has been fixed</li>
<li>The <code>/send_join</code> API is now applying stronger validation to the received membership event</li>
<li>Fixes a crash that could occur during event redaction</li>
<li>The <code>/members</code> endpoint will no longer incorrectly return HTTP 500 as a result of some invite events</li>
<li>Send-to-device messages should now be ordered more reliably and the last position in the stream updated correctly</li>
<li>Parsing of appservice configuration files is now less strict (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/Kab1r">Kab1r</a>)</li>
<li>The sync API should now identify shared users correctly when waking up for E2EE key changes</li>
<li>The federation <code>/state</code> endpoint will now return a HTTP 403 when the state before an event isn't known instead of a HTTP 500</li>
<li>Presence timestamps should now be calculated with the correct precision</li>
<li>A race condition in the roomserver's room info has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition in the sync API has been fixed</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>After a short vacation, I've done some new work on populus-viewer. Most of this has been UX and bugfixes, but I've added one new feature that I wanted to share. <a href="https://github.com/opentower/matrix-doc/blob/audio-markup/proposals/3775-markup-locations-for-audiovisual-media.md">MSC3775: Markup Locations for Audiovisual Media</a> gives a spec for annotating audio and video on matrix, but it also allows you to annotate images. So, for completeness sake, I've added support for annotating image files in Populus! This might be useful for discussing publication layouts, product designs, or for teaching art history. So populus can now annotate: video, audio, images and pdfs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api/">matrix-widget-api</a> v1.0.0 was released yesterday, reflecting the fact that we're not expecting any big changes to the library's architecture for the foreseeable future, and that it's more or less ready for wider use.</p>
<p>It also comes with a couple of new features ‚ú® for widget authors: Sending and receiving to-device messages with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3819">MSC3819</a>, and getting TURN servers from the client with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3846/">MSC3846</a>. Together, these features enable some new complex use-cases, such as doing VoIP from inside a widget. See Matrix Live for a preview of what that looks like with Element Call! üìπÔ∏è</p>
<p>This is as good a time as any to mention that matrix-widget-api doesn't have to just be for web-based apps. If you're building mobile apps with Matrix and want to make use of widgets, running matrix-widget-api inside a web view to liaison with the actual widget can make it a lot simpler to start supporting widget API features. If you're curious, watch Element iOS+Android for upcoming examples of this.</p>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week saw a few major improvements on the dev-ex of the Rust SDK (among others): <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/892">support for refresh tokens</a> landed; we have a setup for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/855">integration tests against an actual synapse instance now</a> (and started writing tests); our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/897">docs for <code>main</code> now contain the js bindings, too</a>; <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/889">event handlers can now be unregistered</a> and we've added an API for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/899">room specific event handlers</a>. Further more, we've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/903">refactored the examples</a> (now to be found in <code>/examples</code> rather than some sub-sub-directory no one finds) and created two more: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/dfec17e6afbf6c1ea35e9ee968c7668eb4a46a04/examples/getting_started/src/main.rs"><code>getting-started</code></a> combines the autojoin and command-example with a lot more additional inline comment to explain what is going on and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/dfec17e6afbf6c1ea35e9ee968c7668eb4a46a04/examples/custom_events/src/main.rs"><code>custom-events</code></a> showcases how to use the sdk and ruma types to send any custom events (in that case a ping-ack example) over matrix!</p>
<p>This was also a week of fighting the ci. After the integration tests landed, coverage reporting broke and an investigation was kicked off to check whether llvm-cov is in a usable state for us by now (it is not), but a fix was found. We've also started regretting adding <code>npm</code>-based workflows in our repo, as we've found ourselves at the end of an upgrade bug and the saw CI failing without us changing anything :shakes_fist_at_sky: . A fix was found quickly by pinning a sub-dependency. On a similar note, we've postponed merging the kotlin bindings until the android team is back on it and available to answer some questions we have, and the wasm-js bindings showed build failures on CI, which the original author will have to take a look at after coming back from vacation - thus delaying <code>crypto-js</code> a bit further.</p>

<p>This week I'm showing off an early look at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive">Matrix public archive</a>. As the name suggests, it acts as an archive of history for your world-readable Matrix rooms. This allows you to view historical content day-by-day and jump back years ago to see what your Matrix room was up to.</p>
<p>More importantly, it also allows Google to do the same thing so you‚Äôll probably start finding Matrix content from your favorite search engine and be able to harness the massive knowledge base stored in Matrix. Imagine seeing Matrix logs instead of Stack Overflow answers when googling questions! The new portal into the Matrix ecosystem üåå</p>

<p>Under the hood, we use the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3030">MSC3030 <code>/timestamp_to_event</code></a> endpoint to fetch the messages for a given day and then we sever-side render the events with the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen SDK</a>.

It was a &quot;for fun&quot; type of thing. But I can see it being useful for people who do not have access to a raspberry pi (such as myself at the moment) to use as a small homeserver. It can hold up in 1 to 1 Direct Messages and in small rooms.

            <p>It's that time again: there's a new Synapse release, fresh out of the oven!
Let's take a look at what's inside <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.64.0">Synapse
1.64</a>.</p>
<h2 id="delegating-email-verification-is-now-deprecated">Delegating email verification is now deprecated</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.4.0">Synapse 1.4.0</a>
introduced a configuration option (<code>account_threepid_delegates.email</code>) to allow
homeservers to delegate validating the ownership of email addresses to an
external identity server. This validation is used by Synapse when adding an
email address to a Matrix account, or before performing a password reset.</p>
<p>As of Synapse 1.64, this option is deprecated, and Synapse will print a warning
if it is used. This is because this option relies on old API endpoints that have
since been
<a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/changelog/#identity-service-api-1-1">removed</a> from the
Matrix specification.</p>
<p>Synapse can do this validation internally provided it is configured with details
of an SMTP server. Administrators currently relying on
<code>account_threepid_delegates.email</code> should therefore ensure that an SMTP server
is correctly configured, and remove the <code>account_threepid_delegates.email</code>
option. See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.64/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#email">configuration
guide</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>We plan to fully remove this configuration option in Synapse 1.66, which is
expected to be released on August 30th.</p>
<p>Note that the equivalent option to validate the ownership of phone numbers
(<code>account_threepid_delegates.msisdn</code>) can still be used, though we expect to
deprecate it in a future release of Synapse.</p>
<h2 id="improved-tls-support-for-sending-emails">Improved TLS support for sending emails</h2>
<p>When configuring an SMTP server to use to send out emails to users, server
administrators can configure Synapse to use TLS to communicate to that server.
Until now, only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS">STARTTLS</a> was
supported in this case.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.64 introduces a new <code>force_tls</code> configuration option in the <code>email</code>
section of the configuration file. If this new setting is set to <code>true</code> Synapse
will use TLS for the initial connection rather than upgrading via STARTTLS.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.64/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#email">configuration
guide</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="memory-leak-in-frozendict">Memory leak in <code>frozendict</code></h2>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, we
<a href="https://github.com/Marco-Sulla/python-frozendict/issues/60">identified</a> a
memory leak within <a href="https://pypi.org/project/frozendict/">frozendict</a>, which is
a library that Synapse relies on. This would in turn cause Synapse instances to
slowly leak memory when processing <code>/sync</code> requests.</p>
<p>We highly encourage server administrators who installed Synapse via <code>pip</code> to
upgrade their local version of <code>frozendict</code> to version 2.3.3 or later, which
includes a fix to this issue. The Docker image <code>matrixdotorg/synapse</code> and the
Debian packages from <code>packages.matrix.org</code> already include the updated library.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This version of Synapse introduces support for room version 10! This new room
version enables support for the new <code>knock_restricted</code> join rule, to allow
knocking into rooms which are otherwise restricted to members of a specific room
(or space). See <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/rooms/v10/">the Matrix specification about room version
10</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Additionally, Synapse 1.64 features a new rate limiter to limit the rate of joins to the same
room. It is intended as a mitigation against abuse scenarios involving joining a
lot of users from different homeservers to a room to then send spam across it.
See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#rc_joins_per_room">configuration
guide</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>This release of Synapse also extends the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#list-room-api">List
Rooms</a>
and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#room-details-api">Room
Details</a>
admin APIs to include the type of a room in responses, allowing server
administrators to differentiate spaces from other rooms.</p>

changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the

<p>This MSC covers an Extensible Events (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) schema definition for translatable text! This would allow a client to send a message in multiple languages, with the receiver able to choose which language they're prefer to see the message in (ideally falling back to a default or machine translation if their preferred language was not available).</p>
<p>Like other MSCs that rely on Extensible Events, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a> will need to land before this MSC can. But until then, it's great to see all of the wonderful things this feature will allow Matrix to do!

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week The Construct server runs on Alpine Linux using freshly cut docker images building on the 0.7 release announced last week. A few images are available for preview while a more complete matrix is filled out. I am proud to announce to TWIM that Construct offers the most compact docker image for a Matrix server at just under 15 MiB; the only caveat is that media
thumbnailing won't be available.</p>
<p>There's still a lot of room for optimization and docker experts to critique! Feel free to join the discussion at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> and check out https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct today!</p>

<li>It‚Äôs an exciting week for both our mobile teams as we‚Äôre ready to release our new authentication flow! If you‚Äôve been reading TWIM for a while you‚Äôll know that we‚Äôve been working hard, across all Element teams, to improve our onboarding experience. Part of this work on iOS was a new Create Account flow.
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre rolling the changes out slowly, so don‚Äôt panic if you don‚Äôt see the new experience yet!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In even more exciting news, our test coverage has increased with a big bump. We‚Äôve gone from 12% to 51%!</li>
<li>We‚Äôve also continued to make updates and improvements to our location sharing feature.</li>
<li>On the ElementX front we have our first proof of concept for sliding sync (sync v3) working and we‚Äôve almost finished setting up snapshot and integration testing. We also have Rust logs, a new authentication service and performance tests incoming.</li>
<li>Finally, the account deactivation button has had a change of copy - this keeps us inline with Apple guidelines around deleting and deactivating accounts.</li>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been a week of quite, constant progress on many fronts, most not that visible to the outside observer. For once, the progress on integration sliding sync into element-x for iOS has taken up speed, with many smaller bug fixes and additional features exposed through the FFI being added and performance optimisations. After the internal jack-in testing tool, this is the first actual trial of sliding sync for rust (and after the js-implementation, only the second client to actually use sliding sync overall)‚Äîand it has been tremendous. Latest tests put the loading time to first view on the first 20-ish rooms at a 150ms range üéâ.</p>
<p>More visible to the keen observers of the repository has been that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/874">we've updated the <code>event_handler</code> API</a> to allow removing existing handlers, an important step towards implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/868">completion guaranteeing API calls</a>, and that we've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/882">support for custom encrypted events</a> now.</p>

<p>An episode with the maintainers of Threematrix, the 100% Rust bridge between Matrix and Threema!</p>
<p>In addition to that, <a href="https://matrix.org/open-tech-will-save-us/">Open Tech Will Save Us will be back on Wednesday 27 at 16:00 UTC</a>! The topic will be &quot;what makes a platform&quot;, or more specifically: &quot;are Linux or the web platforms&quot;. There are many fascinating topics to discuss, such as &quot;is it possible to create an app for Linux&quot; (it's not as simple as it sounds), &quot;why are some people against theming?&quot;, or &quot;why do developers want to use platforms&quot;.</p>
<p>And to answer that, who other than the Linux desktop most advanced projects GNOME and KDE, and people working on Matrix, the protocol that wants to become as unmissable as the web itself, and more specifically on a deeper integration of widgets with Matrix clients?</p>
<p>You can join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#otwsu:matrix.org">#otwsu:matrix.org</a> to ask your questions on July 27 during the live show, and bookmark either https://stream.matrix.org or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGE2KEasjbc">YouTube stream</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of MSCs moving through the pipeline in the last couple weeks! As always, be sure to take a look at those in Final Comment Period above - only a few days left to comment on them before they merge/close!</p>
<p>Otherwise the Spec Core Team is looking to try and get a handle on the current MSC backlog - this means taking a look at all of the open MSCs, triaging them and organising them into a loose priority queue. This is likely to take quite a while to do and may not ever be complete - but should give us and everyone else an idea of what's expected to land in upcoming Matrix spec versions.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3217">MSC3217: Soft kicks</a>!</p>
<p>The idea this MSC proposes is to add a possible <code>m.softkick</code> field to room membership events of type &quot;leave&quot;, which if present will inform clients that the user has only been kicked temporarily, and they are welcome to rejoin.</p>
<p>This helps with the IRC bridging use case laid out in the MSC.</p>

<p>I use Zeal ‚Äì an offline documentation browser using the same docsets as Dash for MacOS.
It allows me to browse MDN, ExpressJS docs, NodeJS docs and other languages and formats while not relying on the Internet when traveling.
They have &quot;208 awesome docsets&quot;, and I guess you know which one I'm missing ‚Äì or used to miss, until I packaged it myself.</p>

<p>If you use Dash or Zeal, give it a try. Let me know, if you find pages that are not working.
I hope that Matrix will be included in their list of user-contributed docsets.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct server has been refurbished to support the Ubuntu 22.04+ platform. I am happy to
report that Construct performs faster and more reliably than ever before. It's been
a long time since the last update due to COVID-related health problems, but development
has picked up again. I'd like to thank @manu_kamath:matrix.org and @uis246 for their
contributions, and of course Yan Minari for keeping things together over the past year.
Additional work implementing the latest MSC's will continue in the coming weeks so I
encourage everyone to show support in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> and contribute if possible.</p>
<p>Several enhancements have taken place this release, so I'd just like to highlight one
here: The media database has been eliminated and has been integrated into the main
events database. Construct did always store media in rooms by splitting files
into blocks, but it offloaded the content block to separate storage leaving just a
hash of the content in the matrix event. Construct now stores blocks directly in event
content via hardware-accelerated base64 encoding. The result performs better because 
there's only one database query instead of two, and the room can be shared between
servers in a Construct Cluster.</p>
<p>Construct is a performant and robust Matrix Server and Natural Language Processor.
Please be mindful of any laws in your country which require registering your instance
for commercial use.</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan Abolivier</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we've released Synapse 1.63! This release includes a few features such as better rate limiting for invites, as well as experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">MSC3827</a> which allows filtering public room search results by room type. The latter will, once stabilised, allow for better discoverability of public spaces since it will allow clients to specifically look for them. Read all about this new release on the matrix.org blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/07/20/synapse-1-63-released</p>
<p>We've also spent some time clarifying documentation and prompts about the usage statistics Synapse automatically reports if configured with <code>report_stats</code> set to <code>true</code>. The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.63/usage/administration/monitoring/reporting_homeserver_usage_statistics.html">new documentation page</a> lists exactly what is reported and how this reporting works. This clarification work included removing the use of &quot;anonymised&quot; when referring to this feature to make it clearer that, even though Synapse does not report identifiable information about users and rooms, it does report the homeserver's name (i.e. the value of the <code>server_name</code> configuration setting).</p>

<p>Say hello to a new bridge in Matrix universe (or rather fediverse): <strong>Threematrix</strong>. As you might've guessed from the name: It's a bridge between the Threema messenger and Matrix. Threema is a very popular messenger in europe, especially in German speaking countries (it's a swiss company). We've just released our very first alpha version ‚Äì it's a very simple bot bridge for now, but we have quite a lot of improvements on our todo list. Currently, it only works with the (paid) Threema Gateway API product, but we're trying to talk to Threema to come up with a more affordable hobbyist pricing model for bridge use. Feel free to follow our releases in the <a href="https://github.com/bitbetterde/Threematrix">GitHub repo</a>, follow our <a href="https://mastodon.social/web/@threematrix">Mastodon account</a> and join our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#threema-bridge:matrix.org">Matrix room</a> to stay up to date or ask any questions.</p>

Aside from usability fixes and documentation improvements, there have been some notable changes to generic webhook support:</p>

<p>I got a fantastic release for you to day and it won't fit inside a normal sized update so without further ado, here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notification counts üíØ (LorenDB, d42)
<ul>
<li>You can now see notification counts in more spaces, like your task bar or in
the community sidebar.</li>
<li>For better work-life balance you can hide the notification counts on a per
space basis.</li>
<li>For notification counts in the task bar your desktop environment needs to
support the Unity protocol.</li>
<li>Notifications are also preserved across restarts now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moderation üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
<ul>
<li>You can now change the permissions and aliases of a room.</li>
<li>Permissions are shown in the Memberlist</li>
<li>A new <code>/redact</code> command to redact an event or all messages by a user.</li>
<li>You can now provide a reason when inviting, knocking, kicking and banning
users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Faster startup ‚ö°
<ul>
<li>On at least some systems startup should now be instant even with thousands
of rooms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Encryption improvements üõ°Ô∏è
<ul>
<li>Support for the most recent changes to Matrix E2EE including fallback keys,
no longer relying on the sender_key.</li>
<li>Compatibility and stability improvements when dealing with different base64
encodings and when verifying users and devices.</li>
<li>Fetch the whole online key backup at the click of a button.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integration with external apps üó∫Ô∏è (LorenDB)
<ul>
<li>Nheko now has a D-Bus API, which you can enable in the settings menu.</li>
<li>This allows applications like KRunner or Rofi to list and switch between
rooms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are reading this a bit early, the release builds might still be cooking, but they should be available in the next few hours. There about 40 more features and at least 30 bugfixes waiting for you, so checkout the release here: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases/tag/v0.10.0 . I'd like to thank as always everyone who contributed to this release, it has been a pleasure to work with you folks and I hope I will see a few of you in the next release as well.</p>
<p>As you might be able to tell, moderation features were a big topic this release. But they are clearly not done yet and I expect more of those to land in the future now that Nheko is fairly mature. There are also a few other cool features planned, so while this release is exciting, there will always be more! Same bad client, same bad... wait, this is not my outro!</p>

<li>We have started to work on using the new Realm Kotlin SDK (we are using the legacy Java SDK at the moment): it should improve the stability of the app (and so the crash free session) and improve devX. Nearly all the possible blocking points have been handled. This will force us to use suspend methods, which will be useful for ElementX.</li>

<p>New project! <code>open-super-dapp-android</code> is a fully open source, open standard, decentralized &quot;super app&quot; including a secure, encrypted Matrix compatible messenger based off of the Element Messenger, and an Ethereum crypto wallet and web3 browser based off of Alpha Wallet. Our mission is to foster, and provide access to, a decentralized and secure digital commons for all. Github repo: https://github.com/2gatherproject/open-super-dapp-android</p>
<p>OSD is a downstream project of Element, aiming to provide the functionalities of a &quot;super app&quot; like WeChat, just as an open, distributed and not-for-profit app instead of a proprietary, closed and for-profit one.</p>
<p>This software is pre-alpha, actively seeking contributors, donors and maintainers/leaders. Get in on the ground floor and help build something amazing!</p>
<p>Currently, Open Super dApp builds and runs with full functionality of the Element messenger and Alpha Wallet in the same Android app, with all existing tests passing. Efforts to further integrate their functionalities are just beginning.</p>
<p>Next steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate easy to use person to person Ethereum payment functionality between Matrix users.</li>
<li>Provide a powerful and easy to use messaging and payment javascript API for use by web3 applications accessed through the Open Super dApp. Produce sample web dApps using this API.</li>
<li>Centralize cryptographic secrets between the wallet and the messenger.</li>
<li>Build a parallel iOS version for iPhones using Element iOS and Alpha Wallet iOS.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Because I don't like having to change my display name to tell coworkers when I'm away, I've written a maubot plugin for an auto-responder bot.</p>
<p>It allows me to signal when I'm away, at which point anyone who sends a message in an existing DM will be sent an automated reply so they know that I'm away, when I'll be back, and how to reach out to me in case of emergencies (it does this once per DM until I come back). When I'm back, I just need to tell the bot and it will automatically turn off the auto-responder and give me a summary of the DMs in which I've missed messages while I was away.</p>

It now supports tracking repos, groups, and user stars on GitHub, GitLab (both .com and self-hosted), as well as Gitea (though Gitea requires a token for reading stars). And also tracking &quot;releases&quot; - a.k.a. tags - on bare Git repos, at least as long as they don't require SSH key authorization. Things are getting ever closer to a 1.0 release, with only really some missing bang commands and error reporting being the remaining pieces.</p>

            <p>Hey all, it's time for another Synapse release! That's right, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.63.0">Synapse
1.63</a> is out,
let's have a look at it.</p>
<h2 id="clarifications-on-anonymised-server-statistics">Clarifications on &quot;anonymised&quot; server statistics</h2>
<p>Synapse has the ability to report usage statistics to the Matrix.org Foundation
(or to another location, if configured to do so). These statistics, such as
number of users, number of rooms joined by the server, etc. (they don't feature
any identifiable information about users and rooms) help us monitor the health
of the public federation.</p>
<p>In this release of Synapse, we have updated our public documentation about this
feature to clarify how it works and what exactly is being reported. This
documentation can be found <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.63/usage/administration/monitoring/reporting_homeserver_usage_statistics.html">right
here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that previous documentation and prompts surrounding this feature called it
&quot;anonymised&quot; server statistics. This could easily be misinterpreted, as while
per-user statistics are not reported, homeserver server names are. We have
therefore changed said documentation and prompts to be clearer about
what is actually reported.</p>
<p>Note that your homeserver will never report any statistics if the <code>report_stats</code>
configuration option is set to <code>false</code>. Server admins who are curious about
which software is used by the Matrix.org Foundation to record server statistics
can check out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/panopticon">panopticon</a>.</p>
<h2 id="improved-filtering-for-public-room-search">Improved filtering for public room search</h2>
<p>This version of Synapse ships with an experimental implementation of
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">MSC3827</a> which
allows filtering public room search results by room type. This feature will
enable better discoverability for Matrix Spaces (which are rooms with a specific
type, under the hood), as it will enable clients to search specifically for
public spaces.</p>
<p>This feature is still experimental as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">its
MSC</a> hasn't
completed the MSC process yet, though it is in its final comment period at the
time this post is being written. This means a stable implementation will be
coming to Synapse very soon, so watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>Synapse 1.63 also includes a new rate limiter to limit invites per issuer. This
rate limiter can be configured using the new <code>rc_invites.per_issuer</code>
configuration setting, see <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#rc_invites">the
documentation</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.63.0">full
changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our
thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular
order) <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/villepeh">villepeh</a> and <a href="https://github.com/arkamar">Petr

</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The Spec Core Team took a concentrated effort to work through our priority backlog of MSCs, resulting in the decent amount of MSCs hitting FCP this week!</p>
<p>Thankfully the community has nearly matched this number by adding quite a few more MSCs into the fray. But we're still up by 1!</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most exciting MSCs to move forwards is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676: Message editing</a>, which allows users to edit events (including messages) that they've previously sent. Part of the aggregations work, this functionality has been used extensively throughout the ecosystem. But only now is it making its way into the spec proper. I'm also personally excited about <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2285">MSC2285: Private read receipts</a>, which allows users to read a room's contents without advertising it.</p>
<p>Of course the above MSCs are still in Final Comment Period; a 5 day period where anyone can raise their concerns about an MSC before it is accepted. So if you have any last-minute comments, be sure to get them in now!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2666">MSC2666: Get rooms in common with another user</a>!</p>
<p>Another MSC I'm personally excited about! This MSC provides an endpoint on the homeserver to request the rooms (or spaces) you have in common with another user. I would find this useful for incoming DMs from users I may or may not know. Note that the client may not already have this information if it is making use of <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#lazy-loading-room-members">lazy loading room members</a>, so it needs a way to ask the server for this information.</p>
<p>Looks like the MSC is currently sitting in the Spec Core Team's review backlog. We'll get to it soon!</p>

<p>The Synapse team has been hard at work! This week we published <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.63.0rc1">Synapse 1.63.0rc1</a>. Among the notable features are support for MSC3827: filtering <code>/publicRooms</code> by room type, allowing for better discovery of Spaces. You can read more about that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">here</a>. In addition, the release contains a number of bugfixes, updates to the documentation, and internal changes focused on reducing memory usage and increasing performance, as well as supporting the long-standing goal of faster room joins. More on these next week in the official release announcement!</p>

<h3 id="nheko-website">Nheko (<a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can now edit aliases in Nheko! This means you can publish your own aliases in the room directory as well as in the room. If an alias can't be used by people (because it isn't listed in the room directory), that alias is highlighted in red with an easy option to fix it (if you have permissions to do so). You can also easily switch the primary (canonical) alias of the room.</p>
<p>With this the feature set I wanted to have for the next release is complete. I wanted to focus on improving moderation and room management capabilities in Nheko and it does now have a very basic sets of capabilities to do so. I do already have plans to expand on them though!</p>
<p>So instead of working on new features, I will be focusing on bug fixes. For a start if someone has the username <code>room</code>, Nheko will now omit the reply fallback to prevent pinging the whole room. The verification window now also should always be big enough to show its contents and we now properly explain to users, why emojis might look different on different devices fixing an issue reported via Twitter... There is also a new icon for the room directory (it is now a building, very punny, huh?).</p>

<li>Nvrwhere has improved NeoChat's Timeline layout: On a wide window, the bubbles will now be centered in the window, in order to better use the space while not stretching the timeline out too far</li>
<li>He's also fixed several papercut issues around the UI, for example editing and replying using the keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>The browser will now properly open when clicking on a link when using wayland</li>
<li>The first part of Snehit's GSoC project is almost ready to land: The room list is gaining a list of spaces, which can be used to filter for the rooms included in that space</li>
<li>We're also moving forward on the E2EE support, with NeoChat now allowing a user to send an encrypted message into a matrix room - provided libQuotient supports it üôÇ</li>
<li>Tobias is also working on improved Reaction &amp; Emoji pickers, which will allow users to select different variants like skin tones and which will behave better on mobile devices</li>

Showcase yourself and your relation to the Matrix world. Let's get to know each other!
We aim to compile a versatile program. We are open to contributions of any length, from 5 minutes (lightning talks) to presentations and talks to workshops and hacksessions up to 5 hours. We‚Äôll come together to discover, celebrate and enjoy the world of matrix. Also, if you have any arty, cultural or playful contribution in mind, please offer it.</p>

<p>Outside of that was the usual rounds of MSC review by team members.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2199">MSC2199: Canonical DMs</a>!</p>
<p>While the name may not make much sense to the layperson, the idea of a &quot;canonical&quot; Direct Messaging room (DM) is one that would always be referenced whenever a DM between two people is requested. That is, instead of potentially having a few different DM rooms with someone, both you and the other person would always know which room to use when DM'ing each other.</p>
<p>We don't really have this today. DM rooms are just group rooms with only you and someone else in them. If you attempt to DM another user, your client will try to guess the best room to use for this through some clever heuristics. What's lacking is a defined way to always arrive at the same room for this action.</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to define one, and would allow other functionality to be built on top of it, such as definitively knowing which room to send user-to-user data into, and to read from.</p>

<p>A Minimal, simple, multi-platform chat client for the Matrix protocol.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alariej:matrix.org">JFA</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quadrix v1.2.0 has now been released. It's already available for Linux (https://snapcraft.io/quadrix, https://flathub.org/apps/details/chat.quadrix.Quadrix) and Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chat.quadrix.android). The Windows, MacOS and iOS versions are awaiting approval from the respective stores.</p>
<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand new icons from Remix Icons (https://github.com/Remix-Design/RemixIcon)</li>
<li>Messages can be redacted (for now only by the message owner)</li>
<li>Users with admin power can kick other users from rooms</li>
<li>Users can start a DM room directly from the member list in a group room</li>
</ul>
<p>Please leave feedback/comments at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#quadrix:matrix.org">#quadrix:matrix.org</a> or in the issues at https://github.com/alariej/quadrix (stars welcome :-)</p>
<p>Note: The PR (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/pull/1348) to publish Quadrix on the matrix.org client list has been submitted more than a month ago, but still awaiting approval. Anyone here can help?</p>

<h3 id="nheko-website">Nheko (<a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can now edit aliases in Nheko! This means you can publish your own aliases in the room directory as well as in the room. If an alias can't be used by people (because it isn't listed in the room directory), that alias is highlighted in red with an easy option to fix it (if you have permissions to do so). You can also easily switch the primary (canonical) alias of the room.</p>
<p>With this the feature set I wanted to have for the next release is complete. I wanted to focus on improving moderation and room management capabilities in Nheko and it does now have a very basic sets of capabilities to do so. I do already have plans to expand on them though!</p>
<p>So instead of working on new features, I will be focusing on bug fixes. For a start if someone has the username <code>room</code>, Nheko will now omit the reply fallback to prevent pinging the whole room. The verification window now also should always be big enough to show its contents and we now properly explain to users, why emojis might look different on different devices fixing an issue reported via Twitter... There is also a new icon for the room directory (it is now a building, very punny, huh?).</p>

<p>A custom html element, web component, to display the latest messages from a matrix room</p>

<p><code>matrix-room-element</code> -&gt; <code>npm@v0.0.58</code> (GPLv3)</p>
<p><code>&lt;matrix-room-element/&gt;</code> is a web component (vanilla JS/HTML/CSS &amp; distributed un-minified) that can be imported and inserted in any web page, to display the content of a (public, soon with authentication, and private room support) matrix room.</p>

<p>We're trying to make composable components that can be inserted in any web page, and maybe help users use Matrix as a CMS, embedable anywhere (web).

            <p>Hey all, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.62.0">Synapse
1.62</a> is out! Let's
have a look inside.</p>
<h2 id="spam-checker-improvements">Spam checker improvements</h2>
<p>In the past few weeks, the Synapse team has been working with the Matrix.org
Trust &amp; Safety team to help module developers build more efficient protections
against spam. As a consequence of this work, Synapse 1.62 introduces new ways
for modules to communicate the result of actions taken against a specific
message or operation through the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.62/modules/spam_checker_callbacks.html">spam checker module
callbacks</a>.</p>
<p>Previously, most spam checker callbacks would be expected to return a boolean
indicating whether a specific operation should be qualified as spam. Starting
from Synapse 1.62, modules are now expected to return either
<code>synapse.module_api.NOT_SPAM</code> (to indicate an action is not spammy), or an error
code that is part of <code>synapse.module_api.errors.Codes</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the previous behaviour is still supported but is now deprecated, and
will be removed in a future version of Synapse.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.62/upgrade.html#new-signatures-for-spam-checker-callbacks">the upgrade
notes</a>
for a list of the affected callbacks and an example of this change. Note that on
top of the list described there, the <code>check_event_for_spam</code> callback was also
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.62/upgrade.html#new-signature-for-the-spam-checker-callback-check_event_for_spam">updated with a similar
change</a>
in Synapse 1.61.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse includes important performance improvements around
syncing, specifically around handling device lists and notifications.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.62 also introduce a changes of its optional dependency on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-synapse-ldap3">LDAP3
authentication provider
module</a> to
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-synapse-ldap3/releases/tag/v0.2.1">v0.2.1</a>
in order to fix an issue with usernames that include uppercase characters.</p>
