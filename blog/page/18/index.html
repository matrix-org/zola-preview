<h3 id="riot-ios-p2p-demo">Riot iOS P2P Demo</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last couple of weeks I have been working on the next P2P demo, using <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/">Yggdrasil</a> as the transport instead of <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a>. Although libp2p is arguably more featureful in many ways, Yggdrasil does have one major benefit in that it provides full overlay routing. Participants in the network can carry traffic on behalf of other participants, resulting in something much closer to a true mesh network.</p>
<p>The mad science doesn't end there however. I've also built a custom Riot iOS build that includes the full Dendrite P2P demo (yes, that's a homeserver running locally on your phone). If you have an iPhone or iPad, it's available in <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/Tgh2MEk6">public TestFlight right now</a> and you can play with it!</p>
<p>The demo still is very experimental and has a number of bugs still (including but not limited to messages occasionally taking a while to deliver, the app crashing when going into the background sometimes etc.) but we'll be improving it further in the coming weeks and it's quite fun to play with, particularly if you can do so with other people nearby.</p>
<p>Thanks to the same technology that powers AirDrop, the demo will automatically find and connect to other nearby devices running the demo and build up a network automatically - even if you are not on the same Wi-Fi network (or indeed connected to Wi-Fi at all)! If you don't have any other nearby peers to test with then fear not - you can still configure a public static peer in the app settings and join the wider network that way.</p>
<p>With any luck the room directory will even work too, showing published rooms from other nearby devices. If not, try joining <code>#beachparty:b5ae50589e50991dd9dd7d59c5c5f7a4521e8da5b603b7f57076272abc58b374</code> from within the app.</p>

<h3 id="a-new-way-to-test-homeservers-complement">A new way to test homeservers - <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of you know that I work on a Go homeserver called <strong>Dendrite</strong>, and so I've had to get familiar with <strong>SyTest</strong>: a black-box homeserver integration testing project. Unfortunately SyTest has a number of problems: from the dialect of perl, lack of documentation for federation bits, the inability to run a single test, and so on. Having a solid black-box integration testing project is crucial for the ecosystem to ensure spec compliance (and hence compatibility between server implementations) and for making all servers more stable and reliable.</p>
<p>As a side project I've been working on a modern Go rewrite called <strong>Complement</strong> which is now ready for a bit more exposure. It currently only has a handful of SyTests converted but I hope to rapidly expand the number in the coming weeks. Complement makes heavy use of Docker to agnostically run homeservers, and already includes a Dockerfile for configuring a Dendrite instance. To try it out, clone the repo and run:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>(cd dockerfiles &amp;&amp; docker build -t complement-dendrite -f Dendrite.Dockerfile .)
</span><span>
</span><span>COMPLEMENT_BASE_IMAGE=complement-dendrite:latest go test -v ./tests
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you're interested in learning more and maybe adding some tests check out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/blob/master/ONBOARDING.md">ONBOARDING.md</a>.</p>
<p>My overall hope is that Complement will lower the barrier to entry when adding tests by so much that it encourages any bugfix/feature in any homeserver implementation to result in a new test. This will benefit everyone and create a feedback loop which will make Matrix even more reliable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asked about Sytest and SyTS, Kegan added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complement currently implements the same tests as sytest, so tests which pass sytest will pass complement (though that will diverge as complement will guard against more race conditions by default). There's about 9 different kinds of tests currently testing CS-API and Federation (outbound to a dummy server and inbound via a federation client)</p>
<p>The problem with SyTS was that the test tooling around it ultimately wasn't expressive enough. I was using Jest and kept finding myself fighting it by bumping up against issues like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/8751">https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/8751</a> and the multi-process parallelisation stuff was too opaque. The assertion helper functions also lacked context because they rely on behavioural testing names like <code>describe(&quot;foo&quot;) { it(&quot;should say bar&quot;) { ... }</code> etc so when your assertion fails (eg wrong value for a JSON key using assert equals) it just says unhelpfully &quot;foo != bar&quot; where what I really want is to know what it actually does say then, and other contextual info around the object (maybe the key name was typod). When I realised that the assertion lib didn't have this and I'd need to add it, coupled with parallelisation concerns and head-desking against Jest, I found myself wishing I just used something else. I stuck with it though and then realised that all the federation stuff (signature checking, canonical JSON, etc) would need to re-implemented when I knew I had working code in Go. Both of these things combined and I thought &quot;you know what, I'm just going to do this in Go&quot; but you'll note that the architecture is identical, so SyTS lives on as an early prototype for Complement ;)</p>

<p>Last week we had a list of major features still missing. Here's a list of what already works:</p>
<p>Registering, logging in, creating rooms, room visibility, join rules, basic permission management, public room list, inviting, creating DMs, e2e encryption, key backups, device verification, cross signing, notifications, uploading media/files (also user/room avatars), lower-resolution media thumbnails, voip calls and a few other thing's I'm forgetting right now.
So it's useable for non-federating chats already.</p>

<p>In Synapse land this week, we shipped <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/07/08/synapse-1-16-0-released">1.16.0</a> and err <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.16.1">1.16.1</a>. </p>
<p>Lifting from the blog post, the highlights are:-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An important performance fix to improve room state resolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An option to enable e2e by default for new rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to run multiple media repo workers side by side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to mark specific content as being safe from quarantine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bug fixes to make migrating from SQLite to Postgres more reliable - if you are running sqlite for anything other than evaluation purposes then please migrate!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also put out a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.17.0rc1">release candidate</a> for 1.17.0 which all being well we‚Äôll release on Monday. 1.17.0 is really a bug fix release the most notable being finally squashing a long standing bug that caused <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2181">locally rejected invites to get ‚Äòstuck‚Äô client side</a>.</p>
<p>Continuing our matrix.org performance theme, having now got the CS API largely into a good state of responsiveness, we are looking at federation lag. Today we shipped a sharded Federation Reader to matrix.org which has reduced the average lag from seconds to milliseconds. We are just running two currently and are still tuning as we figure out how to get the best from it. Initial impressions seem promising. Watch this space. </p>

<p>We also have a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7798">PR out for review</a> to shard the Federation Sender, which will have much the same effect in the other direction. </p>
<p>Once we have sending messages via the Client-Server API, much reduced federation lag and a sharded Pusher we‚Äôll take a look at room joins.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not much to talk about currently, since I'm breaking my Nheko to replace the entire event store at this moment, but I have some heads up on an annoying bug that I fixed on my branch:</p>
<p>Sometimes we had a weird issue, where Nheko wouldn't load the language the user set on their system. This was especially annoying when I wanted to test a specific language, like Japanese, and I couldn't figure out the right LANG* variables to set the language to Japanese in Nheko. Turns out, this was a bug in Nheko and you wouldn't have guessed so, when looking at the examples in the Qt documentation. Anyway, KDAB wrote a nice blogpost explaining this issue: <a href="https://www.kdab.com/fixing-a-common-antipattern-when-loading-translations-in-qt/">https://www.kdab.com/fixing-a-common-antipattern-when-loading-translations-in-qt/</a></p>
<p>If you are a Qt developer, you may want to check your applications, if you are also affected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I initially implemented end-to-bridge encryption in mautrix-python, I used matrix-nio in a slightly hacky way to get it done quickly. It worked fine in some cases, but also caused some undecryptable messages. I tried switching to using matrix-nio's crypto module directly, but the sans-I/O design made that difficult: there were too many parts that needed to be hooked up to the actual I/O and I wasn't able to find them all. In the end, I just decided to implement the basic e2ee stuff directly in mautrix-python the same way it's implemented in mautrix-go.</p>
<p>All my bridges based on mautrix-python (Telegram, Facebook and Hangouts) have been switched to use the new crypto stuff. After a few initial bugs that are already fixed, it seems to work better than the old system. I'll probably add native e2ee to maubot soon too, which is my last main project that's still missing e2ee.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@stephen:m.scd31.com">Stephen D</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a pretty simple Matrix bot in Rust which is loosely based on Cat Disruptor 6000. It will react with üêàÔ∏è to any message containing the string &quot;cat&quot; *. Since it is a small project, I hope it can be used as an example for other people interested in writing Matrix bots in Rust. It implements several important features (crypto/device store, auto-accepting invites, crafting custom events, etc.) You can host it yourself, or you can try it out by inviting the user &quot;@catdisruptor:m.scd31.com&quot; to your room! <a href="https://git.scd31.com/stephen/cat-disruptor-7000">https://git.scd31.com/stephen/cat-disruptor-7000</a></p>
<p>* Cat Disruptor 6000 does not do this (it is used for disrupting monologues with cat pictures). However, many instances of Cat Disruptor 6000 also include a separate bot, which is what Cat Disruptor 7000 is mimicking.</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.16.0 is here!</p>
<p>Notable additions in 1.16.0 include:-</p>
<ul>
<li>An important performance fix to improve room state resolution.</li>
<li>An option to enable e2e by default for new rooms.</li>
<li>Ability to run multiple media repo workers side by side.</li>
<li>Ability to mark specific content as being safe from quarantine.</li>
<li>Bug fixes to make migrating from SQLite to Postgres more reliable - if you are running sqlite for anything other than evaluation purposes then please migrate!</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, we have deprecated the <code>m.login.jwt</code> login method in favour of <code>org.matrix.login.jwt</code> see the changelog for more details.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>Get the new releases from any of the usual sources mentioned at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md. 1.16.0 is on github <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.16.0">here</a>.</p>
<p>Changelog for 1.16.0 follows:</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-16-0-2020-07-08">Synapse 1.16.0 (2020-07-08)</h1>
<p>No significant changes since 1.16.0rc2.</p>
<p>Note that this release deprecates the <code>m.login.jwt</code> login method, renaming it to <code>org.matrix.login.jwt</code>, as <code>m.login.jwt</code> is not part of the Matrix spec. Otherwise the behaviour is identical. Synapse will accept both names for now, but this may change in a future release.</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-16-0rc2-2020-07-02">Synapse 1.16.0rc2 (2020-07-02)</h1>
<p>Synapse 1.16.0rc2 includes the security fixes released with Synapse 1.15.2.

<blockquote>
<p>This week has seen some new architectural changes and a number of bugs fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new Current State Server component has been added, which tracks room state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Public Rooms API has been deprecated in favour of the Current State Server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event size limits are now honoured with the correct return code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invites have seen some refactoring and retiring invites should work better now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federation sender now persists unsent PDUs to the database and will automatically retry when Dendrite is restarted, making resend behaviour much more reliable (particularly in the P2P demos)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some room checks in <code>/state</code> and <code>/state_ids</code> have been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some additional restrictions have been added to <code>/send</code> and we now return the correct error codes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where current state was incorrectly used when getting missing/backfill events has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where you couldn't rejoin a room that you created after wiping your database has been fixed</p>

<p>Did you ever have the issue that a media event sent from someone is too large for your HS and you don't want to fiddle with the link?</p>
<p>IPFS Bot might be a solution. Invite @ipfs:nordgedanken.dev or Check out <a href="https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-ipfs-bot/">https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-ipfs-bot/</a> to use the bot.</p>
<p>If you reply to any media event with <code>!ipfs</code> the bot will send you a link to the media stored on ipfs.</p>
<p>Known issues are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>E2EE not yet working (It joins but can't yet decrypt the related event)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Error handling is basically not existent. Therefore crashes might happen until I sort this out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It currently does very verbose logging. This will be removed when the bot is more stable</p>

<p>Improved UX for room title editor</p>

<li>
<p>Currently, conflicting text will be displayed, but conflicts will not be indicated in any way</p>

<li>
<p>I almost forgot to mention: The room list is now filtered using the typed rooms MSC (event ID <code>org.matrix.msc1840</code>). #test-document0:kb1rd.net is a room with that state event set.</p>

<p>I also made a flame graph of the internal algorithm and I'm surprised by some of the results. The good thing is that I think there's quite a few ways to speed up the algorithm. Here it is:</p>

            <p>Folks, today we are releasing Synapse 1.15.2, which is a security release which contains fixes to two separate problems. We are also putting out the second release candidate for the forthcoming Synapse 1.16, including the same fixes.</p>
<p>Firstly, we have fixed a bug in the implementation of the room state resolution algorithm which could cause users to be unexpectedly ejected from rooms (Synapse issue <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7742">#7742</a>).</p>
<p>Secondly, we have improved the security of pages served as part of the Single-Sign-on login flows to prevent clickjacking attacks. Thank you to <a href="https://sandhose.fr/">Quentin Gliech</a> for reporting this.</p>
<p>We are not aware of either of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild, but we recommend that administrators upgrade as soon as possible. Those on Synapse 1.15.1 or earlier should upgrade to Synapse 1.15.2, while those who have already upgraded to Synapse 1.16.0rc1 should upgrade to 1.16.0rc2.</p>
<p>Get the new releases from any of the usual sources mentioned at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md. 1.15.2 is on github <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.15.2">here</a>, and 1.16.0rc2 is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.16.0rc2">here</a>.</p>
<p>Changelog for 1.15.2 follows:</p>
<h2 id="synapse-1-15-2-2020-07-02">Synapse 1.15.2 (2020-07-02)</h2>
<p>Due to the two security issues highlighted below, server administrators are
encouraged to update Synapse. We are not aware of these vulnerabilities being
exploited in the wild.</p>
<h3 id="security-advisory">Security advisory</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A malicious homeserver could force Synapse to reset the state in a room to a
small subset of the correct state. This affects all Synapse deployments which
federate with untrusted servers. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/96e9afe62500310977dc3cbc99a8d16d3d2fa15c">96e9afe6</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTML pages served via Synapse were vulnerable to clickjacking attacks. This
predominantly affects homeservers with single-sign-on enabled, but all server
administrators are encouraged to upgrade.  (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/ea26e9a98b0541fc886a1cb826a38352b7599dbe">ea26e9a9</a>)</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</a></p>

<h4 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h4>
<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, unfortunately our three MSCs from last week ( <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2366">MSC2366</a> (verification flows), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2403">MSC2403</a> (knocking), and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2630">MSC2630</a> (SAS security)) are still pre-FCP. Most of the team has been quite busy with implementation for the past few weeks. Instead of advertising those 3 MSCs again, we're going to switch the focus to &quot;implementation&quot; for a bit until we're freed up again.</p>
<p>So the focus for this week is: MSC implementation work. However, this should not discourage any MSC authors from responding to MSC feedback in the meantime üôÇ</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week in the ruma/matrix Google Summer of Code project, ruma-events was made ready for use! After adding stripped and sync event generation to the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/commit/fdf87a38a219933ffe99b17baf87841a79702f28"><code>event_enum!</code> macro</a> there were only a few small tweaks needed to try it out in some dependent rust crates. I spent a few days converting <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/63">matrix-rust-sdk</a> to use the ruma-monorepo. Since ruma is used on both client and server-side, I also opened a PR to update <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit/pulls/133">Conduit</a>, a homeserver implementation written in Rust. To test that everything worked together, I updated <a href="https://github.com/DevinR528/rumatui/commit/1ae8776f9a59c297c8c9b2287f7c830ab67302b1">rumatui</a>, my command-line client written in rust.</p>
<p>Then I could test that Conduit sent, and matrix-rust-sdk received the new ruma events successfully. While updating, I felt the pain of not having accessor methods for the <code>Any*Event</code> enums to get at the event fields held within. I have opened a <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/97">pull request</a> to add the generation of these methods to the <code>event_enums!</code> macro. Hopefully, the Conduit and matrix-sdk PR's will be merged and the ruma monorepo can be tested in the wild!</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has been mainly about testing to ensure that all the progress over the past few months is kept up-to-date and correct. We've also added a few features in order to get certain sytests working. To that end:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Invites can now be declined over federation and they will be reflected in <code>/sync</code> responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Errors encountered when joining a room over federation are now sent back to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Errors encountered when accepting an invite over federation are now sent back to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite will now check server names meet the server name grammar in the specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug which caused <code>client-api-proxy</code> to not actually proxy correctly has been fixed, thanks @fantashley !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/send</code> now abides by the limits in the specification: 50 PDUs / 100 EDUs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The docker-compose scripts now include <code>appservice_api</code>, thanks @fantashley !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending invites over federation will now fall back to v1 if v2 fails with a 404.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now implements <code>room.timeline.limit</code> completely (in both in-line and stored filter formats).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now sets the <code>limited</code> flag on <code>/sync</code> responses correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we now have support for collecting code coverage output from SyTest. This indicates we are testing roughly 70% of the Dendrite codebase. The remaining 30% are hard to reach via integration tests (e.g database failures, communication problems between internal APIs).</p>
<p>Spec compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 45%, up from 40% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 50%, up from 38% last week</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In total, we've made an additional 45 sytests pass this week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey all, I've got several releases to talk about this week!</p>
<p>First, <code>matrix-appservice-slack</code> has been updated to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/1.4.0">1.4.0</a> with several quality of life changes such as automatically setting the bot profile on startup, supporting logging out of slack accounts and adding a health checkpoint. There are also quite a few bugfixes so make sure you update.</p>
<p><code>matrix-appservice-irc</code> was also bumped to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.18.0">0.18.0</a> with the headline features being Node 14.x support.</p>
<p>We've also shipped <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.19.0-rc1">0.19.0-rc1</a> which has stopped support for Node 10.x. Why? Because we're adding worker support to the bridge! This release starts to make use of the new(ish) <code>worker_threads</code> feature so that we can dish out processing to separate threads (running their own UV event loops, for node enthusiasts). The first thing to be workerized is metrics, so that metrics may still be reported should the bridge become saturated, but we plan to split out more work as things progress.</p>
<p>Finally <code>matrix-appservice-bridge</code> got a few fixes to support our new worker land, as well as being updated to support <code>matrix-js-sdk</code> 6.0.0. You can checkout the changes for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/1.13.1">1.13.1 here</a>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug which cause some clients like fluffychat to break in E2EE rooms (we accidentally sent a null relation when not replying...)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue, where Nheko didn't verify the format of html formatted messages correctly, causing it to render messages in a way which wasn't compliant to the spec.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@florian:dsn.tm.kit.edu">Florian</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/">We</a> published another scientific paper on Matrix, this time it is called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3381991.3395399">Matrix Decomposition: Analysis of an Access Control Approach on Transaction-based DAGs without Finality</a>!
Its main topic is the question of how access control can work based on a structure that only provides a partial order on events and no consensus on the current state, i.e. the Matrix Event Graph. We found some concrete, non-critical security issues related to both incorrect specification  as well as divergent homeserver behaviour. While the last remaining mitigations found their way into Synapse 1.14.0, we provide ideas on structural solutions to avoid both problem classes in the future using formal verification.</p>
<p>The paper was published at the <a href="http://www.sacmat.org/2020/index.php">ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies(SACMAT)</a> last week.
My talk went well (üéâ), it was recording and is yet to be published by the conference.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has seen a lot of work put into fixing broken tests and refactoring parts of the codebase.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The media API has had quite a bit of attention this week and now media over federation works properly, as well as much better filename handling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new user API component is now responsible for user accounts, devices, access tokens and account data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server key API has been updated with more reliable validity checking and new tests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logging into Dendrite using Riot iOS is now supported thanks to some minor tweaks/fixes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>URL handling for version 3 rooms has been improved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug in the format of <code>/v1/send_join</code> has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/joined_members</code> response has now been fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to that, we've made good progress on embedding the Dendrite-powered Yggdrasil demo into Riot iOS, which we'll hopefully be demoing in a couple of weeks!</p>
<p>Spec compliance has improved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 40%, up from 36% last week</p>

<p>Highlights this week</p>
<ul>
<li>We released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/16/synapse-1-15-1-released">1.15.1</a>, this is a bug fix release, sorry if you were bitten.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changelog-in-full">Changelog in full</h4>
<p>Bugfixes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug introduced in v1.15.0 that would crash Synapse on start when using certain password auth providers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug introduced in v1.15.0 which meant that some 3PID management endpoints were not accessible on the correct URL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implemented unread message counts (MSC 2625) - This is part of the a more general notifications improvement project in conjunction with the Riot teams. The aim being to make Notifications easier to configure. We‚Äôve also been working on push rule definitions for the default behaviour. More on that next week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have the ability to shard the media repository worker. This means we can now run an arbitrary number in parallel, thereby improving upload reliability and performance, we are running this on Matrix.org. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-enabled Jaeger on matrix.org - previously we needed to switch it off due to the performance overhead, we needed a few tweaks but now it is working well and helping us to determine the cause of slow requests. It seems like the HTTP requests between the event creator  and event persister workers can sometimes be slow - we are not sure of the cause yet, we are working on it but it will mean further performance improvements to message sending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next up performance wise is working on sharding the federation sender to improve federation lag. We‚Äôll also try replacing simplejson with stdlib json which seems to be much faster at dumps nowadays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we‚Äôve fixed a bug that meant that quarantining media would from time to time include quarantining sticker packs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other interesting bugs</p>
<p>We fixed a spec compliance bug in fetching remote media raised by our pals in Dendrite-land. We fixed a bug causing federation .well-known requests to fail due to not including the user-agent header. We removed references to six (thanks @ilmari) and finally, fixed a bug that caused stream id to go backwards on the replication stream.</p>
<p>Next week we‚Äôll continue to work on notifications and performance. You can track our progress here <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8</a></p>

<li>
<p>I started working on SSSS and online key backup support. For this I wrote my own base64 and base58 encoders.

</blockquote>
<p>From the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reactions
<ul>
<li>React to a message with an emoji! üéâ</li>
<li>Reactions are shown below a message in a small bubble with a counter.</li>
<li>By clicking on that, others can add to the reaction count.</li>
<li>It may help you celebrating a new Nheko Release or react with a üëé to a failed build to express your frustration.</li>
<li>This uses a new emoji picker. The picker will be improved in the near future (better scrolling, sections, favorites, recently used or similar) and then probably replace the current picker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support for tagging rooms [tag]
<ul>
<li>Assign custom tags to rooms from the context menu in the room list.</li>
<li>This allows filtering rooms via the group list. This puts you in a focus mode showing only the selected tags.</li>
<li>You can assign multiple tags to group rooms however you like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SSO Login
<ul>
<li>With this you can now login on servers, that only provide SSO.</li>
<li>Just enter any mxid on the server. Nheko will figure out that you need to use SSO and redirect your browser to the login page.</li>
<li>Complete the login in your browser and Nheko should automatically log you in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Presence
<ul>
<li>Shows online status of the people you are talking to.</li>
<li>You can define a custom status message to tell others what you are currently up to.</li>
<li>The status message appears next to the usernames in the timeline.</li>
<li>Your server needs to have presence enabled for this to work.</li>

<p>after a couple of setbacks that didn't let us to make the releases earlier, the Quotient project has finally made two new releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GTAD (the piece of code magically producing readable C++ code from a Swagger API description) has achieved version 0.7 (https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad/releases/tag/v0.7.0) adding a few tricks in order to make...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...libQuotient 0.6 beta2 (https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.6-beta2) rely entirely on the upstream matrix-doc specification, rather than a soft fork closely following the main sources! From now on it's &quot;upstream first&quot;, in a sense that the original matrix-doc will be used to build Quotient codebase. Let's see how often it breaks ;)
In other news from the last few weeks:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some housekeeping and deprecation work in the API has been done in preparation to getting User Interactive Authentication along the next (post-0.6) release cycle of libQuotient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>also thanks to the updated code generator, the CS API code has been optimised, consolidating more code in the header files and making data deserialisation lazy; this helped significantly reduce compilation times, and runtime performance also improved a bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the number of configurations tested by CI has been extended, allowing to chase down a few more bugs that managed to go under the radar before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when used with new enough Qt, CBOR is used to cache data locally - entirely transparently for clients.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect more news in the coming weeks, including continued work on matrix: URI proposal and its implementation in Quotient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ever since <code>m.room.aliases</code> was replaced with <code>alt_aliases</code>, there hasn't really been any way to find aliases on other servers, since most room admins don't bother finding and publishing alternate aliases. To help solve that problem, I made a maubot plugin to let users publish alternate aliases in rooms: <a href="https://github.com/maubot/altalias">https://github.com/maubot/altalias</a></p>
<p>By default it lets users publish aliases with the same localpart as any already published alias. If that behavior is sufficient, you can simply invite it to a room and give it permissions to send <code>m.room.canonical_alias</code> events. Alternatively, it can be configured to allow aliases that match specific regexes.</p>
<p>Once it's set up, users can create a local alias and use <code>!altalias publish &lt;their alias&gt;</code> to publish it. The bot will make sure the alias points to the right room, check that the localpart is allowed and then add it to <code>alt_aliases</code>.</p>
<p>I have it running at @alias:maunium.net and I've added it to all my rooms already. Other rooms are also free to use that instance.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Regular readers of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix/">TWIM</a> may be familiar with the <a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/english/index.php">Decentralized Systems and Network Services Research Group</a> at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, who have been busy over the last few years analysing Matrix from an independent academic point of view.  The work started in 2018 with Florian Jacob‚Äôs <a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/matrix/traveller/explained.html">DSN Traveler</a> spidering project, resulting in the <a href="https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000100364">Glimpse of the Matrix</a> paper analysing Matrix‚Äôs scale and room/server distribution (at least as it was back then).</p>
<p>Last week, they released an entirely new paper: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3381991.3395399">Matrix Decomposition: Analysis of an Access Control Approach on Transaction-based DAGs without Finality</a> by Florian Jacob, Luca Becker, Jan Grash√∂fer and Hannes Hartenstein, presented at <a href="https://www.sacmat.org/2020/index.php">ACM SACMAT ‚Äò20</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the new paper is an absolutely fascinating deep dive analysis into <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">State Resolution v2</a> - the algorithm at the heart of Matrix which defines how servers merge together their potentially conflicting copies of a given room, such that everyone ends up eventually with a consistent view‚Ä¶ even in the face of bad actors. This means that Matrix effectively implements a decentralised access control system - ensuring that users stay banned, and only users with permission can ban, etc.  You can see the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/img/SACMAT_2020_Talk_Matrix_Decomposition.pdf">slides</a> below, and read the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3381991.3395399">full paper</a> here. The video of Florian‚Äôs talk from SACMAT should be published shortly.</p>
<br/>
<p><object data="https://matrix.org/blog/img/SACMAT_2020_Talk_Matrix_Decomposition.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="1024" height="768"></object></p>
<br/>
<p>To give some context from the Matrix side: designing and implementing State Resolution v2 back in 2018 was a bit of a mission. Our original v1 implementation had some bugs which meant that the result of the merge could unexpectedly favour historical state over the current state (so called ‚Äòstate resets‚Äô) - thus giving an attacker a way to maliciously revert the state of the room.  In v2 we thought much more carefully about the algorithm, considering state present in one version of the room but not the other as a conflict, separating and applying access control events from regular events, and adding additional ordering of the state in the room by considering events in the context of their authorisation chain (the ‚Äòauth DAG‚Äô).  The end result is that we feel confident in v2 State Res, and we haven‚Äôt seen any problems with it in the wild since we shipped it in July 2018.</p>
<p>However: state resolution is not intuitive at first - for instance, when you merge two versions of a room together, you treat the state events as unordered sets‚Ä¶ even though they are ordered in the context of the room DAG.  The reason is that state res needs to work even if you don‚Äôt have a copy of the whole room DAG (otherwise you‚Äôd have to download way too much data to participate in a large room).  Another example is the sequence in which orderings are then applied to the state events - and how that interacts with re-authorising those events, to stop malicious ones creeping in.  In the core team, we‚Äôve end up describing it several different ways to try to help folks understand: first Erik‚Äôs original <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/state_res_msc/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">MSC1442</a>, then uhoreg‚Äôs <a href="https://matrix.uhoreg.ca/stateres/reloaded.html">literary Haskell implementation</a>, then the terse reference version in <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v2">the Spec</a> itself, and most recently Neil Alexander‚Äôs <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/implementing-stateres">State Resolution v2 for the Hopelessly Unmathematical</a>.</p>
<p>As a result we are <strong>very</strong> excited and happy that Florian and the DSN team have now published the first ever independent in-depth analysis of the algorithm, particularly in the context of decentralised access control (i.e. enforcing bans, power levels, etc).  We‚Äôre pleasantly surprised that apparently ‚ÄúTo the best of our knowledge, Matrix is the only system that implements access control based on an eventually consistent partial order without finality and without a consensus algorithm‚Äù.</p>
<p>Even better, the DSN team found some remaining thinkos in Synapse‚Äôs implementation and the Matrix specification, which could have caused resolution results to diverge from other implementations, specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>we weren‚Äôt enforcing integers in JSON to be within range [-2<sup>53</sup>+1, 2<sup>53</sup>-1], fixed in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7381">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7381</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/clokep/json-validation-room-ver/proposals/2540-stricter-event-validation.md">MSC2540</a></li>
<li>we forgot to include the notification field when authing power level events, fixed in  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7501">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7501</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lucavb/matrix-doc/blob/master/proposals/2209-auth-rules-other-keys-in-m.room.power.levels.md">MSC2209</a> (thanks to Luca from DSN for the MSC!)</li>
<li>we forgot to spec the limit that one should apply to the number of parents of an event in the DAG (fixed in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2538">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2538</a>)</li>
<li>we missed that moderators could set server ACLs which could let them undermine room admins (fixed in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6834">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6834</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these have now been fixed in Synapse and the latest versions of the spec (room v6), and we‚Äôd like to sincerely thank Florian and Luca for rapidly and responsibly disclosing the issues to us.  In other words: this research is directly improving Matrix, and it‚Äôs even more exciting that the stated future work for the DSN team is to work on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">formal verification</a> for the security of Matrix‚Äôs authorisation rules and state resolution.  This stuff is tough, as anyone who‚Äôs played with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA%2B">TLA<sup>+</sup></a> will know, and we are incredibly glad that the research community is helping out to formalise and hopefully prove that State Res v2 is as good as we think it is.</p>
<p>We should stress that DSN‚Äôs work is completely independent of The Matrix.org Foundation or anyone else building on the protocol; we‚Äôre just writing about it here because we think it‚Äôs incredibly cool and deserves the attention of the whole Matrix ecosystem.</p>
<p>Thanks again to Florian and the team - we look forward to seeing what comes next!</p>

<p>Implementing end-to-end encryption for go-neb turns out to be a lot easier than expected thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix">https://github.com/tulir/mautrix</a> library, which contains out of the box e2ee support!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first week of GSoC was spent switching go-neb's usage of gomatrix for mautrix, which was easy as the latter is a fork of the former. This caused a pretty big PR that touched most of go-neb's files, although the changes were simple and easy to review. The PR was merged shortly after into go-neb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the second week, it was time to add some basic e2ee support to go-neb. This was complicated slightly due to the bot's ability to create multiple clients and its treatment of /sync responses, however in the end e2ee is now working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code is still of course a mess and session keys are often lost in the void. The code will be cleaned up and tested further next week, bugs will be (hopefully) fixed and another PR will be submitted to go-neb then to officially add e2ee support!</p>

<p>From <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@arnav-t:matrix.org">arnav-t</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrix has enormous potential to be used in many different use cases be it embedded chat rooms, comments section, chat boxes, etc. This project aims to fill that niche by providing an easy to use and easy to deploy client for users to embed on their webpages.<br />
The client would mesh well wherever it is embedded by providing a <code>postMessage</code> interface to allow the parent webpage to interact with the client and dynamically modify it whenever needed (For example:-  A comments section that is always the same theme as its parent webpage).</p>
<h4 id="features">Features</h4>
<p>As of now, the following features have been added (with more on the way)</p>
<ul>
<li>List of joined rooms that can be selected </li>
<li>Live room timeline events</li>
<li>Support for image-based messages</li>
<li>Message composer and ability to send messages to a room</li>
<li>Dark and light themes for the client</li>
<li>Changeable highlight colors</li>
<li>Toggleable room header, room timeline, and message composer components</li>
<li><code>postMessage</code> interface for sending commands from the parent window</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, I'm working on adding more options to the <code>postMessage</code> interface as well as adding more interactivity to the client itself.</p>

<p>Ruma is a Rust project to create a comprehensive set of APIs for Matrix. Previously there was a Ruma homeserver project.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@devinr528:matrix.org">devinr528</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in ruma-events' Google Summer of Code project, I was able to finish the macros needed to generate the event content enums and trait implementations required for events. I started by defining the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/107">generic event structs</a> (state, message, etc.) and manually writing the <code>Serialize</code> and <code>Deserialize</code> implementations. Over the next few days, this was moved into a custom derive macro called <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/108"><code>Event</code></a>. The derive now implements all necessary traits with appropriate bounds, so a <code>StateEvent&lt;C&gt;</code> can not contain any ephemeral event content and so forth. I have removed the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/111"><code>raw</code></a> mod and related <code>FromRaw</code> and <code>TryFromRaw</code> traits, moving the validation into the deserialization and constructor for the few types that needed it. On the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/106">event content</a> side of things, a function like procedural macro was used to allow declaring the enum using Matrix event type identifiers.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span>event_content_enum! {

<p>Much of this week's work has been maintenance-related with refactoring, cleaning up etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Key fetching/expiry behaviour has been fixed, improving the reliability of federation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The monolith and component setup has now been refactored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of unused internal APIs have now been removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other internal roomserver APIs have been streamlined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also started building an <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io">Yggdrasil</a>-powered P2P demo (as opposed to the previous demos built using libp2p) and even includes support for embedding Riot Web in the single binary. It's not very stable/usable yet but there will be more news on that to follow within the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>We have also started building and releasing Docker images for Dendrite on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixdotorg/dendrite">Docker Hub</a> for those who want to use Docker to test Dendrite deployment.</p>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged from last week:</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome back! This week I focused my efforts on better error handling. My goal was that every problem would be forwarded to the client (e.g. InternalServerError response) and also be logged. Yesterday I merged the <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit/pulls/116/files">giant PR this resulted in</a>. Hopefully this will make Conduit easier to debug in the future.</p>
<p>Here are some other things I finished this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>User-interactive authentication (e.g. you need to type your password again if you want to delete devices)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Config option to disable registration</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also found the problem with Riot not showing notifications for new messages and created <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/14000">a bug report</a>. With a few tweaks, I managed to solve this on my account and now mentions, DMs and more play the notification sound (it also works on Riot X!). </p>
<p>@gnieto fixed a bug that prevented Riot from loading history when you join a room and @PublicByte implemented the /whoami endpoint.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from that we continue out push towards improving performance both in terms of sharding workers but also improving tools to manage disk space usage. Specifically this week and next we are looking at db tuning and sharding the media repo worker. We are also noticing that the typing handler is chewing more CPU than would be expected. It could be a good candidate for moving away from the master process.</p>
<p>More broadly we are changing the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5745">defaults for notifications</a> and making changes to support a more general overhaul of notifications.</p>
<p>Finally we are looking at how to not only delete messages after a certain time period, but also how to delete the associated media (which becomes difficult when considering e2e content along side long lived content such as avatars and sticker packs).</p>
<p>For more detail on what is coming next, take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">public task board</a>.</p>

<p>Since <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2190">MSC2190</a> and the related Synapse PR aren't moving much, all my bridges now generate appservice registration files with the workaround. The workaround is needed to avoid patching synapse or using other hacks, and I decided to enable it by default as many people had problems related to having to apply it manually.</p>
<p>The WhatsApp, Facebook and Hangouts bridges now have an option to use double puppeting to disable notifications when backfilling. It can be useful if you want to copy chat history to Matrix, but don't want to be spammed with hundreds of notifications while it's happening.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@eric:nova.chat">eric</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introducing <a href="https://nova.chat/">NovaChat</a> - a desktop chat client that supports 9+ different chat networks, built on top of Matrix. Think of it as a modern Adium/Trillian.</p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>NovaChat is a system with three parts designed to work together:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a new <a href="https://gitlab.com/nova/nova-web">desktop client</a>, based on Riot-web</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a federating homeserver (nova.chat)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a set of Matrix bridges configured to run on a private server called a <a href="https://gitlab.com/nova/bridgebox">bridgebox</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Matrix bridges are awesome but generally require you to run own homeserver. NovaChat removes that restriction, without sacrificing security and privacy. Your remote chat network credentials never leave your bridgebox, and messages are encrypted* on the bridgebox before being sent to the NovaChat homeserver.</p>
<p>*Encryption is currently enabled on Telegram/FB/Hangouts/Whatsapp bridges, mx-puppet-bridges coming shortly)</p>
<p><em>Very rough system diagram:</em></p>
<p><code>&gt; NovaChat desktop client &lt;&gt; NovaChat homeserver &lt;&gt; bridgebox &lt;&gt; remote chat networks</code></p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fancy new UI, heavily inspired by Telegram. See photo below or <a href="https://app.tella.tv/story/ckar1ock0000007mi7x5t3qdn">see it in action</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy graphical bridge set up (no more fiddling with config files)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliable bridging, with delivery confirmations and bridge disconnect warnings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes 8 pre-configured bridges: Facebook/Whatsapp/Hangouts/Telegram/Slack/Instagram/Twitter/Skype. Planning to add more soon, or submit a PR!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Works on Mac OS, Linux and Windows</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't need to be technical to use NovaChat, it's designed to Just WorkTM. If you need help setting up a bridgebox, we are offering hosting and maintenance for USD $5 per month.</p>
<p>The vast majority of this software has been created by the talented tulir and dm0141. I personally am a terrible coder (you can tell which parts I did), but I do have experience building products and teams, and I'm excited to begin working in the Matrix universe. I wrote recently about how I believe Matrix is the <a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/the-universal-communication-bus-42dfb9a141ad">Universal Communication Bus</a>! Thanks goes to Sorunome for creating the mx-puppet-bridges!</p>

<p>This week, we continued to iterate on the implementation of the new push notification service thanks to user feedbacks. Those feedbacks also show that the app uses less battery.</p>
<p>On login, this is now possible to recover your cross-signing and your key backup from your recovery passphrase or key.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the work this past week was on ruma-events, for more on that see the GSoC section! Devin got far enough with that so we now know it all works out and can replace the previous ruma-events API. When that was clear, ruma-events was also merged into our new <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">monorepo</a>; now the only remaining crate to be merged is ruma-client (where I'm also waiting for some pending changes).</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.15.0 release day folks.</p>
<p>We continue our push to improve performance across the board. Factoring out event persistence into a separate worker pointed the way to a host of small but collectively important improvements. Expect further changes in coming releases.</p>
<p>Aside from that the admin API continues to grow (this time device management) and we have improved device list syncing to aid e2ee reliability.</p>
<p>We are receiving an increasing number of high quality PRs from the community, please keep them coming. Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cg505">cg505</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WGH">WGH</a>, <a href="https://github.com/olof">olof</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ilmari">ilmari</a></p>
