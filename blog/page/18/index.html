<h3 id="dendrite-gomatrixserverlib">Dendrite / gomatrixserverlib</h3>
<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.11">Dendrite 0.3.11</a>, and since then we have merged a significant number of appservice fixes to <code>master</code> which will go into the next release. With these, bridges should stand a much better chance of working with Dendrite.</p>
<p>Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Events are now properly sent to interested appservices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appservice namespace exclusivity is now respected properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users starting with <code>_</code> can now be registered by appservices correctly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room alias queries for appservices have been improved and should work now</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also upgraded a number of dependencies.</p>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 60%, up from 56% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 82%, up from 80% last week</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, please feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for general Dendrite chat, and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite-dev:matrix.org">#dendrite-dev:matrix.org</a> if you are interested in contributing!</p>

<p>Spec compliance is really progressing!</p>
<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've heard some feedback that Synapse's release cadence‚Äîan RC every other week, with releases in between‚Äîcan feel a bit overwhelming. In response, I'm going to try to write a little less about each RC and instead simply refer to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.29.0rc1">1.29.0rc1 Release Notes</a> from yesterday.</p>
<p>We'll shout a bit more when that matures into a formal release early next week. üôÇ</p>
<p>On non-release weeks I'll try to spend a little more time focusing on the behind-the-scenes aspects of developing Synapse in our TWiM updates. If there's anything in particular you'd like hear about, let me know!</p>
<p>Speaking of, we're experimenting with using GitHub Discussions for... discussions.</p>
<p>We don't want to go full-on mailing list, but it might be nice to have a place to for slower, asynchronous conversations that don't quite fit into the more rapid pace of a typical Matrix room.</p>
<p>Our first two discussion topics ask about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/discussions/9553">Your experiences with GitHub Discussions</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/discussions/9554">How Synapse could be better</a></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A PSA this time around. Please test this release and update as soon as you can when we go to release on Monday next week. We've included a change to correct how users are registered against the homeserver to comply with the spec (Synapse accepts a /register call without a <code>type=m.login.application</code>, and versions 2.5.0 and below of the matrix-appservice-bridge sent these invalid requests). I'm hoping to eventually retire this behaviour from Synapse, so the more people that upgrade the better!</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9548">this PR</a> is the Synapse-side change to remove this behaviour. If your appservice implementation uses this behaviour, <strong>please</strong> chime in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mentioned a while back that I've put Element Web on IPFS.</p>
<p>Since then, I unfortunately had to change its DNSLink domain, so I decided to post about it again, with the new addresses and some minor updates. Here are the former:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ipns://element-web.0x1a8510f2.space/</code> (Main DNSLink address)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ipns://k2k4r8mx8muu913j5oy3e4zvt77xtks8xgxuamlv0ltzwx95lcgk2glw</code> (IPNS hash which the above address points to)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ipfs://bafybeievxs6qzzbfbn6xcbz3xwxhjzxkffjbpwbcc3gikrac6ytqkkutva</code> (IPFS hash of the current snapshot of the above)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other news, I've updated Element on IPFS to v1.7.22 and made a tiny script to easily update it in future. In case it's of use to anyone, it's right here:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>
</span><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span>
</span><span>if [ &quot;$#&quot; -ne 2 ]; then
</span><span>
</span><span>        echo -e &quot;Invalid number of arguments (got $# but 2 required)!\nUsage: $0 &lt;element web folder&gt; &lt;release tag to download&gt;&quot; &gt;&amp;2
</span><span>        exit 1
</span><span>
</span><span>fi
</span><span>
</span><span>wget -c &quot;https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/releases/download/$2/element-$2.tar.gz&quot; -O - | tar --overwrite --strip-components=1 -xzv -C $1 element-$2
</span><span>
</span><span>ipfs add -r -p $1
</span><span>
</span><span>echo &quot;Now use: &#39;ipfs name publish -key=&lt;publish key&gt; &lt;folder ID&gt;&#39; to publish on IPFS&quot;

<p>I am very excited to launch Cactus Comments (https://cactus.chat) today together with @asbjorn:olli.ng!</p>
<p>Cactus Comments is a federated, web-embeddable comment system. And of course, we federate by building on Matrix!</p>
<p>On the frontend - your website - we embed a Matrix client written in Elm that renders Matrix rooms as comment sections. The client is designed to be especially easy to embed on static sites. Once you log in to the client, it will only communicate directly with your Matrix server of choice.</p>
<p>On the backend, an application service is used to create rooms on-demand and help with moderation. It is built with Python and is completely stateless. It does this by modelling all state in native Matrix objects without any custom events!</p>
<p>The entire thing is free and open source software and we would love it if you were to contribute. We really hope some of you will give it a try!</p>

<p>With things on the Internet vanishing, I've been wanting to start saving copies of interesting web pages and videos to my server-at-home.</p>
<p>This really doesn't involve much more than just running <code>youtube-dl</code> or <code>archivebox</code> on the relevant URLs, but I needed a better way than having to e-mail myself reminders to download things‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I decided to make <a href="https://bics.ga/reivilibre/matrix_queue_proc">Matrix Queue Processor</a>.</p>
<p>You can run it occasionally (or set it up to run in a cron job!) and it will then read all outstanding messages and feed the text to a given command, such as <code>youtube-dl</code>.</p>
<p>You can choose for it to delete processed messages, or tick them off (‚úÖ). If the command wasn't successful, it will instead reply with the exit code.</p>
<p>It's not particularly sophisticated but it might at least be a small starting point for anyone who wanted to make something similar, and it is end-to-end encryption capable because it uses the Python <code>matrix-nio</code> SDK.</p>
<p>See this example of use with <code>youtube-dl</code>; it fails on the second message because it's not a video page URL:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In layman's terms, we showed that the Event Graph provides a strong form of eventual consistency even when new events are applied in arbitrary order. In addition, this consistency guarantee can still be povided even if all other servers in a room are malicious, which is unexpected compared to the honest majority required for the usual Distributed Ledger Technology. We also looked at the problem of ‚ÄúIf servers randomly select at which parents at the bottom of the Event Graph they append new events, and the number of parents for an event is limited, how can you be sure that the Event Graph does not grow arbitrarily wide?‚Äú, which is something that puzzled me since the beginning of my Ph.D. two years ago. It is easy simulate a given setup and see that the width shrinks really fast, but it is also easy to see that arbitrary growth has a likelihood larger than zero. As this was astonishingly hard to grasp mathematically, we were very happy that we could recruit <a href="https://www.math.kit.edu/stoch/~henze/">Prof. Dr. Norbert Henze from the Institute of Stochastics</a> as co-author to provide evidence that you can expect the Event Graph to shrink to a normal width quite quickly.</p>
<p>Let me quote parts of the abstract for some more technical details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[‚Ä¶] By comparison with traditional decentralized communication systems, Matrix replaces pure message passing with a replicated data structure. This data structure, which we extract and call the Matrix Event Graph (MEG), depicts the causal history of messages. We show that this MEG represents an interesting and important replicated data type for decentralized applications that are based on causal histories of publish-subscribe events: First, we prove that the MEG is a Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type for causal histories and, thus, provides Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC). With SEC being among the best known achievable trade-offs in the scope of the well-known CAP theorem, the MEG provides a powerful consistency guarantee while being available during network partition. Second, we discuss the implications of byzantine attackers on the data type‚Äôs properties. We note that the MEG, as it does not strive for consensus or strong consistency, can cope with n &gt; f environments with n participants, of which f are byzantine. Furthermore, we analyze scalability: Using Markov chains, we study the number of forward extremities of the MEG over time and observe an almost optimal evolution. [‚Ä¶] With the properties shown, a MEG represents a promising element in the set of data structures for decentralized applications, but with distinct trade-offs compared to traditional blockchains and distributed ledger technologies.</p>

<p>As seen from the image, you can now share your screen. This currently only works on X11, since there are no cross platform APIs for that, so look out for that, if you run into issues.</p>
<p>Jedi18 also polished the UX a bit more and fixed bugs, so registration should now work properly again and leaving or joining rooms should place you in the right rooms after that. We also fixed some inconsistencies, where text could be misaligned, when writing long messages.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/erdnaxeli/caridina">Caridina</a>, a <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a> library for Matrix, got some new releases, which bring it to v0.10.2. It now supports the last version of Crystal (0.36.1) and redacted events, which I discovered the hard way were making the lib crash. Internally a big part of the lib was rewritten using macros, which makes the code a lot clearer but the <a href="https://erdnaxeli.github.io/caridina/Caridina/Events.html">API doc</a> too. Thanks to Ruma actually for giving me inspiration about implementing events using macros.</p>

<p>So I had a minute to release my open q&amp;a bot taavi. </p>
<p>I always wanted to write a chatbot that does cool things, so checkmark for that one on the list. In addition to that I recently failed a job interview. For their technical skill test (I did not fail this :P), I got a task for which I learned how to use <code>puppeteer</code>, then saw a post on reddit about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/lk1il3/no_need_of_alexa_siri_cortana_i_am_happy_with_my/">Tuxi</a> and together with my previous project that included Matrix (<a href="https://github.com/select/audius">Audius</a>), I knew what I had to do: create Taavi.</p>
<p>I have created this bot as a &quot;weekend project&quot;, litteraly one day for the code and one day for documentation. Surely it's far from perfect but I don't have any big plans with it so far‚Ä¶ If you think I should add some features, <a href="https://gitlab.com/s3lect/taavi-chat-bot/-/issues">create an issue</a> and let me know. I could imagine adding other websites / services to it like last.fm, do you have any ideas?</p>
<p>I gave my daughter the task to choose a name for a bot, that can anser any question in the world, and she came up with Taavi, nice!</p>

<p>This release comes with several further improvements to the user experience of single sign-on and numerous bugfixes and stability improvements.</p>
<p>For admins, Synapse 1.28 adds a new Admin API for retrieving <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.28.0/docs/admin_api/rooms.md#event-context-api">event context</a> and implements new spam checker hooks which enable checking file uploads and remote downloads. We've also improved memory usage of media repository workers.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have marked an undocumented Admin API for deprecation. If any of your tools use <code>/_synapse/admin/v1/users/&lt;user_id&gt;</code> to get account information, please replace that with the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.28.0/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#list-accounts">V2 List Accounts</a> API, which has been available since Synapse 1.7.0.</p>
<p>There are no special upgrade instructions for 1.28.0. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.28.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> for more details on what's in this release.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soru has been working on experimenting with / designing a way to improve push systems within the matrix ecosystem, so that ideally clients can display full event contents in a notification and dispose of specific push notifications without the need for any extra HTTP calls. This lead her to making <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3013">MSC3013</a> (encrypted push), so that no gateway is able to read event contents pushed down to the client and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3014">MSC3014</a>, so that the client can know which rooms have been read on other devices, allowing them to dispose push notifications.</p>
<p>This is more than just MSCs already, soru already got encrypted push in a patched synapse and a patched fluffychat working locally, and it is working super great!</p>
<p>Dunno soru is just really excited about this somehow <code>&gt;~&lt;</code> ü¶ä</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">krille</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's talk more about Hedwig: This is a push gateway for matrix and an alternative to Sygnal. Hedwig is completely written from scratch in Rust (Yes! Rust!) and offers the basic functionality to forward matrix push notifications to Firebase Cloud Messaging. That's it. Nothing more. It is intended to be as lightweight as possible and so it is very fast and stable. Just change a simple config.toml file and run the binary. There are docs for how you can configure a proxy in Apache2 and an example systemD service file. Currently it only supports event_id_only formatted notifications but maybe, in the future, we expand this functionality.</p>

<p>A bug where a non-excluded event could be accidentally excluded from <code>/sync</code> has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some dependency fixes have been merged</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synapse 1.27 is out, and you can <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/18/synapse-1-27-0-released">read all about it</a> on the Matrix Blog! This is the version that powered FOSDEM, and we're super proud of it. Especially the much improved support for multiple social login providers, which debuted at FOSDEM and is now enabled on matrix.org.</p>
<p>In addition to all the performance, stability, and social login improvements, there are two important things to note:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you use SSO, you will need update your configuration before upgrading; please see the link above for details.</li>
<li>We were unable to build Docker images for ARM platforms in time for this release, and will not build images for ARMv7 in future releases.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To avoid unexpected breakage, we have not updated the  <code>latest</code> tag on Docker Hub for this release; if you want Synapse 1.27, you'll need to specifically reference the <code>v1.27.0</code> tag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Images for ARM64 (and an updated <code>latest</code> tag) will return with the next Synapse release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It took us a bit longer than usual to get 1.27 out the door, so we're also pleased to announce that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.28.0rc1">1.28.0rc1</a> is also now available, and we expect to release it early next week.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had a fun week this time. Today I tested trilenes screen sharing code, which seems to work pretty well on X11, although it only shares the full screen atm. I expect window sharing to land next week though. We also ran into some issues with matrix.org enabling optional SSO login, which locked some people out of their accounts, since Nheko preferred SSO login in that case... This is now fixed and in such cases you will be offered both login flows.</p>
<p>Jedi18 also added a room name completer, which means you can finally complete aliases when typing them! The room settings were also ported to Qml and now actually show the room topic. Apart from that there were various UX fixes here ad there, like hovering actually working properly now, emote messages formatting correctly in notifications and more. We also adapted the matrix: uri support to the latest changes, although the MSC is a bit volatile atm, so it may need some more adaptions over time.</p>

<p>I'm back working on Hydrogen, and started to tackle logging to be able to diagnose problems better. I've opted for a structured log format in JSON that gives a tree of log nodes for an entire operation (e.g. sync, or sending a message, ...) which will be more compact and should also be easier to find patterns in than a pure line based format. I had hoped to get that out in a release by today but didn't get as far as I hoped, so should get released early next week.</p>

<p>We're especially proud of this release, as this is the version of Synapse that powered <a href="/blog/2021/02/15/how-we-hosted-fosdem-2021-on-matrix">FOSDEM 2021 on Matrix</a>. As such, our main focus was on stability, performance, and long-awaited support for social login.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-new">What's New</h3>
<p>To our surprise, nearly <em>half</em> of all people who created accounts on the FOSDEM homeserver did so via a social login method. Full support for those methods is included in Synapse 1.27.0, and already available for all users on the matrix.org homeserver.</p>
<p>We've also changed how we use Redis in larger deployments, making Synapse more resilient to lost connections and eliminating delays when restarting with multiple federation senders.</p>
<p>Our Server Admin APIs saw a few tweaks, including new APIs to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.27.0/docs/admin_api/rooms.md#forward-extremities-admin-api">query and delete forward extremities</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.27.0/docs/admin_api/rooms.md#room-state-api">list the current state of a room</a>.</p>

<p>If you use Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML, OAuth2, or OpenID Connect you <strong>must</strong> adjust your provider's configuration before upgrading to Synapse 1.27.0, as some endpoint URLs have changed. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.27.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1270">upgrading notes</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="dropping-armv7-docker-images">Dropping ARMv7 Docker Images</h3>
<p>We were unable to produce ARM-based Docker images for this release due to problems with cross-compilation. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to cease building 32-bit ARMv7 Docker images as part of our release process. We will resume publishing ARM64 images with the next Synapse release.</p>
<p>Users on ARMv7 platforms (most notably Raspberry Pis) should consider building images locally using Synapse's Dockerfile or switching to installing Synapse directly as a Python module. Users with Raspberry Pi 3's or newer also have the option of installing a 64-bit Linux distribution and using an ARM64 Docker image.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Just over a week ago we had the honour of using Matrix to host FOSDEM: the world's largest free &amp; open source software conference.  It's taken us a little while to write up the experience given we had to recover and catch up on business as usual... but better late than never, here's an overview of what it takes to run a ~30K attendee conference on Matrix!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_5335e89b9ca474d844bdc37ea328967b.png" alt="" /><small><center><em>[confetti and firework easter-eggs explode over the closing keynote of FOSDEM 2021]</em></center></small></p>
<p>First of all, a quick (re)introduction to Matrix for any newcomers: Matrix is an open source project which defines an open standard protocol for decentralised communication.  The global Matrix network makes up at least 28M Matrix IDs spread over around 60K servers.  For FOSDEM, we set up a fosdem.org server to host newcomers, provided by <a href="https://ems.element.io">Element Matrix Services (EMS)</a> - <a href="https://element.io">Element</a> being the startup formed by the Matrix core team to help fund Matrix development.</p>
<p>The most unique thing about Matrix is that conversations get replicated across all servers whose users are present in the conversation, so there's never a single point of control or failure for a conversation (much as git repositories get replicated between all contributors).  And so hosting FOSDEM in Matrix meant that everyone already on Matrix (including users bridged to Matrix from IRC, XMPP, Slack, Discord etc) could attend directly - in addition to users signing up for the first time on the FOSDEM server.  Therefore the chat around FOSDEM 2021 now exists for posterity on all the Matrix servers whose users who participated; and we hope that the fosdem.org server will hang around for the benefit of all the newcomers for the foreseeable so they don't lose their accounts!</p>
<p>Talking of which: the vital stats of the weekend were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We saw almost 30K local users on the FOSDEM server + 4K remote users from elsewhere in Matrix.</li>
<li>There were 24,826 guests (read-only invisible users) on the FOSDEM server.</li>
<li>There were 8,060 distinct users actively joined to the public FOSDEM rooms...</li>
<li>...of which 3,827 registered on the FOSDEM server.  (This is a bit of an eye-opener: over 50% of the actively participating attendees for FOSDEM were already on Matrix!)</li>
<li>These numbers don't count users who were viewing the livestreams directly, but only those who were attending via Matrix.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given last year's FOSDEM had roughly 8,500 in-person attendees at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles, this feels like a pretty good outcome :)</p>
<p>Graphwise, local user activity on the FOSDEM server looked like this:</p>

<img src="/blog/img/upload_63bad29ebc4d672d9979f9eea48fcfc5.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="how-was-it-built">How was it built?</h2>
<p>There were four main components on the Matrix side:</p>
<ol>
<li>A horizontally-scalable Matrix server deployment (Synapse hosted in <a href="https://ems.element.io">EMS</a>)</li>
<li>A Jitsi cluster for the video conferencing, used to host all the Q&amp;A sessions, hallway sessions, stands, and other adhoc video conferences</li>
<li>An elastically scalable Jibri cluster used to livestream the Jitsi conferences both to the official FOSDEM livestreams and to provide a local preview of the conference on Matrix (to avoid the Jitsis getting overloaded with folks who just want to view)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/conference-bot">conference-bot</a> - a Matrix bot which orchestrated the overall conference on Matrix, written from scratch for FOSDEM by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a>, consuming the schedule from FOSDEM and maintaining all the necessary rooms with the correct permissions, widgets, invites, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Architecturally, it looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_06b59bc2b2d518ffe616020e1fe5bee8.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>On the clientside, we made heavy use of widgets: the ability to embed arbitrary web content as iframes into Matrix chatrooms. (Widgets currently exist as a set of <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">proposals</a> for the Matrix spec, which have been preemptively implemented in Element.)</p>
<p>For instance, the conference-bot created Matrix rooms for all the FOSDEM devrooms with a predefined widget for viewing the official FOSDEM livestream for that room, pointing at the appropriate HLS stream at stream.fosdem.org - which looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_07145dc9cf8d5ae22b6eaf91a63dd8d6.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Each devroom also had a schedule widget available on the righthand side, visualising the schedule of that room - huge thanks to Hato and Steffen and folks at <a href="https://nordeck.net/">Nordeck</a> for putting this together at the last minute; it enormously helped navigate the devrooms (and even had a live countdown to help you track where you were at in the schedule!)</p>
<p>Each devroom was also available via IRC on Freenode via a dedicated bridge (#fosdem-...) and via XMPP.</p>
<p>The bot also created rooms for each and every talk at FOSDEM (all 666 of them), as the space where the speaker and host could hang out in advance; watch the talk together, and then broadcast the Q&amp;A session.  At the end of the talk slot, the bot then transformed the talk room into a 'hallway' for the talk, and advertised it to the audience in the devroom, so folks could pose follow-on questions to the speaker as so often happens in real life at FOSDEM.  The speaker's view of the talk rooms looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_f8b9121b21323955233d6633d19e3fb5.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>On the right-hand side you can see a &quot;scoreboard&quot; - a simple widget which tracked which messages in the devroom had been most upvoted, to help select questions for the Q&amp;A session.  On the left-hand side you can see a hybrid Jitsi/livestream widget used to coordinate between the speaker &amp; host.  By default, the widget showed the local livestream of the video call - if you clicked 'join conference' you'd join the Jitsi itself.  This stopped view-only users from overloading the Jitsi once the room became public.</p>
<p>The widgets themselves were hosted by the bot (you can see them at https://github.com/matrix-org/conference-bot/tree/main/web).  Meanwhile the chat.fosdem.org webclient itself ended up being identical to mainline Element Web 1.7.19, other than FOSDEM branding and being configured to hook the 'video call' button up to the hybrid Jitsi/livestream widget rather than a plain Jitsi.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for conferencing we hosted an off-the-shelf Jitsi cluster sized to ~100 concurrent conferences, and for the Jibri livestreaming we set up an elastic scalable cluster using AWS Auto Scaling Groups.  Jibri is essentially a Chromium which views the Jitsi webapp, running in a headless X server whose framebuffer and ALSA audio is hooked up to an ffmpeg process which livestreams to the appropriate destination - so we chose to run a separate VM for every concurrent livestream to keep them isolated from each other.  The Jibri ffmpegs compressed the livestream to RTMP and relayed it to our nginx, which in turn relayed it to FOSDEM's livestreaming infrastructure for use in the official stream, as well as relaying it back to the local video preview in the Matrix livestream/video widget.</p>
<p>Here's a screengrab of the Jitsi/Jibri Grafana dashboard during the first day of the conference, showing 46 concurrent conferences in action, with 25 spare jibris in the scaling group cluster ready for action if needed :)</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_1dfb1ef630c0ac8f5b3fd81f52491964.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There was also an explosion of changes to Element itself to try to make things go as smoothly as possible.  Probably the most important one was implementing Social Login - giving single-click registration for attendees who were happy to piggyback on existing identity providers (GitHub, GitLab, Google, Apple and Facebook) rather then signing up natively in Matrix:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_45b228cf122b2faedfca5e36b6d52576.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This was a real epic to get together (and is also an important part of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix">achieving parity</a> between Gitter and Element) - and seems to have been surprisingly successful for FOSDEM.  Almost 50% of users who signed up on the FOSDEM server did so via social login!  We should also be turning it on for the matrix.org server this week.</p>
<p>Finally, on the Matrix server side, we ran a cluster of synapse worker processes (1 federation inbound, reader and sender, 1 pusher, 1 initial sync worker, 10 synchrotrons, 1 event persister, 1 event creator, 4 general purpose client readers, 1 typing worker and 1 user directory) within Kubernetes on <a href="https://ems.element.io">EMS</a>.  These were hooked up for <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/03/how-we-fixed-synapses-scalability/">horizontal scalability</a> as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_22b8ea14fff89c1bce93767b82ab1db5.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The sort of traffic we saw (from day 2) looked like this:</p>

<h2 id="how-did-it-go">How did it go?</h2>
<p>Overall, people seem to have had a good time.  Some folks have <a href="https://twitter.com/haerwu/status/1358731829512183813">even</a> been <a href="https://twitter.com/AxSaucedo/status/1358048849944797187">kind</a> enough to call it the <a href="https://twitter.com/cterboven/status/1358343020576440322">best</a> online event they've been to :)  This probably reflects the fact that FOSDEM rocks no matter what - and that Matrix is an inherently social medium, built by and for open source communities (after all, the whole Matrix ecosystem is developed over Matrix!).  Also, Matrix being an open network means that folks could join from all over, so the social dynamics already present in Matrix spilled over into FOSDEM - and we even saw a bunch of people spin up their own servers to participate; literally sharing the hosting responsibility themselves.  Finally, having critical infrastructure rooms available such as <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#beerevent:fosdem.org">#beerevent:fosdem.org</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#cafe:fosdem.org">#cafe:fosdem.org</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#food-trucks:fosdem.org">#food-trucks:fosdem.org</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/bortzmeyer/status/1358022989875466240">probably</a> helped as well.</p>
<p>That said, we did have some production incidents which impacted the event.  The most serious one was on Saturday morning, where it transpired that some of the endpoints hosted on the main Synapse process were taking way more CPU than we'd anticipated - most importantly the /groups endpoints which handle traffic relating to communities (the legacy way of defining groups of rooms in Matrix).  One of the last things we'd done to prepare for the conference on Friday night was to create a +fosdem:fosdem.org community which spanned all 1000 public rooms in the conference, as well as add the +staff:fosdem.org community to all of those rooms - and unfortunately we didn't anticipate how popular these would be.  As a result we had to do some emergency rebalancing of endpoints, spinning up new workers and reconfiguring the loadbalancer to relieve load off the main process.</p>
<p>Ironically the Matrix server was largely working okay during this timeframe, given event-sending no longer passes through the main process - but the most serious impact was that the conference bot was unable to boot due to hitting a wide range of endpoints on startup as it syncs with the conference, some of which were timing out.  This in turn impacted widgets, which had been hosted by the bot for convenience, meaning that the Jitsi conferences for stands and talk Q&amp;A were unavailable (even though the Jitsi/Jibri cluster was fine).  This was solved by lunchtime on Saturday: we are really sorry for folks whose Q&amp;As or conferences got caught in this.  On the plus side, we spotted that many affected rooms just added their own widgets for their own Jitsis or BBBs to continue with minimal distraction - effectively manually taking over from the bot.</p>
<p>The other main incident was briefly first thing on Sunday morning, where two Jibri livestreams ended up trying to broadcast video to the same RTMP URL (potentially due to a race when rapidly removing and re-adding the jitsi/livestream widget for one of the stands).  This caused a cascading failure which briefly impacted all RTMP streams, but was solved within about 30 minutes.  We also had a more minor problem with the active speaker recognition malfunctioning in Jitsi on Sunday (apparently a risk when using SCTP rather than Websockets as a transport within Jitsi) - this was solved around lunchtime.  Again, we're really sorry if you were impacted by this.  We've learned a lot from the experience, and if we end up doing this again we will make sure these failure modes don't repeat!</p>
<p>Other things we'd change if we have the chance to do it again include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a to-the-second countdown via a widget in the talk room so the speaker &amp; host can see precisely when they're going 'live' in the devroom (and when precisely they're going to be cut in favour of the next talk)</li>
<li>Providing a scratch-pad of some kind in the talk room so the host &amp; speaker can track which questions they want to answer, and which they've already answered</li>
<li>Keep the questions scoreboard and scratchpad visible to the speaker/host after their Q&amp;A has finished so they can keep answering the questions in the per-talk room, and advertise the per-talk room more effectively.</li>
<li>Use Spaces rather than Communities to group the rooms together and automatically provide a structured room directory! (<a href="https://youtu.be/TzUfS08lMek?t=1609">Like this!</a>)</li>
<li>Use threads (once they land!) to help structure conversations in the devroom (perhaps these could even replace the hallway rooms?)</li>
<li>Make the schedule widgets easier to find, and have more of them around the place</li>
<li>Make room directory easier to find.</li>
<li>Give the option of recording the video in the per-talk and stands for posterity</li>
<li>Provide more tools to stands to help organise demos etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there you have it.  We hope that this shows that it's possible to host successful large-scale conferences on Matrix using an <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/feb/08/just-say-no-to-zoom/">entirely open source stack</a>, and we hope that other events will be inspired to go online via Matrix!  We should give a big shout out to <a href="https://hope.net">HOPE</a>, who independently trailblazed running conferences on Matrix last year and <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/08/11/hope-2020-delivers-historic-marathon-of-hacking/">inspired us</a> to make FOSDEM work.</p>
<p>If you want to know more, we also did a talk about FOSDEM-on-Matrix in this month's <a href="https://youtu.be/Wp2rSyqZsbs?t=4903">Open Tech Will Save Us</a> meetup and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzUfS08lMek">Building Massive Virtual Communities on Matrix</a> talk at FOSDEM went into more detail too.  Our historical <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/04/taking-fosdem-online-via-matrix">Taking FOSDEM online via Matrix</a> blog has been somewhat overtaken by events but gives further context still.</p>
<p>Finally, huge thanks to FOSDEM for letting Matrix host the social side of the conference.  This was a big bet, starting from scratch with our <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1301285515774373889">offer to help</a> back in September, and we hope it paid off.  Also, thanks to all the folks at Element who bust a gut to pull it together - and to the FOSDEM organisers, who were a real pleasure to work with.</p>
<p>Let's hope that FOSDEM 2022 will be back in person at ULB - but whatever happens, the infrastructure we built this year will be available if ever needed in future.</p>

Synapse 1.27.0rc2 is out now (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.27.0rc2/CHANGES.md#synapse-1270rc2-2021-02-11">changelog</a>), and we anticipate a full 1.27 release early next week. This is basically the branch that FOSDEM ran, so we think it's a good one.</p>
<p>Second, keeping with our biweekly development cadence, the first 1.28 release candidate is due out midweek next week, so keep your eyes peeled for that. Given FOSDEM, most of our recent focus has been on stability, bug fixes, and social login. We hope to <em>knock</em> your socks off with more ambitious features soon. üòâ</p>

<p>We just landed basic support for edits. Which means edits are now applied to the original message instead of showing the fallback and you can edit your messages. You can also change a text message to a video (or the other way around) or change, who you replied to, but the latter fails to render in some clients properly, so be aware of that. Edits also send a secondary relation format, which makes handling edits easier, but I still haven't written up the MSC for that... The UI is not final yet and you can't show edit history yet, but apart from that it may or may not work fine.</p>
<p>There were also a lot of bugfixes like broken kerning in some cases, improved focus handling when clicking buttons in the timeline, Duplex devices should now work in calls, notifications now work on Haiku and a few more.</p>
<p>Now please stop asking for edits! :D</p>

<p>Earlier this week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.27.0rc1">Synapse 1.27.0rc1</a>, though the final release is currently blocked on resolving a regression in Synapse 1.26 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9264">#9264</a>) which could cause logins to fail if your <code>public_baseurl</code> was unset in your Synapse configuration. The workaround is to ensure that value is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/docs/sample_config.yaml#L70-L81">correctly set</a> for your deployment.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we're quite excited to get 1.27 out the door, as it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solves an issue (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9172">#9172</a>) where federation senders could take many minutes to catch up after restarts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contains countless improvements to our support for social login methods, many of which will be live for FOSDEM users this weekend.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also included the usual host of bug fixes and Admin API additions, but more on those when the actual release happens. You can preview the release notes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.27.0rc1">on GitHub</a>.</p>

Come see <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/matrix_gitter/">our FOSDEM talk</a> in the Real Time Communications track on Saturday around how we made Gitter speak Matrix and how you can add Matrix support to your own app: https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/matrix_gitter/</p>
<p>*--</p>
<p>We're also working on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> to support backfilling the massive archive of historical messages on Gitter over on Matrix. We're prototyping the MSC on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9247">Synapse</a> and have a suite of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/pull/68">Complement tests</a> to verify that the homeserver implementation is working according to the specification.</p>
<p>The DAG visualization (made with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/tardis/pull/1">TARDIS</a>) shows that we're inserting messages <code>1</code>-<code>3</code> between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>:</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another release! Wow. We're also testing 0.24.0-rc1 which has quite a few big ticket items this week. Off the top of the list is a new command to <code>!plumb</code> rooms dynamically in admin rooms, provided you have permissions in the bridge (happy days self hosters!). We've also added the feature to warn if your messages don't get through in your admin room. Finally, there are a bunch of small bug fixes and one large one that should make the bridge <strong>much</strong> more resistant to netsplits, so that it should recover in a much safer way should it get hit by a ton of traffic. Please test, and if all goes well the formal release will be out next week!</p>

<p>Happy friday bridge users! Today we're releasing 1.7.0-rc1 of the Slack bridge which contains some more critical encryption fixes for our experimental encrypted rooms support. We've also fixed a few serious bugs where DMs would not be persisted to the database in some cases. Please test, and let us know how you get on!</p>

<p>It's been a little over 6 months since I've posted an update for Syphon in TWIM, but a lot has changed since then! There</p>
<p>have been several releases since and a lot of groundwork to get the client further out of Alpha. We've also had
people start to contribute in various ways, including with PRs, and I can't thank people enough for all their hard work and support.</p>
<p>Big thanks to TR_SLimey whose contributions went out in this release! All that said, I'll try to give
updates here more often.</p>

<p>In other news, lorendb extended the drop zone for media to the full timeline, the privacy screen got merged, some more emojis should now display properly, you can now change your avatar and displayname globally or per room and clicking a matrix link in your browser should now actually open the link in Nheko (we were missing the %u in the .desktop file).</p>

<p>I have been learning about matrix the last few months. The result of that is <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~f4814n/frost">frost</a> a very basic GUI matrix client written in Go using <a href="https://gioui.org">Gio</a> and a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~f4814n/matrix">CS library</a>. Highlights of the project so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Works on Linux, Windows, macOS and Android (although I only test on Linux and often break the other platforms)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should work on WASM and iOS with not too much effort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very, very limited E2EE support. (If the session is manually verified by other clients, events can be encrypted and decrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Library that handles storage, encryption and some other things with a opinionated but simple to use (I hope) interface.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I started this project to understand matrix and improve my Go skills (which are not that great) and if somebody wants to play around with it and give me some feedback on it, I would very much appreciate it.

<p>NeoChat is continuing to make progress. First of all Tobias, Nicolas and Hannah have been working on packaging NeoChat for many platforms. We now have nightly builds for Android, Windows, macOS, AppImages and Flatpak. There is still work to be done to improve the quality of the builds and fixing some platform incompatibility bugs. Nicolas has also been working on optimizing the performance and the RAM usage, fixing a few bottlenecks. Tobias finally landed his big revamp of the login flow and we now support login using single sign-on. Myself (Carl) worked on E2EE support in NeoChat and Quotient. This week we finished our Qt bindings for libOlm and started adding device key tracking and more!</p>

<p>We're also excited to <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/28/synapse-1-26-0-released">announce Synapse 1.26.0's release</a>! As mentioned last week, the two biggest new features are a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/auth_chain_difference_algorithm.md">faster algorithm</a> for state resolution and initial support for enabling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9110">multiple OpenID Connect providers</a>. Additionally, we've sped up redaction in large rooms and made it possible to run more APIs on workers. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> for details.</p>
<p>We expect to publish a release candidate for 1.27.0 early next week, but we're trying to be conservative about large changes ahead of FOSDEM, so knocking ‚Äî which <em>is</em> coming! ‚Äî will have to wait until 1.28.0... üö™</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks! It's been a while since we've had an update but things are always manic at bridge HQ. This release is a bit of a whopper containing quite a few bugfixes (including improvements to the experimental encrypted bridge support). We've also updated to Typescript 4.1 which is a bit stricter on those promise return types. Finally, you can now create intents on the bridge and use it's components without starting the HTTP listener which has been a longstanding issue for as long as I've been maintaining.</p>
<p>So go out there and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/v2.5.0-rc1">test this release</a>, all going well we should üö¢ early next week!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Then, later...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apart from the current releases, we have a few things cooking right now:</p>
<h4 id="edits">Edits</h4>
<p>Yes, I have tried to avoid them for long, but <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/pull/420">I am finally working on it</a>. It's a bit different to how Element and others do it, but it also generates a fallback to be compatible with the current MSCs where possible. I've grown a bit tired of having to explain myself everytime, why I did not want to support edits (yet), so I'm experimenting with a few solutions now. Expect a blog post summarizing those experiments in the future and maybe an MSC.</p>
<h4 id="polish">Polish</h4>
<p>Jedi18 and LorenDB are both busy polishing up the rough corners in Nheko, like finally being able to set your username and avatar in the UI as well as being able to copy text via right click, jdenticons and other fancy stuff. We also had a few contributions in the last release, which should improve the UX a lot.</p>
<h4 id="gsoc">GSoC</h4>
<p>Furthermore we will be participating in GSoC (if matrix.org gets accepted) and will probably mentor a student, that implements a few of the smaller features, which users may be missing after using Element for long.</p>
<p>I think that is all I wanted to share. I hope you enjoy the release and if you have any issues or feature requests, tell us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> or open an issue on Github!</p>

<h3 id="quaternion">Quaternion</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the project is already fairly rich in features, I decided that it's timely (some would say - way overdue) to bump up the version a bit. In that light, the next Quaternion beta is numbered 0.0.95 beta 3 (no four-number version any more) and it's out now! <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.95-beta3">Release notes</a> list notable changes since (0.0.9.5) beta 2, with two most significant being ability to enter messages in Markdown and the overhauled timeline that allows you to easily discern between already read and yet unread messages and also quickly scroll to the read marker.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Allowed guest users to see widgets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standardised security terminology to reduce confusion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added ability to pin widgets for everyone in the room</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We made several iterations since the last App Store release (1.1.3) but Element-iOS <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/releases">1.1.6</a> is now in the store. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We made some improvements to use less RAM in the background sync module that manages push notifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We continued to improve performance in E2EE to speed up message sending using pre-sharing keys and re-sharing keys methods. Element-iOS now automatically rejects share requests from not verified devices. It does not send anymore such requests if it is not verified.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are working on improving the initial /sync management. The first objective is to reduce RAM usage. Then, we will improve the time to display the room list.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This release includes a new database schema version. If you need to roll back to Synapse 1.25.0, you will also need to follow the associated <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1260">database downgrade instructions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to a truckload of refactoring and general improvements, Synapse 1.26.0 includes three major new features:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/auth_chain_difference_algorithm.md">brand new algorithm</a> for calculating the auth chain difference, which should dramatically improve worst case performance during state resolution (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622">#8622</a>).</li>
<li>Initial support for enabling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9110">multiple OpenID Connect providers</a>, paving the way for proper multi-provider social login workflows.</li>
<li>A significant speed-up to redaction performance in large rooms.</li>
</ol>
<p>It also brings several improvements to Admin APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific media items can be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/admin_api/media_admin_api.md#protecting-media-from-being-quarantined">protected from quarantine</a>. </li>
<li>The <code>joined_rooms</code> API now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#list-room-memberships-of-an-user">works for remote users</a>.</li>
<li>Deactivating a user can now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#deactivate-account">optionally remove their avatar URL and display name</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also made it possible to offload several additional APIs to worker processes, including read receipts and account data persistence, further improving Synapse's scalability.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> for more.</p>
<p>Lastly, a reminder: we have <strong>deprecated Python 3.5 and PostgreSQL 9.5</strong> and will cease support at the end of March. Due to deprecations in our Python tooling, we were unable to produce a binary package for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) in time for this release. We have resolved this for 1.27.</p>
