<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jfkimmes:matrix.org">jfkimmes</a> shared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just learned that in a poll of 89 universities in Germany, Matrix ranked third place in the chat category already. </p>
<p>The source is in only available in German, unfortunately: https://zenodo.org/record/4817795</p>
<p>However, the conclusion list (first table) may be understandable from context. It lists the top three solutions per category with their respective number of universities using it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@oleg:fiksel.info">Oleg</a> clarified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The evaluation was &quot;which solution are you using&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@florian:dsn.tm.kit.edu">Florian</a> added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Instant Messaging part starts at slide 15, the first chart on that slide is &quot;which solution do you use&quot;, the second is &quot;How content are you with the solution?&quot;, with Matrix having the best average of all solutions, namely ~8.8/10.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>This week the Spec Core Team has been reviewing various Spaces MSCs, most recently <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3230">MSC3230</a> (Space ordering). We're also hoping to square away the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issuecomment-655153491">aggregations MSCs</a> (message editing, reactions, etc) once and for all, though this will likely take a concerted effort from a few members to pull off.</p>
<p>Finally <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">MSC3231</a> is a (currently draft status) MSC from Callum, one of Matrix.org's <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021">GSoC students</a> this year! His project aims to allow native token-based registration to homeservers (the idea is so that you can generate a few tokens from your registration-disabled homeserver and hand them out to a few trusted friends and family members).</p>
<p>And finally, work still continues on finishing up the technical portions of the new release process for the spec. As mentioned last week, we've attempted to split the work up over multiple people in order to get it done quicker. Slowly but surely...</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:pixie.town">f0x</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another round of updates on my smart caching media proxy. After refactoring a lot (as always), I implemented <strong>thumbnailing</strong>! Now the only big feature left to add is url previewing.
I also have a test deployment configured on media.pixie.town now, so you can try fetching a bit of remote media through there, or view <a href="https://media.pixie.town/_matrix/media/r0/download/media.pixie.town/GLhyjFL8MPAzz5Oh1gIzF3lQ">this submissions screenshot</a></p>

<h4 id="comparison-with-matrix-media-repo">comparison with <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/">matrix-media-repo</a></h4>
<p>While they both implement Matrix' media endpoints, they serve rather different niches, where matrix-media-repo fully decouples the media repo aspect, my proxy cooperates with Synapse's filesystem and database, to speed up operation while ultimately making it a seamless drop-in and removal process.</p>

<p>Hello. This week we've released an update to the https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/ library containing a security fix for room upgrade handling.

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Send a bridge notice when getting unexpectedly logged out of LINE, to warn you to log in again.</li>
<li>Improve resiliency of LINE user avatar syncing.</li>
<li>Properly support syncing LINE rooms with participants who aren't in your LINE friends list (This was harder than it sounds...!)</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes (and ones before it) will be merged to <code>master</code> once I reorganize some messy commits.</p>
<p>The next big task is still to fix outbound read receipts (i.e. to make it so that the bridge syncing a message doesn't make your &gt; LINE contacts think you actually read that message). Once that is done, I'll consider the bridge to be in beta.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@freaktechnik:humanoids.be">freaktechnik</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://thunderbird.net">Thunderbird</a> now has Matrix support based on <code>matrix-js-sdk</code> enabled in the Nightly builds.</p>
<p>The star feature is probably that we support multiple Matrix accounts in the same client. Right now all your unencrypted rooms with text messages should work fine. While we think we won't destroy your account's state, it's still recommended to use a testing account with it. During account setup, it will ask you for a password, even if the homeserver supports SSO. If you intend to log in through SSO, just leave the password field blank.</p>
<p>We're not quite at the point where we support all the things you love about chatting with Matrix. Many of the missing features and polish to make communication successful are tracked in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1712710">this meta bug</a>. The goal for that milestone is to enable Matrix in our Beta builds.</p>
<p>You can get a Thunderbird Nightly build at the bottom of <a href="https://thunderbird.net/#channel">thunderbird.net</a> by switching from &quot;Beta Channel&quot; to &quot;Nightly Channel&quot;. If you run into bugs with the Matrix integration, please report them through <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Chat%20Core&amp;component=Matrix">this form</a>. When filing a bug, please include debug logs. You can copy the debug logs for the account by going to the &quot;Show Accounts&quot; dialog, right clicking the account and selecting &quot;Copy Debug Log&quot;. Note that the debug log may contain information from any of your conversations, so you might want to check the contents before posting it anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Callum, our GSoC student, after spending some time on Synapse, had now his first go at Nheko's codebase. He implemented, that you can now just enter the server name on registration instead of the full URL. This means entering conduit.rs or matrix.org works now nicely, since those servers are actually hosted at a different URL. He's now working on the Token Registration MSC, which he will implement in Synapse and Nheko, so exciting times ahead!</p>
<p>We also had a small contribution from pcworld, who fixed that if you only viewed the room list in the narrow layout, you would not get notifications for the last selected room.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with some words, that you may have heard a few times already: &quot;Watch this space for next weeks update!&quot;</p>

<p>Amongst the more trivial changes, Julian made sure rooms are added to the sidebar in batch (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/737">!737</a>) to improve performances, added in-app notifications for invite errors (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/760">!760</a>), added a menu entry to leave rooms (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/769">!769</a>), and implemented display of user and room avatars (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/770">!770</a>).

            <p>Synapse 1.35.0 is out! This release focused on improving internals as we drive toward better memory performance during room joins, but more on that below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.35.1">Synapse 1.35.1</a> was published on Thursday, June 3rd. It resolves a bug (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10109">#10109</a>) which mistakenly listed invite-only rooms in the Spaces summary.</p>
<p>We'd also like to call the attention of client developers to a deprecation: The unstable prefixes used during development of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/proposals/2858-Multiple-SSO-Identity-Providers.md#unstable-prefix">MSC2858: Multiple SSO Identity Providers</a> will be removed from Synapse 1.38, due out in August. Please ensure your client supports the stable identifiers for this feature.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="spaces-on-by-default">Spaces: On by Default</h2>
<p>Following the successful release of <a href="/blog/2021/05/17/synapse-1-34-0-released">Synapse 1.34</a>, the experimental Spaces flag is now enabled by default. If you had manually enabled the <code>experimental_features: { spaces_enabled: true }</code> flag in your homeserver configuration, you may now remove it.</p>
<h2 id="bug-squashing">Bug Squashing</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse fixes an issue which could cause federated room joins to fail when the join response exceeded a size limit which was too low (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10082">#10082</a>). We've also improved what Synapse logs when it drops a connection in similar circumstances (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10091">#10091</a>), which should aid diagnosis if a similar issue were to arise in the future.</p>
<p>GitHub user thermaq contributed a fix (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10014">#10014</a>) for a bug  which could cause user presence state to become stale.</p>
<p>Lastly our OpenTracing support now allows for profiling end-to-end performance on a per-user basis (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9978">#9978</a>).</p>
<h2 id="an-update-on-room-joins">An Update on Room Joins</h2>
<p>We've been hammering away at shrinking Synapse's memory footprint when joining large / complex rooms, and while we're not there yet, the end is in sight! In particular, this release includes many internal refactorings, including using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ijson/">ijson</a> to parse the JSON response to <code>/send_join</code> (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9958">#9958</a>), clearing the way for substantial improvements.</p>
<p>Memory usage still spikes because we're effectively doing the same work with a different library, but ijson's design allows for iterative parsing. This will pay dividends once we modify the code downstream of <code>/send_join</code> to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>Concretely, Erik Johnston has an experimental branch of Synapse which completely eliminates the memory spike:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-06-01-synapse-1.35-join-memory.png" alt="Memory usage graph for Synapse 1.33, 1.35, and an experimental branch" /></p>
<p>The remaining work is centered on splitting that branch into self-contained, reviewable pull requests, like a rewrite of the Synapse Keyring class (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10035">#10035</a>). After that's merged, we'll need to make one further change to properly batch up work, at which point we should attain the efficiency gains from Erik's experiment.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>GitHub user savyajha contributed a security hardened systemd unit file which effectively sandboxes Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9803">#9803</a>). While not enabled by default, we'd encourage security conscious users to review the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.35.0/contrib/systemd/override-hardened.conf">example file</a> and associated <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.35.0/docs/systemd-with-workers/README.md#hardening">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.35.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jerinjtitus">jerinjtitus</a>, <a href="https://github.com/junquera">junquera</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lonyeon">lonyeon</a>, <a href="https://github.com/savyajha">savyajha</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/thermaq">thermaq</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a smart media worker/proxy, to offload initial spikes in traffic for homeservers behind slower network uplinks.</p>
<p>There's a <code>&lt;remote&gt;</code> component that sits on a small vps, handling the upload and download endpoints (and soon, thumbnails), with an in-memory cache to quickly respond to requests.
Media still gets forwarded to the <code>&lt;local&gt;</code> component where it gets stored in Synapse's media folder with an accompanying database entry, so all media is still stored long-term in the way Synapse expects it to be, so the proxy can be removed at any point. </p>
<p>Currently not production ready but you're welcome to snoop around the repo :)</p>

<p>Hey folks, some of you (well, frankly most of you) wanted to hear about our plans for libera.chat. I've been hard at work
this week building a brand new bridge which is hosted on the libera.chat homeserver and it's nearly ready to go. We're just making a few final
preparations before taking it out of beta, but it's currently available as a portaling bridge. You can currently reach any channel on libera.chat by joining
<code>#&lt;channel_name&gt;:libera.chat</code>. You can also add the homeserver to your room directory in your Matrix client to search all the bridged rooms.</p>
<p>We're also hanging out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libera-matrix:libera.chat">#libera-matrix:libera.chat</a>, if you have any questions. Of course, the bridge is proving to be very popular so please be patient :)</p>

<p>On IRC side there will be only a single user/bot that will relay messages from Matrix users. This is a stop-gap between fully puppeting Matrix users on IRC and doesn't need explicit permission from an IRC network to use by channel operators as long as bots are allowed.</p>
<p>On Matrix side puppets will join and leave based on their presence on the IRC channel. The bridge bot does not need any special permissions in a room as it doesn't do permission synchronization so it can be kept without any power levels.</p>
<p>Unplumbing a room is as simple as kicking the bridge out and it will take the puppets with it.</p>
<p>As this is a fairly new feature it does have some rough edges so feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>With all this said, if you're in the need to bridge any IRC channel on any network with little friction, Heisenbridge should have you covered!</p>
<h4 id="sasl-support-unloc">SASL support üîí</h4>
<p>If you're using Heisenbridge to connect to Libera.Chat from a network block that has SASL enforcement enabled (like some VPS providers) you can now configure SASL credentials to authenticate at connection time to bypass this restriction.</p>
<p>This only implements SASL PLAIN for now. Certificate authentication may be looked at in the future.</p>
<h4 id="but-that-s-not-all">But that's not all</h4>

bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week brings a variety of assorted bugfixes &amp; feature improvements in the <code>testing</code> branch. Included are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for <code>m.sticker</code> events for LINE stickers (with an option to use <code>m.image</code> if preferred)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear resolution of LINE emojis, and a config option to scale them (since they're tiny by default)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less frequent re-downloading of already-seen LINE stickers/emoji (there are limits to this, but it's still an improvement)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Option to disable syncing LINE stickers/emoji (in case re-hosting LINE imagery is a liability)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More reliable message syncing (should never get &quot;Decrypting message...&quot; or invisible images/stickers/emoji anymore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix crashes during inbound message &amp; read receipt syncing of multi-user rooms</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like last time, testing is much appreciated üòÄ</p>
<p>Remaining big tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rework message syncing so that receiving a message doesn't require &quot;viewing&quot; the LINE chat in the Puppeteer-controlled browser, which will make LINE send a read receipt even though you may not actually have read the message yourself (I mentioned this a while ago; it's still a todo)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for multiple bridge users at once (A public instance of the bridge will only be considered once multi-user support is ready)</p>
</li>

K√©vin did an <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/759">internal restructuring of how we handle the SyncResponse in !759</a>. The visible consequence for users is that room categories (also known as tags) are updated directly in Fractal when the user changes it from an other client.

<p><strong>Delight</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spaces: We‚Äôve been listening to, investigating, triaging and organising feedback from the beta so far. There‚Äôs a lot to get through, but thanks to everyone who has submitted feedback in-app in Element so far! The insight has been invaluable and is instrumental in shaping up our next milestones.</li>
<li>Papercuts: We‚Äôre also organising and fixing small issues throughout Element, biasing for highly visible issues which have the greatest impact and reach, affectionately titled ‚Äòpapercuts‚Äô. Expect more info on these soon, but for now a fun one to highlight is we‚Äôre implementing <a href="https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash">blurhash</a> on Web &amp; Android (with iOS to follow soon after) to improve previewing and viewing images, especially when on low bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Web</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1.7.29 released
<ul>
<li>Improved startup performance by focusing decryption on recent rooms</li>
<li>Fixed reaction duplication</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sorting out why we sometimes see &quot;<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9422#issuecomment-843366412">missing translations</a>&quot; hopefully for good this time</li>
<li>Continuing to improve application performance</li>
<li>Started work on Apple silicon desktop builds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We continued to work on technical subjects:
<ul>
<li>Stabilisation and performance improvements</li>
<li>New logging system. It will be possible to disable all logs for MatrixSDK, MatrixKit and Element-iOS</li>
<li>The code that manages application navigation in Element-iOS has been updated. It will allow us to add a slide menu to display things like user spaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Element Android 1.1.8 has been released on the beta track of the Google PlayStore. It will probably be pushed to production at the beginning of next week. The Android matrix SDK2 has also been released.</li>
<li>This week, we implemented the ability to change the network when looking in the room directory. Also gitter.im has been added to the default network list. See some screenshots in <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/3419">https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/3419</a> </li>
<li>Lots of improvements regarding Spaces have also landed to develop.</li>

<p>However, there were quite a few other fixes, improvements, and additions: I'd encourage you to read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/17/synapse-1-34-0-released">release announcement</a> for those.</p>
<p>But more than anything, we're hard at work realizing the room-join memory improvements we talked about in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=694VuhmVmfo">last week's Matrix Live</a>, and we expect to have some exciting news to share next week. Concretely: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9958">the pull request</a> to support incremental parsing of join responses was merged, and several pull requests (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10017">#10017</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10018">#10018</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10035">#10035</a>) to simplify and slim down the code for verifying event signatures are in review.</p>

<p>As announced in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021#fractal">the general Matrix GSoC post</a>, we are lucky to get two interns this year again. Alejandro (whose previous work includes <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/626">switching to matrix-rust-sdk for syncs</a>) will implement multi-account support, while Kai (also <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;state=merged&amp;author_username=V02460">a regular contributor</a> by now) will help bring our application rewrite to the same functionality level as our current nightly and stable versions. Both projects will build on top of Fractal Next.</p>
<p>Julian came back from his vacation and immediately got quite busy reviewing and merging contributions from others. Kevin (also known as zecakeh) and him made good progress on several fronts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Room handling was improved. We now keep track of whether the user joined them, left them, or has been invited to them, as well as their categories (favourites, low priority‚Ä¶).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sidebar uses these categories and now uses a single list with <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/git/docs/gtk4/struct.FilterListModel.html">GtkFilterListModels</a> instead of one list per category. The greatly simplifies code for things like moving a room from one category to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>History style has been tweaked, state events and timestamps have been added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown can be enabled from the newly implemented popover and the message composer offers syntax highlighting, although a bug currently makes it so that sent messages are still not sent with a <code>formatted_body</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A persistent state store is used to load rooms on startup while sync is in progress.</p>

<h3 id="ruma">Ruma</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ruma.io/">Ruma</a> is a set of Rust library crates around Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org">jplatte</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've been quiet in the past weeks, but certainly not due to lack of activity! So many awesome things have happened, I don't even know where to start. I guess I'll go chronologically:</p>
<p><strong>We published so many new crate releases.</strong> Most of our crates didn't see non-alpha releases for almost a year and now we've finally reset that counter! Now you can depend on <code>ruma 0.1</code> and get bug fixes and new functionality through <code>cargo update</code> without having to worry about breaking changes. Huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a> for automating our release process, without that this would have taken so much longer.</p>
<p><strong>We got initial spaces support!</strong> I'm super excited that we're now enabling client authors to take spaces into account, even if &quot;taking into account&quot; will initially just mean filtering out space rooms from their room lists. Code-wise, this was actually a <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/585">relatively small change</a>, with ruma-client-api receiving support for room types and ruma-events receiving support for the event types <code>m.space.child</code> and <code>m.space.parent</code>.</p>
<p><strong>We're swapping out ruma-signatures' crypto library.</strong> Since <code>ring</code>, which is what we've been using so far, doesn't currently support cross-compilation to WASM, there's long been some interest to exchange it for something else for webbrowser homeserver experiments. A viable alternative library was identified a while ago and now <a href="https://github.com/ShadowJonathan">@ShadowJonathan</a> has taken on the task of <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/589">implementing the switch</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to unblocking the WASM usecase, this work <a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring/issues/1299">revealed a bug in <code>ring</code></a>, which generated invalid PKCS#8 documents. We are pretty confident that once the switch away from <code>ring</code> (including a small compatibility shim to convert the invalid documents), a certain class of signature verification failures that Conduit has been getting will be fixed.</p>
<p><strong>We're taking part in GSoC again.</strong> As you might have seen in the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021">earlier blog post</a>, two students are working on Ruma as part of GSoC this year: <a href="https://github.com/Frinksy">@Frinksy</a> (for the first time) and <a href="https://github.com/DevinR528">@DevinR528</a> (for the second time).</p>

<h4 id="possible-bug-that-needs-manual-fixing">Possible Bug that needs manual fixing</h4>
<p>Due to a bug with my homeserver or synapse it happens for some rooms that synapse generates a lot of join events (Lots of &quot;server_stats bot made no change&quot; messages). If you see this please write a message to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev">MTRNord</a> so I can manually prevent my bot from trying to join the room over and over again as I cannot easily detect this kind of issue before joining. </p>

<h3 id="devin-ragotzy-ruma-s-automated-checks">Devin Ragotzy: <em>Ruma's Automated Checks</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>My name is Devin Ragotzy. I am a student at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan, studying computer science. I was lucky enough to work last summer on Ruma and have continued to contribute to the project. I was accepted to work on Ruma's automated checks project, mentored by Isaiah Inuwa, Jonas Platte, Timo K√∂sters. The goal of the project is to create a linter capable of enforcing Ruma-specific style and practices. I hope to get this tool to a working state by the end of this summers GSoC!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="abhinav-krishna-c-k-first-class-email-bridge">Abhinav Krishna C K: <em>First-Class Email Bridge</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Abhinav Krishna C K from NSS College of Engineering in Palakkad, India will be working on Building First-Class email bridge for Matrix this summer mentored by Half-Shot and tulir. This will enable Matrix to be connected with Email by translating incoming SMTP traffic to Matrix messages, and then bridging Matrix messages back into emails.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="frinksy-extend-ruma-s-api-coverage">Frinksy: <em>Extend Ruma's API coverage</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>My name is Adam Blanchet, and I am a student from the University of York in the UK.<br />
I am happy to say that I have quite a few mentors: Isaiah Inuwa, Jonas Platte, Timo K√∂sters and Nico from Nheko.<br />
My project is to extend Ruma's API coverage. I'll be doing a few things: finishing coverage of the Identity Service API, adding the &quot;knock&quot; feature to Ruma and finishing the implementation of QR code verification. If time allows it I will also work on implementing other MSCs or features such as &quot;Event notification attributes and actions&quot;. I hope that my work will help enable other Rust-based Matrix projects, such as Conduit and Fractal, to implement more features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Timo added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, I am Timo K√∂sters. I study Computer Science in Germany and spend most of the remaining time developing Conduit, a Matrix homeserver built on top of Ruma. I use Ruma all the time and will be mentoring Adam Blanchet to make it even better.</p>

<h3 id="vladyslav-hnatiuk-pyquotient">Vladyslav Hnatiuk: <em>PyQuotient</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>My name is Vladyslav Hnatiuk, I'm a student  of Vienna University of Technology and my project is PyQuotient.<br />
The aim is to simplify creating of a Matrix Qt-based clients in Python by providing Qt-based SDK and avoid writing a large part of functionality manually. And to not reinvent the wheel PyQuotient will be bindings for the existing library libQuotient that provides SDK for Matrix for C++ applications. I'll be mentored by kitsune, the author of libQuotient and also libQuotient-based Matrix IM client Quaternion. I hope PyQuotient will facilitate the development of Matrix clients in Python with Qt, and it will be a small contribution to the promotion of Matrix, especially in Python world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>kitsune added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this experience proves to be successful, there‚Äôs a good chance Quaternion will eventually switch to Python.</p>

<h3 id="callum-brown-token-authenticated-registration">Callum Brown: <em>Token Authenticated Registration</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi there, I'm Callum, a Londoner who'll be starting a physics degree in September. For GSoC I'll be working on adding Token Authenticated Registration to Matrix. This will allow homeserver admins to restrict who can sign-up by requiring a token to be submitted during registration. I run a small homeserver for friends and family, but don't have the resources to make registration public, so I have wanted this feature integrated into Matrix servers and clients for quite a while! I'll be working with Nico, anoa, and red_sky to write an MSC, implement the server side in Synapse, and the client side in Nheko. Thanks to the mentors and Matrix.org for the opportunity to work on this!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can follow along with this project's progress throughout the program at https://calcuode.com/matrix-gsoc/.</p>
<p>Nico, mentor added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nico here, one of the Mentors. Personally I am super excited about this project! I have been using Matrix for a while now and I think Nheko is pretty good by now. But there is still a barrier, if I want my friends and family to use Matrix: They can't easily sign up! I have tried creating them accounts and telling them to change their passwords, having a dedicated registration page or just telling them to just use a different server, but nothing of that made me happy and it added friction to the already hard process of getting someone to try a new messenger! As such I am super excited for this, because it will make signing up your friends and family to your personal instance, without it having to be public, sooooo much simpler!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="jaiwanth-exporting-conversations-from-element">Jaiwanth: <em>Exporting Conversations From Element</em></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Jaiwanth Vemula from the IIT Kharagpur University in India will be working on Exporting Conversations in Element this summer, mentored by Michael (t3chguy). This work will enable users to easily export their conversations for archival or sharing, this is a feature which has been missed in Element for a very long time!</p>

        <div>
            <p>Last week the UK government published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/draft-online-safety-bill">draft of the proposed Online Safety
Bill,</a>
after having initially introduced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/online-harms-white-paper/public-feedback/online-harms-white-paper-initial-consultation-response">formal proposals for said bill in early
2020</a>.
With this post we aim to shed some light on its potential impacts and explain
why we think that this bill - despite having great intentions - may actually
be setting a dangerous precedent when it comes to our rights to privacy,
freedom of expression and self determination.</p>
<p>The proposed bill aims to provide a legal framework to address illegal and
harmful content online. This focus on ‚Äúnot illegal, but harmful‚Äù content is at
the centre of our concerns - it puts responsibility on organisations
themselves to arbitrarily decide what might be harmful, without any legal
backing. The bill itself does not actually provide a definition of harmful,
instead relying on service providers to assess and decide on this. This
requirement to identify what is ‚Äúlikely to be harmful‚Äù applies to all users,
children and adults. Our question here is - would you trust a service provider
to decide what might be harmful to you and your children, with zero input from
you as a user?</p>
<p>Additionally, the bill incentivises the use of privacy-invasive age
verification processes which come with their own set of problems. This
complete disregard of people‚Äôs right to privacy is a reflection of the
privileged perspectives of those in charge of the drafting of this bill, which
fails to acknowledge how <em>actually</em> harmful it would be for certain groups of
the population to have their real life identity associated with their online
identity.</p>
<p>Our view of the world, and of the internet, is largely different from the one
presented by this bill. Now, this categorically does not mean we don‚Äôt care
about online safety (it is quite literally our bread and butter) - we just
fundamentally disagree with the approach taken.</p>
<p>Whilst we sympathise with the government‚Äôs desire to show action in this space
and to do something about children‚Äôs safety (everyone‚Äôs safety really), we
cannot possibly agree with the methods.</p>
<p>Back in October of 2020 we presented <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">our proposed approach to online safety</a> -
ironically also in response to a government proposal, albeit about encryption
backdoors. In it, we briefly discussed the dangers of absolute determinations
of morality from a single cultural perspective:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">As uncomfortable as it may be, one man‚Äôs terrorist is another man‚Äôs freedom fighter, and different jurisdictions have different laws - and it‚Äôs not up to the Matrix.org Foundation to play God and adjudicate.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now find ourselves reading a piece of legislation that essentially demands
these determinations from tech companies. The beauty of the human experience
lies with its diversity and when we force technology companies to make calls
about what is right or wrong - or what is ‚Äúlikely to have adverse
psychological or physical impacts‚Äù on children - we end up in a dangerous
place of centralising and regulating relative morals. Worst of all, when the
consequence of getting it wrong is criminal liability for senior managers what
do we think will happen?</p>
<p>Regardless of how omnipresent it is in our daily lives, technology is still
not a solution for human problems. Forcing organisations to be judge and jury
of human morals for the sake of ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù will, ironically, have severe
consequences on free speech, as risk profiles will change for fear of
liability.</p>
<p>Forcing a ‚Äúduty of care‚Äù responsibility on organisations which operate online
will not only drown small and medium sized companies in administrative tasks
and costs, it will further accentuate the existing monopolies by Big Tech.
Plainly, Big Tech can afford the regulatory burden - small start-ups can‚Äôt.
Future creators will have their wings clipped from the offset and we might
just miss out on new ideas and projects for fear of legal repercussions. This
is a threat to the technology sector, particularly those building on emerging
technologies like Matrix. In some ways, it is a threat to democracy and some
of the freedoms this bill claims to protect.</p>
<p>These are, quite frankly, steps towards an authoritarian dystopia. If Trust &amp;
Safety managers start censoring something as natural as a nipple on the off
chance it might cause ‚Äúadverse psychological impacts‚Äù on children, whose
freedom of expression are we actually protecting here?</p>
<p>More specifically on the issue of content moderation: the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/985283/Draft_Online_Safety_Bill_-_Impact_Assessment_Web_Accessible.pdf">impact assessment
provided by the government alongside this
bill</a>
predicts that the additional costs for companies directly related to the bill
will be in the billions, over the course of 10 years. The cost for the
government? ¬£400k, in every proposed policy option. Our question is - why are
these responsibilities being placed on tech companies, when evidently this is
a societal problem?</p>
<p>We are not saying it is up to the government to single-handedly end the
existence of Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) or extremist content
online. What we are saying is that it takes more than content filtering, risk
assessments and (faulty) age verification processes for it to end. More
funding for tech literacy organisations and schools, to give children (and
parents) the tools to stay safe is the first thing that comes to mind. Further
investment in law enforcement cyber units and the judicial system, improving
tech companies‚Äô routes for abuse reporting and allowing the actual judges to
do the judging seems pretty sensible too. What is absolutely egregious is the
degradation of the digital rights of the majority, due to the wrongdoings of a
few.</p>
<p>Our goal with this post is not to be dramatic or alarmist. However, we want to
add our voices to the countless <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/online-abuse-why-management-liability-isnt-the-answer/">digital rights
campaigners</a>,
individuals and organisations that have been raising the alarm since the early
days of this bill. Just like with coercive control and abuse, the degradation
of our rights does not happen all at once. It is a slippery slope that starts
with something as (seemingly) innocuous as <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1392823038920564736">mandatory content scanning for
CSAE content and ends with authoritarian surveillance
infrastructure</a>.
It is our duty to put a stop to this before it even begins.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>As many know, over the years we've experimented with how to let users locate
and curate sets of users and rooms in Matrix. <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/communities-aka-groups-are-here-announcing-riot-web-0-13-riot-ios-0-6-and-riot-android-0-7-4-933cb193a28e">Back in Nov
2017</a>
we added 'groups' (aka 'communities') as a custom mechanism for this -
introducing identifiers beginning with a + symbol to represent sets of rooms
and users, like <a href="https://matrix.to/#/+matrix:matrix.org">+matrix:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>However, it rapidly became obvious that Communities had some major
shortcomings.  They ended up being an extensive and entirely new API surface
(designed around letting you dynamically bridge the membership of a group
through to a single source of truth like LDAP) - while in practice groups
have enormous overlap with rooms: managing membership, inviting by email,
access control, power levels, names, topics, avatars, etc.  Meanwhile the
custom groups API re-invented the wheel for things like pushing updates
to the client (causing a whole suite of
<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/5235">problems</a>).  So clients
and servers alike ended up reimplementing large chunks of similar
functionality for both rooms and groups.</p>
<p>And so almost before Communities were born, we started thinking about whether
it would make more sense to model them as a special type of room, rather than
being their own custom primitive.
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1215">MSC1215</a> had the first
thoughts on this in 2017, and then a formal proposal emerged at
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a> in Jan 2019. We
started working on this in earnest at the end of 2020, and christened the new
way of handling groups of rooms and users as... Spaces!</p>
<p>Spaces work as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can designate specific rooms as 'spaces', which contain other rooms.</li>
<li>You can have a nested hierarchy of spaces.</li>
<li>You can rapidly navigate around that hierarchy using the new 'space summary'
(aka space-nav) API - <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/kegan/spaces-summary/proposals/2946-spaces-summary.md">MSC2946</a>.</li>
<li>Spaces can be shared with other people publicly, or invite-only, or private
for your own curation purposes.</li>
<li>Rooms can appear in multiple places in the hierarchy.</li>
<li>You can have 'secret' spaces where you group your own personal rooms and
spaces into an existing hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, we're ridiculously excited to be launching Space support as a beta in
matrix-react-sdk and matrix-android-sdk2 (and thus Element Web/Desktop and
Element Android) and Synapse
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/17/synapse-1-34-0-released">1.34.0</a> - so head
over to your nearest Element, make sure it's connected to the latest Synapse
(and that Synapse has Spaces enabled in its config) and find some Space to
explore! <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#community:matrix.org">#community:matrix.org</a>
might be a good start :)</p>
<p>The beta today gives us the bare essentials: and we haven't yet finished
space-based access controls such as setting powerlevels in rooms based on
space membership
(<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2962/proposals/2962-spaces-access-control.md">MSC2962</a>)
or limiting who can join a room based on their space membership
(<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/clokep/restricted-rooms/proposals/3083-restricted-rooms.md">MSC3083</a>) -
but these will be coming asap.  We also need to figure out how to implement
Flair on top of Spaces rather than Communities.</p>
<p>This is also a bit of a turning point in Matrix's architecture: we are now
using rooms more and more as a generic way of modelling new features in
Matrix.  For instance, rooms could be used as a structured way of storing
files (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3089">MSC3089</a>);
Reputation data
(<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2313">MSC2313</a>) is stored in
rooms; Threads can be stored in rooms
(<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2836">MSC2836</a>); Extensible
Profiles are proposed as rooms too
(<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1769">MSC1769</a>).  As such,
this pushes us towards ensuring rooms are as lightweight as possible in Matrix -
and that things like sync and changing profile scale independently of the
number of rooms you're in.  Spaces effectively gives us a way of creating a
global decentralised filesystem hierarchy on top of Matrix - grouping the
existing rooms of all flavours into an epic multiplayer tree of realtime data.
It's like USENET had a baby with the Web!</p>
<p>For lots more info from the Element perspective, head over to the <a href="https://element.io/blog/p/4ff44807-fe9a-4363-8521-9eab7efd4365/">Element
blog</a>. 
Finally, the point of the beta is to gather feedback and fix bugs - so please
go wild in Element reporting your first impressions and help us make Spaces as
awesome as they deserve to be!</p>
<p>Thanks for flying Matrix into Space;</p>
<p>Matthew &amp; the whole Spaces (and Matrix) team.</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.34.0 is now available, and it's loaded with new features and performance improvements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This release deprecates and replaces the <code>room_invite_state_types</code> configuration option. If you've customized that for your homeserver, please review the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.34.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1340">Upgrade Notes</a>.</p>
<p>We've also marked the v1 room deletion Admin API as deprecated. Instead of sending a <code>POST</code> to a path ending in <code>/delete</code>, administrators are encourage to instead send an HTTP <code>DELETE</code> to <code>/_synapse/admin/v1/rooms/&lt;room_id&gt;</code>. Thanks to ThibF for implementing this (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9889">#9889</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="spaces">Spaces</h2>
<p>The highlight of this release is support for Spaces, now that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772: Matrix Spaces</a> has merged into the Matrix spec!</p>
<p>Synapse also has support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946: Spaces Summary</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083: Restricting room membership based on space membership</a>, but these are off by default as they're still under development. To enable these experimental MSCs, set <code>experimental_features: { spaces_enabled: true }</code> in your homeserver configuration. These <em>are</em> enabled on the matrix.org homeserver, and we encourage you to experiment with Spaces there and let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#spaces-feedback:matrix.org">Spaces Feedback Room</a> if you encounter any issues.</p>
<h2 id="memory-and-caching">Memory and Caching</h2>
<p>Memory consumption and caching have been a major focus of the Synapse team this quarter, and we've made significant strides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synapse has a new <code>gc_min_interval</code> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.34.0/docs/sample_config.yaml#L155-L163">configuration option</a> with reasonable defaults to prevent Python's garbage collector from running too frequently and thrashing when a large homeserver has its collection thresholds set too low.</li>
<li>Synapse will report <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9882">memory allocation stats</a> to Prometheus when using jemalloc.</li>
<li>Synapse will also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9904">measure Redis cache response times</a> and report those to Prometheus.</li>
<li>For debugging, Synapse can <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9881">optionally track</a> the memory use of each LruCache.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a few more tricks up our sleeves; to learn more about how we're planning to improve the memory cost of joining large rooms, check out last week's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=694VuhmVmfo">Matrix Live</a>.</p>
<h2 id="other-fixes-and-improvements">Other Fixes and Improvements</h2>
<p>We've also landed significant improvements to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending events when Redis is available (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9905">#9905</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9950">#9950</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9951">#9951</a>)</li>
<li>Joining large rooms when presence is enabled (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9910">#9910</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9916">#9916</a>)</li>
<li>Backfilling history in large rooms (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9935">#9935</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>...and fixed bugs that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevented cross-account <code>m.room_key_request</code> messages from being delivered (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9961">#9961</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9965">#9965</a>)</li>
<li>Incorrectly applied room creation / invitation rate limits to users and app services which <em>should</em> have been exempt (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9968">#9968</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The health check on our Docker images now responds more quickly upon successful startup thanks to improvements by maquis196 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9913">#9913</a>), and for especially privacy-conscious homeservers, device names can now be shielded over federation thanks to a contribution by aaronraimist (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9945">#9945</a>).</p>
<h2 id="new-access-token-format">New Access Token Format</h2>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.blog/2021-04-05-behind-githubs-new-authentication-token-formats/">GitHub's new token format</a>, we've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/5588">restructured Synapse's access token format</a> to follow the pattern:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>syt_&lt;UnpaddedBase64MXIDLocalPart&gt;_&lt;20RandomLetters&gt;_&lt;CRC32&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>So a token for <code>@example:matrix.org</code> might look like:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>syt_ZXhhbXBsZQ_KfJetOcLWEKCvYdKnQLV_0i3W80
</span></code></pre>
<p>Existing tokens remain valid; this is just for new tokens. We hope the new format reduces network overhead while also making it easier identify misplaced tokens in logs and repositories.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some combination of me, Kegan, Bruno and neilalexander have been working on v3 of the CS /sync API. (Today's /sync API in matrix is v2; v1 was the old /events API).  We're not yet at the point of publishing a draft or MSC, but it's coming soon. It's really exciting work which flips Matrix around so that sync scales independently of the number of rooms you're in - and it's at last possible to write rich clients which only ever sync the bare minimum data needed to work: i.e. lazy loading eeeeeeeeverything.  Watch this space :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3192">MSC3192: Batch state endpoint</a></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs entered proposed FCP state this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs are in FCP.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3122">MSC3122: Deprecate starting verifications without requesting first</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="merged-spec-prs">Merged Spec PRs</h4>
<p>Here are all the actual MSC-related changes made to the raw Matrix spec this week!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3179">Clarify that implementations can use stable prefixes once an MSC proposal has merged</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>There's been activity from the Spec Core Team on a number of different MSCs, such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3189">MSC3189</a> (per-room/space profile data). Additionally a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3168">spec PR</a> for Matrix URI schemes has been getting feedback and is moving forward at a quick pace! There was also some feedback from the team on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2448">MSC2448</a> (blurhashes) which I'll get around to answering shortly üôÇ.</p>
<p>Otherwise I think this week was a bit implementation-heavy for the team (the Spec Core Team is a task in addition to our full-time jobs). Hopefully next week will grant us more of a breather.</p>
