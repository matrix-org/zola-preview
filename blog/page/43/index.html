            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We just got back from braving the snow in Brussels at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/">FOSDEM 2019</a> - Europe's biggest Open Source conference. I think it's fair to say we had an amazing time, with more people than ever before wanting to hang out and talk Matrix and discuss their favourite features (and bugs)!</p>
<p>The big news is that <strong>we released <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.0.html">r0.1 of Matrix's Server-Server API</a> </strong>late on Friday night - our first ever formal stable release of Matrix's Federation API, having addressed the core of the issues which have kept Federation in beta thus far. We'll go into more detail on this in a dedicated blog post, but this marks the first ever time that <strong>all</strong> of Matrix's APIs have had an official stable release.  All that remains before we declare Matrix out of beta is to release updates of the CS API (0.5) and possibly the IS API (0.2) and then we can formally declare the overall combination as Matrix 1.0 :D</p>
<p>We spoke about SS API r0.1 at length in <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/matrix_french_state/">our main stage FOSDEM talk </a>on Saturday - as well as showing off the Riot Redesign, the E2E Encryption Endgame and giving an update on the French Government deployment of Matrix and the focus it's given us on finally shipping Matrix 1.0! For those who weren't there or missed the livestream, here's the talk!  <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-01-FOSDEM-Matrix-1.0.pdf">Slides are available here</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Then, on Sunday we had the opportunity to have a quick <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/matrix/">20 minute talk in the Real Time Comms dev room</a>, where we gave a tour of some of the work we've been doing recently to scale Matrix down to working on incredibly low bandwidth networks (100bps or less).  It's literally the opposite of the Matrix 1.0 / France talk in that it's a quick deep dive into a very specific problem area in Matrix - so, if you've been looking forward to Matrix finally having a better transport than HTTPS+JSON, here goes!  <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-03-FOSDEM-Low-Bandwidth.pdf">Slides are available here.</a></p>

<p>Huge thanks to everyone who came to the talks, and everyone who came to the stand or grabbed us for a chat! FOSDEM is an amazing way to be reminded in person that folks care about Matrix, and we've come away feeling more determined than ever to make Matrix as great as possible and provide a protocol+network which will replace the increasingly threatened proprietary communication silos. :)</p>
<p>Next up: Matrix 1.0...</p>

<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Neil and the team have been working frantically on getting a new Synapse release out this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has been all about gearing up for v0.99.0 and if you would like to help us test it, our latest release candidate lives <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.0rc4">here</a><br />We've taken the decision to bump up to v0.99.0 because it is very much a precursor to v1.0. When v1.0 lands it will contain a breaking change that means all homeservers will need a valid certificate for their server to server endpoint, self signing will no longer be possible.<br />v0.99.0 contains support to help you do this, but once it lands all admins will need to upgrade, failure to do so will mean losing the ability to federate with &gt; v1.0 servers.<br />We'll have detailed docs ready to go alongside the full v0.99.0 release, and we plan to leave at least 1 month between v0.99.0 and v1.0, but for now please be aware that the change is coming.<br />Huge thanks to Rich, Erik, Hawkowl and Anoa for all their work in getting us to rc stage.</p>

<p>If you haven't already heard, then I envy that you get to learn about it now: there is a credible new project which forks <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> and seeks to maintain and continue the project.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko-Reborn</a></strong> is a new project headed by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@red_sky:ocean.joedonofry.com">red_sky</a>, who told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I'm getting pretty close to having another release ready. Need to clean up some things here and there and get the CI packages uploading correctly<br />It'd be good to have more community engagement</p>

<p>I've posted another blog on <a href="https://github.com/lukebarnard1/journal">journal</a> about the next steps for the project, including my thoughts on verifying blog content.</p>
<p><a href="https://journal.lukebarnard.co.uk/journal/26-jan-2019">https://journal.lukebarnard.co.uk/journal/26-jan-2019</a></p>
<p>I'm planning to start work on the component that will scrape blog content from a matrix room. This will most likely involve a dedicated bot that syncs new journal blog events, verifies the blog signature and then writes the blog content to a file on the blog server.</p>
<p>I'll probably ramble about the details of that at some point.</p>

<h3 id="matrix-jabber-java-bridge"><a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-jabber-java-bridge/">matrix-jabber-java-bridge</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The bridge is being re-written. I excluded the jabber server (still need to setup SRV records) and implementing the xmpp s2s api in the bridge.
Done:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>rfc6120 in s2s part;</li>
 	<li>almost server dialback (XEP-0220);</li>
</ul>
Remaining:
<ul>
 	<li>MUC (XEP-0045);</li>
 	<li>stabilize.</li>
</ul>
New version will allow:
<ul>
 	<li>1:1 conversations between matrix and jabber users;</li>
 	<li>group chats by double-puppet mapping rooms to conferences;</li>
 	<li>additionally xmpp users can join directly to rooms via double-puppet bots.</li>
</ul>
Also I started breaking the bridge to modules. And the next module will be ActivityPub S2S module which allows communicate matrix servers with other fedivers.

<p>What there mainly is is <strong>FOSDEM</strong>. A lot of Matrix-folk are currently near me as I write this, sat in a hotel bar in sunny Brussels. Matrix live is not available today, but will incorporate some of the event, which kicks of tomorrow.</p>
<p>If you will be attending, come <code>/join</code> us at the Matrix table, where there will be stickers and t-shirts and merriment, and definitely come and attend the talks:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Working furiously towards an r0 spec release. Event ids as hashes (MSC 1659) and S2S API certificates (MSC 1659 ) are very close now - see <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8</a> to track our progress.</li>
 	<li>Since <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1711">MSC1711</a> is a breaking change, we will initially ship our next release (v0.35.0) with ACME support to make it easy to provision and renew certificates. The give everyone a month to upgrade and install a cert before we ship Synapse v1.0 which will require that servers have certificates in order to federate. Don't worry, there will be plenty of details on the steps necessary for admins when v0.35.0 lands - watch this space.</li>
 	<li>Finally a raft of db performance improvements, room version upgrade bug fixes, as well taking a look at room directory and user directory efficiency.</li>

<h2 id="matrix-puppet-slack">matrix-puppet-slack</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@root:thomasprofitt.com">tom</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack">matrix-puppet-slack</a> version 1.10.1 has been released, thanks again to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack/commits?author=twouters">@twouters</a></p>
<ul>
 	<li>The bridge could not create new Matrix rooms on versions of Synapse after a certain change, because it did not reserve the room alias prefix it used. That's been fixed, but anyone currently running matrix-puppet-slack will need to edit their slack_registration.yaml and restart Synapse. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack/releases/tag/1.10.1">the Release</a> for instructions on doing so.</li>
 	<li>The bridge will no longer send "Edit: " events when Slack sends it a "message_changed" message, if the message text has not actually changed (Slack sends these events for URL previews, for example, but this just causes duplicate bridged messages). This fix has been a long time coming.</li>

<h2 id="matrix-corporal">matrix-corporal</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal">matrix-corporal</a> <a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal/releases/tag/1.3.0">1.3.0</a> was released.<br />It uses a new Matrix API for fetching account data (Synapse &gt;0.34.1 is required), so it performs reconciliation quicker than before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reconciliation is now much faster, due to the way we retrieve account data from the Matrix server (no longer doing <code>/sync</code>).<br />From now on, the minimum requirement for running matrix-corporal is Synapse v0.34.1, as it's the first Synapse release which contains the new API we require (<code>GET /user/{'{'}user_id{'}'}/account_data/{'{'}account_dataType{'}'}</code>).</p>

<p>I've been working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/cl-matrix">cl-matrix</a> and I think now it might be in a good condition to talk about it.
<a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/cl-matrix">cl-matrix</a> is a WIP client library written in common lisp, most of the API endpoints have been covered using macros that allow you to copy straight from the spec, here is an example using the send event endpoint:</p>
<pre><code class="lisp language-lisp">(define-matrix-endpoint room-send-event (:put)
  ("rooms" room-id "send" event-type txn-id))
</code></pre>
<p>this will expand into a function with the signature:</p>
<pre><code class="lisp language-lisp">(PUT-ROOM-SEND-EVENT AUTHENTICATION ROOM-ID EVENT-TYPE TXN-ID CONTENT &KEY PARAMETERS)

<p>it also has some basic events defined using <a href="http://shinmera.github.io/deeds/">deeds</a> that can be issued using the sync endpoint.</p>

 	<li>there's now support for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/docs/importing-postgres.md">importing an existing Postgres database</a>, which should make it easier for people with another setup to migrate over.</li>
 	<li>there's now support for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/docs/configuring-playbook-ssl-certificates.md">manually-managed and self-signed certificates</a>, in addition to the Let's Encrypt support we've always had</li>
 	<li>the playbook now uses a much better (20x smaller, faster) riot-web Docker image (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/avhost/docker-matrix-riot/">avhost/docker-matrix-riot</a> -&gt; <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bubuntux/riot-web/">bubuntux/riot-web</a>). At least until <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/7771">vector-im/riot-web#7771</a> gets merged and official images become available.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#bc-break-mxisd-configuration-changes">completely redone</a> way of generating mxisd configuration, letting people unleash the full power of mxisd without us having to explicitly add support for new features</li>
 	<li>mxisd 1.3.0-ready. We default to a stable mxisd release still (1.2.2), but people can try the much-improved 1.3.0 alpha releases even now (e.g. <code>matrix_mxisd_docker_image: "kamax/mxisd:1.3.0-alpha.2"</code>).</li>
 	<li>we now utilize <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/blob/4185b644b7b69af36bb1fdc81976a36590b1b97f/docs/features/directory.md">mxisd's User Directory Search feature</a> to augment the results coming from Synapse</li>
 	<li>the playbook has been <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#splitting-the-playbook-into-multiple-roles">split into multiple roles</a> (one role per component) and the <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#bc-break-making-the-playbooks-roles-more-independent-of-one-another">roles have been made independent of one another</a>. People who want to re-use our roles in their own playbooks can now more-easily do so.</li>
 	<li>even more components have become optional and can now be turned off completely (coturn, mailer)</li>
</ul>
Lots of thanks go to Maximus, jcgruenhage and Cadair for helping out!

Once the migration is complete all of the migrated users will be emailed with login instructions, so that they can seamlessly continue chatting where they left off in HipChat.

            <p>Hi all, Ben here.</p>
<p>Since joining the core team as Developer Advocate last year it's been quite a ride. One of the best things about the job is getting the chance to talk to so many people about their projects and what they would like to see happen in the matrix ecosystem. With so much going on, I just want to say thanks to everyone who has been so welcoming to me and share some of my personal highlights, as I recall them, from 2018!</p>
<h2 id="clients">Clients</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a></strong> was featured in the very first TWIM, announcing v1.26. Since then, the team have hosted two IRL hackfest events (Strasbourg and Seville - where to next, Stockholm? Salisbury?), engaged two GSOC students and continued to push out releases. At this point, Fractal is a full-featured Matrix client for GNOME.</p>
<p>Matrique became <strong><a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a></strong>, and is generally awesome. Apparently the name &quot;Matrique&quot; was chosen because it sounds French, but those who speak the language well revealed that this name was not ideal! The project was re-named &quot;Spectral&quot;, and is going strong. I really appreciate the multi-user facility! It's a great looking client, and runs great on macOS too (protip: get more attention from <code>/me</code> by providing a macOS build…)</p>
<p>On which subject, <strong><a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass">Seaglass</a></strong> is a native macOS client. First announced in June, this client supports E2EE rooms (via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">matrix-ios-sdk</a>), and is also available on homebrew.</p>
<p>Ubuntu Touch has the most Matrix clients per-user of any platform. UT epitomises the resilience and collaborative spirit of Open Source. It's a true community maintenance effort, and is as friendly a community as you might meet. <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a> came first, but it's <strong><a href="https://github.com/ChristianPauly/fluffychat">FluffyChat</a></strong> that prompted me to install it on my battered old OnePlus One. FluffyChat is now extremely full-featured, with E2EE support being actively discussed.</p>
<p>In the command line, <strong><a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a></strong> appeared and quickly became a competent client, but in terms of sheer enthusiasm and momentum, I must give commendation to <strong><a href="https://github.com/jgkamat/matrix-client-el">matrix-client.el</a></strong>, a newly revived mode for Emacs which turns your editor/OS into a great Matrix Client. I enjoyed using it enough that it began to change my mind about using emacs. Laptops have more than 8mb memory these days anyway.</p>
<h2 id="a-culture-of-bots">A culture of bots</h2>
<p>There is a tendency in the community to build a bot for everything and anything. This has reached the point where there are multiple flairs available depending on what bots you like to make (silly vs serious.)</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> was perhaps the first person I saw to get the obsession, creating</p>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-monitor-bot">matrix-monitor-bot</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-trello-bot">matrix-trello-bot</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-alias-bot">matrix-alias-bot</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-hashtag-bot">hashtag bot</a> (perhaps the most absurd!)</li>
</ul>
and more…
<p>Cadair even made <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/skill-twim">twimbot</a>, designed to make it easier to consume and produce <a href="/twim">This Week in Matrix</a> itself.</p>
<p>In June <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> started <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a>, a plugin-based bot system built in Python, which now also has a management UI.</p>
<h2 id="all-bridges-lead-to-matrix">All bridges lead to Matrix</h2>
<p>Or from Matrix, depending on which way you want to send the message.</p>
<p>Around May, I started to notice another obsession brewing in the community. Bridging is a core part of the Matrix mission, but it was around this time I started seeing it in the wild.</p>
<p>Summer 2018 <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> began working in the Matrix core team, and was <em>hugely</em> productive in maintaining and developing the bridge infrastructure for matrix.org. IRC bridging is far more stable and reliable now than it was a year ago. And yet there are still more bridges - too many to list, so I'm picking the ones I've used and enjoyed.</p>
<p>Discord is bridged by <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</a>, handled by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>, aided and abetted by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> but with a new maintainer this year, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a>. This bridge is now feature-rich and sits at v0.3.1.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>'s suite of bridges including <strong><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a></strong> are extremely stable and useful - big thank you to <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> for maintaining <a href="https://t2bot.io/">t2bot.io</a> and hosting the Telegram bridge too.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/tijder/SmsMatrix">SMSMatrix</a></strong>, a phone-hosted bridge is simple and works great for SMS bridging.</p>
<h2 id="libraries-sdks-frameworks">Libraries, SDKs, Frameworks</h2>
<p>I enjoyed using <strong><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a></strong> for building <a href="https://github.com/benparsons/elizabot">elizabot</a> (more coverage needed for that!), and the SDK recently received support for application services.</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> announced v0.2 of <strong><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libqmatrixclient</a></strong> describing it as “the first one more or less functional and stable&quot; - confidence! This library now powers both Quaternion and Spectral. QMatrixClient has continued to get updates, plus features including lazy loading and VoIP signalling.</p>
<p>There are a few libs I want to pay more attention to this year, starting with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>'s <strong><a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a></strong> now that it has been rewritten in Python. I'm also excited to see <strong><a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk">jmsdk</a></strong>, part of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a>'s broader ecosystem of Matrix tooling - a Java-based SDK.</p>
<h2 id="ruma-resurrection">Ruma Resurrection</h2>
<p>Until around June, <strong>Ruma</strong> was receiving regular updates. There was a pause as the team waited for Rust async/await to land, and also to get some stability in the Matrix Spec. Still waiting on Rust, but now that the Matrix Spec is stabilising, Ruma is showing signs of life too. I have also been watching other homeserver projects begin to restart, which makes for a great start to 2019.</p>
<h2 id="dsn-traveller-by-florian">DSN Traveller by Florian</h2>
<p>Matrix was featured as part of a Master's thesis by Florian Jacob.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/">DSN Traveller</a> tries to get a rough overview of how the Matrix network is structured today. It records how many rooms it finds, how many users and servers take part in those rooms, and how they relate to each other, meaning how many users a server has and of how many rooms it is part of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Florian's thesis was handed in last August. <a href="https://github.com/florianjacob/dsn-traveller">Source code is available</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All details at <a href="https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/">https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/</a>, room at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dsn-traveller:dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu">#dsn-traveller:dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="still-more">Still more</h2>
<p>Synapse dominates the homeserver space right now, so if you want to host your own homeserver today it's the obvious choice. Too great a variety of installation guides was doing more harm than good, so <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@natrius:matrix.org">Stefan</a> took the initiative to create a <strong>definitive community-driven Synapse installation guide</strong>, including a room to discuss and improve the text. Find the <a href="/docs/guides/installing-synapse">guide linked from here</a>, and chat about the guide in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/synapseguide:matrix.org">#synapseguide:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>I want to use Matrix, and I want to host my own homeserver. As such, <strong><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a></strong> is a project I absolutely love. It uses Synapse docker images from the Matrix core team, and combines them with Ansible playbooks written and organised by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a>. It lets you quickly deploy everything needed for a Synapse homeserver, and it's simple enough that even I can use it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">Construct</a></strong>, a homeserver implementation in C++ began successfully federating with Matrix, work progressed <a href="/blog/2018/05/18/this-week-in-matrix-2018-05-18/">from around April/May</a>.</p>
<p>Having a <strong><a href="https://shields.io/#/examples/chat">Matrix-native mode for shields.io</a></strong> (those counter/indicator images you often see at the top of repos) seems like something petty at first, but it's actually a great indicator of the importance of Matrix from the outside. Plus, I love seeing the images at the top of different repos. Thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a> for helping this along.</p>
<p>Two students worked on Matrix-related projects during <strong><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a></strong>.</p>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Zil0:matrix.org">Zil0</a> created E2EE bindings for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a></li>

Something which came in super-helpful for me when testing homeserver installations was <strong><a href="https://neo.lain.haus/fed-tester/">f0x's fed-tester</a></strong>. <a href="https://github.com/f0x52/fed-tester/">Source code available</a> (obv.)
<h2 id="thanks-for-all-the-projects">Thanks for all the projects</h2>
<p>Thanks for a great 2018. There was so much to learn about, so much to write about, and so many great community members to meet and chat to! If I didn't mention your project, I'm sorry to have been either forgetful or to not be able to include everything.</p>
<p>If you think I've missed something, or if there's a project I should have included rather than another, or even if you just disagree with my choices, let's discuss it in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a>. See you there, and let's all parade ahead to a productive, open, interoperable 2019!</p>

        <div>
            <p>On <a href="/blog/2019/01/10/critical-security-update-synapse-0-34-0-1-synapse-0-34-1-1/">Thursday Jan 10th we released a Critical Security Update (Synapse 0.34.0.1/0.34.1.1)</a>, which fixes a serious security bug in Synapse 0.34.0 and earlier. Many deployments have now upgraded to 0.34.0.1 or 0.34.1.1, and we now consider it appropriate to disclose more information about the issue, to provide context and <b>encourage the remaining affected servers to upgrade as soon as possible</b>.</p>
<p>In Synapse 0.11 (Nov 2015) we added a configuration parameter called “macaroon_secret_key” which relates to our use of <a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub41892">macaroons</a> in authentication. Macaroons are authentication tokens which must be signed by the server which generates them, to prevent them being forged by attackers. “macaroon_secret_key” defines the key which is used for this signature, and it must therefore be kept secret to preserve the security of the server.</p>
<p>If the option is not set, Synapse will attempt to derive a secret key from other secrets specified in the configuration file. However, in all versions of Synapse up to and including 0.34.0, this process was faulty and a predictable value was used instead.</p>
<p><b>So if, your homeserver.yaml does not contain a macaroon_secret_key, you need to upgrade to 0.34.1.1 or 0.34.0.1 or Debian 0.34.0-3~bpo9+2 immediately to prevent the risk of account hijacking.</b></p>
<p>The vulnerability affects any Synapse installation which does not have a macaroon_secret_key setting. <b>For example, the Debian and Ubuntu packages from Matrix.org, Debian and Ubuntu include a configuration file without an explicit macaroon_secret_key and must upgrade. </b>Anyone who hasn't updated their config since Nov 2015 or who grandfathered their config from the Debian/Ubuntu packages will likely also be affected.</p>
<p>We are not aware of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild, but if you are running an affected server it may still be wise to check your synapse's user_ips database table for any unexpected access to your server's accounts. You could also check your accounts' device lists (shown under Settings in Riot) for unexpected devices, although this is not as reliable as an attacker could cover their tracks to remove unexpected devices.</p>
<p>We'll publish a full post-mortem of the issue once we are confident that most affected servers have been upgraded.</p>
<p>We'd like to apologise for the inconvenience caused by this - especially to folks who upgraded since Friday who were in practice not affected. Due to the nature of the issue we wanted to minimise details about the issue until people had a chance to upgrade. We also did not follow a planned disclosure procedure because Synapse 0.34.1 already unintentionally disclosed the existence of the bug by fixing it (causing the logout bug for affected users which led us to pull the original Synapse 0.34.1 release).</p>
<p>On the plus side, we are approaching the end of beta for Synapse, and going forwards hope to see much better stability and security across the board.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your patience,</p>
<p>The Matrix.org Team</p>

            <p>After releasing Synapse v0.34.1, we have become aware of a security vulnerability affecting all previous versions (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5885">CVE-2019-5885</a>). v0.34.1 closed the vulnerability but, in some cases, caused users to be logged out of their clients, so we do not recommend v0.34.1 for production use.</p>
<p><b>Today we release two mitigating versions v0.34.0.1 and v0.34.1.1</b>. Both versions close the vulnerability and will not cause users to be logged out. <b>All installations should be upgraded to one or other immediately.</b></p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Admins who would otherwise upgrade to v0.34.1 (or those that have already done so) should upgrade to v0.34.1.1. 
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Admins on v0.34.0, who do not wish to bring in new non-security related behaviour, should upgrade to v0.34.0.1.
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get the new updates for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.34.0.1">v0.34.0.1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.34.1.1">v0.34.1.1</a> here or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>. Note, Synapse is now available from PyPI, pick it up <a href="https://pypi.org/project/matrix-synapse/">here</a>. See also our <a href="/docs/guides/installing-synapse">Synapse installation guide page.</a></p>
<p>We will publish more details of the vulnerability once admins have had a chance to upgrade. To our knowledge the vulnerability has not been exploited in the wild.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your patience, we are moving ever closer to Synapse reaching v1.0, and fixes like this one edge us ever closer.</p>
<p>Thanks also to the package maintainers who have coordinated with us to ensure distro packages are available for a speedy upgrade!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a> got soft launched on matrix.org and is happily bridging XMPP and matrix communities together. I am on full bug and feature fixing duty for it and the consensus from both sides is that it's looking pretty awesome.<br />The matrix-appservice-purple bridge is coming along leaps and bounds, with formatting fixes, presence handling and speedier message delivey both ways. Also a shoutout to the XMPP community for guidling me through the XEP landscape and giving the bridge a thorough testing. :)</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alphapapa:matrix.org">alphapapa</a> provided many updates for <a href="https://github.com/jgkamat/matrix-client-el">matrix-client.el</a> this week, I recommend chatting in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-client.el:matrix.org">#matrix-client.el:matrix.org</a> where the <del>cultists</del> Emacs users and client devs hang out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>matrix-client.el gained more room sorting options and a /priority command to set room priority. It also includes a workaround for a Google Chrome drag-and-drop bug on Linux, so now Chrome users can drag-and-drop URLs, files, and images directly into room buffers to upload them.</p>
<p>matrix-client.el gained a new notifications-buffer feature that shows notifications from multiple rooms in a single list, allowing you to easily monitor multiple rooms at once and jump to events in them.<br />e.g. I can see messages from #matrix and #twim in the same window, and reply to messages in both rooms from the same prompt</p>

<p>Dendrite's audit is finally coming to an end! I'm happy to say I just finished the “data collection” phase, in which I looked at everything that needs to be either fixed or implemented in Dendrite. This represents 90% of the work and around 3 weeks of full-time work. All that's left to do now is some triaging in the data (<a href="https://cloud.abolivier.bzh/index.php/s/qXi2KFjCQk2c6eG">which is available here</a>, by the way), into order to have a clear view on what's left to do in the audit.

<p>I've brought my Matrix&lt;--&gt;Minecraft bridge back to life in the form of a Bukkit plugin.

Check it out on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-minecraft">https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-minecraft</a><br />It'll be designed to work as a public hosted bridge, so someone could use t2bot.io to bridge their minecraft server (for example)</p>

<p>On this subject, it's always worth thinking about the importance of openness and interoperability in messaging.

<p>It's the 28th of December as I write this, and I hope you had a good year. Long as it is, I recommend reading <a href="/blog/2018/12/25/the-2018-matrix-holiday-special/">Matthew's write-up of the year</a>, as it covers a lot of ground!</p>
<p>Many of the core team have been out of the office this week, but there are still plenty of updates to share from the Matrix ecosystem!</p>
<h2 id="mxisd-v1-2-2">mxisd v1.2.2</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> released mxisd v1.2.2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a> had a Holiday-special release: <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.2.2">v1.2.2</a> before v1.3.0.</p>
<p>This release introduces two new big features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Username login rewriting via 3PID to allow advanced flows, like bypassing the synapse restriction of having numerical usernames for non-guest users</li>
 	<li>Support for multiple Base DNs for LDAP backends</li>
</ul>
Work has started on v1.3.0 so this is definitely the last release before a non-backward compatible release.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:feneas.org">Jason Robinson</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started work on a Prometheus Alertmanager bot for Matrix. The basic idea is that Alertmanager can send webhook alert events to the bot which will then send the formatted events to configured rooms based on the alert receiver. It works, but is still early work in progress. See code and info here: <a href="https://git.feneas.org/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager">https://git.feneas.org/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>From the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Enhanced history view with adaptive layout, day divider</li>
 	<li>Reorganised headerbar, app menu merged with user menu</li>
 	<li>Larger display of emoji-only messages</li>
 	<li>Some performance improvements</li>
 	<li>Opening a room jumps to first unread message</li>
</ul>
Bugfixes:
<ul>
 	<li>More reliable notifications</li>
 	<li>Fixed display bug for avatars</li>
</ul>
Under the hood:
<ul>
 	<li>Large code refactor</li>
 	<li>Logging infrastructure</li>
 	<li>Continuous integration</li>
 	<li>More informative build output</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The new command handling system in maubot is ready. The new system should be much nicer to use when developing plugins.</p>
<p>Previously <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a> had a system that was designed after the improved bot support spec proposal, but it wasn't very nice or pythonic. If/when the proposal or something similar goes through, I'll probably add support for it in the new command handling system.</p>
<p>Next I'll make some developer docs so that other people could actually make their own plugins.</p>
<p>The code is at <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">https://github.com/maubot/maubot</a> and you can ask about maubot in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#maubot:maunium.net">#maubot:maunium.net</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/apps/matrix-to">https://github.com/apps/matrix-to</a> is a Github App which makes use of their shiny and new Content Attachments API/Webhook. When a <code>matrix.to</code> or <code>view.matrix.org</code> URL is used this app is activated. It adds a little snippet with the Room Title and Topic (if the room is peekable from matrix.org). In future it'll work for event permalinks, but currently there is no support for peeking context/event in Matrix API.</p>
