<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:elokapina.fi">kapina-jaywink</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent weeks the XR Finland community has been moving over from Wire to our own Matrix homeserver for encrypted secure chat. This was something that had been planned for a while but kicked off in recent weeks due to Wire suffering from serious encryption key delivery issues, causing messages for many to be unreadable in large groups. Currently we've migrated almost 300 rebels with more to come. Feedback has mostly been very positive, people generally like the Element clients ü§© One of the interesting changes has been a huge uptick in the amount of discussion, which can be taken as a good sign. The plan is to next start bridging to some of the international XR chapters, for example those on Mattermost, Telegram and Slack. And maybe get them over to Matrix too eventually ;)</p>
<p>To aid in community management, we've started creating <a href="https://github.com/elokapina/bubo">a bot called Bubo</a>. Right now it mostly helps with maintaining rooms and allowing mass invites, but more features to help the community cooperate are coming. We were planning to utilize (actual) communities so it has some functionality for those, but decided then to wait for the communities rewrite. It doesn't yet have any releases, will update in coming weeks as features are added and releases made.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">released our first beta last week</a> and we've been busy taking feedback from the community and fixing problems as they have been reported to us. We will be cutting a v0.2.0 release candidate later today, which contains a significant number of important fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>We didn't publish a full changelog last week due to the beta announcement, therefore the following list includes changes from the last two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Database migrations are now ran automatically at startup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State resolution v2 performance has been improved dramatically on large state sets, seen to be running up to 20x faster in some rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer runs state resolution over single trusted state snapshots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monolith deployments with Kafka now work again (each component sets up connections independently to avoid duplicate consumers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now correctly rejects invalid UTF-8 - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully read markers are now handled - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>completed</code> field is now returned properly for user-interactive auth - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The devices table now tracks last seen timestamps, IPs and user agents - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed in the reverse topological ordering algorithm which resulted in us giving up on inbound references after the first prev/auth event</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug with concurrent map writes in the rate limiting in the client API has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities and their previous events are now checked fully against the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typing events are now ignored if the sender domain doesn't match the origin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duplicate redaction entries no longer result in database errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some bugs in <code>/send</code> have been fixed where the full room state wasn't requested properly before sending a new snapshot to the roomserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The membership updaters now use database writers properly, which fixes some SQLite locking issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sync API no longer burns CPU processing unnecessary device key change notifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>QueryStateAfterEvents</code> now resolves state from multiple snapshots properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cumulative room state is now sent to the roomserver when creating rooms locally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missing auth events will now be retrieved from multiple servers in the room if necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation requests now have variable timeouts, allowing us to wait much longer for a remote server to process certain tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/send</code> endpoint now returns 500 errors far less often, reducing the frequency that other servers back off from sending to Dendrite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backfill no longer uses the request context for persisting events, which was resulting in us failing to store those events sometimes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite stripped state from the sync API now includes the stripped invite itself, so that Element Web can display who sent the invite properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The signing key fetch mechanism no longer gives up if it is unable to fetch specific keys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling of invalid display name or avatar URLs in membership events has been improved</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved a little:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 80%, up from 79% last week</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Hello everyone, this week we merged the federation branch into master. It's not ready to be used properly yet, but we're merging it as it seems stable enough for now. We also improved performance of the federation branch a lot by turning off debug logs.</p>
<p>Other news:</p>
<ul>
<li>I opened two issues on element-ios which currently break register and login support on Conduit, making it completely unusable. Hopefully they can be resolved soon (https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3736, https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3737)</li>
<li>I'm working on an MSC for threading. It's still WIP, but you can take a look here: https://demo.codimd.org/s/SykbuAUwP</li>

<p><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/stonking">Stonking</a> week for Synapse as we landed sharded event persisters and deployed to matrix.org. This is the last significant component other than the main process to go through the sharding process and a major hurdle in horizontal scalability of Synapse.</p>
<p>Initial results look good with event persistence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">apdex</a> improving, however we think there are still some significant performance improvements available through configuration and will continue to experiment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We also moved off background processes from the main process. This is significant because it means that while the main process is not shardable it really doesn‚Äôt do anything anymore other than orchestration.</p>
<p>Again the initial impact looks very promising and we will continue to tune. Having moved the background processes away it also makes profiling the main process that much easier.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Small bit of news I wanted to talk about from Bridge Island. My <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8437">implementation</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> has been merged which means appservices / bridges can now listen in for incoming presence, typing and read receipt events! This means that the Slack bridge can now reliably send your typing status to Slack, and Bifrost can reliably bridge your everything to XMPP. The MSC is still in flux and could change, but for now this could really improve the native feeling of bridges :)</p>
<p>(Oh and I should mention anyone using matrix-appservice-bridge v2.2.0+ can use this behaviour for free)</p>

<p>Hot on his heels, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been adding support for the MSCs Half-Shot implemented in Synapse to my bridges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enabling end-to-bridge encryption now uses appservice login (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2778">MSC2778</a>), which means setting up the shared secret login module is no longer required for e2be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mautrix-python has support for receiving ephemeral events via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> in a branch, which will be merged once Synapse v1.22 is released. After it's merged, <code>/sync</code>ing with double puppets will no longer be necessary to bridge ephemeral events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these will also be implemented in mautrix-go/whatsapp soon.</p>
<p>Now I just need Half-Shot to make synapse send to-device events to appservices, after which bridges won't need any hacky <code>/sync</code>ing at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several releases this week (0.1.11 to 0.1.15) with lots of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>url-based navigation has landed! All navigation in the app is now done through urls, meaning you can also bookmark any UI state (e.g. grid configurations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed 2 memory leaks (exposed now because you can unload your session without refreshing the page)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed an issue with libolm running out of memory if you send a message to more than 44 devices (see issue #150).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some logical additions now we have url navigation: restoring the last url when opening the app with the default route, and a button to close your session and go back to the picker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the app now blocks concurrent access to the same session from different tabs (it just closes the session in the non-active tab). This will prevent multiple syncs tripping over each other writing to indexeddb (e.g. ConstraintErrors and friends).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>updates are announced in the app (for now through a confirm dialog, but will use an in app notification once we have it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixes updates not installing on iOS, by having an update prompt. To get this update on iOS though, you'll need to unpin the app, and pinning it again. You'll need to login again after this. All future updates should be installable through the update prompt once you have 0.1.15 though, you won't have to do this again normally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>uses the hydrogen icon when pinning on iOS</p>

<p>We are currently preparing the release of the version 1.0.9 of Element Android, which contain searching messages in clear rooms and a lots of other improvements and new features.</p>
<p>The SDK 1.0.9 will also be released, with an updated readme, and a brand new sample app, written by Ganfra. It will help developers to start using the new SDK and can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2-sample">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2-sample</a>. This sample app is able to let the user connects to an existing account on any homeserver with password login, display the room list, display a room timeline and send message to a room.

<blockquote>
<p>I published the first preview of my Sailfish client called Konheko. While you can run Android applications on Sailfish, they usually are a subpar experience, since they really don't fit the platforms design and style and also usually don't properly send notifications.</p>
<p>So about a year ago I started working on a Matrix client for SailfishOS, but I never really made much progress. Well, last weekend I did, and so it can now send plain text messages as well as various forms of media messages, I made a basic application icon and I've been using it this week already (for unencrypted rooms).</p>
<p>It is still missing a lot of features, but if you want you can install it from <a href="https://openrepos.net/content/deepbluev7/konheko">OpenRepos</a>. Sources are available <a href="https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/konheko">here</a>. Just be aware, that it currently stores all messages in RAM, so every restart will take forever to load your rooms and it may run out of RAM at some point. Storing messages in some database will come at some point. Also, a lot of menus may lead nowhere, since those are just placeholders for me atm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently, I tweaked Element-web to feature a few changes similar to SchildiChat for Android.</p>
<p>For now, it's probably best seen rather as a proof-of-concept than a finished product, as there are still some layout bugs, and no settings available for the added features (I know some people prefer separate lists for direct and group chats).
I consider it usable though.</p>
<p>Particular changes compared to upstream Element-web include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A common section for groups and direct chats in the overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message bubbles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bigger items in the room overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A different dark theme, similar to SchildiChat for Android</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know how much I will work on this in the future, but I figured it might be interesting to share either way. Maybe even someone with more web-development skills than me might want to help improving it :)</p>
<p>For further discussion, I have created <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#schildichat-web:matrix.org">#schildichat-web:matrix.org</a> .</p>

            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Today we have released Synapse 1.21.2, which fixes a couple of minor bugs that crept into the previous release. Full details are below.</p>
<p>Separately, we are advising any administrators who have not yet upgraded to Synapse 1.21.0 or later to do so as soon as possible. Previous versions of Synapse were vulnerable to a cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack; the bug was fixed in Synapse 1.21.0 with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8444">PR #8444</a>.</p>
<p>The changelog for 1.21.2 is as follows:</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-21-2-2020-10-15">Synapse 1.21.2 (2020-10-15)</h1>
<p>Debian packages and Docker images have been rebuilt using the latest versions of dependency libraries, including authlib 0.15.1. Please see bugfixes below.</p>
<h2 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix rare bug where sending an event would fail due to a racey assertion. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8530">#8530</a>)</li>
<li>An updated version of the authlib dependency is included in the Docker and Debian images to fix an issue using OpenID Connect. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8534">#8534</a> for details.</li>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">has officially entered beta</a>!</p>
<p>It aims to be an efficient, reliable and scalable alternative to Synapse.</p>
<p>We encourage early adopters to try it out starting with v0.1.0 in Monolith/Postgres mode.</p>
<p>Dendrite supports a large amount of the Matrix spec including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All room versions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E2E encryption (but not cross-signing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and many others!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll be hard at work in the coming weeks ironing out any issues that crop up as Dendrite enters the global</p>
<p>federation of Matrix servers. At present, Dendrite has not been optimised for memory/CPU usage, nor does it
fully support sharding, so there is still much scope to improve the already impressive resource usage whilst</p>
<p>heading towards 100% spec compliance.</p>
<p>Spec compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 77%, same as last week</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week I worked on a new feature: the Admin Room. This is a room that is automatically created for the first user of a new homeserver. This room will be used to send warnings to server admins in the future and can be used to control Conduit (like querying information, running cleanup, banning servers, hiding public rooms or restarting Conduit). Power levels can be used to control who in the room has access to which commands. The admin room will work over federation, so it's easy to help someone fix his server.</p>
<p>Other news:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Federation is now disabled by default and can be enabled in the config</p>

<li>

<p>After a long and sometimes painful journey we plan to run sharded event persisters on matrix.org from Monday. All being well we will start running background processes on their own worker to free up the main process.
These two projects combined should noticeably improve performance of matrix.org and any large scale deployments.</p>
<p>Aside from that we are continuing to work on room knocking as a feature and have been considering ways to reduce load attributable to state resolution.</p>
<p>We will also dust off the notifications project.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we finally cleaned up the remaining parts of Chethans GSoC work and merged it. This means Nheko now has partial support for cross-signing. You can either start the verification from another client or when viewing the profile of a user. There are a few things still missing though:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko does not use the verification status at all at the moment. So while you can verify your master key and let others verify your master key, from Nhekos perspective there is not much benefit yet. You will however show up with a green checkmark in other clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While nheko supports verifying your own master key and after that will also let others verify your master key, it does not yet download the self and user signing keys. This means you won't be able to upload cross-signing signatures for your own devices and other users master keys yet. I'll see if I can implement in the next weeks or so (since literally only the private key download or sharing is missing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko can't bootstrap cross-signing yet. This means you need to bootstrap it from Element or another client once. That will probably take a bit until this is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UX is still WIP. Currently it shows a lot of unnecessary buttons, that are a bit confusing as well as not enough green checkmarks, so that needs some work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things that happened in the mean time or are work in progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decryption errors should be reduced by a bit now. This is still work in progress though. With device trust landed now, we should be able to do automatic key requests, sharing and key backup soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lurkki is currently cleaning up the design of the built in video player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manu_kamath is improving the design when showing images at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LorenDB has been updating our screenshots and working on an Esperanto translation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trilene has been ever busy improving edge cases around the Voip support in Nheko.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So far Hacktoberfest seems to be going well with quite a few people trying to clean up some of the rougher edges in Nheko. If you are using Nheko and think some things could be better, why not try to fix it yourself? October is the perfect time for that!</p>
<p>Featurework of this cycle is also slowly nearing its end. Once cross-signing, voip and the new event store are stable, we plan to improve the UX a bit more as well as some other annoyances and maybe we can do a new release then! A nice and spooky Hacktober everyone!</p>

<p><a href="https://fossil.nil.im/objmatrix">ObjMatrix</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ObjFW/ObjMatrix">GitHub</a>) is a new Matrix client library written in modern Objective-C for <a href="https://objfw.nil.im/">ObjFW</a>. Because it uses ObjFW, it is not limited to Apple platforms, and instead is <a href="https://objfw.nil.im/doc/trunk/PLATFORMS.md">extremely portable</a> and should run on basically everything.</p>
<p>This is currently in its very early stages and is intended to be suitable to develop bots and clients with very soon. Being suitable to develop bridges with it is another goal for later.</p>
<p>Since ObjFW also works on platforms that are usually hard to support or port software to (e.g. <a href="https://www.morphos-team.net/">MorphOS</a>), this will hopefully also bring clients for these less mainstream operating systems. I'm especially hopeful about MorphOS here, since ObjFW already runs quite well there (parts of it are included with the OS even!), and hardware on which MorphOS runs on is usually not powerful enough to run Element Web. And eventually, I will want to have a Matrix client on my Amiga, too üòâ (which this should enable).</p>
<p>This currently does not have a decicated Matrix room yet, so all discussions about it currently happen in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#objfw:nil.im">#objfw:nil.im</a>. So please feel free to join there and follow along development. And contributions are of course <em>very</em> welcome!</p>

        <div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We‚Äôre very excited to announce that Dendrite, the next-generation Matrix homeserver from the core Matrix team, is at last exiting alpha development and entering beta testing!</p>
<p>The path we‚Äôve taken to get here has been quite a curious one, and it‚Äôs worth recapping to give context on why it‚Äôs taken reality a little while to catch up with the dream. :)</p>
<p>The Dendrite project has its roots in 2016 as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendron">Dendron</a>: an attempt to write a next-generation homeserver in Golang rather than Python, in order to benefit from Go‚Äôs stronger typing, ease of profiling (no twisted stack-shredding via deferredInlineCallbacks), multithreading and faster GC performance.  The idea for Dendron was to do a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html">strangler pattern</a> rewrite of Synapse - where we‚Äôd insert Dendron in front of Synapse as a load balancer, and incrementally replace Synapse‚Äôs API endpoints with ones implemented by Dendron.</p>
<p>However, as the project started to progress, it became clear that this was going to end up with many of Synapse‚Äôs architectural choices being baked into the project - particularly the DB schema and data flow architecture, such that the new endpoints could interoperate with the existing Python ones.  We got as far as putting Dendron live on matrix.org and moving some of the login/registration APIs over to it‚Ä¶ but then work fizzled out due to Synapse demanding more urgent attention as traffic grew on Matrix.org, combined with concerns about whether Dendron was the right approach in general.</p>
<p>So, towards the end of 2016 (after the rush to launch <del>Vector</del> <del>Riot</del> Element that summer), we went back to the drawing board to devise Dendrite‚Äî‚ÄúDendron done right!‚Äù‚Äîas opposed to Dendron, which in retrospect was Dendrite done wrong. ;) The new vision was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a massively horizontally scalable architecture, such that large Matrix deployments like matrix.org and big government deployments could run smoothly without the constant scalability headaches we were seeing at the time with Synapse</li>
<li>Do so by splitting the server into well-defined microservice components, each of which could independently horizontally scale, each with its own DB (if desired)</li>
<li>Connect the components together with a set of append-only logs via <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> or similar, easily letting components shard and maintain their databases from the logs, allowing rolling upgrades, possibly schema upgrades, and all sorts of other niceties.  The logs effectively become a primary source of truth rather than putting all the onus on a massive monolithic ever-growing database</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than Dendron‚Äôs top-down approach, instead Dendrite started bottom-up with the very hardest bit: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib">gomatrixserverlib</a>, a standalone Go library implementing the state resolution algorithms and performing federation requests (such that it might also someday be used as a general purpose way to add Matrix federation support to an existing Go codebase).</p>
<p>Then we started building out the various components to implement the various services, starting with the roomserver (the service which models the history and state of one or more rooms in the server), then the syncserver (the service which implements the /sync API to let clients receive messages), etc. We even implemented a simplified in-memory version of Kafka named <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/naffka">naffka</a>‚Äîuseful for glueing together the microservice components when running them all within a single binary.</p>
<p>Things were looking pretty positive by the summer of 2017: we had the server sending/receiving messages, federating with Synapse, and looking tantalisingly close:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We just sent the first ever synapse-&gt;dendrite federated traffic, including full dendrite media API (thumbnailing, fed, etc)!!! :D :D :D <a href="https://t.co/sBcM2jMAr6">pic.twitter.com/sBcM2jMAr6</a></p>&mdash; Matrix (@matrixdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/872861579141947392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2017</a></blockquote>
<p>However, we then hit three fairly major obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2017/07/07/a-call-to-arms-supporting-matrix">Matrix lost its funding</a></li>
<li>In the ensuing uncertainty, the two lead developers (Mjark &amp; Kegan) went to work elsewhere</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Matrix uptake was starting to explode and Synapse was failing to scale to handle the traffic on matrix.org (and elsewhere)</li>
</ul>
<p>At first, having formed what would become New Vector (now Element) to keep the rest of the core team hired, we pushed to see if we could get Dendrite finished fast enough to replace Synapse, with Erik &amp; richvdh jumping over from Synapse to pick up the remaining work.  However, it became clear that we urgently needed a quicker solution to address all the overloaded Synapses out there, and so they swung back to focus on improving Synapse (taking inspiration from some of the design of Dendrite - e.g. offloading endpoints onto worker processes connected via replication streams, and using <a href="https://opentracing.io/">OpenTracing</a> to debug traffic as it flows over the various services).</p>
<p>At this point, Dendrite maintenance was in effect valiantly taken over by the community, with Brendan and later Anoa keeping the ball going in 2017, joined by APWhitehat in GSoC 2018 and cnly in GSoC 2019.  The fact that Dendrite is now here today is thanks in no small part to their work to keep the project alive in its ‚Äúwilderness years‚Äù between Sept 2017 and Dec 2019.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it became clear that we were overdue getting Matrix itself out of beta - and the last thing we wanted to do was to split and dilute the implementation work of Matrix 1.0 over both Synapse and Dendrite - so we consciously made the decision to focus all our effort on Synapse for solving the remaining bugs and challenges.</p>
<p>Then, in July 2019, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation">Matrix and Synapse exited beta</a>, and we finally started to see light at the end of the tunnel.  In October we started dusting off Dendrite again - looking to use it as a relatively simple and flexible codebase for <a href="https://youtu.be/eA0KnTt4O7E?t=1423">experimenting with Peer-to-Peer Matrix</a>, not least because being Go it can compile to WebAssembly and run clientside, and because even though Dendrite was originally built with massive deployments in mind, it turns out the elastic scaling means it can also scale down pretty small too‚Äîas a part of the <a href="http://testflight.apple.com/join/Tgh2MEk6">iOS P2P demo</a>, we‚Äôve even ran full Dendrite homeservers on iPhones embedded into Element iOS! :)</p>
<p>In Dec 2019, we finally got to the point where Element could fund full-time dedicated development on Dendrite once again, with Neil Alexander joining the project and focusing fulltime on getting Dendrite out of alpha and getting it working for P2P and embedded usage (adding libp2p as a federation transport, and adding SQLite support) - and in Jan 2020 we got Dendrite <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/dip_p2p_matrix/">successfully running clientside in a WASM service worker</a> (just in time for FOSDEM!). Then, in Feb 2020, Kegan returned to the project to work fulltime on Dendrite - and the race began in earnest to get Dendrite ready for beta!</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a pretty picture courtesy of GitHub to visualise the progress:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-10-08-dendrite-contributors.png" alt="020-10-08-dendrite-contributors.png" /></p>
<p>Throughout 2020 there‚Äôs been a huge amount of stabilisation work and polish:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refactoring much of Dendrite‚Äôs foundation to make the codebase more maintainable</li>
<li>Created all-new user server, key server, signing key server microservices</li>
<li>Moving some work from existing microservices (ultimately superseding the former currentstateserver, publicroomsapi and typingserver microservices altogether)</li>
<li>Developing new testing infrastructure:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a> - our brand new Golang Matrix integration test harness</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/are-we-synapse-yet.py">Are We Synapse Yet</a> - an aggregator which parses sytest/complement output to compare how close Dendrite is to passing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All the Matrix 1.0 work - particularly state res v2 &amp; room version support</li>
<li>Making it work with more P2P transports for <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix/">all the exciting P2P experiments</a></li>
<li>Supporting backfill and fetching missing events</li>
<li>Fixing up SQLite support to make it work as a first class citizen (with shared storage code where we can!)</li>
<li>Supporting both sending and rejecting invites (even over federation)</li>
<li>E2E encryption support (one-time keys, device lists, send-to-device support)</li>
<li>Improved federation sender logic (resend retries, backoffs, blacklisting, metrics, resetting backoffs when receiving transactions)</li>
<li>Handling both inbound and outbound redactions</li>
<li>User interactive authentication (and implemented on various ‚Äòsudo‚Äô endpoints e.g. deleting devices and changing passwords)</li>
<li>Respecting server ACLs</li>
<li>Rejecting / soft-failing events properly</li>
<li>Support for database schema upgrades</li>
</ul>
<p>... which brings us at last to the present day (Oct 2020), as we declare Dendrite sufficiently stable that we consider it ready for beta testing!</p>
<p>In practice, this means **Dendrite is now ready for experimentation by adventurous Matrix sysadmins. It is <em>NOT</em> ready for production usage yet, but we need folks to test it and help us iron out the remaining bugs!  **Please do not trust it with sensitive data yet, and we don‚Äôt recommend trying to run it at scale yet as we haven‚Äôt done any serious optimisation work yet.</p>
<p>That said, we do provide the following guarantees:</p>
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre providing versioned releases from here on in, beginning with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.1.0">0.1.0</a></li>
<li>We don‚Äôt expect any major breaking changes to the config or architecture before 1.0</li>
<li>Ready for early adopters to try running Dendrite without experiencing ~daily breaking churn</li>
<li>The database schema is now stable and will upgrade itself going forwards - your database should now be here to stay! (assuming we don‚Äôt hit any nasty data loss bugs during beta)</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of comparison with Synapse, the main things you should get excited about are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite aims to provide an <strong>efficient</strong>, <strong>reliable</strong> and <strong>scalable</strong> alternative to Synapse:
<ul>
<li>Efficient: A small memory footprint with better baseline performance than an out-of-the-box Synapse</li>
<li>Reliable: Implements the Matrix specification as written, using the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">same test suite</a> as Synapse as well as a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">brand new Go test suite</a></li>
<li>Scalable: can run on multiple machines and eventually scale to massive homeserver deployments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This means significantly less memory usage than Synapse (depends on joined rooms, often between 50MB - 400MB resident memory) - although we haven‚Äôt tuned this at all yet!</li>
<li>All-new database model, where every microservice instance has its own database tables, letting them scale arbitrarily wide</li>
<li>The ability to efficiently use all your available CPU cores without needing to split into separate processes, thanks to Go and our extensive use of goroutines.  No more Python global interpreter lock! :)</li>
<li>Future experimental MSCs are likely to land in Dendrite before Synapse (e.g <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2753/proposals/2753-peeking-via-sync-v2.md">MSC2753 Peeking via /sync</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2444/proposals/2444-peeking-over-federation-peek-api.md">MSC2444 Peeking over Federation</a> are already being prototyped (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/1370">#1370</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/1391">#1391</a>) in Dendrite rather than Synapse!)</li>
</ul>
<p>The provisos you should know about however are:</p>

<li>We‚Äôre not feature complete yet: sytest reports 56% CS API coverage and 77% Federation coverage. <strong>NB: these are always going to be underestimates of how much Dendrite actually performs due to how the tests are spread out, in actuality it‚Äôs likely more 70% CS, 95% Fed.</strong></li>
<li>No read receipts, membership lazy-loading, presence, push notifications, search, event context, key backups, cross-signing. See changelog for full limitations.</li>
<li>Not battle-tested in the wild by many people (there are probably only ~10 dendrites on the open network today!) - so there‚Äôs likely to be a broad spectrum of bugs at first.</li>
<li>Clients that require more exotic features, like lazy loading, may not behave properly yet</li>
<li>Please <strong>use Postgres rather than SQLite wherever possible</strong>‚Äîit‚Äôs faster and has fewer issues regarding concurrency (some requests on SQLite Dendrites may 500 with ‚Äòdatabase is locked‚Äô - though we‚Äôve worked hard to eliminate most of these)</li>
<li>Dendrite can run in either ‚Äúmonolith‚Äù or ‚Äúpolylith‚Äù mode. In monolith, all the microservices are linked into a single binary - and <strong>we recommend running in this configuration wherever possible</strong> for now. Monolith mode is <em>extremely</em> capable as it is and has fewer moving parts for things to go wrong and will be the right choice for the majority of beta deployments!</li>
<li>Whilst Dendrite is nearly 100% federation compatible, there may still be situations where it will split-brain and disagree with the current room state that Synapse has calculated. We expect these issues to resolve as we get more user feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>Architecture-wise, this is what Dendrite looks like under the hood today:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-10-08-dendrite-arch.svg" alt="2020-10-08-dendrite-arch.svg" /></p>
<p>To get up and running, please install Go and head on over to the Get Started guide at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite#get-started">https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite#get-started</a> to join the fun :)</p>
<p>In terms of where we‚Äôre going next:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read receipts. It‚Äôs a major missing feature and impacts UX significantly.</li>
<li>100% Federation coverage (according to sytest). It‚Äôs crucial that Dendrite instances play nicely with other servers. This will be the best metric we have for asserting that we are just as capable as Synapse at the fed level.</li>
<li>Optimisation‚Äî<strong>Dendrite has not been optimised yet for speed or resource utilisation!</strong>
<ul>
<li>We plan to add benchmarks which will stress test different microservices in the presence of many different scaling factors (number of users, number of rooms, size of room, number of devices per user, number of sync requests, etc). This will hopefully allow us to identify early on bottlenecks and slow algorithms</li>
<li>Good old fashioned pprof with known slow scenarios to see what‚Äôs consuming CPU/memory and fixing issues ad-hoc (which we‚Äôve already done a bit of pre-beta). This may involve adding additional in-memory caches, with a healthy respect for the complexities it may introduce (which Synapse has been bitten by)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We plan to add first class feature flag support for experimental MSCs‚Äîexperimentation is one thing which makes Dendrite notably different from Synapse, and supporting it more thoroughly going forwards will be important. This may mean adding additional hooks; potentially a dedicated microservice to cleanly separate experiments, we don‚Äôt know yet</li>
<li>P2P work will continue with vigour now we have a working, featureful, and relatively stable HS to embed and play with</li>
</ul>
<p>Longer term, it‚Äôs pretty hard to say right now when we expect to exit beta (it took Synapse 5 years to exit beta, after all ;) - but obviously we‚Äôll need Dendrite to have parity with Synapse and have no known serious bugs.</p>
<p>Finally: you‚Äôre probably wondering what this means for Synapse.  Synapse is here to stay - with tens of thousands of deployments around the world serving tens of millions of users.  The majority of the core team is still focused on improving and optimising Synapse, and we‚Äôll be keeping improving it for the foreseeable.</p>
<p>However, we‚Äôll certainly be experimenting with new stuff on Dendrite first - whether that‚Äôs P2P, portable accounts, new-style communities, peeking etc.  We expect Synapse to be the stable long-term-supported solution, while Dendrite (particularly while in beta) will be the more unstable and experimental platform. In the longer term we‚Äôll provide ways of migrating from Synapse to Dendrite however (probably via portable accounts), and perhaps in future new deployments may choose to use Dendrite - a bit like you might choose to use nginx rather than Apache for a new web server these days. But this will be a long transition‚Äîmeanwhile we expect to see more and more next-generation homeservers like <a href="http://conduit.rs/">Conduit</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/mascarene/mascarene">Mascarene</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">Construct</a> coming of age too.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. If you‚Äôre an intrepid sysadmin please spin up a Dendrite and start filing bugs! :)</p>

<p>Internal API calls over HTTP in polylith mode now use their own HTTP client with higher timeouts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now tries harder to find missing auth events, using fetcher workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer falls back on <code>/state</code> unnecessarily, which was the cause of a major memory leak and high CPU usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation HTTP calls now include the <code>User-Agent</code> header</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The event <code>depth</code> field is now ignored in the federation API</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Registration flows now include the <code>completed</code> field after a failure (thanks <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug in the previous event updater in the roomserver has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where we didn't check our own old verify keys when verifying event signatures is fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where we didn't handle event ID domains being different to the event origin in earlier room versions has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLS fingerprints have been removed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jason:zemos.net">Jason</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix Construct supports aarch64 (ARMv8) architectures. The experience has been phenomenal, with performance exceeding all expectations. Last week I wrote about all new vector code inside Construct using SSE through AVX-512 hardware acceleration in servers; that same code is now accelerated by SVE (Scalable Vector Extensions) on ARM architectures when you compile with clang.</p>
<p>This result is important: ARM virtual machines are offered at a significantly lower price compared to x86 from the same vendor. The systems are cheaper, require less power, but generally perform worse. The trick is to optimize the software for the weaker hardware. The benefit allows, for example, Matrix server hosts running Construct to make th eir profit margin from the lower TCO, getting more out of every computing cycle.</p>

Now we are working on improving performance when sending messages to rooms, and also improving global UX, especially of the home (rooms list). Search messages (in clear rooms for the moment) is coming soon, and it will be also possible to filter the room members list.</p>
<p>We will also spend some time on the new Android SDK, https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2, which is for the moment a quick extract of what we have in Element Android. We have to take care of it as a real product now: document it properly, set up CI, export Javadoc, develop a sample app, etc.</p>

            <p><img src="/blog/img/2020-09-30-gitter.png" alt="Gitter ‚ô•Ô∏è Matrix" /></p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We are ridiculously excited to announce that <a href="https://gitter.im">Gitter</a> is joining the Matrix ecosystem and will become the first major existing chat platform to switch to natively speaking Matrix!</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre reading this from the Gitter community and have no idea what Matrix is: we‚Äôre an open source project that provides an open protocol for secure, decentralised communication - effectively the missing real-time communication layer of the open Web.  The open Matrix network has more than 20M users on it and is growing fast (adding another 1.7M or so with the arrival of Gitter!)</p>
<p>Gitter is easily one of the best developer community chat systems out there, used by the communities of some massive projects (<a href="https://gitter.im/nodejs/home">Node</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/Microsoft/TypeScript">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/angular/home">Angular</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/scala/home">Scala</a> etc) and is a custodian of huge archives of knowledge via their chat logs. Gitter is unique in specifically focusing on developers: their tagline is literally ‚ÄúWhere developers come to talk‚Äù (unlike Slack, which has barely any community features - or Discord, with its ban on unofficial clients, where developers are a bit of an afterthought relative to the gamers). With Gitter natively joining Matrix, we‚Äôre super excited to see the global developer community converging on the open Matrix network - and Gitter‚Äôs community rooms should see a huge new lease of life as they‚Äôre properly made natively available to the wider network as first class citizens :)</p>
<p>We‚Äôve always had a bit of a crush on Gitter ever since we ended up opposite each other in the exhibition hall at TechCrunch Disrupt Europe 2014 - particularly when they demoed us not only their sexy webapp but also their official IRC server bridge at irc.gitter.im :D  Over the years we‚Äôve been gently nudging them to consider fully embracing Matrix, but perhaps understandably they‚Äôve been busy focusing on their own stuff. However, earlier this year, our friends at GitLab (who acquired Gitter in 2017) reached out to explore the opportunity of Gitter becoming a core part of Matrix rather than a non-core project at GitLab‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôve jumped on that opportunity to bring Gitter fully into Matrix.</p>
<p>In practice, the way this is happening is that Element (the company founded by the Matrix core team to fund Matrix development) is acquiring Gitter from GitLab, with a combined Gitter and Element dev team focusing on giving Gitter a new life in Matrix!  You can read about it from the Element angle over on <a href="https://element.io/blog/gitter-is-joining-element/">the Element blog</a>.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, we have a pretty interesting plan here, which we‚Äôd like to be very transparent about given it‚Äôs a little unusual:</p>
<p>At first, Gitter will keep running as it always has - needless to say, we will be doing everything we can to delight the Gitter community and keep the service in good shape.</p>
<p>Then we‚Äôre going to build out native Matrix connectivity - running a dedicated Matrix homeserver on gitter.im with a new bridge direct into the heart of Gitter; letting all Gitter rooms be available to Matrix directly as (say) #angular_angular:gitter.im, and bridging all the historical conversations into Matrix via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2716/proposals/2716-importing-history-into-existing-rooms.md">MSC2716</a> or similar. We will of course do this entirely as open source, just as Gitter itself is open source thanks to GitLab releasing it under the MIT license in 2017. The plan is to comprehensively document our progress as the flagship worked example case study of ‚Äúhow do you make an existing chat system talk Matrix.‚Äù</p>
<p>This will of course replace the old and creaky <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter">matrix-appservice-gitter</a> bridge we‚Äôve been running since 2016. Gitter users will also be able to talk to other users elsewhere in the open Matrix network - e.g. DMing them, and (possibly) joining arbitrary Matrix rooms. Effectively, <strong>Gitter will have become a Matrix client</strong>.</p>
<p>Now we come to the interesting bit. Gitter has some <em>really</em> nice features which are sorely lacking in Element today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant live room peeking (less than a second to load the webapp into a live-view of a massive room with 20K users!!)</li>
<li>Seamless onboarding thanks to using GitLab &amp; GitHub for accounts</li>
<li>Curated hierarchical room directory</li>
<li>Magical creation of rooms on demand for every GitLab and GitHub project ever</li>
<li>GitLab/GitHub activity as a first-class citizen in a room‚Äôs side-panel</li>
<li>Excellent search-engine-friendly static content and archives</li>
<li>KaTeX support for Maths communities</li>
<li>Threads!</li>
</ul>
<p>...and we promise to do everything in our power to preserve and honour these features at all costs and continue to give the Gitter community the experience they‚Äôve come to know and love.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>: in the medium/long term, it‚Äôs simply not going to be efficient for the combined Element/Gitter team to split our efforts maintaining two high-profile Matrix clients. Our plan is instead to merge Gitter‚Äôs features into Element (or next generations of Element) itself and then - if and only if Element has achieved parity with Gitter based on the above list - we expect to upgrade the deployment on gitter.im to a Gitter-customised version of Element. The inevitable side-effect is that we‚Äôll be adding new features to Element rather than Gitter going forwards.</p>
<p>In practice, the main outcome in the end should be Element having benefited massively from levelling up with Gitter - and Gitter benefiting massively from all the goodies which Element and Matrix brings, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>E2E Encryption</li>
<li>Reactions</li>
<li>Constantly improving native iOS &amp; Android clients (which should be a welcome alternative to Gitter‚Äôs natives ones, which are <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/issues/2281">already being deprecated</a>)</li>
<li>VoIP and conferencing</li>
<li>All the alternative clients, bots, bridges and servers in Matrix</li>
<li>The full open standard Matrix API</li>
<li>Widgets (embedding webapps into rooms!)</li>
<li>...and of course participation in the wider decentralised Matrix network.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there you have it. It‚Äôs a new era for Gitter - and we look forward to reinvigorating Gitter‚Äôs communities over the coming months. We hope Gitter users will be blown away by the features arriving from Matrix‚Ä¶ and we hope that Element users will be ecstatic with the performance and polish work that Gitter-parity will drive us towards. Imagine having guest access in Element that can launch and load a massive room in less than a second!</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to explicitly reassure the Gitter community again that we love and understand Gitter (it was one of the very first ever bridges we wrote for Matrix, for instance) - and we will be doing everything we can to not screw up our responsibility in looking after it. Please, please let us know if you have any concerns or if we ever fall short on this.</p>
<p>Any questions, come talk to us on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gitter:matrix.org">#gitter:matrix.org</a> - which is bridged with <a href="https://gitter.im/matrix-org/gitter">https://gitter.im/matrix-org/gitter</a>.  Exciting times ahead!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week has mostly been spent trying to improve stability and to fix bugs ahead of the beta release, which is so far still planned to go ahead in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Room version 6 is now the default for newly created rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soft-fail of events that aren't allowed by the current room state is now implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for configuring <code>old_verify_keys</code> has been added to the Dendrite config</p>

<p>Initial support for peeking over federation (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2444">MSC2444</a>) is in progress and it &quot;even works!&quot; (thanks Matthew!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federated joins will now continue being processed even if the client gives up on the join due to a HTTP timeout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backoff code has been refactored a bit more, and now correctly affects device list syncing</p>

<li>
<p><code>/make_join</code> now errors correctly if a federated user tries to join a room which all members have left</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where a single user could start multiple simultaneous federated joins to the same room has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some initial (but unfinished) support for the <code>/key/v2/query</code> notary endpoint has been added</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signature verification has been updated to not fail if the event <code>origin</code> field is missing (although it still requires a signature from the domain of the <code>sender</code> field)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of places where we use SQL transactions have been updated with safe wrappers (thanks <a href="https://github.com/samcday">samcday</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A couple of error codes on invite endpoints for room version 6 JSON violations have been fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly for federation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 77%, up from 74% last week</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/22/synapse-1-20-0-released">1.20.0</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.1">1.20.1</a>) highlights include shadow banning support and including unread message counts in the sync response. This will help client developers and is a precursor to improving notification support.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also been looking at adding monitoring to get a better sense of which rooms are most expensive from a state resolution perspective, we also want a better way to track federation lag.</p>
<p>Up next we‚Äôll move all background tasks away from the main process and try it out on matrix.org, we are hoping for a 10-15% saving in CPU. Event persistence sharding, specifically the new stream token format is on hold slightly while we work on a nasty race condition on start up of the event persister. We hope to get back to the main sharding project next week.</p>

<h3 id="the-construct">The Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jason:zemos.net">Jason</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix concludes a summer of Construct where several transformative rounds of optimization took place. I'd like to talk about these achievements and why they are important for
future directions.</p>
<p>Over the summer, Construct introduced new vector extensions to the project. As server software, our primary target is the datacenter which (for now) is dominated by x86 hardware. The latest features of x86 chips include AVX-2, AVX-512, and on-die GPU. These advancements are important because they help mitigate current limitations of hardware, such as the cubic relationship between a processor's frequency and its power consumption. These limitations mean that CPU cores aren't completing more cycles-per-second every iteration of their development -- they're not getting much faster.</p>
<p>The problem with threads is that they can introduce a lot of complications to a project. Construct is able to forego multi-threading as a network server because it is primarily IO-bound. The benefits to a single-thread design in both performance and simplicity cannot be overstated. This is why Construct stands to benefit the most from features which allow more work to be accomplished at every individual computing cycle.</p>
<p>Construct undertook several endeavors over the summer which directly leverage platforms featuring SSE, AVX, AVX-512, etc. As an added bonus, our approach is designed to effortlessly port to ARM's Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) as it becomes available (inside datacenters too!). Our focus has been JSON, Unicode, and finally Base64. Detailed explanations for each of these will need to be discussed in their own posts, but in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Matrix specifies a canonical form of JSON which is not necessarily the same as the JSON the server receives. Therefor it is imperative that Construct is liberal with what JSON it accepts and correct with its transformation into canonical JSON. Over the summer, a portion of Construct's canonical transform received some optimization to go beyond the default method of character-by-character read-modify-write. As seen in [1], a streaming hardware-accelerated transform now processes at least 16 characters at a time (with more possible) without forward branching except for the parts where transformation needs to occur. One of these transformations is UTF-16 to UTF-8 surrogate conversion, which leads into the second endeavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construct introduced a completely branch-free Unicode toolset in [2]. Among the functions offered is a custom transform of UTF-16 surrogate pairs to UTF-8 sequences. Using the new vector registers, Construct can transform two UTF-16 surrogates in parallel to output two UTF-8 sequences, or two UTF-16 surrogates in a pair to output one UTF-8 sequence. Unfortunately, these specific functions were written at fixed vector widths, so more work needs to be done to really take advantage of the widest hardware. Each surrogate is 6 bytes, and a surrogate pair is 12 bytes; therefor we cannot make use of the last 4 bytes of a 16 byte vector. However, with a little more work this approach can be extended to a 64 byte vector, capable of decoding 5 surrogate pairs and 10 individual surrogates in parallel!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professor Daniel Lemire recently published a paper about fast Base64 from hardware acceleration in [3]. This approach is extremely elegant on the 64-byte-wide AVX-512 system. Prior to Construct's implementation of this in [4], the Boost library base64 encoding and decoding took roughly 20 and 25 cycles per character respectively. Our implementation on the same system, an old system with only SSE2 (not even AVX-512!) yields 5 and 6 cycles per character!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this helps lay a foundation for Construct to introduce Federated Media Rooms sometime in the future. Currently, Construct stores media in a separate database. Recently there's been work on a separate branch at [5] which stores actual file block inside events using Base64. It is for this reason sub-cycle and branchless JSON parsing and Base64 encoding is essential for maximum performance. The result is worthwhile, as the latency for querying the media database is slower than parsing and decoding the event content already in-hand.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Construct is available at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct</a> and don't forget to idle and perform <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:maunium.net">#construct:maunium.net</a></p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I present you a new project I've been working on for some time. It's a bot that allows you to use the admin API through matrix, by typing commands to the bot. The inspiration comes from the OperServ-like bots that allow IRC operators to administrate an IRC server.</p>
<p>The bot exposes some of the available admin APIs and aims to provide some more high level commands by combining different APIs. There is currently one &quot;high level command&quot;, <code>!room garbage-collect</code>, which allow you to purge from your HS all rooms without local users.</p>
<p>The project is written in crystal and is my first project in this language. It should be stable in normal conditions, but don't hesitate to fill issues. A Docker image is provided for more convenience.</p>
<p>I hope you will find this project useful üôÇ</p>

<p>It supports E2EE and can be easily extended with Python plugins. Can be used e.g. for GitLab notifications, automated user invites, room creation, and of course can be programmed to react to any message posted in a room.</p>

<p>Soru made a new thing, <a href="https://gitlab.com/Sorunome/matrix-gotify">matrix-gotify</a>. It is a <a href="https://gotify.net/">gotify</a> plugin to receive matrix notifications. This means, you can now receive matrix push notifications on your android phone self-hosted without the need of google services! That is why putting the full event in the push notification is actually not a privacy leak in this case.</p>
<p>This plugin could also be used to receive push notifications on any other kind of device that gotify supports.</p>
<p>Please note that this is independent of any matrix client - you don't even need to run one to be able to use this!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked whether an <a href="https://bubu1.eu/openpush/">OpenPush</a>-like solution be
built on top of this , and Sorunome responded that someone had already
started working on just that! https://github.com/gotify/android/pull/115</p>
<p>This would allow other matrix clients on your phone to get their push
notifications through your gotify client, instead of needing to run a process
each. Great for battery life without proprietary Google blobs!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@js:nil.im">js</a> got Synapse running in a car on a German highway:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-09-25-njVLa-matrix_car.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the setup is a cigarette lighter to 2x 230V converter, one being used to power the RockPro64, the other being used to power my notebook. My notebook is connected to the hotspot from my phone, while also being connected to a USB ethernet, the other end of which is plugged into the RockPro64. </p>
<p>The notebook then acts as a gateway, as well as SSHing to a tiny VPS with -R, to get a public port, and forwarding that traffic to the RockPro64.</p>

<p>Maybe one day we'll all have an embedded Synapse homeserver in our cars. P2P E2EE

<p>I have been through the perils of setting up a TURN server and having VoIP continue to fail, whilst spending hours scratching my head and staring at Wireshark without getting anywhere. When I was given free reign over project choice last year during my internship, I chose to start a tool that tests your homeserver's VoIP configuration, hoping it would be useful to both me and the community at large.</p>
<p>It saw some progress but I never managed to iron out some of the 'last few things' or put a pretty front on it ‚Äî until about 2 weeks ago, when I got some more time to do it.</p>
<p>There are known issues ‚Äî such as the scores being very arbitrary, wrong and misleading; it crashes Chromium every time (on my machine) and it completely misbehaves in Brave Browser (on my machine). It may also not be the prettiest (but hopefully it is at least somewhat inoffensive). I hope to work on these annoying issues soon.</p>
<p>I have deployed a test instance at <a href="https://test.voip.librepush.net">https://test.voip.librepush.net</a> ‚Äî it can be tried in a WebRTC-supporting browser (probably Firefox if you want half a chance). Please don't take it to heart if you get a Fail or Poor score ‚Äî it's probably not your fault. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oliver was interning with us at Element this Summer. Fixing up and releasing
this VoIP tester was part of it, but he's still working on it in his spare
time even though his internship has finished :)</p>
<p>Through this I found out that I forgot to turn on my turnserver on my
homeserver again. Thanks Oliver!</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.20.0 is here!</p>
<p>Highlights of 1.20.0 include:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Shadow ban support.</li>
<li>Unread message counts in the sync response to help our client developers, this is a precursor to improving notification support.</li>
<li>No less than 28 async/await PRs, so we can finally share all the hard work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also take note that in a future release, we will be dropping support for accessing Synapse's Admin API using the <code>/_matrix/client/* prefixes</code>. More details follow in the changelog.</p>
<p>Get the new releases from any of the usual sources mentioned at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md. 1.20.0 is on github <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.0">here</a>, and 1.20.0rc4 is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.0rc4">here</a>.</p>
<p>The changelog for 1.20.0 is as follows:</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-20-0-2020-09-22">Synapse 1.20.0 (2020-09-22)</h1>
<p>No significant changes since v1.20.0rc5.</p>
<h2 id="removal-warning">Removal warning</h2>
<p>Historically, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/master/docs">Synapse Admin API</a> has been accessible under the <code>/_matrix/client/api/v1/admin</code>, <code>/_matrix/client/unstable/admin</code>, <code>/_matrix/client/r0/admin</code> and <code>/_synapse/admin</code> prefixes. In a future release, we will be dropping support for accessing Synapse's Admin API using the <code>/_matrix/client/*</code> prefixes. This makes it easier for homeserver admins to lock down external access to the Admin API endpoints.</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-20-0rc5-2020-09-18">Synapse 1.20.0rc5 (2020-09-18)</h1>

<h2 id="removal-warning-1">Removal warning</h2>
<p>Some older clients used a <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1#post-matrix-client-r0-register-email-requesttoken">disallowed character</a> (<code>:</code>) in the <code>client_secret</code> parameter of various endpoints.

            <p>This is part of a series of reports on the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696"><em>six</em> projects</a> assigned to Matrix for Google Summer of Code 2020.</p>
<p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696/#5911643604647936">View project: Moving <code>matrix-ircd</code> to async/await and <code>futures</code> 0.3</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The goal of this project was to port <code>matrix-ircd</code> from the outdated combinators style of <code>futures</code> 0.1 to the new-and-improved style of <code>futures</code> 0.3. As initially proposed, this greatly improves code readability and removes the convoluted compiler errors that were pervasive in <code>futures</code> 0.1</p>
<h2 id="matrix-ircd">matrix-ircd</h2>
<p>The matrix-ircd project functions as a bridge between two chat platforms: Internet relay chat (irc) and Matrix. matrix-ircd lets you use any standard IRC Client to communicate with Matrix chatrooms and direct messages.</p>
<h2 id="mentors">Mentors</h2>
<p>This project is mentored by Philipp Mandler (<a href="https://github.com/phlmn">@phlmn</a>) and Jonas Platte (<a href="https://github.com/jplatte">@jplatte</a>). I would like to thank them for the helpful advice and code reviews they have given me over the course of GSoC 2020.</p>
<h2 id="project-results">Project Results</h2>
<p>Since much of the code was written in late 2016, there were many portions of the code that were unidiomatic and produced compiler errors. The first step I made was to remove all compiler errors from <code>cargo</code> and <code>clippy</code> in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/pull/64">#64</a>.</p>
<p>Additional tests were then written in various parts of the codebase to ensure that the upgrade would produce the same results. These changes were made in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/pull/65">#64</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/pull/66">#66</a>.</p>
<p>Since the project master branch currently used a custom http implementation, I moved it to use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hyper">hyper</a>, a fast and correct http implementation that already supported async/await. Additionally, I moved the module that most utilized http, <code>matrix</code>, to async-await and the new <code>hyper</code> code. Not only did these changes shrink the code by ~700 lines, they also removed a lot of unnecessary complexity. These changes were made in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/pull/67">#67</a>.</p>
<p>The last large module remaining, <code>irc</code>, was then ported to <code>irc</code>, along with its dependencies in <code>stream_fold.rs</code> and its upstream user in the <code>bridge</code> module. The most exciting part of these changes was the removal of the <code>futures</code> 0.1 dependency. All code was now running in <code>futures</code> 0.3! These changes also moved away from <a href="https://github.com/erikjohnston/tasked-futures">tasked-futures</a> which further improved code readability. This PR was in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/pull/71">#71</a>.</p>
<p>Since the bulk of the changes were now complete, I moved onto bug fixes. As <a href="github.com/jplatte">@jplatte</a> mentioned in #71, the current single threaded approach to the application was not ideal. In <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/pull/72">#72</a> I updated all code to be multithreaded-compatible.</p>
<p>Lastly, In <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/pull/77">#77</a> I included more tests to functions with heavy changes, added additional logging, removed unnecessary complexity that was introduced to keep code as &quot;1:1&quot; as possible, and added TLS support to <code>hyper</code> so that https would work. This patch also fixed a rather difficult bug regarding the irc TCP streams and the buffer they were reading into.</p>
<h2 id="remaining-work">Remaining Work</h2>
<p>Based on my personal testing there is <em>no additional work</em> to be done in the realm of updating to async/await. All tests pass and the IRC server and matrix bridge function as expected. @jplatte kindly announced in the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix#matrix-ircd---call-for-testing">This Week In Matrix</a> blog that we will be conducting public testing of the <code>async_await</code> branch on github. Barring any issues the async/await code should be merged into the master branch in the next few weeks.</p>
