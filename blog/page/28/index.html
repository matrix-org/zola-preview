<h3 id="p2p-dendrite">P2P / Dendrite</h3>
<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The P2P Yggdrasil iOS demo has seen some improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Federation sender blacklists are now persisted which is important as the iOS app will be frequently terminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQLite3 now uses <code>TransactionWriters</code> in more places to reduce the amount of 'database is locked' issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation sender has had much of its storage code refactored and de-duplicated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there has been much work getting Dendrite to support E2E rooms, which it now mostly does.</p>
<p>You can create and join E2E rooms and have a conversation locally, though there's issues with it over federation. In addition,
Dendrite currently lacks device lists so adding new devices may result in unable-to-decrypt errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Send-to-device events now work over federation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Device key uploads and querying now work both locally and over federation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One-time key uploads and claiming now work both locally and over federation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is up from last week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client Server APIs: 49%, up from 48%.</li>
<li>Federation APIs: 53%, up from 51%.</li>
</ul>

<p>Doesn't it feel like we'll be using Dendrite in the wild really soon now?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we continued on our async/await athon, you can track progress <a href="https://patrick.cloke.us/areweasyncyet/">here</a>, expect steady progress over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>We dusted off the notifications project working with our pals in the Element client teams to ensure that the push rule defaults make sense. On the flip side we made further improvements to Sygnal and will merge the ability to have it sit behind a proxy rsn. </p>
<p>We are also trying to figure out how media retention limits should work in Synapse.</p>
<p>Up next is to continue our performance push. We need to spend time between pulling things off the master process as well sharding the event persister. We will continue with notifications and maybe finally squash <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2528">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2528</a></p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello people. It's been a while since I've talked about a new bridge...or actually any bridges. Fear not, now you can hear both! Today I'm announcing the birth of another project <code>matrix-figma</code>.  <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a> is an online collaborative design tool. It was created to scratch an itch with the Element design team, who wanted to see comments appear in their Matrix rooms in realtime when someone commented on a Figma file.</p>
<p>The bridge works by first joining it to an &quot;admin room&quot;, which functions as a permitted user list. The bot can then be invited to any other room so long as the invitee is in that admin room, and can then ask the bot to start directing comment notifications into the room.</p>
<p>The room uses room state to hold configuration, so you can host the bot as a docker container anywhere without the need for any support files!</p>
<p>I can announce that the bridge is now functional for simple use cases such as these, with more interesting functionality in the future.</p>
<p>Please check out <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-figma">https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-figma</a> to see if the bridge is right for you :)</p>

<h3 id="slack-matrix-migration">slack-matrix-migration</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@rda:phys.ethz.ch">Sven</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I opened a <a href="https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/slack-matrix-migration/pull/5">PR</a> for <a href="https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/slack-matrix-migration">https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/slack-matrix-migration</a>, which makes it compatible with recent <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> versions and adds new config options allowing to effectively import a Slack workspace history to an existing homeserver via federation.</p>
<p>This Python project was initially intended for a full migration from Slack to a new Matrix homeserver and allows reusing the imported user accounts. We have some research groups using Slack that would like to import their Slack workspace history to our Matrix homeserver. This PR allows to import a (free) Slack export to a fresh and empty Synapse instance that is federated with our main homeserver. We do not need a full &quot;migration&quot;: we kick all imported users and invite the existing Matrix users from our homeserver.</p>
<p>Two groups already imported the history and switched to Matrix, one more is in queue and probably more to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a really, really exciting development, and the context for which Sven is expecting to use it is BIG, I can't wait til we can share more about it!</p>

<p>The Twitter DM bridge I announced last week mostly works now. It does text and reaction bridging in both directions, twitter-&gt;matrix media bridging, end-to-bridge encryption and backfilling. I also added support for it in <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-manager">mautrix-manager</a> for web-based login.</p>

<p>Last week, we forgot to announce that we renamed the Riot-iOS app to Element but this is not a surprise anymore. The app version is now 1.0.0. This change came with a lot of UI tweaks like new icons and new colors.</p>
<p>Since then, we made bug fixes we will release soon. This week, we also worked on PIN protection for the app, including support of Touch ID and Face ID.</p>

<p>We weren't in TWIM for a while, but that doesn't mean no progress! Apart from Devin's constant work on ruma-events, there was also some movement in ruma-identifiers and ruma-client-api, with the former seeing a new release, <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/releases/tag/ruma-identifiers-0.17.0">0.17.0</a>.</p>
<p>We're planning to do more releases next week, and hopefully a 0.1 release of the ruma crate that provides a simpler entry point by re-exporting everything else, in one of the weeks after that. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>It's been a while since it's come up, but <a href="https://github.com/dali99/matrix-wug">matrix-wug</a> is a bot capable of transcribing characters writable via normal keyboards to scripts from other languages/notation systems</p>
<p>It supports: x-sampa, z-sampa, proto-indo-european, Inuktitut, and I√±upiatun.</p>
<p>Now it also supports hiragana! The romanization system is something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C4%81puro_r%C5%8Dmaji">WƒÅpuro r≈çmaji</a>, but sticks to Nihon-shiki when in doubt.</p>
<p>I want this transcription to be forgiving, so if you find it not transcribing something in a way you'd expect it to, feel free to DM me!</p>
<p>To use it use the <code>hi</code> key with a delimiter like <code>/x/</code> or <code>[]</code></p>

<p>This bot is not about adapting the current jitsi integration provided by Element IM as widget.</p>

You'll need to create a user and invite you in each room where you want to create a jitsi room url respecting the matrix power levels in the room.</p>
<p>When the service is running invite the bot and send message <code>!jitsi-jwt</code> </p>
<p>If you are a moderator in the room (alias you have enough power levels to redact messages), then you will get a direct message from bot with the url to jitsi
room with the jwt get parameter.</p>

<p>This week was the announcement of the much-awaited rebrand: <a href="https://element.io/blog/welcome-to-element/">Riot is now Element</a>. In fact, three brands are coalescing into one: Riot and New Vector will be referred to as Element, while the SaaS platform known as Modular.im is now <a href="https://element.io/matrix-services">Element Matrix Services</a>.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>Matrix</strong> is <em>not</em> involved in this change. Matrix is still Matrix, don't worry about that!</p>

<p>CommCon is an event dedicated to Real-Time Communications. In 2020 they made the difficult decision to go online-only, but had a fear of missing out on the &quot;hallway-track&quot; that is so important to industry events. Their solution was to include a live chat to run alongside their streamed talks! </p>
<p>Matrix was a natural choice for the crowd, but they wanted a way to encourage viewers to join the correct room from their own Matrix clients. To do this, they used the GSOC project from arnav-t - an HTML Embedded client - to present a live scrolling-view of the chat. You can see the result at <a href="https://2020.commcon.xyz/live/">https://2020.commcon.xyz/live/</a>.</p>

<h4 id="the-end-is-nigh">The End is Nigh</h4>
<p>This week in the ruma/matrix Google Summer of Code project, I worked on refactoring both <code>ruma-api</code> and <code>ruma-events</code>. After moving some of the larger chunks of the <code>ruma_api_macro::api::Api::to_tokens</code> method to helper functions, I spent time removing repetition from the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/109">Request/Response</a> code generated by the <code>ruma_api!</code> macro. For <code>ruma-events</code>, the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/121">input parsing</a> was changed to only allow valid names for the <code>Any*Event</code> enums. Altering the input parsing had the added benefit of replacing all of the string comparison and manipulation with strongly typed comparison and manipulation.</p>
<p>The final few issues to be resolved before the next crates.io release for <code>ruma-events</code> can happen are related to redacted events. Support for <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/114">redacted events</a> was added to the <code>Any*Event</code> enums, they now have redacted variants of each event kind. A few follow-up PR's have been merged to fully integrate redacted events into <code>ruma-events</code>, fixing specific event <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/128">deserialization issues</a> and splitting the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/135">UnsignedData</a> struct into <code>Unsigned</code> and <code>RedactedUnsigned</code>.</p>

<p>Aside from that we also shipped shardable push and frontend proxy workers as both were starting to max out on CPU as well as a shardable client reader, allowing us to shard registration which was especially important this week :) </p>
<p>Finally we moved typing notifications from the master process and optimised incoming replication queuing to buy us a little more head room.</p>
<p>Next steps are to revisit where all the remaining cycles are going on the master process. To help us profile we are migrating to async/await semantics and Patrick produced this natty <a href="https://patrick.cloke.us/areweasyncyet/">graph</a> to track progress.</p>

<p>Outside of performance we shipped a bug fix to prevent large initial syncs taking out the synchrotrons. The admin api sprouted an end point to list room members (thanks <a href="https://github.com/awesome-michael">awesome-michael</a>and the ability to reactivate previously deactivated users. </p>
<p>Coming up we‚Äôll dust off the notifications project which has been put on hold while Riot transmogrified into Element and we‚Äôll continue with chipping away at the master process.</p>

<p>I started working on a Twitter DM bridge that uses the internal API instead of the complicated official one. It should be easier to set up than bridges using the official API, since there won't be a need to get API keys and forward webhooks. The main risk is that Twitter doesn't like people using the internal API and starts blocking users like Facebook does, but hopefully that doesn't happen.</p>
<p>So far I've only made a simple library for the API, but the bridge should be usable by the next TWIM. The bridge and API library are at <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-twitter">https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-twitter</a> and there's a discussion room at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twitter:maunium.net">#twitter:maunium.net</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last couple of weeks I have been working on the next P2P demo, using <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/">Yggdrasil</a> as the transport instead of <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a>. Although libp2p is arguably more featureful in many ways, Yggdrasil does have one major benefit in that it provides full overlay routing. Participants in the network can carry traffic on behalf of other participants, resulting in something much closer to a true mesh network.</p>
<p>The mad science doesn't end there however. I've also built a custom Riot iOS build that includes the full Dendrite P2P demo (yes, that's a homeserver running locally on your phone). If you have an iPhone or iPad, it's available in <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/Tgh2MEk6">public TestFlight right now</a> and you can play with it!</p>
<p>The demo still is very experimental and has a number of bugs still (including but not limited to messages occasionally taking a while to deliver, the app crashing when going into the background sometimes etc.) but we'll be improving it further in the coming weeks and it's quite fun to play with, particularly if you can do so with other people nearby.</p>
<p>Thanks to the same technology that powers AirDrop, the demo will automatically find and connect to other nearby devices running the demo and build up a network automatically - even if you are not on the same Wi-Fi network (or indeed connected to Wi-Fi at all)! If you don't have any other nearby peers to test with then fear not - you can still configure a public static peer in the app settings and join the wider network that way.</p>
<p>With any luck the room directory will even work too, showing published rooms from other nearby devices. If not, try joining <code>#beachparty:b5ae50589e50991dd9dd7d59c5c5f7a4521e8da5b603b7f57076272abc58b374</code> from within the app.</p>

<h3 id="a-new-way-to-test-homeservers-complement">A new way to test homeservers - <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of you know that I work on a Go homeserver called <strong>Dendrite</strong>, and so I've had to get familiar with <strong>SyTest</strong>: a black-box homeserver integration testing project. Unfortunately SyTest has a number of problems: from the dialect of perl, lack of documentation for federation bits, the inability to run a single test, and so on. Having a solid black-box integration testing project is crucial for the ecosystem to ensure spec compliance (and hence compatibility between server implementations) and for making all servers more stable and reliable.</p>
<p>As a side project I've been working on a modern Go rewrite called <strong>Complement</strong> which is now ready for a bit more exposure. It currently only has a handful of SyTests converted but I hope to rapidly expand the number in the coming weeks. Complement makes heavy use of Docker to agnostically run homeservers, and already includes a Dockerfile for configuring a Dendrite instance. To try it out, clone the repo and run:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>(cd dockerfiles &amp;&amp; docker build -t complement-dendrite -f Dendrite.Dockerfile .)
</span><span>
</span><span>COMPLEMENT_BASE_IMAGE=complement-dendrite:latest go test -v ./tests
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you're interested in learning more and maybe adding some tests check out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/blob/master/ONBOARDING.md">ONBOARDING.md</a>.</p>
<p>My overall hope is that Complement will lower the barrier to entry when adding tests by so much that it encourages any bugfix/feature in any homeserver implementation to result in a new test. This will benefit everyone and create a feedback loop which will make Matrix even more reliable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asked about Sytest and SyTS, Kegan added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complement currently implements the same tests as sytest, so tests which pass sytest will pass complement (though that will diverge as complement will guard against more race conditions by default). There's about 9 different kinds of tests currently testing CS-API and Federation (outbound to a dummy server and inbound via a federation client)</p>
<p>The problem with SyTS was that the test tooling around it ultimately wasn't expressive enough. I was using Jest and kept finding myself fighting it by bumping up against issues like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/8751">https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/8751</a> and the multi-process parallelisation stuff was too opaque. The assertion helper functions also lacked context because they rely on behavioural testing names like <code>describe(&quot;foo&quot;) { it(&quot;should say bar&quot;) { ... }</code> etc so when your assertion fails (eg wrong value for a JSON key using assert equals) it just says unhelpfully &quot;foo != bar&quot; where what I really want is to know what it actually does say then, and other contextual info around the object (maybe the key name was typod). When I realised that the assertion lib didn't have this and I'd need to add it, coupled with parallelisation concerns and head-desking against Jest, I found myself wishing I just used something else. I stuck with it though and then realised that all the federation stuff (signature checking, canonical JSON, etc) would need to re-implemented when I knew I had working code in Go. Both of these things combined and I thought &quot;you know what, I'm just going to do this in Go&quot; but you'll note that the architecture is identical, so SyTS lives on as an early prototype for Complement ;)</p>

This was especially annoying when I wanted to test a specific language, like Japanese, and I couldn't figure out the right LANG* variables to set the language to Japanese in Nheko. Turns out, this was a bug in Nheko and you wouldn't have guessed so, when looking at the examples in the Qt documentation.

<blockquote>
<p>When I initially implemented end-to-bridge encryption in mautrix-python, I used matrix-nio in a slightly hacky way to get it done quickly. It worked fine in some cases, but also caused some undecryptable messages. I tried switching to using matrix-nio's crypto module directly, but the sans-I/O design made that difficult: there were too many parts that needed to be hooked up to the actual I/O and I wasn't able to find them all. In the end, I just decided to implement the basic e2ee stuff directly in mautrix-python the same way it's implemented in mautrix-go.</p>
<p>All my bridges based on mautrix-python (Telegram, Facebook and Hangouts) have been switched to use the new crypto stuff. After a few initial bugs that are already fixed, it seems to work better than the old system. I'll probably add native e2ee to maubot soon too, which is my last main project that's still missing e2ee.</p>

<p>I wrote a pretty simple Matrix bot in Rust which is loosely based on Cat Disruptor 6000. It will react with üêàÔ∏è to any message containing the string &quot;cat&quot; *. Since it is a small project, I hope it can be used as an example for other people interested in writing Matrix bots in Rust.

            <p>Synapse 1.16.0 is here!</p>
<p>Notable additions in 1.16.0 include:-</p>
<ul>
<li>An important performance fix to improve room state resolution.</li>
<li>An option to enable e2e by default for new rooms.</li>
<li>Ability to run multiple media repo workers side by side.</li>
<li>Ability to mark specific content as being safe from quarantine.</li>
<li>Bug fixes to make migrating from SQLite to Postgres more reliable - if you are running sqlite for anything other than evaluation purposes then please migrate!</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, we have deprecated the <code>m.login.jwt</code> login method in favour of <code>org.matrix.login.jwt</code> see the changelog for more details.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>Get the new releases from any of the usual sources mentioned at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md. 1.16.0 is on github <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.16.0">here</a>.</p>
<p>Changelog for 1.16.0 follows:</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-16-0-2020-07-08">Synapse 1.16.0 (2020-07-08)</h1>
<p>No significant changes since 1.16.0rc2.</p>
<p>Note that this release deprecates the <code>m.login.jwt</code> login method, renaming it to <code>org.matrix.login.jwt</code>, as <code>m.login.jwt</code> is not part of the Matrix spec. Otherwise the behaviour is identical. Synapse will accept both names for now, but this may change in a future release.</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-16-0rc2-2020-07-02">Synapse 1.16.0rc2 (2020-07-02)</h1>
<p>Synapse 1.16.0rc2 includes the security fixes released with Synapse 1.15.2.

<p>This week has seen some new architectural changes and a number of bugs fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new Current State Server component has been added, which tracks room state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Public Rooms API has been deprecated in favour of the Current State Server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event size limits are now honoured with the correct return code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invites have seen some refactoring and retiring invites should work better now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federation sender now persists unsent PDUs to the database and will automatically retry when Dendrite is restarted, making resend behaviour much more reliable (particularly in the P2P demos)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some room checks in <code>/state</code> and <code>/state_ids</code> have been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some additional restrictions have been added to <code>/send</code> and we now return the correct error codes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where current state was incorrectly used when getting missing/backfill events has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where you couldn't rejoin a room that you created after wiping your database has been fixed</p>

<p>Did you ever have the issue that a media event sent from someone is too large for your HS and you don't want to fiddle with the link?</p>

<p>If you reply to any media event with <code>!ipfs</code> the bot will send you a link to the media stored on ipfs.</p>
<p>Known issues are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>E2EE not yet working (It joins but can't yet decrypt the related event)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Error handling is basically not existent. Therefore crashes might happen until I sort this out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It currently does very verbose logging. This will be removed when the bot is more stable</p>

            <p>Folks, today we are releasing Synapse 1.15.2, which is a security release which contains fixes to two separate problems. We are also putting out the second release candidate for the forthcoming Synapse 1.16, including the same fixes.</p>
<p>Firstly, we have fixed a bug in the implementation of the room state resolution algorithm which could cause users to be unexpectedly ejected from rooms (Synapse issue <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7742">#7742</a>).</p>
<p>Secondly, we have improved the security of pages served as part of the Single-Sign-on login flows to prevent clickjacking attacks. Thank you to <a href="https://sandhose.fr/">Quentin Gliech</a> for reporting this.</p>
<p>We are not aware of either of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild, but we recommend that administrators upgrade as soon as possible. Those on Synapse 1.15.1 or earlier should upgrade to Synapse 1.15.2, while those who have already upgraded to Synapse 1.16.0rc1 should upgrade to 1.16.0rc2.</p>
<p>Get the new releases from any of the usual sources mentioned at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md. 1.15.2 is on github <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.15.2">here</a>, and 1.16.0rc2 is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.16.0rc2">here</a>.</p>
<p>Changelog for 1.15.2 follows:</p>
<h2 id="synapse-1-15-2-2020-07-02">Synapse 1.15.2 (2020-07-02)</h2>
<p>Due to the two security issues highlighted below, server administrators are
encouraged to update Synapse. We are not aware of these vulnerabilities being
exploited in the wild.</p>
<h3 id="security-advisory">Security advisory</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A malicious homeserver could force Synapse to reset the state in a room to a
small subset of the correct state. This affects all Synapse deployments which
federate with untrusted servers. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/96e9afe62500310977dc3cbc99a8d16d3d2fa15c">96e9afe6</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTML pages served via Synapse were vulnerable to clickjacking attacks. This
predominantly affects homeservers with single-sign-on enabled, but all server
administrators are encouraged to upgrade.  (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/ea26e9a98b0541fc886a1cb826a38352b7599dbe">ea26e9a9</a>)</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</a></p>

<h4 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h4>
<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, unfortunately our three MSCs from last week ( <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2366">MSC2366</a> (verification flows), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2403">MSC2403</a> (knocking), and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2630">MSC2630</a> (SAS security)) are still pre-FCP. Most of the team has been quite busy with implementation for the past few weeks. Instead of advertising those 3 MSCs again, we're going to switch the focus to &quot;implementation&quot; for a bit until we're freed up again.</p>
<p>So the focus for this week is: MSC implementation work. However, this should not discourage any MSC authors from responding to MSC feedback in the meantime üôÇ</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week in the ruma/matrix Google Summer of Code project, ruma-events was made ready for use! After adding stripped and sync event generation to the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/commit/fdf87a38a219933ffe99b17baf87841a79702f28"><code>event_enum!</code> macro</a> there were only a few small tweaks needed to try it out in some dependent rust crates. I spent a few days converting <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/63">matrix-rust-sdk</a> to use the ruma-monorepo. Since ruma is used on both client and server-side, I also opened a PR to update <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit/pulls/133">Conduit</a>, a homeserver implementation written in Rust. To test that everything worked together, I updated <a href="https://github.com/DevinR528/rumatui/commit/1ae8776f9a59c297c8c9b2287f7c830ab67302b1">rumatui</a>, my command-line client written in rust.</p>
<p>Then I could test that Conduit sent, and matrix-rust-sdk received the new ruma events successfully. While updating, I felt the pain of not having accessor methods for the <code>Any*Event</code> enums to get at the event fields held within. I have opened a <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/97">pull request</a> to add the generation of these methods to the <code>event_enums!</code> macro. Hopefully, the Conduit and matrix-sdk PR's will be merged and the ruma monorepo can be tested in the wild!</p>

<p>The client now supports guest access. If no access token or user ID is provided in the configuration file, the client attempts to register a guest account on the home server. Room contents are viewed using <code>peekInRoom</code>.</p>
<p>If the guest attempts to send a message, only then <code>joinRoom</code> is called to avoid spam (each page load would lead to a guest joining the room).</p>

<h3 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h3>
<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has been mainly about testing to ensure that all the progress over the past few months is kept up-to-date and correct. We've also added a few features in order to get certain sytests working. To that end:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Invites can now be declined over federation and they will be reflected in <code>/sync</code> responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Errors encountered when joining a room over federation are now sent back to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Errors encountered when accepting an invite over federation are now sent back to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite will now check server names meet the server name grammar in the specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug which caused <code>client-api-proxy</code> to not actually proxy correctly has been fixed, thanks @fantashley !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/send</code> now abides by the limits in the specification: 50 PDUs / 100 EDUs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The docker-compose scripts now include <code>appservice_api</code>, thanks @fantashley !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending invites over federation will now fall back to v1 if v2 fails with a 404.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now implements <code>room.timeline.limit</code> completely (in both in-line and stored filter formats).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now sets the <code>limited</code> flag on <code>/sync</code> responses correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we now have support for collecting code coverage output from SyTest. This indicates we are testing roughly 70% of the Dendrite codebase. The remaining 30% are hard to reach via integration tests (e.g database failures, communication problems between internal APIs).</p>
<p>Spec compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 45%, up from 40% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 50%, up from 38% last week</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In total, we've made an additional 45 sytests pass this week.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we‚Äôve been working on further improvements to event persistence and ironed out a nasty bug where an unusually long state resolution could block the reactor overall and impact send times. We seem to have got to the bottom of this and m.org has improved a lot as of today.</p>
<p>More generally we‚Äôve been trying to characterise matrix.org performance so that we can continue to improve over the coming months. </p>
<p>We are going to focus on:-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client send event</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outbound Federation Latency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inbound Federation Latency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room joins</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as tracking the CS API generally.</p>
<p>We are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">apdex</a> with a satisfied limit of 250 ms and a tolerating limit of 1000 ms. By the end of the Summer we will aim to hit an apdex score of 0.9 for each area. </p>
<p>For instance here is Federation Send Event Apdex graphed overtime. You can see that we are averaging about ~0.8 currently, so plenty to keeping us busy! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Next up will be to work on Outbound Federation Latency</p>
<p>Aside from that we‚Äôve been working hard on the upcoming Notifications improvements. Mapping the push rules to the demands of the UI has been challenging and we‚Äôve been through several iterations.

<blockquote>
<p>Hey all, I've got several releases to talk about this week!</p>
<p>First, <code>matrix-appservice-slack</code> has been updated to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/1.4.0">1.4.0</a> with several quality of life changes such as automatically setting the bot profile on startup, supporting logging out of slack accounts and adding a health checkpoint. There are also quite a few bugfixes so make sure you update.</p>
<p><code>matrix-appservice-irc</code> was also bumped to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.18.0">0.18.0</a> with the headline features being Node 14.x support.</p>
<p>We've also shipped <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.19.0-rc1">0.19.0-rc1</a> which has stopped support for Node 10.x. Why? Because we're adding worker support to the bridge! This release starts to make use of the new(ish) <code>worker_threads</code> feature so that we can dish out processing to separate threads (running their own UV event loops, for node enthusiasts). The first thing to be workerized is metrics, so that metrics may still be reported should the bridge become saturated, but we plan to split out more work as things progress.</p>
<p>Finally <code>matrix-appservice-bridge</code> got a few fixes to support our new worker land, as well as being updated to support <code>matrix-js-sdk</code> 6.0.0. You can checkout the changes for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/1.13.1">1.13.1 here</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Most of our time this week was spent trying out device verification with Chethan. It's fun and I could finally file bugs in Nheko against someone else!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We fixed some issues that should hopefully make text in the timeline less blurry again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug which cause some clients like fluffychat to break in E2EE rooms (we accidentally sent a null relation when not replying...)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue, where Nheko didn't verify the format of html formatted messages correctly, causing it to render messages in a way which wasn't compliant to the spec.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks to the work of a Pirate and his friends, current versions of Nheko should be available in backports for Debian Buster once again!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@florian:dsn.tm.kit.edu">Florian</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/">We</a> published another scientific paper on Matrix, this time it is called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3381991.3395399">Matrix Decomposition: Analysis of an Access Control Approach on Transaction-based DAGs without Finality</a>!
Its main topic is the question of how access control can work based on a structure that only provides a partial order on events and no consensus on the current state, i.e. the Matrix Event Graph. We found some concrete, non-critical security issues related to both incorrect specification  as well as divergent homeserver behaviour. While the last remaining mitigations found their way into Synapse 1.14.0, we provide ideas on structural solutions to avoid both problem classes in the future using formal verification.</p>
<p>The paper was published at the <a href="http://www.sacmat.org/2020/index.php">ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies(SACMAT)</a> last week.
My talk went well (üéâ), it was recording and is yet to be published by the conference.</p>

<p>Highlights this week</p>
<ul>
<li>We released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/16/synapse-1-15-1-released">1.15.1</a>, this is a bug fix release, sorry if you were bitten.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changelog-in-full">Changelog in full</h4>
<p>Bugfixes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug introduced in v1.15.0 that would crash Synapse on start when using certain password auth providers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug introduced in v1.15.0 which meant that some 3PID management endpoints were not accessible on the correct URL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implemented unread message counts (MSC 2625) - This is part of the a more general notifications improvement project in conjunction with the Riot teams. The aim being to make Notifications easier to configure. We‚Äôve also been working on push rule definitions for the default behaviour. More on that next week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have the ability to shard the media repository worker. This means we can now run an arbitrary number in parallel, thereby improving upload reliability and performance, we are running this on Matrix.org. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-enabled Jaeger on matrix.org - previously we needed to switch it off due to the performance overhead, we needed a few tweaks but now it is working well and helping us to determine the cause of slow requests. It seems like the HTTP requests between the event creator  and event persister workers can sometimes be slow - we are not sure of the cause yet, we are working on it but it will mean further performance improvements to message sending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next up performance wise is working on sharding the federation sender to improve federation lag. We‚Äôll also try replacing simplejson with stdlib json which seems to be much faster at dumps nowadays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we‚Äôve fixed a bug that meant that quarantining media would from time to time include quarantining sticker packs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other interesting bugs</p>
<p>We fixed a spec compliance bug in fetching remote media raised by our pals in Dendrite-land. We fixed a bug causing federation .well-known requests to fail due to not including the user-agent header. We removed references to six (thanks @ilmari) and finally, fixed a bug that caused stream id to go backwards on the replication stream.</p>
<p>Next week we‚Äôll continue to work on notifications and performance. You can track our progress here <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8</a></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>As with every release we are currently working through the new bug reports. :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I started working on SSSS and online key backup support. For this I wrote my own base64 and base58 encoders. As a result of this we dropped libsodium as a dependency, which should make Nheko a bit easier to package or build. It's also fun to write base conversions, although 58 is a horrible base!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reactions
<ul>
<li>React to a message with an emoji! üéâ</li>
<li>Reactions are shown below a message in a small bubble with a counter.</li>
<li>By clicking on that, others can add to the reaction count.</li>
<li>It may help you celebrating a new Nheko Release or react with a üëé to a failed build to express your frustration.</li>
<li>This uses a new emoji picker. The picker will be improved in the near future (better scrolling, sections, favorites, recently used or similar) and then probably replace the current picker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support for tagging rooms [tag]
<ul>
<li>Assign custom tags to rooms from the context menu in the room list.</li>
<li>This allows filtering rooms via the group list. This puts you in a focus mode showing only the selected tags.</li>
<li>You can assign multiple tags to group rooms however you like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SSO Login
<ul>
<li>With this you can now login on servers, that only provide SSO.</li>
<li>Just enter any mxid on the server. Nheko will figure out that you need to use SSO and redirect your browser to the login page.</li>
<li>Complete the login in your browser and Nheko should automatically log you in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Presence
<ul>
<li>Shows online status of the people you are talking to.</li>
<li>You can define a custom status message to tell others what you are currently up to.</li>
<li>The status message appears next to the usernames in the timeline.</li>
<li>Your server needs to have presence enabled for this to work.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>after a couple of setbacks that didn't let us to make the releases earlier, the Quotient project has finally made two new releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GTAD (the piece of code magically producing readable C++ code from a Swagger API description) has achieved version 0.7 (https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad/releases/tag/v0.7.0) adding a few tricks in order to make...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...libQuotient 0.6 beta2 (https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.6-beta2) rely entirely on the upstream matrix-doc specification, rather than a soft fork closely following the main sources! From now on it's &quot;upstream first&quot;, in a sense that the original matrix-doc will be used to build Quotient codebase. Let's see how often it breaks ;)
In other news from the last few weeks:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some housekeeping and deprecation work in the API has been done in preparation to getting User Interactive Authentication along the next (post-0.6) release cycle of libQuotient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>also thanks to the updated code generator, the CS API code has been optimised, consolidating more code in the header files and making data deserialisation lazy; this helped significantly reduce compilation times, and runtime performance also improved a bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the number of configurations tested by CI has been extended, allowing to chase down a few more bugs that managed to go under the radar before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when used with new enough Qt, CBOR is used to cache data locally - entirely transparently for clients.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect more news in the coming weeks, including continued work on matrix: URI proposal and its implementation in Quotient.</p>

<p>This week in ruma-events' Google Summer of Code project, after trying out the new <code>Any*Event</code> enums <a href="https://github.com/DevinR528/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2"><code>matrix-rust-sdk</code></a>, we found a few big flaws. There was no easy way to go from <code>StateEvent&lt;AnyStateEventContent&gt;</code> to <code>StateEvent&lt;SpecificEventContent&gt;</code>, the other issue was one could create a <code>StateEvent</code> with differing <code>content</code> and <code>prev_content</code> fields using the <code>AnyStateEventContent</code> enum. The <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/68">0.22 ruma-events</a> will be similar to the existing API; each event type has a corresponding event enum variant.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever since <code>m.room.aliases</code> was replaced with <code>alt_aliases</code>, there hasn't really been any way to find aliases on other servers, since most room admins don't bother finding and publishing alternate aliases. To help solve that problem, I made a maubot plugin to let users publish alternate aliases in rooms: <a href="https://github.com/maubot/altalias">https://github.com/maubot/altalias</a></p>
<p>By default it lets users publish aliases with the same localpart as any already published alias. If that behavior is sufficient, you can simply invite it to a room and give it permissions to send <code>m.room.canonical_alias</code> events. Alternatively, it can be configured to allow aliases that match specific regexes.</p>
<p>Once it's set up, users can create a local alias and use <code>!altalias publish &lt;their alias&gt;</code> to publish it. The bot will make sure the alias points to the right room, check that the localpart is allowed and then add it to <code>alt_aliases</code>.</p>
<p>I have it running at @alias:maunium.net and I've added it to all my rooms already. Other rooms are also free to use that instance.</p>

<p>Now, the new paper is an absolutely fascinating deep dive analysis into <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">State Resolution v2</a> - the algorithm at the heart of Matrix which defines how servers merge together their potentially conflicting copies of a given room, such that everyone ends up eventually with a consistent view‚Ä¶ even in the face of bad actors. This means that Matrix effectively implements a decentralised access control system - ensuring that users stay banned, and only users with permission can ban, etc.  You can see the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/img/SACMAT_2020_Talk_Matrix_Decomposition.pdf">slides</a> below, and read the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3381991.3395399">full paper</a> here. The video of Florian‚Äôs talk from SACMAT should be published shortly.</p>

<p>To give some context from the Matrix side: designing and implementing State Resolution v2 back in 2018 was a bit of a mission. Our original v1 implementation had some bugs which meant that the result of the merge could unexpectedly favour historical state over the current state (so called ‚Äòstate resets‚Äô) - thus giving an attacker a way to maliciously revert the state of the room.  In v2 we thought much more carefully about the algorithm, considering state present in one version of the room but not the other as a conflict, separating and applying access control events from regular events, and adding additional ordering of the state in the room by considering events in the context of their authorisation chain (the ‚Äòauth DAG‚Äô).  The end result is that we feel confident in v2 State Res, and we haven‚Äôt seen any problems with it in the wild since we shipped it in July 2018.</p>
<p>However: state resolution is not intuitive at first - for instance, when you merge two versions of a room together, you treat the state events as unordered sets‚Ä¶ even though they are ordered in the context of the room DAG.  The reason is that state res needs to work even if you don‚Äôt have a copy of the whole room DAG (otherwise you‚Äôd have to download way too much data to participate in a large room).  Another example is the sequence in which orderings are then applied to the state events - and how that interacts with re-authorising those events, to stop malicious ones creeping in.  In the core team, we‚Äôve end up describing it several different ways to try to help folks understand: first Erik‚Äôs original <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/state_res_msc/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">MSC1442</a>, then uhoreg‚Äôs <a href="https://matrix.uhoreg.ca/stateres/reloaded.html">literary Haskell implementation</a>, then the terse reference version in <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v2">the Spec</a> itself, and most recently Neil Alexander‚Äôs <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/implementing-stateres">State Resolution v2 for the Hopelessly Unmathematical</a>.</p>
<p>As a result we are <strong>very</strong> excited and happy that Florian and the DSN team have now published the first ever independent in-depth analysis of the algorithm, particularly in the context of decentralised access control (i.e. enforcing bans, power levels, etc).  We‚Äôre pleasantly surprised that apparently ‚ÄúTo the best of our knowledge, Matrix is the only system that implements access control based on an eventually consistent partial order without finality and without a consensus algorithm‚Äù.</p>
<p>Even better, the DSN team found some remaining thinkos in Synapse‚Äôs implementation and the Matrix specification, which could have caused resolution results to diverge from other implementations, specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>we weren‚Äôt enforcing integers in JSON to be within range [-2<sup>53</sup>+1, 2<sup>53</sup>-1], fixed in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7381">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7381</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/clokep/json-validation-room-ver/proposals/2540-stricter-event-validation.md">MSC2540</a></li>
<li>we forgot to include the notification field when authing power level events, fixed in  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7501">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7501</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lucavb/matrix-doc/blob/master/proposals/2209-auth-rules-other-keys-in-m.room.power.levels.md">MSC2209</a> (thanks to Luca from DSN for the MSC!)</li>
<li>we forgot to spec the limit that one should apply to the number of parents of an event in the DAG (fixed in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2538">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2538</a>)</li>
<li>we missed that moderators could set server ACLs which could let them undermine room admins (fixed in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6834">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6834</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these have now been fixed in Synapse and the latest versions of the spec (room v6), and we‚Äôd like to sincerely thank Florian and Luca for rapidly and responsibly disclosing the issues to us.  In other words: this research is directly improving Matrix, and it‚Äôs even more exciting that the stated future work for the DSN team is to work on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">formal verification</a> for the security of Matrix‚Äôs authorisation rules and state resolution.  This stuff is tough, as anyone who‚Äôs played with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA%2B">TLA<sup>+</sup></a> will know, and we are incredibly glad that the research community is helping out to formalise and hopefully prove that State Res v2 is as good as we think it is.</p>
<p>We should stress that DSN‚Äôs work is completely independent of The Matrix.org Foundation or anyone else building on the protocol; we‚Äôre just writing about it here because we think it‚Äôs incredibly cool and deserves the attention of the whole Matrix ecosystem.</p>
<p>Thanks again to Florian and the team - we look forward to seeing what comes next!</p>
