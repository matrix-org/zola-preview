            <p>Last week we had a great time attending WebRTC Conference Expo Paris 2014 - chatting to lots of new folks about Matrix; speaking in the &quot;To Build or Not To Build&quot; panel discussion; giving a general presentation on Matrix, and participating in the Demo shoot-out.</p>
<p>And we're very proud to say that we won the <a href="http://blog.uppersideconferences.com/award-winners-webrtc-2014-conference-expo/">Best Innovation Award</a> for a slightly frantic demo, showing an iPad mounted on our pet Trossen Robotics PhantomX Hexapod being used for robot telepresence by streaming video and audio to an Oculus Rift VR headset.  This was using our proprietary in-house WebRTC stack, but once Matrix has fully taken off we hope to share our WebRTC stack with the world too :)  This was a very last minute demo - we wanted to show something different to normal browser-to-browser IM/Video calling via Matrix and had the idea to use the Rift at the last minute - and in fact it still wasn't working when we went on stage (turns out that iOS 8.1 introduces some quirks in the video capture API which were producing corrupt video).  By switching from an iPhone 5S running iOS 8.1 to an iPad running iOS 6 we were able to turn the demo around in the nick of time and get it working live on stage (modulo a RGB&lt;-&gt;BGR colourspace bug) just in time to win the award.  Huge thanks to the jury for voting for us against the odds :D  For those interested in displaying raw video straight onto the Oculus Rift (without using any head-mounted tracking), there's an OpenGL code snippet up at <a href="https://gist.github.com/ara4n/875b5e8b66be3617efb7">https://gist.github.com/ara4n/875b5e8b66be3617efb7</a>.</p>

            <p>We're proud to announce the new 0.6.0 major release of Synapse: the Python reference implementation of Matrix - as well as 0.6.0 of the AngularJS example Matrix client, as a special early Christmas present from the Matrix team :)</p>
<p>The main priority here has been hunting down stability bugs whilst also adding in a few more features.  The most exciting new feature is the new Media/Content API: this allows every homeserver to replicate, cache and thumbnail any files associated with Matrix rooms, rather than relying on retrieving them from the origin homeserver as was previously the case.  This is really cool, as it effectively makes Matrix a distributed content distribution network and gives the same replication semantics to file attachments as to the rest of JSON in rooms.</p>
<p>We've also landed a major new branch which changes the way events are represented internally in order to make them immutable, and fixes a whole range of minor stability issues.  In other news, performance issues are still a work in progress...</p>
<p>To get involved, head over to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a> and install and upgrade today!</p>

            <p>One of the final remaining missing bits of Matrix today is specifying and implementing the Application Service (AS) APIs which allow you to easily extend Matrix with custom server-side functionality. The AS APIs should let you perform any arbitrary manipulation on chatroom contents, modulo end-to-end encryption constraints - e.g. machine translation; archiving/searching contents; interactive automated services; conferencing; firing push notifications and other hooks; etc. If you really want to look behind the curtain, the bug tracking the development (somewhat out-of-date) is at <a href="/jira/browse/SPEC-34">SPEC-34</a>.</p>
<p>However, the most obvious use case for this is gatewaying Matrix rooms through to existing communication platforms (XMPP, SIP, non-standardised systems) - which is obviously key to Matrix's overall goal of defragmenting communication.  And the good news is that even though the AS APIs don't yet exist, we can still make good progress here through the existing client-server API.  Anyone who's hung around chat systems like IRC should be familiar with the idea of bots - non-human users who participate in chatrooms and but perform arbitrary automated functionality - and you can go quite a long way in using the 'bot' idiom to add automatic functionality to Matrix.</p>
<p>[In fact the first AS API we'll be adding will probably be simply extending the client-server API with some additional privileges to allow homeserver admins to hook up services to their server which are essentially privileged bots (e.g. ability to autojoin rooms created on that server with high power-level; ability to flag themselves as an invisible 'service bot'; ability to monitor events from rooms without joining them: useful for read-only services such as sending push notifications, adding search/archive functionality; etc).  This should also be familiar to IRC users, as it's similar to the model that IRC Services uses.]</p>
<p>So, we already have a few bots hanging around prototyping out bridging to other systems, which hopefully should evolve into full Application Services (where it makes sense; sometimes a bot is good enough).  For instance, we have the <a href="https://github.com/tm604/Matrix-IRCBridge">Matrix/IRC Bridge</a> thanks to tm604 and LeoNerd.  The way this works is simply a bot which joins IRC channels and their Matrix room equivalents; watching the messages on both sides of the bridge and relaying them to the other side, creating virtual users as required.  In future we can be smarter about having the bridge talk on behalf of actual users, or letting actual users control their virtual users, but it's good enough as a first cut.</p>
<p>So for Friday's <a href="http://www.voipusersconference.org/2014/vuc517-matrix-org/">VUC 517</a>, we decided at the last minute (on Tuesday) to make as much of VUC accessible via Matrix as possible.  One side of this was hooking up the <a href="https://jitsi.org/Projects/JitsiMeet">Jitsi Video Bridge</a> to be accessible by talking to the underlying XMPP server - the other side was hooking up via SIP to the <a href="https://www.zipdx.info">ZipDX audio bridge</a> that is used for audio-only participants in the conference.  Both of these would be done as Matrix bots - a virtual user that you could voice/video call 1:1 over Matrix which would then route your call into VUC appropriately.</p>
<p>By Thursday, the Jitsi bot got to the point of being able to place calls and see a single video stream (picked at random), but the video uplink wasn't getting through and actually selecting the right stream to watch (or viewing multiple streams) wasn't in place either.  I'm sure there'll be a similar blogpost once it's finished, so I'm not going to talk about it further here.  Meanwhile, on Thursday night we hacked together a separate bot to jack into the ZipDX bridge via SIP.  Tim Panton's suggestion was to use <a href="http://www.freeswitch.org">FreeSWITCH</a>'s <a href="https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/mod_verto">mod_verto</a> for this, and after Anthony Minesalle and Mike Jerris from FreeSWITCH had popped up on <a href="http://matrix.org/beta">#matrix:matrix.org</a> on Tuesday to find out what we're up to, this seemed like serendipity.</p>
<p>We hadn't played with mod_verto before, although had been pointed at it by someone on IRC shortly after we released Matrix - it's a cool project from the FreeSWITCH dev team that exposes a simple JSON-RPC interface for call signalling over websockets, providing a much more suitable way for WebRTC developers to get calls in and out of FreeSWITCH than shoehorning a SIP stack into their browser.  In this respect it's quite similar to Matrix, but there are some huge differences:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Verto doesn't (yet) do federation - either for message-passing (like XMPP) or history-replication (like Matrix or XMPP FMUCs).  In fact, Matrix fundamentally competes more with JSON-RPC at OSI layer 5 by defining a standardised RESTful API for federated state synchronisation - which so happens to define some datatypes for VoIP signalling; whereas Verto currently seems to be focused solely on the application-layer problem of VoIP signalling.</li>
	<li>Verto is a generic RPC API with method names like verto.invite, verto.answer, verto.media, verto.bye etc. for handling call signalling.  It's obviously readily extensible to any other functionality expressed as an RPC invocation.  The Matrix client-server API however passes around event objects within the context of a room - it's message passing rather than RPC.</li>
	<li>Matrix's VoIP events support trickle-ICE; announcing ICE candidates from WebRTC as and when they become available.  This good is for speedy call-setup (you don't have to wait for all ICE to complete before setting up the call) and to support call continuity when roaming between different IP networks (in theory).  However, Verto currently requires ICE candidates to be presented monolithically - it hasn't made sense to implement trickle-ICE as FreeSWITCH's core engine doesn't support it yet.</li>
        <li>Verto looks to be wired to speak JSON-RPC over Websockets, whereas Matrix deliberately uses plain old HTTP as its baseline for maximum simplicity and compatibility in PUTting and GETting JSON events around</li>
	<li>Verto could be an interoperable standard but the API hasn't been documented yet (unless I've totally missed it) - to build the bot we looked at the websockets tab in Chrome's network inspector and drew some inferences from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/e43139ac5e1f337d9a82ee16d9a4f15195120ec3/contrib/vertobot/verto-example.json">JSON seen in a call</a> placed using the <a href="https://webrtc.freeswitch.org/verto">FreeSWITCH Verto demo site</a>, which was very intuitive and almost self-documenting.  Meanwhile, the (minimal) doc for Matrix's events is up at <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#voice-over-ip">http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#voice-over-ip</a>.</li>
</ul>
Verto has a huge advantage however, in that FreeSWITCH has a mod_verto today, and doesn't have a mod_matrix - so one can use mod_verto right now as an easy way to get VoIP calls in and out of FreeSWITCH from the web and bridge them to SIP!  So, when writing a Matrix&lt;-&gt;SIP bridging bot for VUC, Verto turned out to be a really nice way to quickly get something up and running.  The end result is at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/e43139ac5e1f337d9a82ee16d9a4f15195120ec3/contrib/vertobot/bot.pl">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/contrib/vertobot/bot.pl</a> - a (precisely!) 300 line perl script built on LeoNerd's <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Net-Async-Matrix">Net-Async-Matrix</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Net::Async::Protocol::WebSocket">Net::Async::Protocol::WebSocket</a> which logs into Matrix and routes any 1:1 audio calls it receives through to the defined mod_verto service.  Currently it gleefully hardcodes in the destination extension it calls and the caller-ID, but this could trivially be extended.  It also chokes on SSL WebSockets, so your mod_verto needs to be listening unencrypted on port 8081.
<p>The task of mapping between Matrix m.call.* VoIP events and Verto verto.* RPC methods was almost entirely trivial (although I hasten to add that Matrix's and Verto's were developed completely independently - it's just that there are only so many ways to express VoIP signalling in JSON!)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Matrix's m.call.invite is equivalent to the combination of verto.invite + verto.media (but may lack ICE candidates)</li>
	<li>Matrix's m.call.candidates has no direct equivalent, so has to be coalesced and merged into verto.media</li>
	<li>Matrix's m.call.answer is equivalent to verto.answer (but may lack ICE candidates)</li>
	<li>Matrix's m.room.displayname is equivalent to verto.display (assuming I understand verto.display)</li>
	<li>Matrix's m.call.hangup is equivalent to verto.bye</li>
	<li>…and these are the only verto RPCs we mapped.</li>
</ul>
For the demo itself, we obviously needed a FreeSWITCH with mod_verto all up and running to hook into the ZipDX bridge: our friends at <a href="http://truphone.com">Truphone</a> were good enough to provide one at zero notice (Thanks James, Andy, Giacomo!), and we were up and running.
<p>Unfortunately we did hit some problems: Net::Async::Matrix has a few quirks which LeoNerd is working out currently; the bot doesn't coalesce the trickle-ICE properly currently causing a race-condition that means ICE setup may fail; Matthew's use of IO::Async was a bit buggy; and moreover we didn't have time to implement DTMF… which was a bit of a shame as you can only unmute yourself on the ZipDX bridge via DTMF *5!</p>
<p>But in general, the mini-hackathon was a success and it was great fun to be able to listen into VUC via the bridge and demonstrate the first ever Matrix&lt;-&gt;SIP call!  The bot ran as @vucbot:matrix.org, although is turned off now as there's no VUC to listen to, and the FreeSWITCH &amp; bot were only deployed temporarily.  Once the kinks mentioned above are sorted out we'll hopefully set it running again permanently!  And hopefully this little bot is an exciting precursor to more robust Matrix bridges and application services in the months to come...</p>
<p>If you're crazy enough to want to try to run the bot yourself, then it should actually be quite simple to get up and running:</p>
<p><code> # grab synapse if you don't have it already
git clone https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse.git synapse-develop

<p>Finally, huge thanks to everyone to helped make the VUC bridging escapade work out - Emil Ivov at Jitsi, James Body, Andy Smith and Giacomo Vacca at Truphone, Anthony Minesalle &amp; Mike Jerris &amp; Brian West at FreeSWITCH for writing freeswitch and mod_verto, Tim Panton for the VUC intro and suggestion of mod_verto, Randy Resnick &amp; Michael Graves at VUC itself, and of course the Matrix team for glueing our side of it together!</p>
<p>Looking forward to lots more ambitious cross-protocol gatewaying and federation in future!</p>

            <p>Some updates on the conferences Matrix attended over the last 3 weeks: WebRTC Summit in Santa Clara, TAD Summit in Istanbul, WebRTC World West in San José and fOSSa in Rennes. Great shows, ending in lots of interesting discussions and new excitement in Matrix!</p>
<h2 id="webrtc-summit-santa-clara-november-4-6">WebRTC Summit (Santa Clara, November 4-6)</h2>
<p>Matrix was a <a href="http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/3242708">sponsor</a> at the Santa Clara <a href="http://webrtcsummit.net/">WebRTC Summit</a> at CloudExpo, and opened the WebRTC track alongside our friends at <a href="http://www.openpeer.org">Open Peer / Hookflash</a>. Matthew presented Matrix as the missing signalling layer for WebRTC and as a good federated complement to MQTT and COAP for IoT use cases: you can find his presentation <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-03-Matrix_Missing-Link_IOT.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Great techie discussions and debates down there, the stand was flooded with interested people and John had a hardtime answering everyone by himself on day 2!</p>
<p>But he still found a few minutes to do a TV interview for SYSCon TV on Tuesday evening! :)</p>
<p>[embed]http://youtu.be/JVq6S9V1Jcg[/embed]</p>
<h2 id="tad-summit-istanbul-november-12-13">TAD Summit (Istanbul, November 12-13)</h2>
<p>Matrix was a partner at <a href="http://tadsummit.com/2014/">TAD Summit</a> in Istanbul this year, a great opportunity to meet a very good mix of developers, industry players and mobile networks! TAD mixes conferences and technical workshops where everyone gets involved to create a vibrant ecosystem for Telecom Application Developers. Again really productive discussions and meetings as we continue our search for partners to help support the uptake of Matrix.</p>
<p>Matthew's talk was fully recorded so just watch the video to get the real pitch!</p>

<h2 id="webrtc-world-san-jose-november-18-20">WebRTC World (San Jose, November 18-20)</h2>
<p>Matrix's attendance at <a href="http://www.webrtcworld.com/conference/west/default.aspx">WebRTC World</a> in San Jose was more rewarding than expected! The team was ready to be part of the expo and give a talk on FOSS WebRTC options... but didn't hesitate to jump at the opportunity when a demo slot opened up! And that was a worthwhile decision as Matrix ended up winning not one but<strong> TWO awards from the demo:</strong> The <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Audience Choice Award</strong></span>
as the audience's favourite demo of the 10 shown on Tuesday, and also the overall <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Best Social Integration Award</strong> </span>
from the Jury! So a big congrats to the dev team who were rushing to get the fine details ready in time and to Matthew for getting the audience's attention! And of course a even bigger thank you to everyone who voted for us, including in the Jury!</p>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sj.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-239" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sj-300x168.jpg" alt="Matthew at WebRTC World 2014" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Of course this drew lots of interest, and WebRTC Expo ended up the busiest show ever for the team who pitched solidly at the booth for 2 days in a row!</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Audience_Choice_14.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-240" style="box-shadow: none ! important;" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Audience_Choice_14.png" alt="Audience_Choice_14" width="300" height="229" /></a> <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Best_Social_Integration_14.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-241" style="box-shadow: none ! important;" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Best_Social_Integration_14.png" alt="Best_Social_Integration_14" width="300" height="229" /></a></div>
<h2 id="fossa-rennes-november-20">fOSSa (Rennes, November 20)</h2>
<p>And eventually, while Matthew and John were celebrating in San José (or flying home, more accurately), Amandine was also evangelising at home in Rennes (France), where <a href="https://fossa.inria.fr/">fOSSa </a>was gathering experts from the opensource world for 3 days. Matrix was presented within the Serendipity section on the conférence, &quot;Le Carrefour des Possibles&quot;: 6 minutes to pitch an open project that making dreams possible.</p>
<p>So if you speak French or are not afraid to only read from <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-17.2-Matrix.pdf">the slides</a>, check out the video the team made of the pitch. The official one should be available soon!</p>

            <p>Since we exited alpha and released Synapse 0.5.0 last week there's been a flurry of bug fix releases as we ran around firefighting some of the more exciting problems which popped up thanks to merging the federation-auth and event-signing branches.</p>
<p>We released 0.5.3a on Nov 27, which seems to now be pretty stable - if you were holding off on upgrading your homeserver and trying to federate with the new 0.5 release branch, now would be a great time to press the button!</p>
<p>Most excitingly, we believe we have <strong>finally fixed the PyNaCL dependency problems</strong> which have plagued pretty much anyone setting up a homeserver.  This was a problem in PyNaCL itself - huge thanks to Mark for hunting it down and sending the PyNaCL team <a href="http://git.io/1Rr5OA">pull</a> <a href="http://git.io/SUHmBA">requests</a> to get it fixed.  As a result, installing synapse as of 0.5.3a really should be a one-liner at last (please let us know if it isn't!):</p>
<p><code>pip install --user --process-dependency-links https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tarball/master</code></p>
<p>The full changelog of what's been going on since 0.5.0 is as follows:</p>
<pre>
Changes in synapse 0.5.3a (2014-11-27)
=====================================

 * Depend on a fixed version of PyNaCL
 * Fix bug that caused joining a remote room to fail if a single event was not
   signed correctly.
 * Fix bug which caused servers to continuously try and fetch events from other
   servers.

Changes in synapse 0.5.2 (2014-11-26)
=====================================

 * Fix major bug that caused rooms to disappear from people's initial sync.

Changes in synapse 0.5.1 (2014-11-26)
=====================================
See UPGRADES.rst for specific instructions on how to upgrade.

 * Fix bug where we served up an Event that did not match its signatures.
 * Fix regression where we no longer correctly handled the case where a
   homeserver receives an event for a room it doesn't recognise (but is in.)

            <p>We're really excited to release the biggest update yet to Synapse (the python/twisted reference Matrix homeserver implementation) - version 0.5.0 is out!</p>
<p>This effectively concludes our alpha testing phase - Synapse's security model is now feature complete and we are now cautiously encouraging people to run their own Synapse installation on the 'net; federate up; and help us squash all and any bugs as we get beta testing.</p>
<p>Synapse 0.5.0 has huge database schema changes from previous versions as we have landed both the event-signing and federation-authorisation branches and so added full cryptographic signing of all matrix events and unified the client-server and server-server model of events/PDUs.  As a result, migrating history is Hard - we recommend a clean start if possible; if not, come talk to us in #matrix:matrix.org.  UPGRADE.rst has the details.</p>
<p>The full changelog is as per below - please upgrade your homeserver or install a new one if you're new here and join Matrix and help us create a robust open distributed messaging fabric for the web!</p>
<pre>
Changes in synapse 0.5.0 (2014-11-19)
=====================================
This release includes changes to the federation protocol and client-server API
that is not backwards compatible.

This release also changes the internal database schemas and so requires servers to
drop their current history. See UPGRADES.rst for details.

Homeserver:
 * Add authentication and authorization to the federation protocol. Events are
   now signed by their originating homeservers.
 * Implement the new authorization model for rooms.
 * Split out web client into a separate repository: matrix-angular-sdk.
 * Change the structure of PDUs.
 * Fix bug where user could not join rooms via an alias containing 4-byte
   UTF-8 characters.
 * Merge concept of PDUs and Events internally.
 * Improve logging by adding request ids to log lines.
 * Implement a very basic room initial sync API.
 * Implement the new invite/join federation APIs.

Webclient:
 * The webclient has been moved to a separate repository.

            <p>Matrix has been showing off in various places these last months. But whilst drowning in the launch we haven't managed to keep the blog updated with what's been going on! We are now much more back on track and able to catch up at last, as well as start on new ground for upcoming events!</p>
<p>So you'll find here a summary of the 4 events Matrix attended in September and October as well as all the presentations we gave!</p>
<h5 id="disrupt-san-francisco-september-6-10">Disrupt San Francisco (September 6-10)</h5>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/6am.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-191" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_48491-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_4849[1]" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/6am.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-138 size-medium" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/6am-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2014/event-home/">Disrupt SF</a> was the launchpad of Matrix! We participated in the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-hackathon-2014/">Hackathon </a>as both a sponsor and a competitor (see our live <a title="Techcrunch Update!" href="http://matrix.org/blog/2014/09/09/techcrunch-update/">update</a>!), and exhibited at the conference as a Product Sponsor.</p>
<p>Three teams announced that they were using Matrix to build their hack but eventually only <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/go-social">Go Social</a> presented their project: a social network for travelers with a very nice UI! Go Social used Matrix APIs to add chat to their platform. The video of Go Social's presentation is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/video/go-social-presents-disrupt-sf-2014-hackathon/518404022/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Matrix team worked on <a href="http://challengepost.com/software/animatrix">Animatrix</a>: a chat app allowing you to build your own 3D animated cartoon and share it with any other friend using Matrix-compliant app using Unify. We had to hack together a basic Matrix Android client in order to do the demo .... You can see our project's presentation <a href="http://techcrunch.com/video/animatrix-presents-disrupt-sf-2014-hackathon/518404216/">here</a>!</p>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_48581.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-195 aligncenter" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_48581-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_4858[1]" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>The three days conference was great in terms of reaching out to devs and getting good feedback on Matrix! We love seeing people's eyes lighting up and people saying &quot;Eventually someone is doing it!&quot; when we explain what Matrix is about :) So thank you all for your support!</p>
<h5 id="disrupt-europe-london-uk-october-18-21">Disrupt Europe (London, UK - October 18-21)</h5>
<p>After getting public in SF, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-eu/event-home/">Disrupt London </a>was the next steps to release a more stable version of Matrix and encourage even more people to build on Matrix. Again we sponsored both the Hackathon and the Conference and we brought with us a very cool <a href="http://www.trossenrobotics.com/phantomx-ax-hexapod.aspx" target="_blank">PhantomX robot from Trossen Robotics</a> which was also the price we gave away during the hackathon.</p>

<p>Two teams pitched a Matrix project at the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-europe-hackathon-2014-london/">Hackathon </a>this time:</p>
<p><a href="http://hujambo.co">Hujambo</a> is a very cool chat app allowing you to chat in your native language to someone who is going to read you in their own native language.</p>
<p>Movidiam did a very ambitious hack, modelling the trends of conversation in the Matrix ecosystem and displaying them a force-directed graph visualisation using D3.</p>
<p>Matrix team worked on a MIDI to Matrix bridge allowing to share and display music you play in a chatroom and jam together even if in different places. Here is the demo video:</p>

<p>Another great time to meet a lot of interesting people and build partnerships!</p>
<h5 id="webrtc-summit-europe-and-rich-communication-conference-berlin-october-27-29">WebRTC Summit Europe and Rich Communication Conference (Berlin - October 27-29)</h5>
<p>Matrix was a Silver sponsor at <a href="http://rich-communication.com/webrtc-summit-europe/">WebRTC Summit</a> and the <a href="http://rich-communication.com/">Rich Communication</a> events and it was a great opportunity to show the multiple ways that Matrix can be considered.</p>
<p>The first day was the WebRTC Summit where the focus was on the challenges and next steps of the standard. Matthew presented Matrix explained how it can be used as the missing signaling layer to WebRTC raising lots of questions and interest. You can see the presentation <a title="Matrix, the missing link to WebRTC" href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-03-Matrix_Missing-Link_IOT.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-201 aligncenter" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="photo" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>The two next days were focusing more on <a href="http://www.gsma.com/network2020/rcs/" target="_blank">Rich Communication Services </a>(RCS) and again Matrix didn't go unnoticed, and not only because of the lightspeed presentation from Matthew waking everyone up on Wednesday morning! This time Matthew addressed Telcos and RCS vendors with the compelling proposition of using Matrix as the bridge between RCS/IMS/PSTN and the world of over-the-top applications.  The presentation is downloadable <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-10-29-OTT-Federation-Strategies.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Again some great feedback and lots of animated discussions over the future of the IP communication world!</p>

<h5 id="webrtc-summit-santa-clara-november-4-5">WebRTC Summit (Santa Clara - November 4-5)</h5>
<p>Beginning of November Matrix was back on the West Coast  to sponsor the <a href="http://webrtcsummit.net/">WebRTC Summit</a>, collocated with the CloudExpo. Matthew opened the WebRTC track with another presentation again raising a lot of interest and question, and greatly supported by <a href="http://hookflash.com" target="_blank">Hookflash</a> in their following session. The presentation is available <a title="Matrix, the missing link to WebRTC" href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-03-Matrix_Missing-Link_IOT.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>And the tour continues: this week Matrix sponsored the <a href="http://tadsummit.com/2014/">TADSummit</a> in Istanbul and next week we will be in San José at the <a href="http://www.webrtcworld.com/conference/west/">WebRTC World Conference &amp; Expo</a>: meet us there and watch out for the upcoming TADSummit news!</p>

            <p><em>As part of our semi-regular series of having Matrix core team members write about how they see the overall project, here's Oddvar Lovaas' view.  Oddvar helps out with project management and promoting Matrix.</em></p>
<p>According to the homepage, Matrix is &quot;a new open standard for interoperable Instant Messaging and VoIP, providing pragmatic HTTP APIs and open source reference implementations for creating and running your own real-time communication infrastructure. &quot;</p>
<p>That's all good - but you might be asking yourself &quot;sure, but what can it do?&quot; And more importantly, &quot;what can it do for me?&quot;</p>
<p>The original inspiration for Matrix was to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications, by creating a standard for creating and running your own real-time communication infrastructure. This means that if you want your app or program or website to be able to communicate user to user for example, you can use Matrix. Matrix is the protocol through which your communication packets are sent and received, and we provide HTTP APIs to make it easy to make use of this protocol in your code.</p>
<p>The nice thing here is that the user can to talk to any other user anywhere in the Matrix ecosystem, much like email or the web. For example, let's imagine I have an app whose goal is to keep the user updated on anything happening in the football world. Whenever any news drops in, the app is notified and thousands of users check the app for the news. This app could have a communication element where the users can talk in rooms (maybe a #general room and rooms for each football club) - or even between themselves or in groups of friends. Today, a lot of people would use an IM-client to do this, but with Matrix it wouldn't matter if you use a dedicated IM-app or talk inside the football app - since you are using the same Matrix account, you will get the same conversations in both clients!</p>
<p>In fact, imagine that later on you are chatting with some (non-football) friends on your Matrix-supporting chat-application. You can then easily check the previous conversation to see if anyone's appreciated the great joke you made earlier - without having to go back into the football app.</p>
<p>But Matrix's real potential and ultimate mission is to be a generic messaging and data synchronisation system for the web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other with full history. It's easier to visualise the chat-application because we are used to chat-messages going back and to, but there's nothing stopping you from putting other data instead of chat-messages. For example, you could use the Matrix protocol to exchange moves - encrypted and secured, of course - in your Chess-game. In fact, your Chess-game could use Matrix both for chatting and exchanging payloads of data.</p>
<p>Imagine if you open up your favourite chat-application, and your contacts there include other users of the same app and also other Matrix-users (so the app has exposed itself to Matrix). Your friend, however, much prefers a different app, but he can still talk to you over the Matrix protocol. And if he ever moves to the other app (or any other Matrix-supporting app) - he would still have all the backlog and history of the conversation!</p>
<p>Obviously the problem here is that we can't instantly make the various chat-applications support Matrix. We believe if we can encourage and grow a truly open communication ecosystem, users will get used to the availability and benefits of interoperable services and they will demand it everywhere.</p>
