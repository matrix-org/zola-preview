            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Just over a week ago we had the honour of using Matrix to host FOSDEM: the world's largest free &amp; open source software conference.  It's taken us a little while to write up the experience given we had to recover and catch up on business as usual... but better late than never, here's an overview of what it takes to run a ~30K attendee conference on Matrix!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_5335e89b9ca474d844bdc37ea328967b.png" alt="" /><small><center><em>[confetti and firework easter-eggs explode over the closing keynote of FOSDEM 2021]</em></center></small></p>
<p>First of all, a quick (re)introduction to Matrix for any newcomers: Matrix is an open source project which defines an open standard protocol for decentralised communication.  The global Matrix network makes up at least 28M Matrix IDs spread over around 60K servers.  For FOSDEM, we set up a fosdem.org server to host newcomers, provided by <a href="https://ems.element.io">Element Matrix Services (EMS)</a> - <a href="https://element.io">Element</a> being the startup formed by the Matrix core team to help fund Matrix development.</p>
<p>The most unique thing about Matrix is that conversations get replicated across all servers whose users are present in the conversation, so there's never a single point of control or failure for a conversation (much as git repositories get replicated between all contributors).  And so hosting FOSDEM in Matrix meant that everyone already on Matrix (including users bridged to Matrix from IRC, XMPP, Slack, Discord etc) could attend directly - in addition to users signing up for the first time on the FOSDEM server.  Therefore the chat around FOSDEM 2021 now exists for posterity on all the Matrix servers whose users who participated; and we hope that the fosdem.org server will hang around for the benefit of all the newcomers for the foreseeable so they don't lose their accounts!</p>
<p>Talking of which: the vital stats of the weekend were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We saw almost 30K local users on the FOSDEM server + 4K remote users from elsewhere in Matrix.</li>
<li>There were 24,826 guests (read-only invisible users) on the FOSDEM server.</li>
<li>There were 8,060 distinct users actively joined to the public FOSDEM rooms...</li>
<li>...of which 3,827 registered on the FOSDEM server.  (This is a bit of an eye-opener: over 50% of the actively participating attendees for FOSDEM were already on Matrix!)</li>
<li>These numbers don't count users who were viewing the livestreams directly, but only those who were attending via Matrix.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given last year's FOSDEM had roughly 8,500 in-person attendees at the Université libre de Bruxelles, this feels like a pretty good outcome :)</p>
<p>Graphwise, local user activity on the FOSDEM server looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_e24e0febde0118ea9f2e93005d926d48.png" alt="" />
<img src="/blog/img/upload_63bad29ebc4d672d9979f9eea48fcfc5.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="how-was-it-built">How was it built?</h2>
<p>There were four main components on the Matrix side:</p>
<ol>
<li>A horizontally-scalable Matrix server deployment (Synapse hosted in <a href="https://ems.element.io">EMS</a>)</li>
<li>A Jitsi cluster for the video conferencing, used to host all the Q&amp;A sessions, hallway sessions, stands, and other adhoc video conferences</li>
<li>An elastically scalable Jibri cluster used to livestream the Jitsi conferences both to the official FOSDEM livestreams and to provide a local preview of the conference on Matrix (to avoid the Jitsis getting overloaded with folks who just want to view)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/conference-bot">conference-bot</a> - a Matrix bot which orchestrated the overall conference on Matrix, written from scratch for FOSDEM by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a>, consuming the schedule from FOSDEM and maintaining all the necessary rooms with the correct permissions, widgets, invites, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Architecturally, it looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_06b59bc2b2d518ffe616020e1fe5bee8.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>On the clientside, we made heavy use of widgets: the ability to embed arbitrary web content as iframes into Matrix chatrooms. (Widgets currently exist as a set of <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">proposals</a> for the Matrix spec, which have been preemptively implemented in Element.)</p>
<p>For instance, the conference-bot created Matrix rooms for all the FOSDEM devrooms with a predefined widget for viewing the official FOSDEM livestream for that room, pointing at the appropriate HLS stream at stream.fosdem.org - which looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_07145dc9cf8d5ae22b6eaf91a63dd8d6.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Each devroom also had a schedule widget available on the righthand side, visualising the schedule of that room - huge thanks to Hato and Steffen and folks at <a href="https://nordeck.net/">Nordeck</a> for putting this together at the last minute; it enormously helped navigate the devrooms (and even had a live countdown to help you track where you were at in the schedule!)</p>
<p>Each devroom was also available via IRC on Freenode via a dedicated bridge (#fosdem-...) and via XMPP.</p>
<p>The bot also created rooms for each and every talk at FOSDEM (all 666 of them), as the space where the speaker and host could hang out in advance; watch the talk together, and then broadcast the Q&amp;A session.  At the end of the talk slot, the bot then transformed the talk room into a 'hallway' for the talk, and advertised it to the audience in the devroom, so folks could pose follow-on questions to the speaker as so often happens in real life at FOSDEM.  The speaker's view of the talk rooms looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_f8b9121b21323955233d6633d19e3fb5.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>On the right-hand side you can see a &quot;scoreboard&quot; - a simple widget which tracked which messages in the devroom had been most upvoted, to help select questions for the Q&amp;A session.  On the left-hand side you can see a hybrid Jitsi/livestream widget used to coordinate between the speaker &amp; host.  By default, the widget showed the local livestream of the video call - if you clicked 'join conference' you'd join the Jitsi itself.  This stopped view-only users from overloading the Jitsi once the room became public.</p>
<p>The widgets themselves were hosted by the bot (you can see them at https://github.com/matrix-org/conference-bot/tree/main/web).  Meanwhile the chat.fosdem.org webclient itself ended up being identical to mainline Element Web 1.7.19, other than FOSDEM branding and being configured to hook the 'video call' button up to the hybrid Jitsi/livestream widget rather than a plain Jitsi.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for conferencing we hosted an off-the-shelf Jitsi cluster sized to ~100 concurrent conferences, and for the Jibri livestreaming we set up an elastic scalable cluster using AWS Auto Scaling Groups.  Jibri is essentially a Chromium which views the Jitsi webapp, running in a headless X server whose framebuffer and ALSA audio is hooked up to an ffmpeg process which livestreams to the appropriate destination - so we chose to run a separate VM for every concurrent livestream to keep them isolated from each other.  The Jibri ffmpegs compressed the livestream to RTMP and relayed it to our nginx, which in turn relayed it to FOSDEM's livestreaming infrastructure for use in the official stream, as well as relaying it back to the local video preview in the Matrix livestream/video widget.</p>
<p>Here's a screengrab of the Jitsi/Jibri Grafana dashboard during the first day of the conference, showing 46 concurrent conferences in action, with 25 spare jibris in the scaling group cluster ready for action if needed :)</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_1dfb1ef630c0ac8f5b3fd81f52491964.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>There was also an explosion of changes to Element itself to try to make things go as smoothly as possible.  Probably the most important one was implementing Social Login - giving single-click registration for attendees who were happy to piggyback on existing identity providers (GitHub, GitLab, Google, Apple and Facebook) rather then signing up natively in Matrix:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_45b228cf122b2faedfca5e36b6d52576.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This was a real epic to get together (and is also an important part of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix">achieving parity</a> between Gitter and Element) - and seems to have been surprisingly successful for FOSDEM.  Almost 50% of users who signed up on the FOSDEM server did so via social login!  We should also be turning it on for the matrix.org server this week.</p>
<p>Finally, on the Matrix server side, we ran a cluster of synapse worker processes (1 federation inbound, reader and sender, 1 pusher, 1 initial sync worker, 10 synchrotrons, 1 event persister, 1 event creator, 4 general purpose client readers, 1 typing worker and 1 user directory) within Kubernetes on <a href="https://ems.element.io">EMS</a>.  These were hooked up for <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/03/how-we-fixed-synapses-scalability/">horizontal scalability</a> as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/upload_22b8ea14fff89c1bce93767b82ab1db5.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The sort of traffic we saw (from day 2) looked like this:</p>

<h2 id="how-did-it-go">How did it go?</h2>
<p>Overall, people seem to have had a good time.  Some folks have <a href="https://twitter.com/haerwu/status/1358731829512183813">even</a> been <a href="https://twitter.com/AxSaucedo/status/1358048849944797187">kind</a> enough to call it the <a href="https://twitter.com/cterboven/status/1358343020576440322">best</a> online event they've been to :)  This probably reflects the fact that FOSDEM rocks no matter what - and that Matrix is an inherently social medium, built by and for open source communities (after all, the whole Matrix ecosystem is developed over Matrix!).  Also, Matrix being an open network means that folks could join from all over, so the social dynamics already present in Matrix spilled over into FOSDEM - and we even saw a bunch of people spin up their own servers to participate; literally sharing the hosting responsibility themselves.  Finally, having critical infrastructure rooms available such as <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#beerevent:fosdem.org">#beerevent:fosdem.org</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#cafe:fosdem.org">#cafe:fosdem.org</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#food-trucks:fosdem.org">#food-trucks:fosdem.org</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/bortzmeyer/status/1358022989875466240">probably</a> helped as well.</p>
<p>That said, we did have some production incidents which impacted the event.  The most serious one was on Saturday morning, where it transpired that some of the endpoints hosted on the main Synapse process were taking way more CPU than we'd anticipated - most importantly the /groups endpoints which handle traffic relating to communities (the legacy way of defining groups of rooms in Matrix).  One of the last things we'd done to prepare for the conference on Friday night was to create a +fosdem:fosdem.org community which spanned all 1000 public rooms in the conference, as well as add the +staff:fosdem.org community to all of those rooms - and unfortunately we didn't anticipate how popular these would be.  As a result we had to do some emergency rebalancing of endpoints, spinning up new workers and reconfiguring the loadbalancer to relieve load off the main process.</p>
<p>Ironically the Matrix server was largely working okay during this timeframe, given event-sending no longer passes through the main process - but the most serious impact was that the conference bot was unable to boot due to hitting a wide range of endpoints on startup as it syncs with the conference, some of which were timing out.  This in turn impacted widgets, which had been hosted by the bot for convenience, meaning that the Jitsi conferences for stands and talk Q&amp;A were unavailable (even though the Jitsi/Jibri cluster was fine).  This was solved by lunchtime on Saturday: we are really sorry for folks whose Q&amp;As or conferences got caught in this.  On the plus side, we spotted that many affected rooms just added their own widgets for their own Jitsis or BBBs to continue with minimal distraction - effectively manually taking over from the bot.</p>
<p>The other main incident was briefly first thing on Sunday morning, where two Jibri livestreams ended up trying to broadcast video to the same RTMP URL (potentially due to a race when rapidly removing and re-adding the jitsi/livestream widget for one of the stands).  This caused a cascading failure which briefly impacted all RTMP streams, but was solved within about 30 minutes.  We also had a more minor problem with the active speaker recognition malfunctioning in Jitsi on Sunday (apparently a risk when using SCTP rather than Websockets as a transport within Jitsi) - this was solved around lunchtime.  Again, we're really sorry if you were impacted by this.  We've learned a lot from the experience, and if we end up doing this again we will make sure these failure modes don't repeat!</p>
<p>Other things we'd change if we have the chance to do it again include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a to-the-second countdown via a widget in the talk room so the speaker &amp; host can see precisely when they're going 'live' in the devroom (and when precisely they're going to be cut in favour of the next talk)</li>
<li>Providing a scratch-pad of some kind in the talk room so the host &amp; speaker can track which questions they want to answer, and which they've already answered</li>
<li>Keep the questions scoreboard and scratchpad visible to the speaker/host after their Q&amp;A has finished so they can keep answering the questions in the per-talk room, and advertise the per-talk room more effectively.</li>
<li>Use Spaces rather than Communities to group the rooms together and automatically provide a structured room directory! (<a href="https://youtu.be/TzUfS08lMek?t=1609">Like this!</a>)</li>
<li>Use threads (once they land!) to help structure conversations in the devroom (perhaps these could even replace the hallway rooms?)</li>
<li>Make the schedule widgets easier to find, and have more of them around the place</li>
<li>Make room directory easier to find.</li>
<li>Give the option of recording the video in the per-talk and stands for posterity</li>
<li>Provide more tools to stands to help organise demos etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there you have it.  We hope that this shows that it's possible to host successful large-scale conferences on Matrix using an <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/feb/08/just-say-no-to-zoom/">entirely open source stack</a>, and we hope that other events will be inspired to go online via Matrix!  We should give a big shout out to <a href="https://hope.net">HOPE</a>, who independently trailblazed running conferences on Matrix last year and <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/08/11/hope-2020-delivers-historic-marathon-of-hacking/">inspired us</a> to make FOSDEM work.</p>
<p>If you want to know more, we also did a talk about FOSDEM-on-Matrix in this month's <a href="https://youtu.be/Wp2rSyqZsbs?t=4903">Open Tech Will Save Us</a> meetup and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzUfS08lMek">Building Massive Virtual Communities on Matrix</a> talk at FOSDEM went into more detail too.  Our historical <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/04/taking-fosdem-online-via-matrix">Taking FOSDEM online via Matrix</a> blog has been somewhat overtaken by events but gives further context still.</p>
<p>Finally, huge thanks to FOSDEM for letting Matrix host the social side of the conference.  This was a big bet, starting from scratch with our <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1301285515774373889">offer to help</a> back in September, and we hope it paid off.  Also, thanks to all the folks at Element who bust a gut to pull it together - and to the FOSDEM organisers, who were a real pleasure to work with.</p>
<p>Let's hope that FOSDEM 2022 will be back in person at ULB - but whatever happens, the infrastructure we built this year will be available if ever needed in future.</p>

<p>Article in German, but my favourite parts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They used the word &quot;Anti-Datenkrake&quot; to describe how data is handled in the application, which basically is a metaphor for Famedly being the opposite of the usual corporations trying to pry their tentacles into everyones personal data.

<p>They actually use <code>[matrix]–Protokoll</code> to refer to the Matrix protocol. The open and standardized Matrix protocol seems to be a big selling factor.</p>

<h4 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h4>
<p>Some chatter about the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403</a> (knocking) as FCP has been proposed. Otherwise work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a> (Spaces) as that nears production and some encryption work with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2874">MSC2874</a> (single SSSS).</p>
<p>The team is carefully debilitating <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2997">MSC2997</a>, which spurred out of a conversation during FOSDEM2021. What sizes to include? What font to use? What colour do we paint this bike shed? All incredibly complex questions.</p>
<h4 id="new-spec-platform">New Spec Platform</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wbamberg">Will Bamberg</a> has done an incredible job with getting both an entire redesign and an internal refactoring to the Matrix Spec. Remaining work includes ironing out some remaining minor blockers (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3002, https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3003), merging changelog representation with respect to the current idea of a global Matrix Spec version number (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2992) and then finally hooking up all the CI/CD to deploy it all (my job!).</p>
<p>We're planning to present the new spec on a new domain; running it in parallel with the old design for a bit before eventually retiring the latter.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@grin:grin.hu">grin</a> shared this note from Jason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix Construct added Application Services support. I've been using the Mautrix Telegram bridge on a daily basis, and it's been a pleasure to develop with. Expect more bridges to be tested in the coming weeks. I'll also be working on completing the documentation for how to setup a bridge in Construct. Just to give some insight: The server has the ability to manage all of your bridges as sub-processes. In any client, just create a room for your bridge and enter its configuration there. Voila! The bridge's console appears right in that room and can even highlight you about errors!</p>
<p>Join us at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> to learn more about bridges and lend a hand.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We survived FOSDEM! Last week was relatively slower in Synapse land as we paused to catch our breath, but we do have news!</p>
<p>First, releases. Synapse 1.27.0rc2 is out now (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.27.0rc2/CHANGES.md#synapse-1270rc2-2021-02-11">changelog</a>), and we anticipate a full 1.27 release early next week. This is basically the branch that FOSDEM ran, so we think it's a good one.</p>
<p>Second, keeping with our biweekly development cadence, the first 1.28 release candidate is due out midweek next week, so keep your eyes peeled for that. Given FOSDEM, most of our recent focus has been on stability, bug fixes, and social login. We hope to <em>knock</em> your socks off with more ambitious features soon. 😉</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We just landed basic support for edits. Which means edits are now applied to the original message instead of showing the fallback and you can edit your messages. You can also change a text message to a video (or the other way around) or change, who you replied to, but the latter fails to render in some clients properly, so be aware of that. Edits also send a secondary relation format, which makes handling edits easier, but I still haven't written up the MSC for that... The UI is not final yet and you can't show edit history yet, but apart from that it may or may not work fine.</p>
<p>There were also a lot of bugfixes like broken kerning in some cases, improved focus handling when clicking buttons in the timeline, Duplex devices should now work in calls, notifications now work on Haiku and a few more.</p>
<p>Now please stop asking for edits! :D</p>

<ul>
<li>VoIP branches merged to develop on iOS and &amp; Android - please test voice &amp; video calling if you have the android develop build, or testflight for iOS will be coming soon. More complex scenarios with multiple devices are particularly useful to test, eg. do other devices stop ringing when you answer on a different one?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Web</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1.7.21-rc.1 is now available at https://staging.element.io, including:</p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>XcodeGen integration into the Element-iOS codebase is almost complete. From next week, we will not have merge conflicts on the pbxproj files. This also means better control on build settings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initial sync work improvements: performance is far better regarding RAM usage and stability (especially true for large accounts), though duration is still a concern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Started working on running integration tests via CI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1.0.17 released, fixing a join over federation bug. Expect 1.0.18 next week.</p>

<p>This is a super early announcement.</p>
<p>As now Spaces exist and are kind of testable if you know how I went ahead to plan organizing my 200 rooms I currently have into spaces and realized soon that I will have A LOT of nested Spaces.</p>
<p>So I am now starting to write a tool to generate these spaces easily from a folder structure and exporting them.</p>
<p>You may ask why not a yaml or json format: Simply to more easily allow forking of existing collections. A folder structure is much easier to do a diff over in git than file content.</p>

<p>FOSDEM is happening this year, regardless of pandemics or anything else! Actually FOSDEM in my experience is a huge super-spreader event even in normal years, so it may be refreshing to know that this year it will be <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/04/taking-fosdem-online-via-matrix">fully virtual, and hosted using Matrix and Jitsi</a>!</p>
<p>Matrix have several relevant talks happening:</p>

</ul>
<p>Plus, there is a bonus talk from Brendan:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/community_devroom_mental_health_free_software/">Mental health and free software</a> <em>Sunday @ 13:50</em> (in which Brendan talks about mental health issues in the context of working on free software, which may or may not relate to people, though certainly not me, pinging him at all hours to ask about customer integrations and features)</li>

<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>

<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/">FOSDEM</a> is tomorrow! We're all very excited to be powering the fosdem.org homeserver, and we hope you'll join in over the weekend.</p>
<p>Earlier this week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.27.0rc1">Synapse 1.27.0rc1</a>, though the final release is currently blocked on resolving a regression in Synapse 1.26 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9264">#9264</a>) which could cause logins to fail if your <code>public_baseurl</code> was unset in your Synapse configuration. The workaround is to ensure that value is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/docs/sample_config.yaml#L70-L81">correctly set</a> for your deployment.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we're quite excited to get 1.27 out the door, as it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solves an issue (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9172">#9172</a>) where federation senders could take many minutes to catch up after restarts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contains countless improvements to our support for social login methods, many of which will be live for FOSDEM users this weekend.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also included the usual host of bug fixes and Admin API additions, but more on those when the actual release happens. You can preview the release notes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.27.0rc1">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>See you at FOSDEM!</p>

<p>My iMessage bridge is starting to be usable now. Text and files work in both directions and tapbacks and replies work iMessage-&gt;Matrix. Currently it only supports running on a Mac, the iOS option will come later. The bridge doesn't require opening ports to the Mac, it uses a simple proxy that turns the usual HTTP appservice transactions into a websocket instead.</p>
<p>The bridge itself can be found at https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-imessage and the websocket proxy is at https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-wsproxy. The Matrix room is <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#imessage:maunium.net">#imessage:maunium.net</a></p>

<p>We're also working on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> to support backfilling the massive archive of historical messages on Gitter over on Matrix.

<p>Another release! Wow. We're also testing 0.24.0-rc1 which has quite a few big ticket items this week. Off the top of the list is a new command to <code>!plumb</code> rooms dynamically in admin rooms, provided you have permissions in the bridge (happy days self hosters!). We've also added the feature to warn if your messages don't get through in your admin room. Finally, there are a bunch of small bug fixes and one large one that should make the bridge <strong>much</strong> more resistant to netsplits, so that it should recover in a much safer way should it get hit by a ton of traffic. Please test, and if all goes well the formal release will be out next week!</p>

<p>In other news, lorendb extended the drop zone for media to the full timeline, the privacy screen got merged, some more emojis should now display properly, you can now change your avatar and displayname globally or per room and clicking a matrix link in your browser should now actually open the link in Nheko (we were missing the %u in the .desktop file).</p>

<p>I have been learning about matrix the last few months.

Highlights of the project so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Works on Linux, Windows, macOS and Android (although I only test on Linux and often break the other platforms)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should work on WASM and iOS with not too much effort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very, very limited E2EE support. (If the session is manually verified by other clients, events can be encrypted and decrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Library that handles storage, encryption and some other things with a opinionated but simple to use (I hope) interface.</p>

As mentioned last week, the two biggest new features are a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/auth_chain_difference_algorithm.md">faster algorithm</a> for state resolution and initial support for enabling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9110">multiple OpenID Connect providers</a>.

See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> for details.</p>
<p>We expect to publish a release candidate for 1.27.0 early next week, but we're trying to be conservative about large changes ahead of FOSDEM, so knocking — which <em>is</em> coming! — will have to wait until 1.28.0... 🚪</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks! It's been a while since we've had an update but things are always manic at bridge HQ. This release is a bit of a whopper containing quite a few bugfixes (including improvements to the experimental encrypted bridge support). We've also updated to Typescript 4.1 which is a bit stricter on those promise return types. Finally, you can now create intents on the bridge and use it's components without starting the HTTP listener which has been a longstanding issue for as long as I've been maintaining.</p>
<p>So go out there and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/v2.5.0-rc1">test this release</a>, all going well we should 🚢 early next week!</p>

All the feedback, bugfixes and issues you provided certainly will help improving Nheko for everyone!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, later...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apart from the current releases, we have a few things cooking right now:</p>
<h4 id="edits">Edits</h4>
<p>Yes, I have tried to avoid them for long, but <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/pull/420">I am finally working on it</a>. It's a bit different to how Element and others do it, but it also generates a fallback to be compatible with the current MSCs where possible. I've grown a bit tired of having to explain myself everytime, why I did not want to support edits (yet), so I'm experimenting with a few solutions now. Expect a blog post summarizing those experiments in the future and maybe an MSC.</p>
<h4 id="polish">Polish</h4>
<p>Jedi18 and LorenDB are both busy polishing up the rough corners in Nheko, like finally being able to set your username and avatar in the UI as well as being able to copy text via right click, jdenticons and other fancy stuff. We also had a few contributions in the last release, which should improve the UX a lot.</p>
<h4 id="gsoc">GSoC</h4>
<p>Furthermore we will be participating in GSoC (if matrix.org gets accepted) and will probably mentor a student, that implements a few of the smaller features, which users may be missing after using Element for long.</p>
<p>I think that is all I wanted to share. I hope you enjoy the release and if you have any issues or feature requests, tell us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> or open an issue on Github!</p>

<h3 id="quaternion">Quaternion</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the project is already fairly rich in features, I decided that it's timely (some would say - way overdue) to bump up the version a bit. In that light, the next Quaternion beta is numbered 0.0.95 beta 3 (no four-number version any more) and it's out now! <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.95-beta3">Release notes</a> list notable changes since (0.0.9.5) beta 2, with two most significant being ability to enter messages in Markdown and the overhauled timeline that allows you to easily discern between already read and yet unread messages and also quickly scroll to the read marker.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Delight</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social Login</p>
<ul>
<li>Final polishing and bug hunting across all platforms. We are targeting 5 options to begin with (Gitlab, Github, Facebook, Google and Apple) and will hopefully be ready to start setting these up on homeservers next week. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spaces</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of polishing on Element web, you can get all the latest in the matrix live demo session next week!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VoIP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added some debugging to web to help debug call connectivity failures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a compatibility regression in web with voip v0 clients (ie. element android / ios) - d’oh!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Android: work on getting call audio routing correct on various different devices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design coming up to speed to support on implementation and ongoing UI improvements</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Web</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Off cycle 1.7.18 release for VoIP compat bug</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various tweaks to prepare for FOSDEM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Element Web 1.7.19-rc.1 is now available at https://staging.element.io, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allowed guest users to see widgets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standardised security terminology to reduce confusion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added ability to pin widgets for everyone in the room</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We made several iterations since the last App Store release (1.1.3) but Element-iOS <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/releases">1.1.6</a> is now in the store. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We made some improvements to use less RAM in the background sync module that manages push notifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We continued to improve performance in E2EE to speed up message sending using pre-sharing keys and re-sharing keys methods. Element-iOS now automatically rejects share requests from not verified devices. It does not send anymore such requests if it is not verified.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are working on improving the initial /sync management. The first objective is to reduce RAM usage. Then, we will improve the time to display the room list.</li>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.26.0">Synapse 1.26.0</a> is now available!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This release includes a new database schema version. If you need to roll back to Synapse 1.25.0, you will also need to follow the associated <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1260">database downgrade instructions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to a truckload of refactoring and general improvements, Synapse 1.26.0 includes three major new features:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/auth_chain_difference_algorithm.md">brand new algorithm</a> for calculating the auth chain difference, which should dramatically improve worst case performance during state resolution (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622">#8622</a>).</li>
<li>Initial support for enabling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9110">multiple OpenID Connect providers</a>, paving the way for proper multi-provider social login workflows.</li>
<li>A significant speed-up to redaction performance in large rooms.</li>
</ol>
<p>It also brings several improvements to Admin APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific media items can be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/admin_api/media_admin_api.md#protecting-media-from-being-quarantined">protected from quarantine</a>. </li>
<li>The <code>joined_rooms</code> API now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#list-room-memberships-of-an-user">works for remote users</a>.</li>
<li>Deactivating a user can now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#deactivate-account">optionally remove their avatar URL and display name</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also made it possible to offload several additional APIs to worker processes, including read receipts and account data persistence, further improving Synapse's scalability.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> for more.</p>
<p>Lastly, a reminder: we have <strong>deprecated Python 3.5 and PostgreSQL 9.5</strong> and will cease support at the end of March. Due to deprecations in our Python tooling, we were unable to produce a binary package for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) in time for this release. We have resolved this for 1.27.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/0xflotus">0xflotus</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chris-ruecker">chris-ruecker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/emelie-qis">emelie-qis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jerinjtitus">jerinjtitus</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/tzyl">tzyl</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>New website! <a href="https://beeperhq.com">beeperhq.com</a>. Beeper is a Matrix server+client combo preconfigured with 12+ bridges. Our mission is to bring a lot of new users into the Matrix ecosystem and give them a fast and powerful client to message people on all networks. Beeper is a paid subscription service, but since all the bridges are open source, you can set the whole system up yourself for free if you choose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're doing a lot of work to boost bridge reliability. Beeper now comes with bridges to Signal, Whatsapp, FB, Slack, Skype, Telegram, Instagram, Hangouts, Twitter, Discord. iMessage coming within a week or two.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>We are offering bounties of $500-2,000 USD to build new open source bridges based on tulir's mautrix-python or mautrix-go libraries. In particular, we would love to commission Linkedin, MS Teams, Google Chat, GroupMe, WeChat, Snapchat (maybe run it in Anbox?), Line and Email (gmail specifically) bridges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are also looking for contract iOS and Android developers familiar with the Element codebase to reskin the app with our new UI. Part-time roles with potential for full time.</p>

<p>Google Summer of Code has come around again! Last year was really successful for Matrix: six projects, with members of the community coming forward to mentor students for their project. This year there is a slight tweak to the formula: <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/10/google-summer-of-code-2021-is-bringing.html">the projects will now be 175 hours, rather than the traditional 350, over the summer</a>.</p>
<p>Since we need to <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline">submit an application to Google within the next few weeks</a>, I have a request: if you admin a Matrix-related Open Source project and would like to have a student work with you over the summer, get involved!</p>
<p>How to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources">Google's own documentation</a> on the setup. This is fairly thorough, and should get you most of the way there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about a task, that you consider a student should be able to contribute to your project over a 10-week/175-hour period. Try to come up with 2-3 of these.</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be a well-defined feature that genuinely contributes to the progress of your project, but maybe doesn't block other work on the critical path.</li>
<li>This is a very important step, and one that may need some time and discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>DM me (@benpa:bpulse.org) and we'll talk about next steps.</p>

<p>We've decided to ditch the focus as it was clear that it wasn't a great indicator of progress. Once one team member has reviewed all of the focus items, they will move on to other MSCs. None of that work is reflected in the focus, and items in there often stick around while waiting on a small number of people to complete work on.</p>
<p>As such, we'd instead like to direct people to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/31">Spec Core Team Backlog board</a>, which is a better representation of the current state of things. And of course the weekly list of MSCs state changes above.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of this week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.6">Dendrite 0.3.6</a>, which included a number of refactors in the sync API and a selection of fixes. It is also the first version to be released with multi-arch Docker images with ARMv7/ARM64 targets.</p>
<p>Since then, the following changes have been merged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sync filtering support for event types, senders as well as better-supported limits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation support for MSC2946 (Spaces Summary)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug where large well-known files could consume a lot of memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for in-process DNS caching for federation traffic (although it is disabled by default)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some preparatory work for tracking the most recent membership states in the sync API for future history visibility work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 60%, up from 58% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>

<p>🎉 Synapse 1.26.0rc1 is here!</p>
<p>☠️ But don't install it yet; wait for rc2.</p>
<p>A few issues were reported with rc1 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9187">#9187</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9193">#9193</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9208">#9208</a>), and we'll issue an rc2 early next week once we're confident they've been resolved.</p>
<p>Otherwise, once 1.26.0 is released you can look forward to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/docs/auth_chain_difference_algorithm.md">a new algorithm</a> for calculating auth chain difference in v2 State Resolution which should significantly speed up some of the most expensive state resolution calculations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622">#8622</a>).</p>
<p>We've also dramatically improved the performance of redactions in large rooms, helping Synapse's moderation tools scale to communities of any size (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9022">#9022</a>). And speaking of scaling, Synapse 1.26 makes it possible to offload many different APIs to worker processes, including read receipts and account data persistence.</p>
<p>Lastly, Synapse 1.26 will include support for multiple Single Sign-On Identity providers, though we expect further fit-and-finish for that feature to land in 1.27.</p>
<p>You can preview the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/CHANGES.md">changelog</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1260">upgrade notes</a> now, but remember: wait for rc2! 😉</p>

<p>Today a present you a Matrix client library I've been working for the last few months: <a href="https://github.com/erdnaxeli/caridina">caridina</a>.</p>
<p>It is a <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a> library. Currently for reading it implements the sync API and supports the events to do text messaging (all state events + <code>m.room.message</code>). For writing it provides methods to send messages, edit them, and send receipts and typing notifications.</p>
<p>While I would not recommend this library to write a full featured client, it is enough to write a simple text bot. I currently use it for some of my own projects. The README provides some examples of how to use the library.</p>

<h4 id="opsdroid-1">opsdroid</h4>
<p><a href="https://opsdroid.dev/">opsdroid</a> is an easy to use chat-ops framework with excellent Matrix support.</p>
<h4 id="0-20-release">0.20 Release</h4>
<p>This week opsdroid released version 0.20. This is a <em>massive</em> release that's been a long time coming because of a <strong>complete rewrite of the internals of the matrix connector to use <a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a></strong>---thanks to <a href="https://github.com/awesome-michael">@awesome-michael</a> for the initial work on this.</p>
<p>Having ported the connector to nio, our GSOC student <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tyagdit:matrix.org">@Tyagdit</a> got to work polishing the nio port and reimplementing the <strong>matrix database</strong> module in the core opsdroid library. Opsdroid has a concept of memory which is a key-value store which can be backed my many different kinds of <a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/">databases</a>. The <a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/matrix.html">matrix database</a> stores the opsdroid memory in room state, meaning your bot's database and messages are all stored in the same place.</p>
<p>Finally, the other big feature added to the matrix support in this release is <strong>End to End Encryption</strong> support. Thanks to using matrix-nio as our matrix library it was possible to implement support for encrypted matrix rooms. This also includes support in the matrix database for encrypted memory which works by referencing event ids in room state (<a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/matrix.html#encryption">see here</a> for more info). As this is the first release to support E2EE I would still consider it &quot;beta&quot;; please open issues if you have any trouble using it.</p>
<h4 id="highlights-1">Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>End to End Encryption support in the Matrix connector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matrix database now included in core, with e2ee support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of Python's install &quot;extras&quot; to allow for installations with fewer packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved documentation of the matrix connector and database (at least a little).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for Python 3.9 (and dropped support for 3.6).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Checkout the <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/releases">full release notes</a> for all the gory details.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Version 2.0 of <a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal">matrix-corporal</a> has been released.</p>
<p>It's a huge release bringing many improvements (read all of it in the <a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal/releases/tag/2.0.0">release notes</a>).</p>
<p>Here's a short summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an <strong>Event Hooks system</strong> has been introduced, so matrix-corporal can now also act like a &quot;generic firewall&quot; (similar to what <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxgwd">mxgwd</a> was doing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>device-free login</strong> is now used when impersonating users (thanks to a new API introduced by Synapse v1.24.0) - this is both faster and more resilient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for <strong>Interactive Authentication</strong> (and thus, <strong>End-to-End-Encryption</strong>) has been added. Users can now set up E2EE keys, manage devices, etc. (actions that require Interactive Authentication and were previously broken). Requires cooperation between <code>matrix-corporal</code> and the <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-synapse-rest-password-provider">REST auth password provider module</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>End-to-End-Encryption control</strong>. matrix-corporal can enforce whether rooms that users create are encrypted or unencrypted. You can force-disable or force-enable encryption for locally-created rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fixes user-creation regression</strong> that happened with Synapse v1.24.0. matrix-corporal v1.12.0 is also out, with a backport of this fix (for users who don't want to jump to 2.0 yet).</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's not dead! yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's been some code refactoring on the <a href="https://github.com/anchor-logoot">algorithm</a>. Mainly, the search tree used has been split into a different package</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm working on porting the Notepad to the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api">widget API</a>. Ongoing work is on the <a href="https://github.com/KB1RD/matrix-notepad/tree/nextgen">nextgen branch</a> and is tracked by <a href="https://github.com/KB1RD/matrix-notepad/projects/3">this</a> project. The widget is currently blocked on some stuff in the widget API, so I probably won't be releasing soon. The code in there needs a <em>ton</em> refactoring, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that the old notepad client will disappear on the next release and you'll need to add a widget for the Notepad for any documents that you want to edit. Currently, this means you would have to use Element, but I heard Ditto just might be doing some widget work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The widget API is planned to do everything and more that my &quot;mxapps&quot; project was supposed to do, so that project will be deprecated in favor of using the widget API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's also a little demo/teaser video showing the old notepad talking to the new one. You can see the rate limiting issues that the Notepad hits there, which is on my todo list.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week we released Dendrite 0.3.5, our first release of 2021, which includes a fairly significant refactor of parts of the sync API, along with other fixes. More work has since been merged into <code>master</code> too.</p>
<p>Changes in the last two weeks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sync streams are now logically separate, with a lot of behaviour fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities are now deep-checked properly, which should significantly reduce the peaks of CPU and RAM when handling the current room state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pagination tokens in <code>/messages</code> have been fixed, which should improve the reliability of scrolling back in the timeline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of fixes have been made to the <code>/sync</code> response, largely avoiding <code>null</code>s, which should make some clients happier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send-to-device messaging has been refactored, which should improve E2EE stability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well-known/DNS records for federated servers are now cached rather than performing lots of lookups, speeding up outbound federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Device list requests to remote servers now time out quicker, so as to not block <code>/send</code> transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental support for MSC2946 has been merged (gated behind the <code>mscs</code> configuration)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request context is no longer reused for <code>/send</code>, which should help in cases where the remote sending server gives up waiting or the connection breaks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%</p>

<p>I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you explain something: Dendrite federation is basically working fine, AIUI, what does it mean that <code>Server-server APIs</code> is &lt;100%?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil</a> helpfully replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are still some edge-case tests that we haven't got passing yet, but I think that's only ~20 tests or so.<br />
There are also a few tests which are quite sensitive to exactly what Synapse does/returns, even though Dendrite is probably doing the right thing but maybe taking a different amount of time to do it or returning something slightly different, so there'll be some tests we need to fix too</p>

<p>A few improvements to the Gitter bridge this week so that when a room updates and the avatar or topic changes, it now propagates across to Matrix automatically. We also handle updating the name whenever we have to rename a room or a group.</p>
<p>We're also thinking about how best to tackle self-service plumbing so you can pipe a Gitter room into your existing Matrix room. And the bigger idea of connecting various bridged portal rooms together. So you can connect your community on Gitter &lt;-&gt; Matrix &lt;-&gt; IRC seamlessly for example. The current thinking is introducing this as a native Matrix concept so you can easily connect any Matrix room to another Matrix room. We'd love to hear your thoughts in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2923">MSC2923</a>.</p>

<p>Version 2 of mx-puppet-groupme is here! This week I did some reverse engineering of the GroupMe Android app with mitmproxy so that I could work out the remaining undocumented features of GroupMe's API. As a result, typing notifications, read receipts, and videos are now working! Though note that due to limitations of the platform, read receipts are a DMs-only feature.</p>
<p>We also now have a Dockerfile (thanks, Trey B.!), double puppeting support was added, the code was ported to Typescript, and it should now work with older versions of Node. So at this point the bridge is basically feature-complete!

<p>The new version only supports Postgres like my newer bridges, but I'll invent a SQLite migration tool before merging to master.</p>

<p>NeoChat 1.0.1 was released with a few important bugfixes. https://carlschwan.eu/2021/01/13/neochat-1.0.1-first-bugfix-release/. On the unstable branch, we continued to improve the integration with Plasma. We now display the unread count in the taskbar and we are getting inline replies too thanks to the work of <a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/knotifications/-/merge_requests/28">Kai Uwe Broulik</a> in Knotifications. Another important change is that rooms can now be opened in a new separate window.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bugfixing for the next release is in progress, fixing various issues and instabilities introduced with the new features, but some smaller features also still made it in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is now a call invite screen more fitting for mobile devices, when you enable the &quot;Touchscreen mode&quot; in the settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various clickable elements now have a ripple effect again to give feedback, when a click was registered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko now handles the Matrix URI scheme. This means opening a link starting with <code>matrix:</code> should open Nheko (at least on Linux) and redirect to the appropriate room and matrix URIs inside of Nheko are also handled. This currently does not support navigating to a specific event, but opening user profiles, starting chats with specific users and opening or joining rooms should work. Nheko also does not automatically linkify links starting with <code>matrix:</code>, so you need to do that manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verification dialogs were cleaned up a bit and hopefully are easier to understand now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flatpak nightlies now support VOIP calls, but as a result are now a few MB more to download.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we are nearing the next release, it would be appreciated, if you could check the <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/">translations for your platform are up to date</a> and try the <a href="https://matrix-static.neko.dev/room/!TshDrgpBNBDmfDeEGN:neko.dev/">current nightlies</a> and check them for bugs your experience and want to have fixed before release. If you find anything, please report it on <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/new/choose">GitHub</a> or discuss it in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:ocean.joedonofry.com">#nheko:ocean.joedonofry.com</a>.

<p>I'd like to have announced the next beta release for Quaternion 0.0.9.5 - unfortunately, <a href="https://travis-ci.community/t/org-com-migration-unexpectedly-comes-with-a-plan-change-for-oss-what-exactly-is-the-new-deal/10567">migrating from Travis CI</a> took more than I wanted; but adventurous souls are welcome to test the master branch that's basically ready for beta 3.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it surfaced that Quaternion 0.0.9.4e Windows binaries have been expecting (very old and no more supported) OpenSSL 1.0. This is now fixed in <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.9.4f">Quaternion 0.0.9.4f</a> (hopefully this will be the last 0.0.9.4 rebuild and I won't chase the above-mentioned OpenSSL project in trying to expire Latin letters).</p>

<p>PingPong measures transport latencies on Matrix networks. It connects to two Matrix accounts simultaneously, and bounces messages back and forth between them. It aggregates all information in an intuitive terminal user interface, and automatically computes statistics. Source code and more information are available at https://github.com/p-e-w/pingpong.</p>
<p>I have been working on this for a while now and I believe it is ready for others to use at this point. No binary releases yet, the program must be built from source. I only have a Linux development system currently, so feedback on whether it works on macOS and especially Windows is very welcome.</p>

<p>A small update on what is happening after a long time of nothing:</p>

<p>Bot has first part of the registration process (essentially the required automated tests) implemented. Next is the manual verification half.</p>

<p>Welcome back, TWiM readers! It's a new year, and the Synapse team is excited to get back to our regularly scheduled releases! Three main things this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>We published <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.25.0rc1">1.25.0rc1</a>! We'll have full release notes next week, but highlights include:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Deprecated Python 3.5 and Postgres 9.5</strong> per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8782">#8782</a>; more details to come with the formal release announcement.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/04/taking-fosdem-online-via-matrix">Matrix is hosting FOSDEM</a>! Which means that most of the Synapse team is going to be focused on security, stability, and performance until February to ensure that our virtual Université Libre de Bruxelles is as reliable and welcoming the real thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of security, we have some big (but good!) news to announce next week. Watch this space... 🕵️🇪🇺💶</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, one of our goals for this year is to maintain a biweekly cadence of release candidates, so we should have a more consistent pace. At the same time, we realize that keeping up with biweekly releases of server-side software can be a bit of a chore, so we're also discussing ways that we could provide longer support for some of our releases. That's a project for much later this year, but consider it a preview of things to come.</p>

<p><a href="https://schildi.chat/">SchildiChat</a> is a fork of Element, which focuses on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list for both direct messages and groups, which is a more familiar approach to users of other popular instant messengers.</p>
<p>During the last couple of weeks, SchildiChat-Android development focused mainly on staying up-to-date with the upstream Element codebase (URL previews took some time to make them fit nicely into the bubble layouts), and doing some smaller design improvements (like wider message bubbles for some scenarios, and an intelligent message timestamp placement at the bottom of the bubble, depending on the available space).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we now also have experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2867">MSC2867</a>, which allows you to mark rooms as unread. Note that for now, this feature needs to be enabled in the labs settings, since the MSC is still unstable and not supported by many clients, which means other clients might ignore whether the user has manually marked a chat as unread and thus display it as read anyway.</p>

<h3 id="element-clients">Element Clients</h3>
<p>Some updates below from the team. Not all teams are back from their Christmas breaks yet, and those who are may be a little busy with FOSDEM-specific projects, but we have some updates:</p>
<h4 id="spaces">Spaces</h4>
<p>We’re making more progress on the client implementations for Spaces on the web on Android. <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/15930">On Web</a>, recent progress includes implementing notification badges, and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/issues/2495">on Android</a> we’re progressing from SDK work to initial UI implementations.</p>
<h4 id="social-login">Social Login</h4>
<p>Support for <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3846">Social Login on iOS</a> is in review after resolving some issues around VoiceOver, which is the last Element client to implement support ahead of Synapse landing support for social login in the near future.</p>
<h4 id="voip">VoIP</h4>
<p>Lots of things merged to web: dial pad, call forward, dtmf pad, although most won’t show up in normal use (yet). Other progress on web on hold for fosdem work. Dial pad &amp; phone number lookup support incoming on iOS, and phone number lookup on its way on Android.</p>
<h4 id="ios">iOS</h4>
<p>We progressed on several things this week. They are not yet merged but almost. They will be part of the next release we will ship next week: social login, app deadlock fix, encrypted message sending speed improvement, xcodegen usage, sending bug reports in background.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently started a new freelance project and got them to use Matrix as our main communication channel. Since they chose GitHub as our source code platform I got into writing continuous integrations and delivery scripts. But one thing was missing: notifications in our Matrix room. I looked into the GitHub Action Marketplace and found 2 actions that could do that, so that was nice ... but they could not send e2e encrypted messages. Therefore I took up my old issue on how to make e2e encryption work with the js-sdk (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/issues/731) with some new found energy and finally solved it. The result is this GitHub action: </p>
<p>https://github.com/select/matrix-message-e2e</p>
<p>While it's almost a full success story there is still one issue to solve: While the action successfully sends e2e encrypted messages the job is marked as failed. My guess it that while sending the messages the matrix client outputs on stderr due to some encryption errors (unknown device keys, ...)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Videosprechstunde is quite hot right now, and <strong>the technical requirements in terms of security are already handled with matrix.</strong><br />
It is regulated by the german government and is only working for centralised services right now. So there is no way to get it certified with matrix. It might be possible in future (fingers crossed) and then we (Famedly) are also ready to provide it :)<br />
(Government is slightly wrong, it is more the KBV, but the Government also plans to regulate it starting in two years)</p>

<p>Imagine you could physically step into your favourite FOSS projects’ chatrooms, mailing lists or forums and talk in person to other community members, contributors or committers?  Imagine you could see project leads show off their latest work in front of a packed audience, and then chat and brainstorm with them afterwards (and maybe grab a beer)?  Imagine, as a developer, you could suddenly meet a random subset of your users, to hear and understand their joys and woes in person?</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a>, Europe’s largest Free and Open Source conference, where every year thousands of people (last year, ~8,500) take over the Solbosch campus of the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium for a weekend and turn it into both a cathedral and bazaar for FOSS, with over 800+ talks organised over 50+ tracks, hundreds of exhibitor stands, and the whole campus generally exploding into a physical manifestation of the Internet.  The event is completely non-commercial and volunteer run, and is a truly unique and powerful (if slightly overwhelming!) experience to attend.  Ever since we began Matrix in 2014, FOSDEM has been <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/02/03/matrix-at-fosdem-2020">the</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019">focal</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/02/05/3-d-video-calling-with-matrix-webrtc-and-webvr-at-fosdem-2018">point</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2017/02/06/fosdem-2017-report">of</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2016/02/03/fosdem-16-retrospective">our</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2015/02/04/back-from-fosdem">year</a> as we’ve rushed to demonstrate our latest work and catch up with the wider community and sync with other projects.</p>
<p>This year, things are of course different.  Thankfully FOSDEM 2020 snuck in a few weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic went viral, but for FOSDEM 2021 on Feb 6/7th the conference will inevitably happen online.  When this was announced <a href="https://twitter.com/fosdem/status/1301167254705303554">a few months back</a>, we reached out to FOSDEM to see if we could help: we’d just had a lot of fun helping <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/08/11/hope-2020-delivers-historic-marathon-of-hacking/">HOPE go online</a>, and meanwhile a lot of the work that’s gone into Matrix and Element in 2020 has been around large-scale community collaboration due to COVID - particularly thanks to all the development driven by Element’s <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/element-germany-deal/">German Education</a> work.  Meanwhile, we obviously love FOSDEM and want it to succeed as much as possible online - and we want to attempt to solve the impossible paradox of faithfully capturing the atmosphere and community of an event which is “online communities, but in person!”... but online.</p>
<p>And so, over the last few weeks we’ve been hard at work with the FOSDEM team to figure out how to make this happen, and we wanted to give an update on how things are shaping up (and to hopefully reassure folks that things are on track, and that devrooms don’t need to make their own plans!).</p>
<p>Firstly, FOSDEM will have its own dedicated Matrix server at fosdem.org (hosted by <a href="https://element.io/matrix-services">EMS</a> along with a tonne of Jitsi’s) acting as the social backbone for the event.  Matrix is particularly well suited for this, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’re an <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec">open standard</a> comms protocol with an open network run under a <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">non-profit foundation</a> with loads of <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/">open source implementations</a> (including the reference ones): folks can jump on board and participate via their own servers, clients, bridges, bots etc.</li>
<li>We provide official bridges through to IRC and XMPP (and most other chat systems), giving as much openness and choice as possible - if folks want to participate via Freenode and XMPP they can!</li>
<li>We’re built with large virtual communities in mind (e.g. Mozilla, KDE, Matrix itself) - for instance, we’ve worked a lot on <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation">moderation</a> recently.</li>
<li>We’ve spent a lot of time improving <a href="https://youtu.be/Fk7YRiFIwZ4?t=251">widgets</a> recently: these give the ability to embed arbitrary webapps into chatrooms - letting you add livestreams, video conferences, schedules, Q&amp;A dashboards etc, augmenting a plain old chatroom into a much richer virtual experience that can hopefully capture the semantics and requirements of an event like FOSDEM. </li>
</ul>
<p>We’re currently in the middle of setting up the server with a dedicated <a href="https://element.io">Element</a> as the default client, but what we’re aiming for is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attendees can lurk as read-only guests in devrooms without needing to set up accounts (or they can of course use their existing Matrix/IRC/XMPP accounts)</li>
<li>Every devroom and track will have its own chatroom, where the audience can hang out and view the livestream of that particular devroom (using the normal FOSDEM video livestream system).  There’ll also be a ‘backstage’ room per track for coordination between the devroom organisers and the speakers.</li>
<li>The talks themselves will be prerecorded to minimise risk of disaster, but each talk will have a question &amp; answer session at the end which will be a live Jitsi broadcast from the speaker and a host who will relay questions from the devroom.</li>
<li>Each talk will have a dedicated room too, where after the official talk slot the audience can pop in and chat to the speaker more informally if they’re available (by text and/or by moderated jitsi).  During the talk, this room will act as the ‘stage’ for the speaker &amp; host to watch the livestream and conduct the question &amp; answer session.</li>
<li>Every stand will also have its own chatroom and optional jitsi+livestream, as will BOFs or other adhoc events, so folks can get involved both by chat and video, to get as close to the real event as possible (although it’s unlikely we’ll capture the unique atmospheric conditions of K building, which may or may not be a bug ;)</li>
<li>There’ll also be a set of official support, social etc rooms - and of course folks can always create their own!  Unfortunately folks will have to bring their own beer though :(</li>
<li>All of this will be orchestrated by a Matrix bot (which is rapidly taking shape over at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/conference-bot">https://github.com/matrix-org/conference-bot</a>), responsible for orchestrating the hundreds of required rooms, setting up the right widgets and permissions, setting up bridges to IRC &amp; XMPP, and keeping everything in sync with the official live <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/xml">FOSDEM schedule</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>N.B. This is aspirational, and is all still subject to change</strong>, but that said - so far it’s all coming together pretty well, and hopefully our next update will be opening up the rooms and the server so that folks can get comfortable in advance of the event.</p>
<p>Huge thanks go to the FOSDEM team for trusting us to sort out the social/chat layer of FOSDEM 2021 - we will do everything we can to make it as successful and as inclusive as we possibly can! :)</p>
<h2 id="p-s-we-need-help">P.S. We need help!</h2>
<p>FOSDEM is only a handful of weeks away, and we have our work cut out to bring this all together in time.  There are a few areas where we could really do with some help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folks on XMPP often complain that the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-bifrost">Bifröst</a> Matrix&lt;-&gt;XMPP bridge <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-bifrost/issues/64">doesn’t support MAMs</a> - meaning that if XMPP users lose connection, they lose scrollback.  We’re not going to have time to fix this ourselves in time, so this would be a great time for XMPP folks who grok xmpp.js to come get involved and help to ensure the best possible XMPP experience!  (Similarly on other bifrost shortcomings).</li>
<li>It’d be really nice to be able to render nice schedule widgets for each devroom, and embed the overall schedule in the support rooms etc.  The current HTML schedules at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/day/saturday/">https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/day/saturday/</a> and (say) <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/room/vcollab/">https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/room/vcollab/</a> don’t exactly fit - if someone could write a thing which renders them at (say) 2:5 aspect ratio so they can fit nicely down the side of a chatroom then that could be awesome!</li>
<li>While we’ll bridge all the official rooms over to Freenode, it’d be even nicer if people could just hop straight into <em>any</em> room on the FOSDEM server (or beyond) via IRC - effectively exposing the whole thing as an IRC network for those who prefer IRC.  We have a project to do this: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd">matrix-ircd</a>, but it almost certainly needs more love and polish before it could be used for something as big as this.  If you like Rust and know Matrix, please jump in and get involved! </li>
