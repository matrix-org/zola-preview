<p>Both the recording equipment and the video team volunteers were new this year, so some problems were encountered, which means that our lightning talk video unfortunately was lost. However, our talk in the IoT-devroom is now available:</p>

            <p>Heads up that we released Synapse 0.8.1 a little while back, but we've all been too busy writing software to announce it... you know how it goes. Anyway, here are the changes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Disable registration by default. New users can be added using the included <code>register_new_matrix_user</code> script or by enabling registration in the config.</li>
	<li>Add metrics to synapse. To enable metrics use config options <code>enable_metrics</code> and <code>metrics_port</code>.</li>
	<li>Fix bug where banning only kicked the user.</li>
</ul>
Note that first one in particular: if you set up a new install, you won't be able to register new users using the API by default. This means random people on the Internet can't create accounts on your Home Server unless you actually choose to let them. Also, if you were trying to ban users and noticed that didn't work... yeah, we fixed that.
<p>Okay, back to writing software again!</p>

            <p>It's competition time! Matrix is sponsoring <a href="http://tadhack.com/2015/tadhack-mini-london/" title="TADHack-mini London">TADHack-mini London</a>, which is a two-day hackathon with focus on WebRTC technology, happening on April 11 and 12 at <a href="http://www.idea-london.co.uk/" title="IDEA London">IDEA London</a>. We will award a <a href="http://www.parrot.com/uk/products/bebop-drone/" title="Parrot Bebop Drone">Parrot Bebop Drone</a> (which itself can be hacked via the <a href="https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3/ARSDKBuildUtils" title="ARDroneSDK3">ARDroneSDK3</a>) to the two best hacks using Matrix, and we can't wait to see what kind of ideas people will come up with!
<img src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/parrot.png" alt="Parrot Bebop Drone" width="552" height="244" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-482" />
We strongly encourage anyone to get involved - have a look at our <a href="http://tadhack.com/2015/tadhack-mini-london/" title="Development Resources">Development Resources</a> (scroll down a bit) and have a think of what you can create within the 16-hour timeframe. The reference Matrix web client already supports WebRTC - you can play with this by registering a user via the matrix.org <a href="/beta/" title="web client">web client</a> (or you can check out the reference <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-angular-sdk" title="web client">web client</a> and run it on your own box), inviting a user to a 1-1 chat (click on their avatar and &quot;start chat&quot;) and then clicking the microphone or video camera icon in the top right to start a voice/video call. </p>
<p>We brainstormed some ideas for further WebRTC/Matrix work in our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/IDEAS.md#implementing-webrtc-support-in-mobile-apps" title="GSoC">GSoC</a> (Google Summer of Code) project proposals, for example &quot;Implementing WebRTC support in Mobile apps&quot; and &quot;Multi-way voice and video conferencing&quot;. These are very probably too extensive for the 16-hour hackathon, but might provide some ideas for smaller hacks.</p>
<p>We will be at the event to offer mentoring and help, but you can already start thinking about potential hacks - come talk to us in the <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a> room!</p>

            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>As of today you can install the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/matrix-console/id970074271">basic reference Matrix client</a> on iOS from the App Store.  We've called the app &quot;Matrix Console&quot; to try to make it clear that it's very much a developer/poweruser tool for experimenting with Matrix and showcasing the Matrix APIs and an example of how to use the iOS SDK - whilst it can be used as a great replacement to IRC, it's by no means meant to be a glossy polished app like Hangouts or Slack.</p>
<p>Meanwhile you can also get <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.matrix.androidsdk.alpha">the Android version of Console</a> at the Google Play Store as we mentioned in the last post.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/matrix-console/id970074271"><img src="http://matrix.org/img/screenie.jpg" width="375" height="667" alt="iOS screenshot" class="aligncenter" /></a>
</p>
<p>Needless to say, they're both entirely open-source (Apache license) and you can grab the code from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk</a> respectively if you want to play with your own copy.</p>
<p>The mobile apps currently act very similarly to <a href="http://matrix.org/beta">the reference web app</a> - providing group chat (text/images/video etc) in decentralised public and private rooms, with room history kept in sync across all your different Matrix-enabled apps.  They don't yet do VoIP, although we're working on it.  Please give the apps a go and file all your bugs and feedback into <a href="http://matrix.org/jira">JIRA</a> or <a href="/beta/#/room/#ios:matrix.org">#ios:matrix.org</a> and <a href="/beta/#/room/#android:matrix.org">#android:matrix.org</a> so we can make them even better :)</p>
<p>The iOS app in particular showcases one of the coolest new features in Matrix: the ability for homeservers to support highly configurable push notifications, ensuring you never miss messages on Matrix ever again.  The way this works is that when you install the Matrix Console app from iTunes and log in, the app tells your homeserver to send push notifications to a simple push server on Matrix.org running the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">sygnal</a> codebase (you can also run your own sygnal for your own Matrix apps).  You can then configure some excitingly comprehensive push settings in the settings page of the web client (we haven't exposed the UI to configure these on the mobile apps yet) to configure what events in Matrix should trigger push notifications - and then you will automatically receive the desired pushes even when the app isn't running.</p>
<p>We think this is incredibly powerful: there are no longer <em>any</em> client-side notification settings.  Instead, all your notifications are stored server-side - per-room, per-user, per-word and as many other extensible rules as you desire (plus some helpful common special cases).  This means that the rules that determine whether you see notifications on the desktop from the webclient are <em>identical</em> to the notifications you receive push notifications on your mobile devices.  We hope this is a huge improvement over the inflexible notification rules that iMessage, Hangouts etc push onto you (so to speak).</p>
<p>To support the new push rules we've just released a new version of the web client - 0.6.5.  This implements the new rule configuration UI - see below for example UI.</p>
<img src="http://matrix.org/img/push-settings.jpg" width="988" height="1252" alt="push settings UI" class="aligncenter" />
<p>The full list of changes in matrix-angular-sdk 0.6.5 is as per below.  We hope you enjoy the new clients and push settings - thanks for flying Matrix :)</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>What with the chaos of Mobile World Congress last week we seem to have been hoarding releases - so here's what's been happening!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse 0.8.0</a> was released this afternoon.  This is a major performance/stability release, with lots of good stuff going on - especially adding more customisable push notification support APIs for iOS/Android; support for registering accounts from mobile devices; extensions to the new Application Service API and lots of federation improvements and bug fixes.  <b>Please upgrade at your earliest convenience.</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile, we quietly released the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.matrix.androidsdk.alpha">Matrix Console</a> Android example app to the Google Play last week, alongside <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">v0.2.2 of the Android SDK</a> - release notes below.  There'll be a new version of the Android Console app out tomorrow, but mentioning here for completeness and to share the release notes.  Also, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">iOS SDK is now on v0.3.1</a>, with lots of performance and usability improvements.</p>
<p>Finally, we have a whole new official <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">Matrix client SDK for JavaScript</a>, all packaged up ready for use by Node developers and JS purists alike as an NPM with minimal dependencies.  Meanwhile, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-angular-sdk">matrix-angular-sdk</a> has been switched to use matrix-js-sdk from now on.  You can use the plain JS API with a <code>npm install matrix-js-sdk</code> and then:</p>
<pre>
var sdk = require("matrix-js-sdk");
var client = sdk.createClient("https://matrix.org");
client.publicRooms(function(err, data) {'{'}
    console.log("Public Rooms: %s", JSON.stringify(data));
{'}'});

</pre>
<p>
Meanwhile, release notes for all &amp; sundry lie below.
</p>

Changes in synapse v0.8.0 (2015-03-06)
======================================

General:

* Add support for registration fallback. This is a page hosted on the server
  which allows a user to register for an account, regardless of what client
  they are using (e.g. mobile devices).

* Added new default push rules and made them configurable by clients:

  * Suppress all notice messages.
  * Notify when invited to a new room.
  * Notify for messages that don't match any rule.
  * Notify on incoming call.

Federation:

* Added per host server side rate-limiting of incoming federation requests.
* Added a ``/get_missing_events/`` API to federation to reduce number of
  ``/events/`` requests.

Configuration:

* Added configuration option to disable registration:
  ``disable_registration``.
* Added configuration option to change soft limit of number of open file
  descriptors: ``soft_file_limit``.
* Make ``tls_private_key_path`` optional when running with ``no_tls``.

Application services:

* Application services can now poll on the CS API ``/events`` for their events,
  by providing their application service ``access_token``.
* Added exclusive namespace support to application services API.

            <p><strong>This post has now been edited into a guide - you can find <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/supporting-docs/guides/2015-08-21-application_services.md">the source in github</a>, and the <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/guides/application-services">formatted guide on the matrix.org website</a>!</strong></p>
<hr />
<p> </p>
<p>Hi everyone. I'm Kegan, one of the core developers on Matrix. I'd like to explain a bit more about one of the upcoming features in Matrix: Application Services. This is an entirely new component in the Matrix architecture which gives great power (along with great responsibility!) to the wielder.</p>
<p>Application services are distinct modules which which sit alongside a home server providing arbitrary extensible functionality decoupled from the home server implementation. Just like the rest of Matrix, they communicate via HTTP using JSON. Application services function in a very similar way to traditional clients, but they are given much more power than a normal client. They can reserve entire namespaces of room aliases and user IDs for their own purposes. They can silently monitor events in rooms, or any events directed at any user ID. This power allows application services to have extremely useful abilities which overall enhance the end user experience.</p>
<p>One of the main use cases for application services is for protocol bridges. As you may know, we have an IRC bridge bot on matrix.org which resides as a user on #matrix, #matrix-dev, #openwebrtc and #vuc which bridges into freenode. There is nothing special about this bot; it is just treated as a client. However, this limits the things the bot can do. For example, the bot cannot reserve the virtual user IDs it creates, and cannot lazily bridge arbitrary IRC rooms on-the-fly. By using application services, the IRC bot can do both of these things. This would allow any Matrix user to join a room alias which doesn't exist: say <code>#irc.freenode.python:matrix.org</code>, which would then tell the application service to create a new Matrix room, make the alias for it, join #python on freenode and bridge into it. Any IRC user on #python would then be provisioned as a virtual user e.g. <code>@irc.freenode.alice:matrix.org</code>. This also allows PMs to be sent directly to <code>@irc.freenode.alice:matrix.org</code>, no matter what channel Alice is on.</p>
<p>Application services have enormous potential for creating new and exciting ways to transform and enhance the core Matrix protocol. For example, you could aggregate information from multiple rooms into a summary room, or create throwaway virtual user accounts to proxy messages for a fixed user ID on-the-fly. As you may expect, all of this power assumes a high degree of trust between application services and home servers. Only home server admins can allow an application service to link up with their home server, and the application service is in no way federated to other home servers. You can think of application services as additional logic on the home server itself, without messing around with the book-keeping that home servers have to do. This makes adding useful functionality very easy.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>The application service (AS) API itself uses webhooks to communicate from the home server to the AS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Room Alias Query API : The home server hits a URL on your application server to see if a room alias exists.</li>
<li>User Query API : The home server hits a URL on your application server to see if a user ID exists.</li>
<li>Push API : The home server hits a URL on your application server to notify you of new events for your users and rooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>A very basic application service may want to log all messages in rooms which have an alias starting with &quot;#logged_&quot; (side note: logging won't work if these rooms are using end-to-end encryption).</p>
<p>Here's an example of a very basic application service using Python (with Flask and Requests) which logs room activity:</p>
<pre># app_service.py:

import json, requests  # we will use this later
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/transactions/&lt;transaction&gt;", methods=["PUT"])
def on_receive_events(transaction):
    events = request.get_json()["events"]
    for event in events:
        print "User: %s Room: %s" % (event["user_id"], event["room_id"])
        print "Event Type: %s" % event["type"]
        print "Content: %s" % event["content"]
    return jsonify({'{'}{'}'})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
</pre>
<p>Set your new application service running on port 5000 with:</p>
<pre>python app_service.py
</pre>
<p>The home server needs to know that the application service exists before it will send requests to it. This is done via a registration YAML file which is specified in Synapse's main config file e.g. <code>homeserver.yaml</code>. The server admin needs to add the application service registration configuration file as an entry to this file.</p>
<pre># homeserver.yaml
app_service_config_files:
  - "/path/to/appservice/registration.yaml"
</pre>
<p>NB: Note the &quot;-&quot; at the start; this indicates a list element. The registration file <code>registration.yaml</code> should look like:</p>
<pre># registration.yaml

# this is the base URL of the application service
url: "http://localhost:5000"

# This is the token that the AS should use as its access_token when using the Client-Server API
# This can be anything you want.
as_token: wfghWEGh3wgWHEf3478sHFWE

# This is the token that the HS will use when sending requests to the AS.
# This can be anything you want.
hs_token: ugw8243igya57aaABGFfgeyu

# this is the local part of the desired user ID for this AS (in this case @logging:localhost)
sender_localpart: logging
namespaces:
  users: []
  rooms: []
  aliases:
    - exclusive: false
      regex: "#logged_.*"
</pre>
<p><strong>You will need to restart the home server after editing the config file before it will take effect.</strong></p>
<p>To test everything is working correctly, go ahead and explicitly create a room with the alias &quot;#logged_test:localhost&quot; and send a message into the room: the HS will relay the message to the AS by PUTing to /transactions/&lt;tid&gt; and you should see your AS print the event on the terminal. This will monitor any room which has an alias prefix of &quot;#logged_&quot;, but it won't lazily create room aliases if they don't already exist. This means it will only log messages in the room you created before: #logged_test:localhost. Try joining the room &quot;#logged_test2:localhost&quot; without creating it, and it will fail. Let's fix that and add in lazy room creation:</p>
<pre>@app.route("/rooms/&lt;alias&gt;")
def query_alias(alias):
    alias_localpart = alias.split(":")[0][1:]
    requests.post(
        # NB: "TOKEN" is the as_token referred to in registration.yaml
        "<a href="http://localhost:8008/_matrix/client/api/v1/createRoom?access_token=TOKEN" target="_blank">http://localhost:8008/_matrix/client/api/v1/createRoom?access_token=TOKEN</a>",
        json.dumps({'{'}
            "room_alias_name": alias_localpart
        {'}'}),
        headers={'{'}"Content-Type":"application/json"{'}'}
    )
    return jsonify({'{'}{'}'})
</pre>
<p>This makes the application service lazily create a room with the requested alias whenever the HS queries the AS for the existence of that alias (when users try to join that room), allowing any room with the alias prefix #logged_ to be sent to the AS. Now try joining the room &quot;#logged_test2:localhost&quot; and it will work as you'd expect.  You can see that if this were a real bridge, the AS would have checked for the existence of #logged_test2 in the remote network, and then lazily-created it in Matrix as required.</p>
<p>Application services are powerful components which extend the functionality of home servers, but they are limited. They can only ever function in a &quot;passive&quot; way. For example, you cannot implement an application service which censors swear words in rooms, because there is no way to prevent the event from being sent. Aside from the fact that censoring will not work when using end-to-end encryption, all federated home servers would also need to reject the event in order to stop developing an inconsistent event graph. To &quot;actively&quot; monitor events, another component called a &quot;Policy Server&quot; is required, which is beyond the scope of this post.  Also, Application Services can result in a performance bottleneck, as all events on the homeserver must be ordered and sent to the registered application services.  If you are bridging huge amounts of traffic, you may be better off having your bridge directly talk the Server-Server federation API rather than the simpler Application Service API.</p>
<p>I hope this post demonstrates how easy it is to create an application service, along with a few ideas of the kinds of things you can do with them. Obvious uses include build protocol bridges, search engines, invisible bots, etc. For more information on the AS HTTP API, check out the new <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api">Application Service API</a> section in the spec, or the raw drafts and spec in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/" target="_blank">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/</a>.  The AS API is not yet frozen, so feedback is very welcome!</p>

        <div>
            <p>Last week, we mentioned that we released part of a first implementation of the long awaited <a title="Application Service (AS) API" href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api">Application Service (AS) API</a> as part of the <a title="Synapse 0.7.1 released – with Application Service API" href="http://matrix.org/blog/2015/02/19/synapse-0-7-1-released-with-application-service-api/">0.7.1 release</a>. The AS API makes it dead simple to connect your service into the Matrix ecosystem using an existing standard Matrix server.</p>
<p>And today we're very excited that the first implementation using this API has gone live! <a title="OpenMarket" href="http://openmarket.com">OpenMarket</a> just announced the <a title="OpenMarket Matrix Gateway" href="http://www.openmarket.com/matrix/">OpenMarket Matrix Gateway</a> which lets you chat with non-Matrix users via their phone number: as you send and receive instant messages from your Matrix chat room, they'll receive and send SMSes back to you, which will appear in your Matrix room as IM, extending your reach to any non-Matrix user.</p>
<p>To use the new OpenMarket service just login to the matrix.org <a title="webclient" href="/beta/">webclient</a> and start a chat with your target mobile phone user by identifying him/her with a Matrix ID in the format <em>@+&lt;msisdn&gt;:matrix.openmarket.com</em> (msisdn being the internationally formatted phone number of your contact) - any messages to them will be sent via OpenMarket's SMS service. The SMSes will be sent from dynamically assigned numbers so that the recipient is able to respond to your message(s) - and the user will first receive an &quot;opt-in&quot; message from the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway to invite them to the conversation (just as they would if you invited them to a conversation in Matrix). Note that there are a finite set of these dynamically assigned numbers: OpenMarket reserves the right to recycle contact numbers if they have not been used to send or receive traffic for more than 2 months.</p>
<p>Sending SMS through the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway will be free during the introductory beta testing period, and users will be warned when that changes - although usage is subject to a per-user fair-usage policy. Despite the free service today, you'll have to associate a valid PayPal account to your account in order to send messages for security purposes. OpenMarket will not (and cannot) charge this account without your consent. You can associate your PayPal account via the settings page of any reference Matrix web client which has been configured to be aware of the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway - for example, the matrix.org <a title="webclient" href="/beta/#/settings">webclient</a>.</p>
<p>You'll also have to accept the OpenMarket Matrix API End User License Agreement to use the service.</p>
<p>The OpenMarket Matrix Gateway is a great example of how the Application Service API can be used to extend Matrix, we're really happy to see it live and hope it's going to give our community lots of ideas! There are a lot of services that could mutually benefit from being integrated with Matrix, and the AS API makes this much easier to accomplish!</p>
<p>Thus, we strongly urge you to have a look at the <a title="AS API" href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api">AS API</a> - and as always we are happy to answer any questions at <a title="#matrix:matrix.org" href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a>!</p>

            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Just a quick heads up that we'll be attending <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com">Mobile World Congress</a> (Mar 2-5) this year, chatting to the telco community about how they can benefit from Matrix; encouraging companies to build gateways, servers and clients and generally trying to grow the Matrix ecosystem.  If you're going to be there and are interested in finding out more, please mail us (matrix at matrix.org) to arrange a meeting - we'll be hanging out at the OpenMarket (8.1D113) and the Amdocs (3G10) booths.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
