<ul>
<li>
<p>New website! <a href="https://beeperhq.com">beeperhq.com</a>. Beeper is a Matrix server+client combo preconfigured with 12+ bridges. Our mission is to bring a lot of new users into the Matrix ecosystem and give them a fast and powerful client to message people on all networks. Beeper is a paid subscription service, but since all the bridges are open source, you can set the whole system up yourself for free if you choose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're doing a lot of work to boost bridge reliability. Beeper now comes with bridges to Signal, Whatsapp, FB, Slack, Skype, Telegram, Instagram, Hangouts, Twitter, Discord. iMessage coming within a week or two.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sneak peek below of our upcoming desktop UI</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="looking-for-contract-work">Looking for contract work?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We are offering bounties of $500-2,000 USD to build new open source bridges based on tulir's mautrix-python or mautrix-go libraries. In particular, we would love to commission Linkedin, MS Teams, Google Chat, GroupMe, WeChat, Snapchat (maybe run it in Anbox?), Line and Email (gmail specifically) bridges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are also looking for contract iOS and Android developers familiar with the Element codebase to reskin the app with our new UI. Part-time roles with potential for full time.</p>
</li>

<p>If you're interested, please send me a DM <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@eric:beeperhq.com">@eric:beeperhq.com</a></p>

<h3 id="gsoc-2021">GSOC 2021</h3>
<p>Google Summer of Code has come around again! Last year was really successful for Matrix: six projects, with members of the community coming forward to mentor students for their project. This year there is a slight tweak to the formula: <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/10/google-summer-of-code-2021-is-bringing.html">the projects will now be 175 hours, rather than the traditional 350, over the summer</a>.</p>
<p>Since we need to <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline">submit an application to Google within the next few weeks</a>, I have a request: if you admin a Matrix-related Open Source project and would like to have a student work with you over the summer, get involved!</p>
<p>How to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources">Google's own documentation</a> on the setup. This is fairly thorough, and should get you most of the way there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about a task, that you consider a student should be able to contribute to your project over a 10-week/175-hour period. Try to come up with 2-3 of these.</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be a well-defined feature that genuinely contributes to the progress of your project, but maybe doesn't block other work on the critical path.</li>
<li>This is a very important step, and one that may need some time and discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>DM me (@benpa:bpulse.org) and we'll talk about next steps.</p>
</li>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h4>
<p>We've decided to ditch the focus as it was clear that it wasn't a great indicator of progress. Once one team member has reviewed all of the focus items, they will move on to other MSCs. None of that work is reflected in the focus, and items in there often stick around while waiting on a small number of people to complete work on.</p>
<p>As such, we'd instead like to direct people to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/31">Spec Core Team Backlog board</a>, which is a better representation of the current state of things. And of course the weekly list of MSCs state changes above.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of this week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.6">Dendrite 0.3.6</a>, which included a number of refactors in the sync API and a selection of fixes. It is also the first version to be released with multi-arch Docker images with ARMv7/ARM64 targets.</p>
<p>Since then, the following changes have been merged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sync filtering support for event types, senders as well as better-supported limits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation support for MSC2946 (Spaces Summary)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug where large well-known files could consume a lot of memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for in-process DNS caching for federation traffic (although it is disabled by default)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some preparatory work for tracking the most recent membership states in the sync API for future history visibility work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 60%, up from 58% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for general Dendrite chat or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite-dev:matrix.org">#dendrite-dev:matrix.org</a> for development discussion.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>

<h4 id="synapse-1">Synapse</h4>
<p>üéâ Synapse 1.26.0rc1 is here!</p>
<p>‚ò†Ô∏è But don't install it yet; wait for rc2.</p>
<p>A few issues were reported with rc1 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9187">#9187</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9193">#9193</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9208">#9208</a>), and we'll issue an rc2 early next week once we're confident they've been resolved.</p>
<p>Otherwise, once 1.26.0 is released you can look forward to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/docs/auth_chain_difference_algorithm.md">a new algorithm</a> for calculating auth chain difference in v2 State Resolution which should significantly speed up some of the most expensive state resolution calculations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622">#8622</a>).</p>
<p>We've also dramatically improved the performance of redactions in large rooms, helping Synapse's moderation tools scale to communities of any size (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9022">#9022</a>). And speaking of scaling, Synapse 1.26 makes it possible to offload many different APIs to worker processes, including read receipts and account data persistence.</p>
<p>Lastly, Synapse 1.26 will include support for multiple Single Sign-On Identity providers, though we expect further fit-and-finish for that feature to land in 1.27.</p>
<p>You can preview the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/CHANGES.md">changelog</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1260">upgrade notes</a> now, but remember: wait for rc2! üòâ</p>

<p>The switch to acting as a mobile app I mentioned last week has been merged and it's starting to be clear that it works better. So far logging in has worked fine for everyone at least after enabling 2FA.</p>
<p>Changes this week mostly included tons of bugfixes (thanks to everyone who already updated and found the bugs) and re-adding some old features like read receipt bridging. The SQLite migration script now exists too. Upgrade instructions can be found at https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook/wiki/Upgrading-to-v0.2.0</p>

<p>Today a present you a Matrix client library I've been working for the last few months: <a href="https://github.com/erdnaxeli/caridina">caridina</a>.</p>
<p>It is a <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a> library. Currently for reading it implements the sync API and supports the events to do text messaging (all state events + <code>m.room.message</code>). For writing it provides methods to send messages, edit them, and send receipts and typing notifications.</p>
<p>While I would not recommend this library to write a full featured client, it is enough to write a simple text bot. I currently use it for some of my own projects. The README provides some examples of how to use the library.</p>
<p>Feel free to try it, report bugs, ask for missing features if you need them or even contribute!</p>

<h4 id="opsdroid-1">opsdroid</h4>
<p><a href="https://opsdroid.dev/">opsdroid</a> is an easy to use chat-ops framework with excellent Matrix support.</p>
<h4 id="0-20-release">0.20 Release</h4>
<p>This week opsdroid released version 0.20. This is a <em>massive</em> release that's been a long time coming because of a <strong>complete rewrite of the internals of the matrix connector to use <a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a></strong>---thanks to <a href="https://github.com/awesome-michael">@awesome-michael</a> for the initial work on this.</p>
<p>Having ported the connector to nio, our GSOC student <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tyagdit:matrix.org">@Tyagdit</a> got to work polishing the nio port and reimplementing the <strong>matrix database</strong> module in the core opsdroid library. Opsdroid has a concept of memory which is a key-value store which can be backed my many different kinds of <a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/">databases</a>. The <a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/matrix.html">matrix database</a> stores the opsdroid memory in room state, meaning your bot's database and messages are all stored in the same place.</p>
<p>Finally, the other big feature added to the matrix support in this release is <strong>End to End Encryption</strong> support. Thanks to using matrix-nio as our matrix library it was possible to implement support for encrypted matrix rooms. This also includes support in the matrix database for encrypted memory which works by referencing event ids in room state (<a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/matrix.html#encryption">see here</a> for more info). As this is the first release to support E2EE I would still consider it &quot;beta&quot;; please open issues if you have any trouble using it.</p>
<h4 id="highlights-1">Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>End to End Encryption support in the Matrix connector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matrix database now included in core, with e2ee support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of Python's install &quot;extras&quot; to allow for installations with fewer packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved documentation of the matrix connector and database (at least a little).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for Python 3.9 (and dropped support for 3.6).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Checkout the <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/releases">full release notes</a> for all the gory details.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Version 2.0 of <a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal">matrix-corporal</a> has been released.</p>
<p>It's a huge release bringing many improvements (read all of it in the <a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal/releases/tag/2.0.0">release notes</a>).</p>
<p>Here's a short summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an <strong>Event Hooks system</strong> has been introduced, so matrix-corporal can now also act like a &quot;generic firewall&quot; (similar to what <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxgwd">mxgwd</a> was doing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>device-free login</strong> is now used when impersonating users (thanks to a new API introduced by Synapse v1.24.0) - this is both faster and more resilient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for <strong>Interactive Authentication</strong> (and thus, <strong>End-to-End-Encryption</strong>) has been added. Users can now set up E2EE keys, manage devices, etc. (actions that require Interactive Authentication and were previously broken). Requires cooperation between <code>matrix-corporal</code> and the <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-synapse-rest-password-provider">REST auth password provider module</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>End-to-End-Encryption control</strong>. matrix-corporal can enforce whether rooms that users create are encrypted or unencrypted. You can force-disable or force-enable encryption for locally-created rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fixes user-creation regression</strong> that happened with Synapse v1.24.0. matrix-corporal v1.12.0 is also out, with a backport of this fix (for users who don't want to jump to 2.0 yet).</p>

<p>It's not dead! yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's been some code refactoring on the <a href="https://github.com/anchor-logoot">algorithm</a>. Mainly, the search tree used has been split into a different package</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm working on porting the Notepad to the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api">widget API</a>. Ongoing work is on the <a href="https://github.com/KB1RD/matrix-notepad/tree/nextgen">nextgen branch</a> and is tracked by <a href="https://github.com/KB1RD/matrix-notepad/projects/3">this</a> project. The widget is currently blocked on some stuff in the widget API, so I probably won't be releasing soon. The code in there needs a <em>ton</em> refactoring, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that the old notepad client will disappear on the next release and you'll need to add a widget for the Notepad for any documents that you want to edit. Currently, this means you would have to use Element, but I heard Ditto just might be doing some widget work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The widget API is planned to do everything and more that my &quot;mxapps&quot; project was supposed to do, so that project will be deprecated in favor of using the widget API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's also a little demo/teaser video showing the old notepad talking to the new one. You can see the rate limiting issues that the Notepad hits there, which is on my todo list.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week we released Dendrite 0.3.5, our first release of 2021, which includes a fairly significant refactor of parts of the sync API, along with other fixes. More work has since been merged into <code>master</code> too.</p>
<p>Changes in the last two weeks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sync streams are now logically separate, with a lot of behaviour fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities are now deep-checked properly, which should significantly reduce the peaks of CPU and RAM when handling the current room state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pagination tokens in <code>/messages</code> have been fixed, which should improve the reliability of scrolling back in the timeline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of fixes have been made to the <code>/sync</code> response, largely avoiding <code>null</code>s, which should make some clients happier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send-to-device messaging has been refactored, which should improve E2EE stability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well-known/DNS records for federated servers are now cached rather than performing lots of lookups, speeding up outbound federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Device list requests to remote servers now time out quicker, so as to not block <code>/send</code> transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental support for MSC2946 has been merged (gated behind the <code>mscs</code> configuration)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request context is no longer reused for <code>/send</code>, which should help in cases where the remote sending server gives up waiting or the connection breaks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%</p>

<p>Can you explain something: Dendrite federation is basically working fine, AIUI, what does it mean that <code>Server-server APIs</code> is &lt;100%?</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil</a> helpfully replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are still some edge-case tests that we haven't got passing yet, but I think that's only ~20 tests or so.<br />
There are also a few tests which are quite sensitive to exactly what Synapse does/returns, even though Dendrite is probably doing the right thing but maybe taking a different amount of time to do it or returning something slightly different, so there'll be some tests we need to fix too</p>

<p>A few improvements to the Gitter bridge this week so that when a room updates and the avatar or topic changes, it now propagates across to Matrix automatically. We also handle updating the name whenever we have to rename a room or a group.</p>
<p>We're also thinking about how best to tackle self-service plumbing so you can pipe a Gitter room into your existing Matrix room. And the bigger idea of connecting various bridged portal rooms together. So you can connect your community on Gitter &lt;-&gt; Matrix &lt;-&gt; IRC seamlessly for example. The current thinking is introducing this as a native Matrix concept so you can easily connect any Matrix room to another Matrix room. We'd love to hear your thoughts in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2923">MSC2923</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Version 2 of mx-puppet-groupme is here! This week I did some reverse engineering of the GroupMe Android app with mitmproxy so that I could work out the remaining undocumented features of GroupMe's API. As a result, typing notifications, read receipts, and videos are now working! Though note that due to limitations of the platform, read receipts are a DMs-only feature.</p>
<p>We also now have a Dockerfile (thanks, Trey B.!), double puppeting support was added, the code was ported to Typescript, and it should now work with older versions of Node. So at this point the bridge is basically feature-complete! As usual, send any questions, bugs, or feature requests to <a href="https://gitlab.com/robintown/mx-puppet-groupme">GitLab</a> or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#mx-puppet-groupme:townsendandsmith.ml">Matrix</a>. üíú</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on moving mautrix-facebook to act as a Messenger mobile app instead of the web app in order to hopefully make it more reliable. The initial version is starting to work now.</p>
<p>It's currently in the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook/tree/mobile">mobile</a> branch. I'm not actually sure if it helps with facebook forcing password resets (for some reason they've never done that to my account), but if it does, I'll merge it into master in the near future.</p>
<p>The new version only supports Postgres like my newer bridges, but I'll invent a SQLite migration tool before merging to master.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@carl:kde.org">Carl Schwan</a> told us:</p>

<p>NeoChat 1.0.1 was released with a few important bugfixes. https://carlschwan.eu/2021/01/13/neochat-1.0.1-first-bugfix-release/. On the unstable branch, we continued to improve the integration with Plasma. We now display the unread count in the taskbar and we are getting inline replies too thanks to the work of <a href="https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/knotifications/-/merge_requests/28">Kai Uwe Broulik</a> in Knotifications. Another important change is that rooms can now be opened in a new separate window.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bugfixing for the next release is in progress, fixing various issues and instabilities introduced with the new features, but some smaller features also still made it in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is now a call invite screen more fitting for mobile devices, when you enable the &quot;Touchscreen mode&quot; in the settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various clickable elements now have a ripple effect again to give feedback, when a click was registered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko now handles the Matrix URI scheme. This means opening a link starting with <code>matrix:</code> should open Nheko (at least on Linux) and redirect to the appropriate room and matrix URIs inside of Nheko are also handled. This currently does not support navigating to a specific event, but opening user profiles, starting chats with specific users and opening or joining rooms should work. Nheko also does not automatically linkify links starting with <code>matrix:</code>, so you need to do that manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verification dialogs were cleaned up a bit and hopefully are easier to understand now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flatpak nightlies now support VOIP calls, but as a result are now a few MB more to download.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we are nearing the next release, it would be appreciated, if you could check the <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/">translations for your platform are up to date</a> and try the <a href="https://matrix-static.neko.dev/room/!TshDrgpBNBDmfDeEGN:neko.dev/">current nightlies</a> and check them for bugs your experience and want to have fixed before release.

<p>PingPong measures transport latencies on Matrix networks. It connects to two Matrix accounts simultaneously, and bounces messages back and forth between them. It aggregates all information in an intuitive terminal user interface, and automatically computes statistics. Source code and more information are available at https://github.com/p-e-w/pingpong.</p>
<p>I have been working on this for a while now and I believe it is ready for others to use at this point. No binary releases yet, the program must be built from source. I only have a Linux development system currently, so feedback on whether it works on macOS and especially Windows is very welcome.</p>

<p>Lastly, one of our goals for this year is to maintain a biweekly cadence of release candidates, so we should have a more consistent pace. At the same time, we realize that keeping up with biweekly releases of server-side software can be a bit of a chore, so we're also discussing ways that we could provide longer support for some of our releases. That's a project for much later this year, but consider it a preview of things to come.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@carl:kde.org">Carl Schwan</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NeoChat gained a few new features this week. The timeline displays stickers now, and edited messages don't get duplicated anymore. NeoChat also now lets you edit your messages. Additionally, Noah improved the support for attachments in the UI, more image formats are detected (and can then be edited in the built-in image editor), and mime type icons get added to non-image attachments. Tobias continues to work on the registration flow and SSO support.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://schildi.chat/">SchildiChat</a> is a fork of Element, which focuses on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list for both direct messages and groups, which is a more familiar approach to users of other popular instant messengers.</p>
<p>During the last couple of weeks, SchildiChat-Android development focused mainly on staying up-to-date with the upstream Element codebase (URL previews took some time to make them fit nicely into the bubble layouts), and doing some smaller design improvements (like wider message bubbles for some scenarios, and an intelligent message timestamp placement at the bottom of the bubble, depending on the available space).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we now also have experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2867">MSC2867</a>, which allows you to mark rooms as unread. Note that for now, this feature needs to be enabled in the labs settings, since the MSC is still unstable and not supported by many clients, which means other clients might ignore whether the user has manually marked a chat as unread and thus display it as read anyway.</p>

<h3 id="element-clients">Element Clients</h3>
<p>Some updates below from the team. Not all teams are back from their Christmas breaks yet, and those who are may be a little busy with FOSDEM-specific projects, but we have some updates:</p>
<h4 id="spaces">Spaces</h4>
<p>We‚Äôre making more progress on the client implementations for Spaces on the web on Android. <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/15930">On Web</a>, recent progress includes implementing notification badges, and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/issues/2495">on Android</a> we‚Äôre progressing from SDK work to initial UI implementations.</p>
<h4 id="social-login">Social Login</h4>
<p>Support for <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3846">Social Login on iOS</a> is in review after resolving some issues around VoiceOver, which is the last Element client to implement support ahead of Synapse landing support for social login in the near future.</p>
<h4 id="voip">VoIP</h4>
<p>Lots of things merged to web: dial pad, call forward, dtmf pad, although most won‚Äôt show up in normal use (yet). Other progress on web on hold for fosdem work. Dial pad &amp; phone number lookup support incoming on iOS, and phone number lookup on its way on Android.</p>
<h4 id="ios">iOS</h4>
<p>We progressed on several things this week. They are not yet merged but almost. They will be part of the next release we will ship next week: social login, app deadlock fix, encrypted message sending speed improvement, xcodegen usage, sending bug reports in background.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently started a new freelance project and got them to use Matrix as our main communication channel. Since they chose GitHub as our source code platform I got into writing continuous integrations and delivery scripts. But one thing was missing: notifications in our Matrix room. I looked into the GitHub Action Marketplace and found 2 actions that could do that, so that was nice ... but they could not send e2e encrypted messages. Therefore I took up my old issue on how to make e2e encryption work with the js-sdk (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/issues/731) with some new found energy and finally solved it. The result is this GitHub action: </p>
<p>https://github.com/select/matrix-message-e2e</p>
<p>While it's almost a full success story there is still one issue to solve: While the action successfully sends e2e encrypted messages the job is marked as failed. My guess it that while sending the messages the matrix client outputs on stderr due to some encryption errors (unknown device keys, ...)</p>

<p>Videosprechstunde is quite hot right now, and <strong>the technical requirements in terms of security are already handled with matrix.</strong><br />
It is regulated by the german government and is only working for centralised services right now. So there is no way to get it certified with matrix. It might be possible in future (fingers crossed) and then we (Famedly) are also ready to provide it :)<br />
(Government is slightly wrong, it is more the KBV, but the Government also plans to regulate it starting in two years)</p>

<p>Imagine you could physically step into your favourite FOSS projects‚Äô chatrooms, mailing lists or forums and talk in person to other community members, contributors or committers?  Imagine you could see project leads show off their latest work in front of a packed audience, and then chat and brainstorm with them afterwards (and maybe grab a beer)?  Imagine, as a developer, you could suddenly meet a random subset of your users, to hear and understand their joys and woes in person?</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a>, Europe‚Äôs largest Free and Open Source conference, where every year thousands of people (last year, ~8,500) take over the Solbosch campus of the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium for a weekend and turn it into both a cathedral and bazaar for FOSS, with over 800+ talks organised over 50+ tracks, hundreds of exhibitor stands, and the whole campus generally exploding into a physical manifestation of the Internet.  The event is completely non-commercial and volunteer run, and is a truly unique and powerful (if slightly overwhelming!) experience to attend.  Ever since we began Matrix in 2014, FOSDEM has been <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/02/03/matrix-at-fosdem-2020">the</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019">focal</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/02/05/3-d-video-calling-with-matrix-webrtc-and-webvr-at-fosdem-2018">point</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2017/02/06/fosdem-2017-report">of</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2016/02/03/fosdem-16-retrospective">our</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2015/02/04/back-from-fosdem">year</a> as we‚Äôve rushed to demonstrate our latest work and catch up with the wider community and sync with other projects.</p>
<p>This year, things are of course different.  Thankfully FOSDEM 2020 snuck in a few weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic went viral, but for FOSDEM 2021 on Feb 6/7th the conference will inevitably happen online.  When this was announced <a href="https://twitter.com/fosdem/status/1301167254705303554">a few months back</a>, we reached out to FOSDEM to see if we could help: we‚Äôd just had a lot of fun helping <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/08/11/hope-2020-delivers-historic-marathon-of-hacking/">HOPE go online</a>, and meanwhile a lot of the work that‚Äôs gone into Matrix and Element in 2020 has been around large-scale community collaboration due to COVID - particularly thanks to all the development driven by Element‚Äôs <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/element-germany-deal/">German Education</a> work.  Meanwhile, we obviously love FOSDEM and want it to succeed as much as possible online - and we want to attempt to solve the impossible paradox of faithfully capturing the atmosphere and community of an event which is ‚Äúonline communities, but in person!‚Äù... but online.</p>
<p>And so, over the last few weeks we‚Äôve been hard at work with the FOSDEM team to figure out how to make this happen, and we wanted to give an update on how things are shaping up (and to hopefully reassure folks that things are on track, and that devrooms don‚Äôt need to make their own plans!).</p>
<p>Firstly, FOSDEM will have its own dedicated Matrix server at fosdem.org (hosted by <a href="https://element.io/matrix-services">EMS</a> along with a tonne of Jitsi‚Äôs) acting as the social backbone for the event.  Matrix is particularly well suited for this, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre an <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec">open standard</a> comms protocol with an open network run under a <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">non-profit foundation</a> with loads of <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now/">open source implementations</a> (including the reference ones): folks can jump on board and participate via their own servers, clients, bridges, bots etc.</li>
<li>We provide official bridges through to IRC and XMPP (and most other chat systems), giving as much openness and choice as possible - if folks want to participate via Freenode and XMPP they can!</li>
<li>We‚Äôre built with large virtual communities in mind (e.g. Mozilla, KDE, Matrix itself) - for instance, we‚Äôve worked a lot on <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation">moderation</a> recently.</li>
<li>We‚Äôve spent a lot of time improving <a href="https://youtu.be/Fk7YRiFIwZ4?t=251">widgets</a> recently: these give the ability to embed arbitrary webapps into chatrooms - letting you add livestreams, video conferences, schedules, Q&amp;A dashboards etc, augmenting a plain old chatroom into a much richer virtual experience that can hopefully capture the semantics and requirements of an event like FOSDEM. </li>
</ul>
<p>We‚Äôre currently in the middle of setting up the server with a dedicated <a href="https://element.io">Element</a> as the default client, but what we‚Äôre aiming for is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attendees can lurk as read-only guests in devrooms without needing to set up accounts (or they can of course use their existing Matrix/IRC/XMPP accounts)</li>
<li>Every devroom and track will have its own chatroom, where the audience can hang out and view the livestream of that particular devroom (using the normal FOSDEM video livestream system).  There‚Äôll also be a ‚Äòbackstage‚Äô room per track for coordination between the devroom organisers and the speakers.</li>
<li>The talks themselves will be prerecorded to minimise risk of disaster, but each talk will have a question &amp; answer session at the end which will be a live Jitsi broadcast from the speaker and a host who will relay questions from the devroom.</li>
<li>Each talk will have a dedicated room too, where after the official talk slot the audience can pop in and chat to the speaker more informally if they‚Äôre available (by text and/or by moderated jitsi).  During the talk, this room will act as the ‚Äòstage‚Äô for the speaker &amp; host to watch the livestream and conduct the question &amp; answer session.</li>
<li>Every stand will also have its own chatroom and optional jitsi+livestream, as will BOFs or other adhoc events, so folks can get involved both by chat and video, to get as close to the real event as possible (although it‚Äôs unlikely we‚Äôll capture the unique atmospheric conditions of K building, which may or may not be a bug ;)</li>
<li>There‚Äôll also be a set of official support, social etc rooms - and of course folks can always create their own!  Unfortunately folks will have to bring their own beer though :(</li>
<li>All of this will be orchestrated by a Matrix bot (which is rapidly taking shape over at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/conference-bot">https://github.com/matrix-org/conference-bot</a>), responsible for orchestrating the hundreds of required rooms, setting up the right widgets and permissions, setting up bridges to IRC &amp; XMPP, and keeping everything in sync with the official live <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/xml">FOSDEM schedule</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>N.B. This is aspirational, and is all still subject to change</strong>, but that said - so far it‚Äôs all coming together pretty well, and hopefully our next update will be opening up the rooms and the server so that folks can get comfortable in advance of the event.</p>
<p>Huge thanks go to the FOSDEM team for trusting us to sort out the social/chat layer of FOSDEM 2021 - we will do everything we can to make it as successful and as inclusive as we possibly can! :)</p>
<h2 id="p-s-we-need-help">P.S. We need help!</h2>
<p>FOSDEM is only a handful of weeks away, and we have our work cut out to bring this all together in time.  There are a few areas where we could really do with some help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folks on XMPP often complain that the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-bifrost">Bifr√∂st</a> Matrix&lt;-&gt;XMPP bridge <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-bifrost/issues/64">doesn‚Äôt support MAMs</a> - meaning that if XMPP users lose connection, they lose scrollback.  We‚Äôre not going to have time to fix this ourselves in time, so this would be a great time for XMPP folks who grok xmpp.js to come get involved and help to ensure the best possible XMPP experience!  (Similarly on other bifrost shortcomings).</li>
<li>It‚Äôd be really nice to be able to render nice schedule widgets for each devroom, and embed the overall schedule in the support rooms etc.  The current HTML schedules at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/day/saturday/">https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/day/saturday/</a> and (say) <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/room/vcollab/">https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/room/vcollab/</a> don‚Äôt exactly fit - if someone could write a thing which renders them at (say) 2:5 aspect ratio so they can fit nicely down the side of a chatroom then that could be awesome!</li>
<li>While we‚Äôll bridge all the official rooms over to Freenode, it‚Äôd be even nicer if people could just hop straight into <em>any</em> room on the FOSDEM server (or beyond) via IRC - effectively exposing the whole thing as an IRC network for those who prefer IRC.  We have a project to do this: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd">matrix-ircd</a>, but it almost certainly needs more love and polish before it could be used for something as big as this.  If you like Rust and know Matrix, please jump in and get involved! </li>
<li>If you just want to follow along or help out, then we‚Äôve created a general room for discussion over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fosdem-matrix:fosdem.org">#fosdem-matrix:fosdem.org</a>.  It‚Äôd be awesome to have as many useful bots &amp; widgets as possible to help things along.</li>

<p>If you didn't read it already, I encourage you to read <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a>'s <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-special-2020">Matrix Holiday Special 2020</a> post. So much has happened this year! </p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@oleg:fiksel.info">Oleg</a> responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great summary! Very inspiring!</p>
<p>I have a feeling experiencing a revolution in how people perceive messaging. Now, public sector and multiple communities adopting Matrix, one cannot think of a world without Matrix any more.</p>
<p>Kudos to the Element team and to the wonderful Matrix community! ‚ô•Ô∏è</p>
<p>I'm very excited for the FOSDEM on Matrix!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andycuccaro:matrix.org">Andy</a> added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What a wonderful year has been for matrix, and it looks like next year will be equally as exciting. I'm HYPED.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I'm hyped too. Simple statements like &quot;loads of different universities have rolled out Matrix for collaboration&quot; don't quite capture how much work is going on, and how much excitement there is to get the growth in the network we're soon to see. </p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">Ansible playbook</a> is meant to easily let you run your own Matrix homeserver.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> now defaults to using the Postgres database engine for all bridges, bots and related services (ma1sd, Dimension, etc).</p>
<p>Previously we were only using Postgres for Synapse and couldn't reuse the same database server for other services.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/pull/740">this huge pull request</a>, we've added Postgres support to 17 other services.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jdreichmann">Johanna Dorothea Reichmann</a> for starting the work on it and for providing great input!</p>
<p>Existing installations will get automatically migrated from SQLite/nedb to Postgres the next time you run the playbook.</p>
<p>Not only does this bring better performance and compatibility, but also, being able to reuse the same Postgres database for services other than Synapse paves the way for us to introduce other Postgres-only services such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-signal">mautrix-signal</a> bridge (existing <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/pull/686">pull request</a>), etc.</p>

<h3 id="middleman">Middleman</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:elokapina.fi">kapina-jaywink</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Common accounts for support are tricky to handle due to needing the people using those accounts to keep separate clients open to use the common account. For this at Elokapina we created <em>Middleman</em>, which acts as a proxy between an account and a room.</p>
<p>It's a bit basic but works pretty well for pure text messages. Any messages in rooms where the bot is are relayed to the management room and any replies to those messages (prefixed with <code>!reply</code>) in the management room are relayed back. Optionally senders can be anonymised to enable a feedback bot.</p>
<p>Coming up is more configuration on for example ignoring non-mentions in rooms with lots of members and hopefully support for images and reactions in the not too long future.</p>
<p>Find it here: https://github.com/elokapina/middleman (built with nio-template).</p>

<p>Threema published the source code for their apps this week: https://threema.ch/en/open-source</p>
<p>While that is not strictly Matrix related, it is great to see other E2EE enabled chat systems publishing the source code for their clients. It's the only way to verify their encryption actually works and is secure.</p>
<p>This move was announced a while ago, but I think that it actually happened now deserves a small shoutout! üéâ</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Over the years it‚Äôs become a tradition to write an end-of-year wrap-up on Christmas Eve, reviewing all the things the core Matrix team has been up over the year, and looking forwards to the next (e.g. here‚Äôs <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/12/24/the-2019-matrix-holiday-update">last year‚Äôs edition</a>).  These days there‚Äôs so much going on in Matrix it‚Äôs impossible to cover it all (and besides, we now have <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix">This Week In Matrix</a> and better blogging in general to cover events as they happen).  So here‚Äôs a quick overview of the highlights:</p>
<p>Looking back at our <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/12/24/the-2019-matrix-holiday-update#2020">plans for 2020</a> in last year‚Äôs wrap-up, amazingly it seems we pretty much achieved what we set out to do.  Going through the bulletpoints in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/05/06/cross-signing-and-end-to-end-encryption-by-default-is-here">turned on End-to-end Encryption by default</a>.</li>
<li>We have a dedicated team making major improvements to First-Time User Experience in Element (as of the last few months; hopefully you‚Äôve been noticing the improvements!)</li>
<li><a href="https://element.io/blog/welcome-to-element/">RiotX became Element Android and shipped</a>.</li>
<li>Communities have been completely reinvented as <a href="https://youtu.be/_Ade0FZfnWo?t=39">Spaces</a> (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/commits/matthew/msc1772/proposals/1772-groups-as-rooms.md">MSC1772</a>) and while in alpha currently, they should ship in Jan.</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/03/how-we-fixed-synapses-scalability">Synapse scalability is fixed</a>: we now shard horizontally by event - and Synapse is now pretty much <a href="https://patrick.cloke.us/areweasyncyet/">entirely async/await</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta/">Dendrite Beta shipped</a>, as did the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix/">initial P2P Matrix experiments</a>, which have subsequently continued to evolve significantly (although we haven‚Äôt implemented <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/proposal/remove_mxids_from_events/proposals/1228-removing-mxids-from-events.md">MSC1228</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/neilalexander/identities/proposals/2787-portable-identities.md">MSC2787</a> portable accounts yet). Check out the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/15/dendrite-2020-progress-update">Dendrite end-of-year update</a> for more.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/_Ade0FZfnWo?t=939">MLS experiments are in full swing</a> - we got the first MLS messages passing over Matrix a few days ago, and Decentralised MLS work is back on the menu after an initial sprint in May.</li>
<li>There‚Äôs been a valiant mission to improve Bridge UX in the form of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2346">MSC2346</a> and its implementations in Element Web, although this has ended up failing to get to the top of the todo list (sorry Half-Shot! :/)</li>
<li>Spec progress has improved somewhat, and we are very excited to have welcomed Will Bamberg (formerly MDN) to support the spec from a professional tech writer perspective, with <a href="https://friendly-yonath-3de225.netlify.app/">the all-new engine</a> landing any day now! We‚Äôre still experimenting with ways to ensure the spec gets enough time allocated to keep up with the backlog, however - particularly community contributions.</li>
<li>...and in terms of Abuse/Reputation - we properly <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">kicked off our anti-abuse work</a> and launched a first PoC implementation in the depths of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/18/introducing-cerulean#whats-with-the-decentralised-reputation-button">Cerulean</a> last week.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps more interesting is the stuff we didn‚Äôt predict (or at least didn‚Äôt want to pre-announce ;) for 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li>Riot, Modular and New Vector got unified at last behind a single name: <a href="https://element.io/blog/welcome-to-element/">Element</a>; hopefully the shock has worn off by now :)</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/03/03/moznet-irc-is-dead-long-live-mozilla-matrix">Mozilla joined Matrix</a> in force, turning off Moznet IRC in favour of going full Matrix.</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/30/welcoming-gitter-to-matrix">We welcomed Gitter</a> into the heart of the Matrix ecosystem (with <a href="https://element.io/blog/gitter-is-joining-element/">Element acquiring Gitter</a> from <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/09/30/gitter-moves-to-element/">Gitlab</a> in order to ensure Gitter‚Äôs Matrix integration acts as a reference for integrating future chat silos into Matrix) - with <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix">native Matrix support in Gitter</a> going live shortly afterwards.</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/05/21/welcoming-automattic-to-matrix">Automattic</a> launched itself into the Matrix ecosystem with an investment in Element, and since then we‚Äôve been working on getting Matrix better integrated and available to them (although all of Element‚Äôs Matrix-for-governments activity has ended up delaying this a bit).  If you want to work for Automattic on integrating Matrix, <a href="https://automattic.com/work-with-us/matrix-integrations-engineer/">they‚Äôre hiring</a>!</li>
<li>We previewed <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/18/introducing-cerulean">Cerulean</a> as a super-exciting proof-of-concept client, demonstrating how social media could work on Matrix, with native threading, profiles-as-rooms, decentralised reputation, and (shortly) peeking-over-federation.</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/17/matrix-to-reloaded">We completely rewrote matrix.to</a> and relaunched it as a much more capable and friendly permalink redirection service; a precursor to finally getting matrix:// URLs everywhere!</li>
<li>We certainly didn‚Äôt predict that the ‚Äú<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/06/running-your-own-secure-communication-service-with-matrix-and-jitsi">how to install Synapse</a>‚Äù video tutorial published at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic would end up with 25.5K views (and counting‚Ä¶)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, there‚Äôs whole new waves of exciting stuff going on.  The most obvious has to be the amount of Government uptake we‚Äôve seen with Matrix this year, following on from <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/document/french-government-launches-house-developed-messaging-service-tchap">France embracing Matrix</a> across the public sector last year.  Firstly the German armed forces announced their <a href="https://www.bwi.de/news-blog/news/artikel/open-source-matrix-ist-einheitlicher-messenger-standard-fuer-die-bundeswehr">transition to Matrix</a>, and then the German states of Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg announced a <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/element-germany-deal/">mammoth 500K user Matrix deployment</a> for education and public administration.  Meanwhile, North Rhine Westphalia (the biggest state in Germany) launched their own Matrix-powered <a href="https://www.logineo.schulministerium.nrw.de/LOGINEO-NRW/NEU-LOGINEO-NRW-Messenger/Messenger.html">messager for education</a>; loads of different universities have rolled out Matrix for collaboration  - and we hear <a href="https://famedly.com">Famedly</a> is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.de/gruenderszene/health/famedly-kommunikation-app-gesundheitswesen/">making good progress</a> with Matrix-powered healthcare messaging solutions.  Finally, outside of Germany, we‚Äôre seeing the first official deployments in the UK government and US federal government - we‚Äôll share details where possible (but sometimes big deployments of encrypted communication systems want to remain discreet).  It‚Äôs incredibly exciting to see Matrix spreading across the public sector and education, and we‚Äôre hoping this will follow a similar pattern to how the Internet, email or indeed the Web first developed: a mix of high profile public sector deployments, complemented by a passionate grass-roots technical community, eventually spreading to span the rest of society :).</p>
<p>Another exciting thing which emerged this year is the amazing academic work that Karlsruhe Institute of Technology‚Äôs <a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/english/">Decentralized Systems and Network Services Research Group</a> has been conducting on Matrix.  This really came on the radar back in June when their <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/16/matrix-decomposition-an-independent-academic-analysis-of-matrix-state-resolution">Matrix Decomposition: Analysis of an Access Control Approach on Transaction-based DAGs without Finality</a> paper was published - a truly fascinating analysis of how state resolution works in Matrix, and how we manage to preserve access control within rooms without using blockchain-style ‚Äòsealed blocks‚Äô (and has helped fix a few nasty bugs!).  I‚Äôm not sure any of us realised that Matrix‚Äôs state resolution counts as a new field of research, but it‚Äôs been great to follow along with their independent work.  Most recently, and even more excitingly, they‚Äôre circulating a preview of their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06488">Analysis of the Matrix Event Graph Replicated Data Type</a> paper - a deep analysis of the properties of Matrix DAGs themselves.  We highly recommend reading the papers (what better way to spend the holiday break!).  To give a taste, the final paragraph of the paper concludes:</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06488"><img src="https://matrix.org/blog/img/2020-12-25-meg-summary.png" alt="MEG summary" /></a></p>
<p>2020 has also seen the arrival and maturation of a whole new generation of Matrix clients - <a href="https://hydrogen.element.io">Hydrogen</a> is <em>really</em> impressive as an experimental next-generation Web (and Mobile Web) client; an account with 3000 rooms that uses 1.4GB of RAM on Element Web uses 14MB of RAM on Hydrogen and launches instantly, complete with excellent E2EE implementation.  It even works on MSIE!  The whole app, including dependencies, is about 70KB of code (200KB including Olm).  Meanwhile, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk">matrix-rust-sdk</a> is coming along well, providing a general purpose native library for writing excellent native Matrix clients.  Fractal merged initial matrix-rust-sdk a few weeks ago, and we‚Äôll be experimenting with switching to it in Element iOS and Element Android (for its e2ee) in the coming year.  It‚Äôs not inconceivable to think of a world where matrix-rust-sdk ends up being the no-brainer official SDK for native apps, and Hydrogen‚Äôs SDK becomes the no-brainer official SDK for JS apps.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the community, there‚Äôs been so much activity it‚Äôs untrue.  But on the subject of maturing apps, it‚Äôs been incredibly exciting to see <a href="https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat">NeoChat</a> emerge as an official KDE Matrix client (built on <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient">libQuotient</a> and <a href="https://develop.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami">Kirigami</a>, forked from <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a>), <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/fluffychat">FluffyChat</a> going from strength to strength; <a href="https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> continuing to mature impressively; <a href="https://github.com/mirukana/mirage">Mirage</a> appearing out of nowhere as a fully featured desktop client; <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal">Fractal</a> merging matrix-rust-sdk etc.  On the serverside, <a href="http://conduit.rs/">Conduit</a> was the big community story of the year - with an incredibly fast Rust + Sled server appearing out of the blue, with viable federation coming up on the horizon.  The best bet for an overview of all things community is to checkout the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix">TWIM backlogs</a> however - there‚Äôs simply way too much stuff to mention it all here.</p>
<p>Obviously, no 2020 wrap-up post would be complete without acknowledging the COVID-19 pandemic - which increased focus on Matrix and other remote collaboration technology more than anyone could have predicted (especially given all the privacy missteps from Zoom, Teams and others).  One of the highlights of the year was seeing the HOPE (Hackers On Planet Earth) conference shift <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/08/11/hope-2020-delivers-historic-marathon-of-hacking/">their entire proceedings over to Matrix</a> - turning the conference into a 10 day television station of premium hacking content, with Matrix successfully providing the social glue to preserve a sense of community despite going virtual.  Similarly, we‚Äôre incredibly excited that FOSDEM 2021 is highly likely to run primarily via Matrix (with bridges to IRC and XMPP, of course) - our work is going to be cut out for us in January to ensure the amazing atmosphere of FOSDEM is preserved online for the &gt;8,500 participants and ~800 talks.  And if any other event organisers are reading this - please do reach out if you‚Äôre interested in going online via Matrix: we want Matrix to be the best possible ecosystem for online communities, including virtual events, and we‚Äôll be happy to help :)</p>
<p>Talking of FOSDEM, a really fun bit of work which landed in Element this year was to (finally!) polish Widgets: the ability to embed arbitrary webapps into Matrix chatrooms.  This includes being able to embed widgets in the RightPanel on Element Web, the LeftPanel too, add as many as you like to a room, resize them(!), and generally build much more sophisticated dashboards of additional content.  Modal and fullscreen widgets are coming too, as are ways to simplify and unify access control.  It turns out that these have arrived in the nick of time for events like FOSDEM, where we‚Äôre expecting to very heavily use widgets to embed video streams, video conferences, schedules, and generally automate the workflow of the conference via adding in web UIs as widgets wherever necessary.  The work for this has been driven by the various German education deployments, where the same tricks are invaluable for automating online learning experiences.  We originally wrote Widgets back in 2017 as a proof-of-concept to try to illustrate how chatrooms could be used to host proper custom UIs, and it's fantastic to see that dream finally come of age.</p>
<p>Finally, it‚Äôs been really exciting to see major progress in recent months on what‚Äôs essentially a whole new evolution of Matrix.  Two years ago, a quiet patch during the Christmas holidays gave birth to a whole bunch of wild science fiction Matrix Spec Changes: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a>: Spaces (groups as rooms), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1769">MSC1769</a>: Profiles as rooms, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>: Extensible events, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1776">MSC1776</a>: Peeking over /sync, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1777">MSC1777</a>: Peeking over federation, etc.  This was in part trying to ensure that we had something to look forward to when we emerged from the tunnel of launching Matrix 1.0, and in part trying to draw a coherent high-level sketch of what the next big wave of Matrix features could look like.  Inevitably the MSCs got stuck in limbo for ages while we exited beta, launched Matrix 1.0, turned on E2EE by default etc - but in the latter half of this year they‚Äôve hit the top of the todo list and it‚Äôs been incredibly exciting to see entirely new features landing once again.  Implementation for Spaces is in in full swing and <a href="https://youtu.be/_Ade0FZfnWo?t=39">looking great</a>; Profiles-as-rooms are effectively being trialled in Cerulean; Peeking over /sync has landed in Dendrite and peeking over federation is in PR (and unlocks all sorts of desirable features for using rooms more generically than we have today, including Spaces).  Only Extensible events remains in limbo for now (we have enough to handle getting the others landed!)</p>
<p>Of these, Spaces has turned out to be exciting in wholly unexpected ways.  While prototyping the UX for how best to navigate hierarchies of spaces, we had a genuine epiphany: the ability for anyone to define and share arbitrary hierarchies of rooms makes Matrix effectively a global decentralised hierarchical file system (where the ‚Äòfiles‚Äô are streams of realtime data, but can obviously store static content too).  The decentralised access controls that KIT DSN <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/16/matrix-decomposition-an-independent-academic-analysis-of-matrix-state-resolution">wrote about</a> could <em>literally</em> be file-system style access controls; enforcing access on a global decentralised hierarchy.  We obviously have shared hierarchical filesystems today thanks to Dropbox and Google Drive, but these of course are centralised and effectively only store files - whereas Spaces could potentially scale to the whole web.  In fact, you could even think of Spaces as flipping Matrix entirely on its head: the most defining building block going forwards could be the Spaces themselves rather than the rooms and events - just as directories are intrinsic to how you navigate a conventional filesystem.  How has Matrix got this far without the concept of folders/directories?!</p>
<p>Right now these thoughts are just overexcited science fiction, but the potential really is mindblowing.  It could give us a global read/write web for organising any arbitrary realtime data - with the social controls via ACLs to delegate and crowdsource curation of hierarchies however folks choose.  The Matrix.org Foundation could seed a ‚Äòroot‚Äô hierarchy, go curate all the rooms we know about into some Linnean-style taxonomy, delegate curation of the various subspaces to moderators from the community, and hey presto we‚Äôve reinvented USENET‚Ä¶ but with modern semantics, and without the rigid governance models.  Hell, we could just mount (i.e. bridge) USENET straight into it.  And any other hierarchical namespace of conversations you can think of - Google Groups, Stackoverflow, Discourse, IMAP trees‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Of course, the initial Spaces implementation is going to be focused of on letting communities publish their existing rooms, and users organise their own rooms, rather than managing an infinite ever-expanding global space hierarchy - but given we‚Äôve been designing Spaces to support government (and inter-government) scales of Spaces, it‚Äôs not inconceivable to think we could use it to navigate gigantic public shared Spaces in the longer term.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough Space scifi - what‚Äôs coming up in 2021?</p>
<h2 id="2021">2021</h2>
<p>Our current hit list is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spaces</strong> - see above :)</li>
<li><strong>Social Login</strong> - we‚Äôre going to be making Single Sign On (SSO) a proper first-class citizen in Matrix (and Synapse and Element) in the coming weeks, and enabling it on the matrix.org homeserver, so users can do single-click logins via Github/Gitlab/Google and other SSO providers.  Obviously this means your Matrix identity will be beholden to your identity provider (IdP), but this may well be preferable for many users who just want a single-click way to enter Matrix and don‚Äôt care about being tied to a given IdP.</li>
<li><strong>VoIP</strong> - we have a <em>lot</em> of work in flight at the moment to make 1:1 VoIP super robust.  Some of it has already landed in Element, but the rest will land in the coming weeks - and then we‚Äôre hoping to revisit Matrix-native group voice/video.</li>
<li><strong>Voice messaging</strong> - we‚Äôre hoping to finally add voice messaging to Element (and Matrix)</li>
<li><strong>Location sharing</strong> - ...and this too.</li>
<li>**P2P **- Lots of P2P work on the horizon, now Dendrite is increasingly stable.  First of all we need to iterate more on Pinecone, our pre-alpha next-generation P2P overlay network - and then sort out account portability, and privacy-preserving store-and-forward.  We‚Äôre hoping to see the live P2P Matrix network turn on this year, however, and ideally see homeservers (probably Dendrite) multihoming by default on both today‚Äôs Matrix as well as the P2P network, acting as gateways between the two.</li>
<li><strong>Threads</strong> - Cerulean is excellent proof for how threading could work in Matrix; we just need to get it implemented in Element!</li>
<li><strong>Peeking</strong> - Peeking is going to become so much more important for participating in non-chat rooms, such as Spaces, Profiles, Reputation feeds, etc.  We‚Äôll finish it in Dendrite, and then implement it in Synapse too.</li>
<li>**Decentralised Reputation **- Cerulean has the first implementation of decentralised reputation for experimentation purposes, and we‚Äôll be working solidly on it over the coming year to empower users to counter abuse by applying their own subjective reputation feeds to their content.</li>
<li>**Incremental Signup **- Once upon a time, Element (Riot) had the ability to gradually sign-up without the user even really realising they‚Äôd signed up.  We want to bring it back - perhaps this will be the year?</li>
<li><strong>DMLS</strong> - with the first <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls">MLS</a> messages flowing over Matrix, we want to at least provide MLS as an option alongside Megolm for encryption.  It should be radically more performant in larger rooms (logarithmic rather than linear complexity), but lacks deniability (the assurance that you cannot prove a user said something in retrospect, in order to blackmail them or similar), and is still unproven technology.  We‚Äôll aim to prove it in 2021.</li>
<li><strong>E2EE improvements</strong> - We improved E2EE immeasurably in 2020; turning it on by default, adding cross-signing, QR code verification etc.  But usability and reliability can still be improved.  We‚Äôll be looking at further simplifying the UX, and potentially combining together your login password and recovery/security passphrase so you only have one password to remember going forwards.</li>
<li><strong>Hydrogen</strong> - We‚Äôll keep polishing Hydrogen, bringing it towards feature parity with Element, ensure its SDK is available for other clients, and start seeing how we can use it in Element itself.  For instance, the Spaces-aware RoomList in Element may well end up stealing alien technology from Hydrogen.</li>
<li><strong>matrix-rust-sdk</strong> - Similarly, we‚Äôll keep polishing matrix-rust-sdk; stealing inspiration from Hydrogen‚Äôs state model, and start migrating bits of the native mobile Element apps to use it.</li>
<li><strong>The Spec</strong> - get Will‚Äôs new spec website live, and get improving all the surrounding material too.</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing lots here, but these are the ones which pop immediately to mind.  You can also check <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/projects/1">Element's public roadmap</a>, which covers all the core Matrix work donated by Element (as well as everything else Element is getting up to).</p>
<p>As always, huge huge thanks goes to the whole Matrix community for flying Matrix and keeping the dream alive and growing faster than ever.  It‚Äôs been a rough year, and we hope that you‚Äôve survived it intact (and you have our sincere sympathies if you haven‚Äôt).  Let‚Äôs hope that 2021 will be a massive improvement, and that the whole Matrix ecosystem will continue to prosper in the new year.</p>
<p>-- Matthew, Amandine, and the whole Matrix team.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We have a bit of an unexpected early Christmas present for you today‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Alongside all the normal business-as-usual Matrix stuff, we‚Äôve found some time to do a mad science experiment over the last few weeks - to test the question: ‚ÄúIs it possible to build a serious Twitter-style decentralised microblogging app using Matrix?‚Äù</p>
<p>It turns out the answer is a firm ‚Äúyes‚Äù - and as a result we‚Äôd like to present a <strong>very</strong> early sneak preview of <a href="https://cerulean.matrix.org">Cerulean</a>: a highly experimental new microblogging app for Matrix, complete with first-class support for arbitrarily nested threading, with both Twitter-style (‚Äúvertical‚Äù) and HN/Reddit-style (‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù) layout‚Ä¶ and mobile web support!</p>
<p><a href="https://cerulean.matrix.org/@kegan:dendrite.matrix.org/!bHe21S4P3axekSRD:dendrite.matrix.org/$0QE6vqMZiS9169Y-3C84dkQui-1G5uG2eGFsYzPrhx8"><img src="https://matrix.org/blog/img/2020-12-18-cerulean-screenshot.jpg" alt="Cerulean screenie" /></a></p>
<p>Cerulean is unusual in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs (currently) <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/cerulean">a very minimal javascript app</a> - only 2,500 lines of code.</li>
<li>It has zero dependencies (other than React).
<ul>
<li>This is to show just how simple a fairly sophisticated Matrix client can be...</li>
<li>...and so the code can be easily understood by folks unfamiliar with Matrix...</li>
<li>...and so we can iterate fast while figuring out threading...</li>
<li>...and because none of the SDKs support threading yet :D</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It relies on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2836">MSC2836: Threading</a> - our highly experimental Matrix Spec Change to extend relationships (as used by reaction &amp; edit aggregations) to support free-form arbitrary depth threading.</li>
<li>As such, <strong>it only works on Dendrite</strong>, as that‚Äôs where we‚Äôve been experimenting with implementing MSC2836.  (We‚Äôre now running an <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/15/dendrite-2020-progress-update">official public Dendrite server instance</a> at dendrite.matrix.org though, which makes it easy to test - and our test Cerulean instance <a href="https://cerulean.matrix.org">https://cerulean.matrix.org</a> points at it by default).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is **very much a proof of concept.  **We‚Äôre releasing it today as a sneak preview so that intrepid Matrix experimenters can play with it, and to open up the project for contributions! (PRs welcome - it should be dead easy to hack on!).  Also, we give no guarantees about data durability: both Cerulean and dendrite.matrix.org are highly experimental; do not trust them yet with important data; we reserve the right to delete it all while we iterate on the design.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-it-do">What can it do?</h3>
<p>So for the first cut, we‚Äôve implemented the minimal features to make this something you can just about use and play with for real :)</p>
<ul>
<li>Home view (showing recent posts from folks you follow)</li>
<li>Timeline view (showing the recent posts or replies from a given user)</li>
<li>Thread view (showing a post and its replies as a thread)</li>
<li>Live updating (It‚Äôs Matrix, after all! We‚Äôve disabled it for guests though.)</li>
<li>Posting plain text and images</li>
<li>Fully decentralised thanks to Matrix (assuming you‚Äôre on Dendrite)</li>
<li>Twitter-style ‚ÄúVertical‚Äù threading (replies form a column; you indent when someone forks the conversation)</li>
<li>HN/Reddit/Email-style ‚ÄúHorizontal‚Äù threading (each reply is indented; forks have the same indentation)</li>
<li>Basic Registration &amp; Login</li>
<li>Guest support (slightly faked with non-guest users, as Dendrite‚Äôs guest support isn‚Äôt finished yet)</li>
<li>Super-experimental proof-of-concept support for <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">decentralised reputation filtering</a>(!) </li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, there‚Äôs a huge amount of stuff needed for parity with a proper Twitter-style system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configurable follows.  Currently the act of viewing someone‚Äôs timeline automatically follows them.  This is because Dendrite doesn‚Äôt peek over federation yet (but <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/1391">it‚Äôs close</a>), so you have to join a room to view its contents - and the act of viewing someone‚Äôs timeline room is how you follow them in Cerulean. </li>
<li>Likes (i.e. plain old Matrix reactions, although we might need to finally sort out federating them as aggregations rather than individually, if people use them like they use them on Twitter!)</li>
<li>Retweets (dead easy)</li>
<li>Pagination / infinite scrolling (just need to hook it up)</li>
<li>Protect your posts (dead easy; you just switch your timeline room to invite-only!)</li>
<li>Show (some) replies to messages in the Home view</li>
<li>Show parent and sibling context as well as child context in the Thread view</li>
<li>Mentions (we need to decide how to notify folks when they‚Äôre mentioned - perhaps Matrix‚Äôs push notifications should be extended to let you subscribe to keywords for public rooms you‚Äôre not actually in?)</li>
<li>Notifications (although this is just because Dendrite doesn‚Äôt do notifs yet)</li>
<li>Search (again, just needs to be implemented in Dendrite - although how do you search beyond the data in your current homeserver? Folks are used to global search)</li>
<li>Hashtags (it‚Äôs just search, basically)</li>
<li>Symlinks (see below)</li>
<li>Figure out how to handle lost unthreaded messages (see below)</li>
<li>Offline support? (if we were using a proper Matrix SDK, we‚Äôd hopefully get this for free, but currently Cerulean doesn‚Äôt store any state locally at all).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>
<p>Every message you send using Cerulean goes into two Matrix rooms, dubbed the &quot;timeline&quot; room and the &quot;thread&quot; room. The &quot;timeline&quot; room (with an alias of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#@matthew:dendrite.matrix.org">#@matthew:dendrite.matrix.org</a> or whatever your matrix id is) is a room with all of your posts and no one else's. The &quot;thread&quot; room is a normal Matrix room which represents the message thread itself. Creating a new &quot;Post&quot; will create a new &quot;thread&quot; room. Replying to a post will join the existing &quot;thread&quot; room and send a message into that room. MSC2836 is used to handle threading of messages in the &quot;thread‚Äù room - the replies refer to their parent via an m.relationship field in the event.</p>
<p>These semantics play nicely with existing Matrix clients, who will see one room per thread and a flattened chronological view of the thread itself (unless the client natively supports MSC2836, but none do yet apart from Cerulean). However, as Cerulean only navigates threaded messages with an m.reference relationship (eg it only ever uses the new /event_relationships API rather than /messages to pull in history), <strong>normal messages sent by Matrix into a thread or timeline room will not yet show up in Cerulean.</strong></p>
<p>In this initial version, Cerulean literally posts the message twice into both rooms - but we‚Äôre also experimenting with the idea of adding ‚Äúsymlinks‚Äù to Matrix, letting the canonical version of the event be in the timeline room, and then the instance of the event in the thread room be a ‚Äòsymlink‚Äô to the one in the timeline.  This means that the threading metadata could be structured in the thread room, and let the user do things like turn their timeline private (or vice versa) without impacting the threading metadata.  We could also add an API to both post to timeline and symlink into a thread in one fell swoop, rather than manually sending two events.  It‚Äôd look something like this:</p>

<p>We also experimented with cross-room threading (letting Bob‚Äôs timeline messages directly respond to Alice‚Äôs timeline messages and vice versa), but it posed some nasty problems - for instance, to find out what cross-room replies a message has, you‚Äôd need to store forward references somehow which the replier would need permission to create.  Also, if you didn‚Äôt have access to view the remote room, the thread would break. So we‚Äôve punted cross-room threading to a later MSC for now.</p>
<p>Needless to say, once we‚Äôre happy with how threading works at the protocol level, we‚Äôll be looking at getting it into the UX of Element and mainstream Matrix chat clients too!</p>
<h3 id="what-s-with-the-decentralised-reputation-button">What‚Äôs with the decentralised reputation button?</h3>
<p>Cerulean is very much a test jig for new ideas (e.g. threading, timeline rooms, peeking), and we‚Äôre taking the opportunity to also use it as an experiment for our first forays into publishing and subscribing to reputation greylists; giving users the option to filter out content by default they might not want to see‚Ä¶ but doing so on their own terms by subscribing to whatever reputation feed they prefer, while clearly visualising the filtering being applied.  In other words, this is the first concrete experimental implementation of the work proposed in the second half of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">Combating Abuse in Matrix without Backdoors</a>.  This is super early days, and we haven‚Äôt even published a proto-MSC for the event format being used, but if you‚Äôre particularly interested in this domain it‚Äôs easy enough to figure out - just head over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nsfw:dendrite.matrix.org">#nsfw:dendrite.matrix.org</a> (warning: not actually NSFW, yet) and look in /devtools to see what‚Äôs going on.</p>
<p>So, there you have it - further evidence that Matrix is not just for Chat, and a hopefully intriguing taste of the shape of things to come!

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you haven't already seen it, we wrote a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/15/dendrite-2020-progress-update">Dendrite 2020 Progress Update blog post</a> detailing our year in Dendrite. It also includes an announcement for our new public <code>dendrite.matrix.org</code> homeserver, which is open for registration!</p>
<p>Today we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.4">Dendrite 0.3.4</a>, which is a performance and bug-fix release, including the following changes from the last two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The stream tokens for <code>/sync</code> have been refactored, giving PDUs, typing notifications, read receipts, invites and send-to-device messages their own respective stream positions, greatly improving the correctness of sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new roominfo cache has been added, which results in less database hits in the roomserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prometheus metrics have been added for sync requests, destination queues and client API event send perceived latency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event IDs are no longer recalculated so often in <code>/sync</code>, which reduces CPU usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync requests are now woken up correctly for our own device list updates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device list stream position is no longer lost, so unnecessary device updates no longer appear in every other sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A crash on concurrent map read/writes has been fixed in the stream token code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver input API no longer starts more worker goroutines than needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver no longer uses the request context for queued tasks which could lead to send requests failing to be processed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new index has been added to the sync API current state table, which improves lookup performance significantly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client API <code>/joined_rooms</code> endpoint no longer incorrectly returns <code>null</code> if there are 0 rooms joined</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver will now query appservices when looking up a local room alias that isn't known</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The check on registration for appservice-exclusive namespaces has been fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>
</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone! It's been ages since I've talked about a personal project on here. I've been working on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-github">matrix-github</a> bridge, which is an all singing all dancing service to connect you to Github AND Gitlab. (Yes, it's now poorly named).</p>
<p>I've landed the initial bits to make GitLab work, so that you can join issues and MRs as rooms in the UI but there is more work to do to make that solid and more interactive. The thing I am most looking forward to is notifications for GitLab so I can get away from emails.</p>
<p>ALSO, off the back of TravisR's fantastic widget work, I've landed initial support for widgets in admin rooms and soon issue/PR rooms. The idea here being that widgets give you a nicer UI to control the bridge or render details like commits going past or diffs. All the groundwork for authenticating widgets against the bridge and rendering them is done, now it just needs features.</p>
<p>That's the highlights this week. I'm hoping to really tighten the documentation to get more people spun up on it as the notifications features have turned out to be a killer feature for me :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-12-18-x7YaI-image.png" alt="2020-12-18-x7YaI-image.png" /></p>
<p>I've been using this (the bridge, rather than the upcoming widgets) for a couple of months now and find it really really powerful. I'm not in GitHub most of the day, so getting notifs piped direct into Matrix is great!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In celebration of the cross-signing MSC being finally merged, Nheko master now supports cross signing other users and your own devices. üéâ The UX is currently not final, you have to manually fetch the cross signing keys in the settings, if you don't have them after a verification. You are also not yet prompted to verify new logins and can't bootstrap cross-signing from Nheko, but the functional bits and bobs are there now. We are also still investigating, if prompting for your recovery key/passphrase is less confusing by using just one input field or if we should prompt for them separately. Currently Nheko just asks you to unlook and will accept whatever you input (if it can decrypt the secrets with it). FluffyChat does that and I think it is really nice!</p>
<p>There are also a few smaller features added recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now uses the icon from your theme on the login page</p>

<p><a href="https://fluffychat.im">FluffyChat</a> is a cute cross-platform matrix client. It is available for Android, iOS, Web and Desktop.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">krille</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FluffyChat 0.24.0 is released with new features and fixes.</p>
<p>What is new:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new public room discovery page, where you can find and join public rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental bootstrap support for cross-signing and keybackup and something really weird that is named SSSS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced power level managing for rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minor design changes like a new icon set</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beside of that we have of course a lot of bug fixes and stability improvements. All languages should now also work on iOS.</p>
<p>Also we are looking forward to publish the app in the AppStore for iOS but we will do this under the hood of Famedly. Btw. FluffyChat will soon move to the Famedly GitLab project and we will move the app in the PlayStore to the Famedly account too. This doesn't mean that anything will change there. It is just that Famedly will now handle the legal stuff for us and may offer paid customer support for businesses, which have interest in FluffyChat. But the app will still be available under the same AGPL3 license. This will just make it easier for us to publish the app in the official stores as we don't need to pay so much for the developer accounts.</p>

<p>It's the most wonderful time of the year! The ‚õÑÔ∏è winter edition of <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/">Games Done Quick</a> is almost upon us. This recurring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrun">speedrunning</a> event helps raise money for charity each year. As usual, the proceeds of the week long <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule">AGDQ</a> are going to the Prevent Cancer Foundation. With some luck we might break last year's $3.13 million record.</p>
<p>To help you keep track of the event I've created <a href="https://github.com/daenney/gdqbot">GDQBot</a>. Right now you can use it to query for the schedule. Next week should see the code land to add the announcer routine so the bot will announce events as they happen to channels its invited to.</p>
<p>Also a big thank you to tulir for patiently answering my questions as I was trying to find my way around mautrix-go.</p>

            <p>One of the goals on the core team is to reduce friction for new users joining Matrix. A challenge we regularly face is all the factors which make Matrix flexible and powerful as an open, secure decentralised protocol also increase the difficulty of getting started.</p>
<p>As one example‚Äî to create a healthy, vibrant ecosystem and put power back into the hands of end users, it‚Äôs critical multiple clients exist, and that users ultimately have control over which one to use. However, needing to choose a client before getting going is counter-intuitive, and adds cognitive load which proprietary services simply don‚Äôt have.</p>
<p>Striking this balance is tricky, and one we‚Äôre aiming to improve with the latest version of <a href="https://www.matrix.to">Matrix.to</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-matrix-to">What's Matrix.to?</h2>
<p>Matrix.to is a simple URL redirection service which lets users share links to rooms, users and communities. It isn‚Äôt tied to any client, and for end users it serves as a landing page for many as their first touch to Matrix. And until the matrix:// URI scheme is deployed commonplace (we finally <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/matrix">registered it with IANA</a> a few months ago!) it is the only client-agnostic way to link to content in Matrix.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs privacy preserving, with no information stored server side, with all calculation done in client-side JavaScript. It started life years ago as a temporary minimum viable hack by Matthew which then hung around untouched for years being‚Ä¶ minimally viable. But we‚Äôve recently given it a huge upgrade in usability and functionality at last!</p>
<h2 id="what-s-new">What's new?</h2>
<p><img src="https://matrix.org/blog/img/2020-12-17-matrix_to.png" alt="The matrix.to room, on the new matrix.to!" /></p>
<p>We‚Äôve re-written matrix.to from scratch, giving it a visual upgrade and refocused the experience around:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Helping new users find the best client for them to easily get going.</strong> By default, links will prioritise showing clients which are compatible with the platform the link is being viewed from, including mobile platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optionally, remembering your preferred client for future visits.</strong> This also includes deeplinking into native apps for Element Desktop &amp; Element Mobile (and in future, other clients too, of course).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fetching useful previews.</strong> One of our main observations when testing with new users is a lack of confidence trying out a new service without personalised, contextual information on the rooms or people they‚Äôre heading to. Matrix.to now displays room metadata like avatars, names and topics directly (fetched via matrix.org by default, asking for permission).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>We‚Äôve baked in the ability to specify clients and deployments within links, allowing sharing to give the option of a specific destination to guarantee a predictable experience. For instance, Mozilla might share matrix.to links which recommend using chat.mozilla.org, if you don‚Äôt already have a preferred Matrix client configured. We‚Äôve yet to implement this feature in Element, but we‚Äôll be researching and experimenting with different implementations soon and will recommend best practises when we have them.</p>
<p>We plan to evolve matrix.to over time, including eventually evolving it to better support the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2312">Matrix URI scheme</a>. As before, you can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to">on GitHub</a> and please go ahead and submit pull requests to get your Matrix client listed.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think over in the matrix.to room, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix.to:matrix.org">linked to via matrix.to</a>!</p>
