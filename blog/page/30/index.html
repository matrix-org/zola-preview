<p>I finally got around to actually making the maubot <a href="https://github.com/maubot/github">github plugin</a>, which is now spamming commits and other github things in all my project rooms.</p>
<p>Next up is per-room config options for webhooks and more matrix -&gt; github actions (currently it's mostly just the github -&gt; matrix webhooks). I might also end up making a more advanced plugin configuration system that supports multiple files, since jinja2 templates in a yaml file isn't that nice.</p>

            <p>A few years ago, back when Matrix was originally implementing end-to-end encryption, we asked Moxie (the project lead for Signal) whether he‚Äôd ever consider connecting Signal (then TextSecure) to Matrix.  After all, one of Matrix‚Äôs goals is to be an interoperability layer between other communication silos, and one of the reasons for us using Signal‚Äôs Double Ratchet Algorithm for Matrix‚Äôs encryption was to increase our chances of one day connecting with other apps using the same algorithm (Signal, WhatsApp, Google Allo, Skype, etc).  Moxie politely declined, and then a few months later wrote ‚Äú<a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">The ecosystem is moving</a>‚Äù to elaborate his thoughts on why he feels he ‚Äúno longer believes that it is possible to build a competitive federated messenger at all.‚Äù</p>
<p>At the time we didn‚Äôt respond via a blog post; instead we ended up talking it through a few times in person to see how misaligned we really were. The conclusion was that we agreed to disagree and Moxie said he‚Äôd be happy to be proved wrong, and wished us good luck.  However, the subject has come up again thanks to <a href="https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2019/Fahrplan/events/11086.html">Moxie‚Äôs talk on the same subject</a> at 36C3 last week, and we <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21933891">keep</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21935219">getting</a> <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!OGEhHVWSdvArJzumhm:matrix.org/$SzdpeR_Hji5AMOkydnYzv5UN_UaGdN710ThF-lfAt9A?via=matrix.org&amp;via=t2bot.io&amp;via=privacytools.io">asked</a> to write a formal response on the Matrix side.  So, here‚Äôs an attempt to do so.  (Moxie didn‚Äôt want the 36C3 talk recorded, and I haven‚Äôt watched it, so this is responding to the original blog post).</p>
<p>From my perspective, the main points proposed in ‚ÄòThe ecosystem is moving‚Äô boil down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decentralised systems are harder to design and build than centralised ones, as coordination is harder if you don‚Äôt have a single authority to trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decentralised systems are harder and slower to evolve than centralised ones, as you can‚Äôt force participants to rapidly roll out (or even agree on) new features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users in federated systems tend to coalesce around the best/biggest server that the bulk of people use - which means that server typically gets to see a disproportionate amount of communication metadata (who‚Äôs talking to who, and when), and has disproportionate power over the network, which could bully others away from running their own deployments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If users don‚Äôt trust their app provider, they can always go switch apps, which gives them freedom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open systems are less secure because you have no control over the quality of the implementations - if anyone can bring their own client or server to the table, all it takes is one bad implementation to compromise everyone in the vicinity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, all of these points are valid to some extent.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs absolutely true that decentralised systems are harder than centralised ones.  Prior to Matrix we built centralised comms systems - we literally can do a side-by-side comparison for the same team to see how easily and fast we built our centralised comms system relative to Matrix.  Empirically It took us around 6 times longer to get to the same feature-set with Matrix.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also true that decentralised systems are harder to evolve than centralised ones - you can‚Äôt just push out a given feature with a single app update, but you have to agree and publish a public spec, support incremental migration, and build governance processes and community dynamics which encourage everyone to implement and upgrade.  This is hard, but not impossible: we‚Äôve spent loads of time and money on Matrix‚Äôs <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation/">governance model</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">spec process</a> to get it right.  It‚Äôs still not perfect, but we haven‚Äôt seen much fragmentation so far, and when we‚Äôre pushing out a feature empirically we can and do go just as fast as the centralised alternatives. (E2E by default is a bit of a special case because we‚Äôve had to go and reimplement many features users take for granted today in an E2E-capable manner, but we‚Äôre sprinting to get it done in the coming weeks).  A bigger problem is that there are hundreds of spec change proposals which folks would like to see in the protocol, and finding a way to manage expectations and parallelise spec progress is hard - something we‚Äôre looking to improve in 2020 (although still figuring out how!)</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also fair that in a multi-server federated model, users naturally tend to sign up on the most prominent server(s) (e.g. the matrix.org homeserver in the case of Matrix).  In practice, the matrix.org homeserver currently makes up about 35% of the visible Matrix network by active users.  It‚Äôs also true that Matrix servers currently store metadata about who‚Äôs talking to who, and when, as a side-effect of storing and relaying messages on behalf of their users.  And without an adequate protocol governance system in place, a large server could start pushing around smaller ones in terms of protocol behaviour.  In practice, we‚Äôre looking into solving metadata protection in Matrix by experimenting with hybrid P2P / Client Server models - letting users store their metadata purely clientside if they so desire, and potentially obfuscating who‚Äôs talking to who via mixnets of blinded store &amp; forward servers (more about this coming up at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/dip_p2p_matrix/">FOSDEM</a>). Combined with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/proposal/remove_mxids_from_events/proposals/1228-removing-mxids-from-events.md">nomadic accounts</a>, this would let us eventually turn off the matrix.org server entirely and eliminate the pseudo-centralisation effect - the default ‚Äòserver‚Äô would be the one running on your client.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs true that if a user doesn‚Äôt trust (say) Telegram, they are free to go switch to Signal or WhatsApp or whatever instead‚Ä¶ at the massive expense of having to persuade all their friends to install yet another app, and fragmenting their conversation history across multiple apps.</p>
<p>Finally, it‚Äôs also true that because anyone can develop a Matrix client or server and connect to the global network, there‚Äôs a risk of bad quality implementations in the wild.  There are many forks of Riot on the app stores - we simply can‚Äôt vouch for whether they are secure.  Similarly there are Matrix clients whose E2E encryption is partial, missing, or unreviewed.  And there are a wide range of different Matrix servers run by different people with different agendas in different locations, which may be more or less trustworthy.</p>
<p><strong>HOWEVER: all of this completely ignores one critical thing - the value of freedom</strong>.  Freedom to select which server to use.  Freedom to run your own server (perhaps invisibly in your app, in a P2P world). Freedom to pick which country your server runs in. Freedom to select how much metadata and history to keep. Freedom to choose which apps to use - while still having the freedom to talk to anyone you like (without them necessarily installing yet another app).  Freedom to connect your own functionality - bots, bridges, integrations etc.  Freedom to select which identifiers (if any) to use to register your account.  Freedom to extend the protocol.  Freedom to write your own client, or build whole new as-yet-unimagined systems on top.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs true that if you‚Äôre writing a messaging app optimised for privacy at any cost, Moxie‚Äôs approach is one way to do it. However, this ends up being a perversely closed world - a closed network, where unofficial clients are banned, with no platform to build on, no open standards, and you end up thoroughly putting all your eggs in one basket, trusting past, present &amp; future Signal to retain its values, stay up and somehow dodge compromise &amp; censorship‚Ä¶ despite probably being the single highest value attack target on the ‚Äònet.</p>
<p>Quite simply, that isn‚Äôt a world I want to live in.</p>
<p>We owe the entire success of the Internet (let alone the Web) to openness, interoperability and decentralisation.  To declare that openness, interoperability and decentralisation is ‚Äòtoo hard‚Äô and not worth the effort when building a messaging solution is to throw away <em>all</em> the potential of the vibrancy, creativity and innovation that comes from an open network.  Sure, you may end up with a super-private messaging app - but one that starts to smell alarmingly like a walled garden like Facebook‚Äôs Internet.org initiative, or an AOL keyword, or Google‚Äôs AMP.</p>
<p>So, we continue to gladly take up Moxie‚Äôs challenge to prove him wrong - to show that it‚Äôs both possible and imperative to create an open decentralised messaging platform which (if you use reputable apps and servers) can be as secure and metadata-protecting as Signal‚Ä¶ and indeed more so, given you can run your server off the grid, and don‚Äôt need to register with a phone number, and in future may not even need a server at all.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Every year we do an annual wrap-up and retrospective of all the things happening in the Matrix core team - if you‚Äôre feeling particularly curious or bored you can check out the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2015/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-special/">2015</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2016/12/26/the-matrix-holiday-special-2016-edition/">2016</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2017/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-mini-special-2017-edition/">2017</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/12/25/the-2018-matrix-holiday-special/">2018</a> editions for context.  The idea is to look at the bigger picture trends in Matrix outside of the weekly <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix/">TWIM</a> posts to get an idea of the stuff which we made progress on, and the stuff which still remains.</p>
<p>That said, it‚Äôs hard to know where to start - Matrix accelerated more than ever before in 2019, and there‚Äôs been progress on pretty much all battlefronts.  So as a different format, let‚Äôs take the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/12/25/the-2018-matrix-holiday-special#2019">stuff we said we had planned for 2019</a> from the end of last year‚Äôs update and see what we actually achieved...</p>
<h4 id="2019-the-immediate-priorities">2019: the immediate priorities</h4>
<p>So, our immediate priorities for 2019 were:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>r0 spec releases across the board (aka Matrix 1.0)</em></li>
<li><em>Implementing them in Synapse</em></li>
</ul>
<p>‚úÖ Well, unless you‚Äôve been floating in a sensory deprivation tank for the last year, hopefully you spotted that Matrix (as a protocol) finally exited beta - starting off with the announcement at FOSDEM in February of the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019/">first stable release of the Server-Server API</a>, alongside the Synapse 0.99.x series as we began the process of migrating to the 1.0 APIs.</p>
<p>Specifically this meant killing off self-signed certificates, adding .well-known server discovery and implementing room version semantics so we could upgrade the underlying room version algorithm to fix the residual flaws.  This culminated in June with the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation/">official release of Matrix 1.0</a> - now including the remaining APIs and a stable release of Synapse 1.0.  The emphasis was on addressing all the main pre-1.0 design flaws rather than adding features or performance, but with 1.0 out the door at last we‚Äôve been able to make progress there too.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Landing the Riot redesign</em></li>
</ul>
<p>‚úÖ The full redesign of Riot‚Äôs UI on Web/Desktop landed shortly after FOSDEM in Feb with <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/the-big-1-0-68fa7c6050be">The Big 1.0</a>. Cosmetically we got most of the new look &amp; feel in place, and have had very positive feedback overall - although some of the UX thinkos of the old app remain and coming up on the radar for fixing.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Finalising the Matrix.org Foundation</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>‚úÖ This happened too, coincident with releasing Matrix 1.0 in June - read all about it at <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">https://matrix.org/foundation</a>. So far the governance and legal infrastructure the Foundation provides has helped the project significantly, and while it was a mammoth task to organise, we‚Äôre very glad it‚Äôs here!  Huge thanks go out to Jon, Ross and Jutta for agreeing to join the foundation as Guardians - they have been excellent in patiently listening to the various dramas of the year and ensuring Matrix‚Äôs neutrality and that we keep an even keel.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Landing all the new E2E encryption UX and features</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The good news on E2E encryption is that we‚Äôve been making solid progress throughout the year - the bad news is that we are still yet to turn it on by default.  Progress updates for the various pieces of the puzzle are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>‚úÖ The final UX is pretty much locked down (after several iterations as we try to tread the balance between trustworthiness and security) - here‚Äôs a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/wwqBo5oAFfk8XKmtd2YaIs/Cross-signing">sneak preview</a> of what we‚Äôre aiming at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üèó Cross-signing is the single biggest remaining piece of work in progress - letting users attest to the trustworthiness of their own devices, so you only ever have to trust a given user once rather than trusting all their devices individually. We gave a <a href="https://youtu.be/C2eE7rCUKlE?t=2974">very early demo</a> of an experimental implementation back at FOSDEM in Feb, inspired by some of the initial spec proposal at <a href="https://github.com/uhoreg/matrix-doc/blob/cross-signing/proposals/1680-cross-signing.md">MSC1680</a> (MSC = Matrix Spec Change, our <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">process for evolving Matrix</a>).</p>
<p>However, having played with it a bit, MSC1680 turned out to be too generic and complicated (it worked by the user signing a device with any other of their devices, building a twisted maze of which device vouched for which) - and we replaced it with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1756">MSC1756</a>, which shifts the model to be the simpler ‚Äúthe user has a key, which they use to sign their devices‚Äù. However, this in turn requires more infrastructure - you need somewhere secure to store your signing key, which prompted <a href="https://github.com/uhoreg/matrix-doc/blob/ssss/proposals/1946-secure_server-side_storage.md">MSC1946</a> - Secure Secret Storage &amp; Sharing (SSSS): the ability to sync your signing key between devices by storing it (encrypted, of course) on the server.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it also became obvious that the primitives for key verification needed to be improved too: introducing verification by emoji comparison (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1267">MSC1267</a>) and QR codes (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1543">MSC1543</a>), and switching key verification to be performed in the context of a DM (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2241">MSC2241</a>) so that you can see your verification history, find verifications, and easily dip in and out of verifying users as needed.</p>
<p>Whilst everyone else was panicking about Matrix 1.0 and associated baggage, Uhoreg was off in the wilderness plugging his way through all of this - iterating on the design, speccing it and implementing it in synapse and matrix-js-sdk, complete with a test jig to demonstrate it all working (<a href="https://scitech.video/videos/watch/1c8a0262-dee9-4927-b9e9-9856a7f4d8bf">part 1</a> and <a href="https://scitech.video/videos/watch/d1ef04a8-397a-4570-a9a9-cef143ea637c">part 2</a>).  Over the last few months the rest of the team has joined him though, and we‚Äôve been frantically working away implementing it all on both Riot/Web, iOS &amp; RiotX/Android.  For instance - here‚Äôs <a href="https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/IoFfFRWTmRNTbNDzfmKFPvLq">verification happening in DM</a> between Riot/Web &amp; RiotX a few weeks ago, and here‚Äôs a very early (unskinned) cut of <a href="https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tAWxQKhrfiPxBvtAOQfMiGjW">verification</a> happening in Riot/Web‚Äôs RightPanel a few days ago.</p>
<p>We were hoping to get cross-signing ready for the end of 2019, but in practice we‚Äôre now sprinting to get it done by FOSDEM 2020 in Feb - not least because we have a main-stage talk proposed to tell everyone how we landed it and turned on E2E by default... ;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚úÖ Support for non-E2E clients.  The last thing we want is to make it impossible to write a simple Matrix client, or to suddenly excommunicate (hah) all the existing Matrix bots &amp; bridges which haven‚Äôt implemented E2E.  To this end, poljar created <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">pantalaimon</a> - our very own Matrix daemon, which can sit in the background and offload all your E2EE from your Matrix client by acting as a transparent Matrix proxy which magically encrypts everything.  Built on matrix-nio and asyncio python3, We use it in production today for running various bots and it works excellently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚úÖ Support for search in E2E rooms.  Hot off the heels of pantalaimon‚Äôs success, poljar also created <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/seshat">seshat</a> - a native library for clientside indexing encrypted Matrix events written in Rust, powered by the <a href="https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy">tantivy</a> full-text search engine.  (pantalaimon also has support for indexing via tantivy, which involved contributing python bindings for tantivy, but we ended up going with Rust so we could embed it natively in as many Matrix clients as possible).  Seshat is particularly cool in that the indexes themselves are encrypted in on disk - and in future could even be synced between clients using <a href="https://github.com/uhoreg/matrix-doc/blob/ssss/proposals/1946-secure_server-side_storage.md">SSSS</a> so you don‚Äôt have to reindex your messages every time you log in on a new device.  Seshat is implemented behind a labs flag on Riot/Desktop and it will ship as soon Riot/Desktop‚Äôs build pipeline is fully updated to support native modules (which will also unlock other goodies, such as using faster/safer native E2E primitives, safer key storage, and Discord-style keyboard-shortcuts for VoIP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üèó Fixing ‚Äúunable to decrypt‚Äù errors.  We‚Äôve done big sprint over the last month or so to track down the final straggling causes of unable to decrypt errors.  Some of these are legitimate bugs (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/6399">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/6399</a>) - but many are artefacts of the current architecture: for instance, if the sender has no way to know your device was in the room when it encrypted a message, you won‚Äôt be able to decrypt.  We‚Äôre addressing this by improving better error messages and feedback so the user isn‚Äôt surprised by what‚Äôs going on (aiming for Jan) - and in future we‚Äôll have to revisit E2E‚Äôs fundamentals to ensure that it‚Äôs impossible to receive a message without also receiving the key to decrypt it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚úÖ Support for push notifications in E2E rooms.  This is kinda solved right now by having all clients get (silently) pushed whenever they receive a message in an E2E room with push enabled, and relying on the client to be woken up by the push in order to decrypt the message in order to display the push notification.  However, this is battery intensive, and we could probably do better - but this isn‚Äôt a blocker for going live.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üèó Support for FilePanel and NotifPanel in E2E rooms.  Seshat should fix this by indexing all your messages (and so tracking whether they contain pushes or files, and populating up your local view of your file &amp; notif panels respectively) - just need to ensure it‚Äôs hooked up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>...and that‚Äôs where things stand right now on E2E by default.  We‚Äôll start turning it on by default for private rooms as soon as the UX has landed (probably starting first with new DMs and private rooms, prompting the user in case they want to opt out - and then migrating existing ones).  It‚Äôs worth noting that we have poured a <em>lot</em> of work into E2E encryption now - often to the detriment of the rest of Matrix; our rich featureset and decentralisation has combined to make this a tough nut to crack, but the end is in sight.  Thanks to all for your patience and support while we‚Äôve been working through this.</p>
<p>That takes us to the end of the stuff we planned to prioritise in 2019 - but what about the more speculative medium-term stuff which was on the menu this time last year?</p>
<h4 id="2019-the-medium-term-priorities">2019: the medium-term priorities</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Reworking and improving Communities/Groups.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We have some really promising UX work and a fairly early spec proposal (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1772/proposals/1772-groups-as-rooms.md">MSC1772</a>), but work in earnest hasn‚Äôt kicked off yet. It‚Äôs going to be one of the next big projects though. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reactions.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>‚úÖ Riot now has Reactions! üéâüéâüéâ  The only remaining work is to finish the remaining rough edges of the spec proposal (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1849/proposals/1849-aggregations.md">MSC1849</a>) and actually land them in the Matrix spec proper.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>E2E-encrypted Search</em></li>
</ul>
<p>‚úÖ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/seshat">Seshat</a> exists! (see above)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Filtering. (empowering users to filter out rooms &amp; content they're not interested in).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>‚úÖ We‚Äôve ended up thinking lots in 2019 about empowering users to filter content.  The main impetus has been to ensure that users and communities can filter out abuse (on their own terms), and also to start building infrastructure which can be used for folks to share their own filters.  Over the last few months, this has started to take concrete form - with the arrival of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/msc2313/proposals/2313-moderation-policy-rooms.md">MSC2313</a> ‚ÄúModeration policies as rooms‚Äù, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir">Mjolnir</a> - a bot you can run to enforce moderation policies on your rooms.  It‚Äôs all quite early, but we expect a lot more work in this space over the coming year (and it‚Äôs wryly amusing that <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">Twitter has also woken up</a> to it being an interesting problem needing to be solved.)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Extensible events</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry folks; no progress here since a flurry of spec work (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1767/proposals/1767-extensible-events.md">MSC1767</a>) back in Jan 2019. The good news is that the spec proposal seems to be relatively well received. The bad news is that we haven‚Äôt had bandwidth to finish reviewing it, implementing it and migrating it anywhere. It blocks a bunch of really useful stuff in Matrix, and there are users willing to pay for it (via New Vector) - we‚Äôll get to it as soon as we can.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Editable messages.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>‚úÖ These landed too and are a thing of joy!  Just need to merge <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1849/proposals/1849-aggregations.md">MSC1849</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Extensible Profiles (we've actually been experimenting with this already).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to Extensible Events, there was a flurry of spec work (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1769/proposals/1769-extensible-profiles-as-rooms.md">MSC1769</a>) back in Jan, but little progress since.  This will also unlock a lot of really useful features - e.g. custom status, custom profile data, social timeline rooms etc.  We‚Äôll likely get to it shortly after communities work.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Threading.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>üèó So we actually landed label-based threading (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2326/proposals/2326-label-based-filtering.md">MSC2326</a>) in Synapse 1.6, but it‚Äôs not exposed in Riot yet (or elsewhere).  It doesn‚Äôt have quite the same semantics as Slack-style threading; the idea is to filter down your room based on which messages are tagged as part of a given topic.  However, it‚Äôs very powerful, and it‚Äôll be fun to add it to Riot at some point in 2020.  Meanwhile, better-than-label-based-threading is also on the cards, although slightly lower priority than some of the other stuff in this section.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Landing the Riot/Android rewrite</em></li>
</ul>
<p>üèó As you probably know, RiotX is a full rewrite of Riot/Android in Kotlin using modern AndroidX and Jetpack idioms - and it entered beta <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/introducing-the-riotx-beta-for-android-b17952e8f771">back in June</a>.  Since then we‚Äôve been frantically working away on both playing catch-up with the old app‚Ä¶ as well as implementing all the new stuff (reactions, edits, new E2E verification, cross-signing etc) which makes no sense to waste time adding in Riot/Android, but also pushes out the timeline on RiotX itself.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre currently sprinting to try to get RiotX ready for FOSDEM in February - hopefully users will have felt the app starting to really stabilise over the last few months (it even supports breadcrumbs now!)</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Considering whether to do a similar overhaul of Riot/iOS</em></li>
</ul>
<p>üèó It‚Äôs cheating a bit, but Manu (the lead developer on Riot/iOS and delivery manager of Riot/Mobile in general) has been hacking on an entirely new client called <a href="https://github.com/manuroe/messagerie">Messagerie</a> in his spare time, using SwiftUI.  The idea of throwing away the whole UI layer and replacing it with the latest best practices sounds suspiciously like RiotX - it‚Äôll be interesting to see how RiotX/iOS takes shape next year! </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Scaling synapse via sharding the master process</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We ended up bottlenecked on IO rather than CPU in 2019, and as a result we worked on splitting synapse‚Äôs database across multiple database instances on a per-table granularity.  However, the master process itself doesn‚Äôt shard yet; so we‚Äôre now bottlenecked on CPU and need to get on and do this asap to unlock further Synapse scalability for mega-monolithic-deployments like the Matrix.org homeserver. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bridge UI for discovery of users/rooms and bridge status</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>üèó There‚Äôs been a bit of movement in the last few weeks on this, but nothing concrete yet. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bandwidth-efficient transports</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>‚úÖ We finished the 100bps CoAP transport proof-of-concept for Matrix, demoed it at FOSDEM and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/03/12/breaking-the-100-bps-barrier-with-matrix-meshsim-coap-proxy">shipped it in March</a>. However, we haven‚Äôt progressed it much further; it really needs a corporate sponsor who wants to fund work to finish it off and bake it properly into Matrix. <strong>If you‚Äôre interested, please <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">get in touch</a>.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bandwidth-efficient routing</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>üèó We also did a bunch of related work on bandwidth-efficient routing, which sadly hasn‚Äôt been released yet.  However, it‚Äôs interesting to note that the <a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/english/">Decentralized Systems and Network Services Research Group</a> at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology‚Äôs Institute of Telematics has been looking into this space too - c.f. their <a href="https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000100364">A Glimpse of the Matrix</a> paper, which ponders very similar problems. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Getting Dendrite to production.</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>üèó Dendrite work has been bubbling away in the background thanks to Anoa, Brendan, cnly (our GSoC dendrite contributor) and others.  Inevitably most of our bandwidth has gone into getting Synapse to 1.0 and making sure it‚Äôs fit for purpose, but we want and need to keep Dendrite alive for next-generation purposes - and in fact New Vector is hiring new people to work on it in 2020. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Inline widgets (polls etc)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>üèó We have an MSC (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2192">MSC2192</a>), but not an implementation. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Improving VoIP over Matrix.</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>Very little progress here, frustratingly.  Jitsi has been upgraded and conference calls should kick ass these days (let us know if they don‚Äôt), but 1:1 needs a lot of love.  Hopefully we‚Äôll get to it in 2020. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Adding more bridges, and improving the current ones.</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of bridging progress in 2020 - all new puppeting Slack support; huge fixes to the IRC bridge (including shifting to Postgres at last); Bifrost (the XMPP bridge) progressed too, and there‚Äôs been loads of community bridging work around WhatsApp, Discord and others. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Account portability</em></li>
<li><em>Replacing MXIDs with public keys</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We‚Äôve just started looking at implementing these seriously via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/proposal/remove_mxids_from_events/proposals/1228-removing-mxids-from-events.md">MSC1228</a> (as of last week) - expect progress in 2020.</p>
<p>So that sums up progress on the medium term menu - as you can see, a bunch actually happened; a bunch made progress; a few didn‚Äôt happen at all.</p>
<h4 id="2019-the-longer-term-priorities">2019: the longer-term priorities</h4>
<p>Finally, on the longer term radar:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Shared-code cross-platform client SDKs (e.g. sharing a native core library between matrix-{js,ios,android}-sdk)</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>No progress here.  Instead, all three main platforms have continued to write and maintain their own platform-specific SDKs for now.  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/seshat">Seshat</a> however will be the first piece of native rust code shared across all 3 platforms - let‚Äôs see how that goes first... </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Matrix daemons (e.g. running an always-on client as a background process in your OS which apps can connect to via a lightweight CS API)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>‚úÖ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a> lives!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Push notifications via Matrix (using a daemon-style architecture)</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>No progress here, unless you count the CoAP low-bandwidth work.  However, Bubu (also Riot/Android Fdroid maintainer) has been working on a project called <a href="https://bubu1.eu/openpush/">OpenPush</a> which looks to help in this space (albeit not built on Matrix, but could be used by Matrix).  There are a few other related projects.  If someone wants to build this on top of Matrix + CoAP please get in touch asap! </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Clientside homeservers (i.e. p2p matrix) - e.g. compiling Dendrite to WASM and running it in a service worker.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>üèó Work is actually happening on this currently.  Dendrite has successfully compiled to WASM and runs, and we‚Äôve had it (almost) talking HTTP tunnelled over libp2p as part of P2P Matrix experiments.  In 2020 we‚Äôre going to be investing a lot in P2P Matrix - to give users full control of their communication without even having to run a server, and also to simplify onboarding and account portability enormously.  We have a talk about this accepted for FOSDEM 2020 (<a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/dip_p2p_matrix/">The Path to P2P Matrix</a>) and we‚Äôre actively (frantically) hacking on Dendrite to make it happen - keep an eye out for how things develop!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Experimenting with MLS for E2E Encryption</em></li>
</ul>
<p>üèó Now that E2E-by-default has entered the ‚Äúit works! let‚Äôs land it in Riot asap‚Äù phase, Uhoreg has had some time to start thinking about the longer term future of encryption in Matrix.  <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/charter/">MLS (Messaging Layer Security)</a> is the IETF‚Äôs initiative to define a standard mechanism for end-to-end-encrypted group chats, which has some major algorithmic improvements over Olm/Megolm and the Double Ratchet Algorithm as used by Signal.  The catch is that it doesn‚Äôt work at all well with decentralisation - however, we‚Äôve been <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/mls/MnLJkbJ_Mwe8Oz0Ll6delGJLPz4">working with them</a> to try to ensure MLS can work in a decentralised world.  More recently, uhoreg has had a chance to think a lot more about this and we‚Äôre working on a proposal for Decentralised MLS which builds on plain MLS while also giving the semantics needed for Matrix.  It‚Äôs all very experimental at this point (and the proof-of-concept implementation is written in <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>!) - but looks promising.  We‚Äôll share more asap, and will certainly be investing more time in this in 2020.. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Storing and querying more generic data structures in Matrix (e.g. object trees; scene graphs)</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly no progress here :( </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Alternate use cases for VR, IoT, etc.</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>...and none here either.</p>
<p>So, of all the myriad things on our radar for 2019 (as of Dec 2018), hopefully this gives some idea of where we hit the mark.</p>
<h4 id="2019-the-unpredictable-bits">2019: the unpredictable bits</h4>
<p>However, there‚Äôs also a tonne of other stuff which happened which wasn‚Äôt explicitly on the radar.  On the synapse side, we finished fully migrating from Python 2 to Python 3, and started using asyncio and all the latest Python 3 goodies!  We finally <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6358">implemented configurable history retention</a> for servers and rooms! We even implemented <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6409">self-destructing messages</a> in Synapse (not that Riot exposes them yet). And there has been loads of optimisation and performance work since 1.0 landed in June.</p>
<p>On the ops side, we overhauled all our ops processes and security after the Matrix.org <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/05/08/post-mortem-and-remediations-for-apr-11-security-incident/">datacenter breach</a> in April, throwing away our legacy infrastructure and rebuilding it properly - and subsequently have been expanding our ops team from one dedicated ops person to four.  We also found ourselves having to do another emergency datacenter migration back in November when the old one was unable to reliably service IO for our database cluster. </p>
<p>We also spent a bunch time after shipping Matrix 1.0 working on tightening up Matrix‚Äôs privacy model - particularly around third party identity servers, integration managers, and making sure that folks self-hosting Matrix don‚Äôt accidentally depend on use 3rd party services without realising it.  If you missed out on the fun at the time, you can read all about it <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/30/tightening-up-privacy-in-matrix/">here</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/09/27/privacy-improvements-in-synapse-1-4-and-riot-1-4/">here</a>.  This ended up being way more work than we expected, but we‚Äôre very glad to have sorted it out now. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, mainstream uptake of Matrix has properly taken off, with the French Government launching Tchap (their fork of Riot), now with hundreds of thousands of daily active users.  The <a href="https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Open-Source-Bundeswehr-baut-eigene-verschluesselte-Messenger-App-4623404.html">German Government revealed today</a> that they are also formally trialling Matrix, starting with the Bundeswehr (Ministry of Defense); we‚Äôve been helping them out with the deployment too. It is not an exaggeration to suggest that we could end up with an official cross-government Matrix network, publicly federated with the wider Internet, for self-hosted encrypted decentralised instant messaging.  In fact Ulrich Kelber, the Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragte (Federal Data Protection Commissioner) for Germany <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/whatsapp-matrix-oder-xmpp-bmi-sucht-einen-messenger-fuer-bundesbehoerden-1912-145326.html">pointed out</a>: ‚ÄúYou could even set up a privacy-friendly messenger service in cooperation with France, which in the medium term could represent a real alternative to existing products on the market as a pan-European solution‚Äù. </p>
<p>Alongside all this, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/12/19/welcoming-mozilla-to-matrix/">Mozilla announced</a> they are replacing the Moznet IRC network with Matrix; <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/20/welcome-to-matrix-kde/">KDE joined Matrix</a> in Feb, <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T230531">Wikimedia</a> is getting set up on their server, and more and more massive players (including the largest in the world) keep getting in touch to find out how they can best get onboard Matrix - it‚Äôs incredibly exciting.  It also means that we were able to <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/10/10/new-vector-raises-8-5-m-to-accelerate-matrix-riot-modular/">raise capital</a> to keep folks employed to work on Matrix fulltime via <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a> and scale up <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a> as a paid hosting platform - which massively helps support core Matrix development.</p>
<h4 id="2020">2020</h4>
<p>All that remains now is to make some predictions for 2020.  Our main priorities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get E2E enabled for private rooms by default (see above). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Riot First-time User Experience (FTUE).  While we redesigned Riot‚Äôs UI in 2019, there are still far too many weird gotchas which trip over new users.  Starting in October we began a shift to completely change how Riot development works - transitioning the project to being led by the UX design team rather than the dev team, and ensuring that the design team considers the app holistically across all 3 platforms.  Above all else, our priority is to make it kick ass for normal non-technical mainstream users - not just for opensourcey wizards.  This is a tough ask, but we believe it‚Äôs literally make-or-break for the project in the long term if Matrix is ever to become as prevalent as Slack or WhatsApp, and we are throwing everything we have at it.  The second that E2E is on by default, the entirety of the Riot teams will be focusing on the mission to clear our <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aproject%3Aftue">FTUE backlog</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RiotX. We‚Äôre shipping RiotX on Android as fast as we can - currently users on Riot/Android are left high and dry and we need to do everything we can to finish RiotX and get them upgraded as rapidly as possible. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communities.  Off the back of FTUE comes the importance of grouping rooms &amp; users together into communities in a much better way than we have today.  This will be up next. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synapse: shard the master by user/room to avoid being it being bottlenecked on CPU.  We also need to apply smarter queue management on federation traffic to better reduce the memory footprint (and so eliminate complexity limits on small-footprint hosted servers!) - and we also desperately need to speed up joins. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite &amp; P2P Matrix: the plan currently is to use Dendrite as the basis for our P2P Matrix experiments.  In practice this means making it federate using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/proposal/remove_mxids_from_events/proposals/1228-removing-mxids-from-events.md">MSC1228</a>-semantics (no point in wasting time implementing the ‚Äòlegacy‚Äô key management), and then experiment with hooking it up to various P2P transports (e.g. our low-bandwidth CoAP transport) and discovery systems (e.g. mDNS; libp2p; etc).  How we go about actually getting it into production depends entirely on how well the experiment goes; we could evolve Matrix to be hybrid CS/P2P; we could treat it as a new protocol and bridge to it; who knows.  Watch this space...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MLS: figure out our plan for next-generation E2E - for better scaling, and better reliability, and what (if anything) we should do with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/charter/">MLS</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridges: loads of work on the horizon to put a better UX on Bridging.  Bridge stability has improved enormously over the last year (thanks Half-Shot!) but we need to transition from being robust but ugly to being robust and polished... </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spec: we need to work out how to go faster on reviewing MSCs (both our own and from the wider community).  While the governance process in general feels healthier than it‚Äôs ever been, empirically we‚Äôre not exactly burning through the MSC backlog - and this is in part that MSC work is squeezed in alongside the other dayjob stuff everyone‚Äôs working on. Finding the right balance between sculpting spec and sculpting code is tough, but we‚Äôre going to try to improve it in 2020. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abuse / Reputation: we want to empower users to make their own minds up about what content they want to see and not see on Matrix (or what they want to host or not host on their servers / communities / rooms).  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir">Mjolnir</a> is a good start, but we‚Äôll be continuing to work on this throughout the year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, all the things listed above that we didn‚Äôt get to in 2019 are of course still options on the menu too.</p>
<p>So there you have it.  I‚Äôve not even tried to talk about the amazing stuff that the wider Matrix community has been up to - whether that‚Äôs amazing new clients like <a href="https://dittochat.org/">Ditto</a> (React Native!) or <a href="https://github.com/kiliankoe/nio">Nio!</a> (SwiftUI), or new bridges like <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts">mautrix-hangouts</a>, or even poljar‚Äôs secret rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/poljar/weechat-matrix-rs">weechat-matrix in Rust</a>; your best bet there is to skim through <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix/">TWIM</a>.  Huge undying thanks go out though to everyone who builds on Matrix and keeps the ecosystem maturing and growing (especially while we‚Äôre scurrying around shoring up the foundations) - there‚Äôs simply no point in Matrix as a protocol without the vibrant community building on top.</p>
<p>All told, it‚Äôs been a bit of an epic year (both in terms of wins and fails), and all that remains is to thank <em>everyone</em> who continues to use Matrix (particularly our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a> supporters) for their ongoing support and for helping the project accelerate forwards.  More than ever before, the world needs free and open communication open to all; the age of proprietary communication silos may be coming to an end - consigned to live alongside AOL CDs and Compuserve IDs in the history books.  With your support, Matrix can provide a decent mainstream yet decentralised alternative - and we‚Äôll do everything we can to make that happen in 2020.</p>
<p>Happy holidays!</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix.org team.</p>

<p>You may well have read about it by now, but Mozilla (purveyor of popular web browsers and champion of the open web) <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/12/19/welcoming-mozilla-to-matrix/">selected Matrix to replace IRC for their comms</a>! You can <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/synchronous-messaging-at-mozilla-the-decision/50620">read their own announcement here</a>.  Please note that this doesn't have to mean the death of Moznet on IRC - if someone wants to pick up <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd">matrix-ircd</a> and finish it off, we can keep exposing an IRC listener too!

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We've just released Synapse 1.7.2 - a minor point release to address two regressions which snuck into 1.7.0 and 1.7.1.  Sorry for the upgrade faff; hopefully we will be back to a saner release cadence shortly.  Reminder that if you are on 1.7.0 or earlier you should upgrade asap as 1.7.1 contained security fixes.</p>
<p>Get the new release from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.7.2">github</a> or any of the sources mentioned at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md.</p>
<p>The changelog since 1.7.1 is:</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-7-2-2019-12-20">Synapse 1.7.2 (2019-12-20)</h1>
<p>This release fixes some regressions introduced in Synapse 1.7.0 and 1.7.1.</p>
<h2 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix a regression introduced in Synapse 1.7.1 which caused errors when attempting to backfill rooms over federation. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/6576">#6576</a>)</li>
<li>Fix a bug introduced in Synapse 1.7.0 which caused an error on startup when upgrading from versions before 1.3.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/6578">#6578</a>)</li>

        <div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We‚Äôre incredibly excited that <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/synchronous-messaging-at-mozilla-the-decision/50620">Mozilla just announced</a> that they‚Äôve selected Matrix as the successor to IRC as the communication platform for the public Mozilla community!!  This comes off the back of a <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/synchronous-messaging-at-mozilla-trial-servers-feedback/44871">formal 1-month trial</a> in September to evaluate various options side by side, and now New Vector will be helping Mozilla get their homeserver up and running on the <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a> hosting platform over the coming weeks - and federating openly with the rest of the open global Matrix network! :)</p>
<p>We have always been massive fans of Mozilla: they have been an excellent role model as champions of the open web, open standards, not to mention open source - and it‚Äôs fair to say that Mozilla has been a major inspiration to how Matrix has evolved (Riot aspires to be to Matrix what Firefox is to the Web: a flagship open source app which provides an accessible friendly interface into an open standard network).  It‚Äôs very reassuring to see that Mozillians from the trial recognise the alignment and have converged on Matrix as the way forward - it‚Äôs a massive win for the open web and standards-based communication in general.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs worth noting that we‚Äôve also always been massive fans of IRC, and Matrix is unashamedly derivative of IRC in capabilities and culture, while broadening the scope to decentralised synchronisation and relaying of any kind of data.  For context, the genesis of the team which eventually spawned Matrix was on a student IRC server ~20 years ago - and subsequently everything we‚Äôve worked on (up to Matrix) was coordinated exclusively through IRC.  We even used to give conference talks on how to run your project/company off IRC.  I can‚Äôt really overstate how fundamental IRC is to our history - and we still keep our private IRC network online for old time‚Äôs sake (albeit bridged to Matrix). The very first protocol bridge we built for Matrix back in 2015 was for IRC - and Moznet and Freenode were the first public bridges we turned on. As of right now, <code>/stats u</code> on Moznet says that there are 4950 connected users, of which 1724 (so 35%) are actually Matrix users connected via the Moznet bridge - effectively using Matrix as a big decentralised IRC bouncer in the sky.</p>
<p>All of this is to say is that we deeply understand how dependent Mozilla has been on IRC over the years, and that we built Matrix to be a worthy successor which tries to capture all the best bits of IRC while providing much richer primitives (E2E encryption, openly federated decentralised chatrooms, arbitrary data sync, HTTP API, VoIP, etc).  It‚Äôs also worth noting that even though Moznet is being turned off, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd">matrix-ircd</a> exists as a very promising project that exposes <em>any</em> Matrix homeserver as an ircd - so for all you IRC die-hards, Moznet can absolutely live on in the afterlife!  (matrix-ircd is still alpha right now, but it‚Äôs a relatively modest amount of Rust and PRs are <em>very</em> welcome - if you grok IRC it should be a really really fun project to contribute to).</p>
<p>In other news, the trial in September was an amazing opportunity to gather feedback first-hand from a wide range of Mozillians as they gave Riot and Matrix a spin, often for the first time - and it was a lot of fun to take that feedback and rapidly act on it to improve the app.  For instance, having direct expert feedback on our screenreader support meant that we were able to <a href="https://blog.riot.im/riot-web-1-5/">radically improve our accessibility</a>, and we‚Äôve kept up the momentum on this since the trial (regardless of the outcome) with Mozilla &amp; Riot devs hacking together with the aim of making Riot the most accessible communication app out there without exception.  Huge thanks to Marco Zehe for all his guidance (and PRs), as well as the rest of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#a11y:matrix.org">#a11y:matrix.org</a>!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Riot‚Äôs UX continues to mature in general. One of our two primary projects right now is to improve First Time User Experience (<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aproject%3AFtue+">FTUE</a>) - i.e. making our UX as smooth and polished and predictable as possible, especially as seen by new users.  This project had just kicked off in September as the Mozilla trial began, and some of the major improvements to the Room Directory and Room Creation flow which subsequently landed in Riot/Web 1.5 were prioritised directly based on Mozillian feedback.  Since the trial we‚Äôve been focusing more on our other primary project (getting E2E Encryption enabled by default), but we will be back on FTUE asap - particularly to incorporate all the feedback we anticipate as Mozilla goes live!  We are absolutely determined for Riot to have as good if not better UX than the likes of Slack or Discord.  New Vector is also <a href="https://apply.workable.com/new-vector/j/6CB817C79E/">actively hiring more designers</a> to come work fulltime on Riot‚Äôs UI and UX as we shift Riot‚Äôs focus from being developer-led to design-led - if this sounds interesting, please get in touch!  And finally, everything is of course open source and PRs are genuinely appreciated to keep Riot heading in the right direction (please just check first if they change the UI/UX).</p>
<p>Finally, in case you‚Äôre dreading having to use a graphical chat client like Riot, the Mozilla instance will of course be accessible to any <a href="https://matrix.org/clients/">Matrix client</a> that floats your boat - for instance, <a href="https://github.com/poljar/weechat-matrix">weechat-matrix</a> also got a spurt of development to support Mozilla IAM single-sign-on so that commandline junkies can get their fix too. (It‚Äôs worth noting that weechat-matrix really is an incredibly fully featured and usable client - complete with full end-to-end encryption support.  If you haven‚Äôt tried it, you‚Äôre missing out).</p>
<p>So, to conclude: it has been indescribably valuable to have the expertise and enthusiasm of the Mozilla community in contributing feedback and fixes to Riot (and even <a href="https://github.com/bnjbvr/botzilla">building new Matrix bots</a>!).  Huge thanks to everyone who invested their time and energy participating in the trial and for their trust in concluding that Matrix was the way forward.  We see this as a massive responsibility and honour to help power the wider Mozilla community, and we will do everything we can to make it as successful as conceivably possible :)</p>
<p>To the future of an open web, with even more open communications!</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix &amp; Riot team :)</p>
<p>P.S. we‚Äôve come a long way since <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/matrix-and-irc-mozillians-custom-client/2911/7">Matrix was first proposed</a> for Mozilla :D</p>

            <p>Hi folks; today we are releasing Synapse 1.7.1.</p>
<p>This is a security release which fixes some problems which affected all previous versions of Synapse. We advise all admins whose servers are open to public federation to upgrade as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Full details follow, but the most important change improves event authorization, thereby preventing the ability to add certain events to a given room erroneously.</p>
<p>You can get the new release from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.7.1">github</a> or any of the sources mentioned at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md.</p>
<p>The changelog since 1.7.0 follows:</p>
<h2 id="security-updates">Security updates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug which could cause room events to be incorrectly authorized using events from a different room.

            <p>Hello people, it‚Äôs Synapse 1.7.0 time.</p>
<p>This release includes some long requested features, most notably the ability to automatically delete message data after a predefined period. For more details take a look at the config <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.7.0/docs/sample_config.yaml#L332-L393">here</a> ‚îÄ it should be pretty self explanatory.</p>
<p>Another significant change this release is to explicitly set room directories to be private by default. Previously it was possible to inadvertently configure the directory to be visible to arbitrary Matrix servers and the internet in general.</p>
<p>This means that for those admins who want their room directories to be publicly searchable (matrix.org for instance) they need to explicitly say so in the config. For more details see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.7.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v170">upgrade notes</a> and our <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/11/09/avoiding-unwelcome-visitors-on-private-matrix-servers/">blog post</a> explaining the situation in greater detail.</p>
<p>We also have early support for ephemeral messages, as well as the ability to specify a reason when rejecting an invite (amongst other actions).</p>
<p>Aside from all of that, we want to let you know about some changes on the horizon. Currently Synapse runs Sqlite by default. This is great in that it gets new admins going quickly without needing to install and configure Postgres. The downside of using Sqlite is that it offers very poor performance, especially once a server tries to join the federation. In truth Sqlite is only really there to demonstrate the service, but for anything other than the most trivial cases it is essential to migrate to Postgres.</p>
<p>Over the past few months we‚Äôve been working to improve the migration path to Postgres such that finally we feel confident to actively encourage admins to migrate. What‚Äôs more, in a future release we will forcibly prevent SQLite-backed servers federating unless the admin explicitly sets a config flag to show that they understand the trade-off they are making.</p>
<p>Overall we see these changes as something that will improve everyone‚Äôs experience of the matrix federation. We‚Äôll talk more about this closer to the time, but please expect a change in the coming months and if you are running SQLite, consider this a nudge to get yourself migrated.</p>
<p>As ever, you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.7.0">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>. Also, check out our <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/installing-synapse">Synapse installation guide page</a>.</p>
<p>The changelog since 1.6.1 follows:</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-7-0-2019-12-13">Synapse 1.7.0 (2019-12-13)</h1>
<p>This release changes the default settings so that only local authenticated users can query the server's room directory. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.7.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v170">upgrade notes</a> for details.</p>
<p>Support for SQLite versions before 3.11 is now deprecated. A future release will refuse to start if used with an SQLite version before 3.11.</p>
<p>Administrators are reminded that SQLite should not be used for production instances. Instructions for migrating to Postgres are available <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.7.0/docs/postgres.md">here</a>. A future release of synapse will, by default, disable federation for servers using SQLite.</p>
<p>No significant changes since 1.7.0rc2.</p>
