<p>Last week</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shipped <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/23/synapse-1-12-4-released">1.12.4</a> a patch release to fix some cross signing related bugs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redis support to replace our existing cross replication system, merged to develop. This is a precursor to the sharding project. We have a PR to support cache invalidation across workers which, once merged should make it relatively easy to pull off event persistence from the master process. Just removing event persistence could give some decent perf wins, but the prize is then splitting persistence to run across across multiple workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A final PR to support SSO for user interactive auth will merge imminently, thereby freeing up full cross signing support for worker installs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aside from that we‚Äôve been working on fixing a weird bug where rooms can end up with zero forward extremities and generally showing Sygnal some love. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upcoming</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Put Redis into production</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ship 1.13.0 which will contain Redis support as well as a host of SSO bug fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge our new caching config logic to give finer granularity on cache settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge cache invalidation and try to get events persistence running in its own worker.</p>
</li>

<p>This week I worked a lot on getting the first bit of federation working. My goal was to query the public room list of another server and forward it to a client.</p>
<p>This involved setting up a keypair to sign the json I send to the server and putting authorization headers into my requests. Most of the work is already done and <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/">https://federationtester.matrix.org/</a> reports it's all good.</p>

<p>Sadly there seems to be a problem with the signing, because other homeservers reject requests: <code>Unable to verify signature: &lt;class 'nacl.exceptions.BadSignatureError'&gt; Signature was forged or corrupt</code>. I'll continue to work on this in the next week(s).</p>

<li>
<p>Dendrite now uses a newer version of the Sarama library</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some caching has been added to the roomserver API for room versions, which should help quite a bit with performance over federation and handling transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auth checks for <code>/send_join</code> are now quite a bit more robust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed where the default state filter limited the amount of room state that was visible after a join</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gomatrixserverlib has quite a bit of new support for backfilling now, which will be wired into Dendrite soon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gomatrixserverlib has new primitives for v2 invite responses and <code>/get_missing_events</code> requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite support is being worked on currently, which should also enable support for creating DMs in Riot</p>

<p>A Matrix homeserver written in Rust <a href="https://conduit.rs">https://conduit.rs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I spent some time improving Riot support. Now there should be a lot less warnings and some new features: typing events, read receipts, better room directory, invites, user search.</p>
<p>The only bigger bug that exists currently is that the message history is not automatically loaded when you join a room.  Sometimes reloading the page helps, but not always. The reason for that is that Riot calls the deprecated /initialSync endpoint, which I do not support (I hope someone works on Riot to fix that).</p>
<p>In the next few weeks I plan to improve the single-homeserver experience further and add permission management, while also working on federation.</p>
<p>Check out the repository on <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit">https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit</a> and our Matrix room on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:koesters.xyz">#conduit:koesters.xyz</a>. If you want to try out the server yourself, you can try to connect to it using <a href="https://riot.nordgedanken.de/#/register">https://riot.nordgedanken.de/#/register</a> (though it might be offline when you read this).</p>
<p>I also want to thank my supporters on <a href="https://liberapay.com/timokoesters">Liberapay</a> for their kindness üòä.</p>

<p>I tested the performance of Conduit yesterday by running a ruma client that sends a /send request in a for loop 10k times, which took ~46.8 seconds (all locally on my pc). This means the server can handle ~210 /sends per second under these circumstances.</p>

<p>The flamegraph shows what the cpu is spending most of its time doing. Plateaus are things that take time. You can see most of the time is used for a function in sled::io (I spoke with one of the devs and they said this is expected, but will be improved in the next release)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We continue to focus on performance and spent a good chunk of time improving worker replication test coverage to build confidence that our upcoming changes will work as expected. Erik has been working on how to how to factor out cache invalidation which is now starting to take good shape. Once we have that, factoring out things like event persistence are next on the horizon. </p>
<p>Aside from that we‚Äôve been working with the Riot client teams as they near release for cross signing, fixing bugs and improving performance on key actions.</p>
<p>SSO support continues to improve, and more fixes for user inactive auth for worker'd installs will land next week. Poor old Rich has been banging his head against a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7206">sync bug</a> blocking develop, but hopefully he has broken its back now, and we'll get that merged asap.</p>
<p>Finally we experienced some operational issues with push over the weekend, so we spent some time cleaning up and figuring out how to make things more resilient. </p>
<p>Coming up, performance, cross signing support, SSO improvements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update from Jason:</strong></p>
<p>The Construct server made significant progress this week with end-to-end encryption, client compatibility, application services support, and build-related enhancements. I'd like to thank <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@yan:yetanothernerd.xyz">Yan Minari</a> for contributing spec-compliant code paths for application services in the user registration system. Special thanks this week to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@qy:cs.xa0.uk">Tony O.</a> for continued work on the NixOS (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nix:matrix.org">#nix:matrix.org</a>) derivation for reproducible builds, in addition to contributing fixes to Nio for optimal compatibility with Construct. I'd also like to thank <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@weebl:matrix.weebl.me">Wessel</a> for contributing a much needed reorganization of the Dockerfiles in preparation for Construct operating on many more platforms. Many thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> for working with the team this week in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net">#test:zemos.net</a> on various compatibility fixes to mtxclient and Nheko; the responsiveness when using Nheko with Construct is mind-blowing. I'd also like to thank <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@david:vovo.id.au">David Vo (a.k.a. auscompgeek)</a> for also contributing to Nio toward Construct compatibility.</p>
<p>Finally, I owe much appreciation to tulir, jochen, qy and others for setting up brand new installations this week and providing feedback in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net">#test:zemos.net</a>. Construct is the first and only federating alternative to Synapse. It is written in C++ for maximum performance, the lowest possible TCO, and designed for horizontal scaling with Construct Cluster. If you are interested in starting a low-cost Matrix hosting service, Construct may be your ideal choice.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, this week has been busy for us over in bridge corner. We've released:</p>
<h4 id="matrix-appservice-bridge-1-12-2"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/1.12.2">matrix-appservice-bridge 1.12.2</a></h4>
<p>Which includes a bunch of small fixes, including a performance improvement to <code>StateLookup</code> hits. Apparently it's bad to hit the homeserver with 1000s of concurrent /state requests on startup. <strong>Most importantly</strong> it also includes a critical fix to the <code>addAppServicePath</code> function, which previously did not authenticate requests, see the CHANGELOG for more information on that.</p>
<h4 id="matrix-appservice-irc-0-17-0-rc3"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.17.0-rc3">matrix-appservice-irc 0.17.0-rc3</a></h4>
<p>We're still working on the RCs for this release, having discovered and fixed a bunch of failures that can happen around getting connected to IRC. Be aware that the above security fix is applied in this release, which means provisioning requests will now be authenticated.</p>
<h4 id="matrix-appservice-slack-1-2-0-rc1"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/1.2.0-rc1">matrix-appservice-slack 1.2.0-rc1</a></h4>
<p>This is another big load of bug fixes, with many thanks to our new bridge crew member, Christian!. This release includes the above security fixes, as well as some metrics improvements to track activity on the bridge.</p>
<h4 id="matrix-appservice-gitter-0-1-1"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter/releases/tag/0.1.1">matrix-appservice-gitter 0.1.1</a></h4>

<p>WIP Command line Matrix client using matrix-rust-sdk</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@devinr528:matrix.org">devinr528</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A clickable command-line client Matrix written in Rust. Although, still in the early stages, enough has been implemented to show a working demo. <code>rumatui</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs">tui</a> to power the UI and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk">matrix-rust-sdk</a> for all communication with the server. So far the message formatting has been the most visually satisfying feature, although implementing it was not much fun. The goal of the project is to have a UI driven command-line client, useable from either keyboard and/or mouse.</p>
<p>Big thanks to @poljar for allowing me to work on matrix-rust-sdk, @jplatte for the opportunity to work with the <a href="https://github.com/ruma">ruma</a> crates and everyone in the Matrix community for being so helpful!</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://github.com/DevinR528/RumaTui">https://github.com/DevinR528/RumaTui</a>! Help is welcome, although as <code>matrix-rust-sdk</code> develops the design and structure of <code>rumatui</code> will evolve quickly.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko is preparing for the 0.7.0 release! You can find the first release candidate here: <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases/tag/v0.7.0-rc1">https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases/tag/v0.7.0-rc1</a></p>
<p>0.7.0 will contain a lot of work, including replies, e2ee attachments and a completely rewritten timeline (the full changelog is too big for TWIM, but you can find it in the github releases). It also fixes a lot of issues. We should probably released it a lot earlier, but we always had one more feature we wanted to finish... For the future we plan to do smaller, more regular releases!</p>
<p>If you want to see Nheko translated to your language, you can translate it here: <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/engage/nheko/">https://weblate.nheko.im/engage/nheko/</a></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-api/releases/tag/0.15.1">ruma-api 0.15.1</a> was released with a small bugfix</p>

<li>
<p>before, we would parse the server name into a <code>url::Host</code></p>

<p>We've been doing Matrix editions of <a href="https://twitter.com/Emily_Rosina">Emily Cook</a>'s Doctor Who watchalongs since confinement started around Europe. The concept is pretty simple: on a given day, at a given time, everyone presses play on the same episode. Folks are then free to then watch it on their own, or discuss the episode as they watch it in the Matrix room and/or in the Jitsi call.

<h2 id="final-thoughts-thought-balloon">Final Thoughts üí≠</h2>
<p>While discussing the use of QML in Nheko, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aa13q:matrix.org">aa13q</a> became extremely energised, so I'm including this piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Qt/QML fanboy here, feel free to skip, just a love letter to the framework :D</p>
<p>Qt/QML is super-awesome, it's hard to describe how pretty declarative syntax is and how beautiful MVC approach with native Qt C++ side integration %) It is very hard to contribute to HTML/CSS/JS projects when you have seen QML once.</p>
<p>Talking about resources, there are even projects for very low-level embedded boards with arm cortex m7 core [1,2]</p>
<p>I'm actually thinking Qt is the bright future of very wide development areas. I'm both frightened and intrigued looking at relatively low popularity of the project. Since I want it to live and prosper even more but afraid of the possible mistakes for even harder tasks. The better popularity of the project will be harder to coordinate and the future tasks will be even harder. Similar to other cool projects (like matrix! :) I guess it's very challenging to balance between running as hard as you can and not to &quot;die&quot; from exhaustion %)</p>
<p>I don't even know is there something similar comparing to the Qt project, that's also why I'm worried about the future of the project %) </p>
<p>So-called software crisis (the late 60s ‚Äì mid-80s [3,4]) was successfully overcome by introducing Object-Oriented Programming (it's always funny to see some people who are more into functional programming hates OOP in that context [5]) And notably Alan Kay is not only OOP pioneer (Smalltalk language) but also a first GUI applications developer. While the current OOP languages like Java and C++ are quite imperative, OOP is not only about the objects but also about the messages between them (Smalltalk is probably a nice example here too).</p>
<p>Qt in that context restores interesting balance to quite imperative C++ introducing the so-called meta-object system (for the messaging between objects). After that in ~Qt5, the declarative QML approach was introduced to develop these ideas even more. Not only GUI subject matter could be expressed with QML (like Qt Quick), but the others too (for example, QBS build system).</p>
<p>Sorry for typos and poor style, not a native speaker :) And I could be wrong in my views.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week was really successful for the homeserver project. Not only does event sending and syncing work properly, but creating/joining rooms, state events and the public room directory works as well.  But the biggest archievement I made this week is Riot support.</p>
<p>Big thanks to MTRNord for fixing bugs in Riot web and deploying an instance of Riot with all patches applied and to jplatte and @iinuwa for improving the ruma libraries.</p>
<p>Today we did the first actual test of the new homeserver. We had ~5 people sending and syncing messages in a room and all of them were able to send messages almost instantly. We'll see how well that scales when we implement federation in the future.</p>
<p>Check out the repository on <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit">https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit</a> and our Matrix room on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:koesters.xyz">#conduit:koesters.xyz</a>.

<p>Aside from that we continue to improve the SSO experience, landing UIA support for CAS providers. We also made a small change to the default behaviour so that only room admins can enable e2ee (applies to new rooms only).</p>
<p>Next week, is more of the same. Expect a few short term performance improvements (specifically to help with cross signing UX) and more SSO support.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks there's been huge increase in interest from folks
wanting the security and autonomy of running their remote collaboration
services, rather than being at the mercy of traditional proprietary
centralised apps.  Meanwhile, the Matrix.org homeserver has been very
overloaded (although we're at last making excellent progress in radically
improving Synapse's performance) - so it's particularly important right now to
help folks run their own servers.</p>
<p>Therefore we're very happy to announce that it's easier than ever before now to
self-host your own video conferencing alongside Riot &amp; Synapse: as of Riot/Web
1.5.15 (released last week), it's now a single config option to point Riot at
a specific Jitsi rather than needing to hook up to an integration manager!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over the last 18 months, it's got easier and easier to run your
own Matrix deployments: the Debian packages are unrecognisably better now, and
with <code>.well-known</code> URL support it's trivial to set up federation without
needing to worry about complicated DNS, TLS or load balancer configurations.</p>
<p>So, to try to show off just how smooth this has become, we thought we'd do a
run-through video showing installing Synapse, Riot &amp; Jitsi on a completely
fresh Debian install.  It's (almost) filmed in a single shot, and takes about
20 minutes from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Please note that this does assume you're pretty familiar with Linux system
administration.  If you're not, then we'd recommend using a Matrix hosting
provider such as <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a> (which directly supports development of the core team),
<a href="https://ungleich.ch/u/products/hosted-matrix-chat/">Ungleich.ch</a>, or <a href="https://startupstack.tech/">StartupStack</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, while the video shows how to install on Debian via Debian packages,
there are many many other environments and architectures (e.g. installing
under Docker) - this is just one relatively easy way to skin the cat.  Perhaps
there will be other 'speed-run' videos in future :)</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dDddKmdLEdg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>If you want to follow along at home without listening to the video (and I can't blame you if you do ;) the high level steps are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="debian-dns">Debian &amp; DNS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Take one fresh Debian 10 install.</li>
<li>Point the DNS for your domain to it.  You should use separate subdomains for the various services as a hygiene measure to make cross-site scripting attacks less effective.  In this example, we set up DNS for:
<ul>
<li><code>dangerousdemos.net</code> (general website, and for hosting a .well-known path to advertise the Matrix service)</li>
<li><code>matrix.dangerousdemos.net</code> (Synapse)</li>
<li><code>riot.dangerousdemos.net</code> (Riot/Web)</li>
<li><code>jitsi.dangerousdemos.net</code> (Jitsi video conferencing)</li>
<li>In practice, we used a <code>*.dangerousdemos.net</code> wildcard DNS record for the three subdomains in this instance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nginx-and-letsencrypt">Nginx and LetsEncrypt</h3>
<ul>
<li>Install nginx as a webserver: <code>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt -y install nginx</code></li>
<li>Go to <code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled</code> and copy the vhost configuration block from the bottom of <code>default</code> to new files called <code>dangerousdemos.net</code>, <code>matrix.dangerousdemos.net</code>, and <code>riot.dangerousdemos.net</code>.  We don't set up <code>jitsi.dangerousdemos.net</code> at this point as the jitsi installer handles it for us.
<ul>
<li>Rename the <code>server_name</code> field in the new files to match the hostname of each host, and point <code>root</code> to an appropriate location per domain (e.g. <code>/var/www/dangerousdemos.net</code> for the main domain, or <code>/var/www/riot.dangerousdemos.net/riot</code> for riot)</li>
<li>For the Synapse domain (<code>matrix.dangerousdemos.net</code> here), you should replace the contents of the <code>location</code> block with <code>proxy_pass http://localhost:8008;</code> - telling nginx to pass the traffic through to synapse, which listens by default for plaintext HTTP traffic on port 8008.  (N.B. do <strong>not</strong> put a trailing slash on the URL here, otherwise nginx will mangle the forwarded URLs.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enable TLS via LetsEncrypt on nginx, by: <code>apt install -y python3-certbot-nginx &amp;&amp; certbot --nginx -d dangerousdemos.net -d riot.dangerousdemos.net -d matrix.dangerousdemos.net</code> (or whatever your domains are).</li>
<li>You should be able to go to https://dangerousdemos.net at this point and see a page with valid HTTPS.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<ul>
<li>Then, install Synapse via Debian packages using the instructions at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md#debianubuntu (see below).  If you're not on Debian, keep an eye out for all the other OSes we support too!
<ul>
<li>You should specify the server name to be the domain you want in your matrix IDs - i.e. <code>dangerousdemos.net</code> in this example.</li>
<li>Please report anonymous aggregate stats to us so we can gauge uptake and help justify funding for Matrix!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>sudo apt install -y lsb-release wget apt-transport-https
</span><span>sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/matrix-org-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.matrix.org/debian/matrix-org-archive-keyring.gpg
</span><span>echo &quot;deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/matrix-org-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.matrix.org/debian/ $(lsb_release -cs) main&quot; |
</span><span>    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list
</span><span>sudo apt update
</span><span>sudo apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You should now be able to go to https://matrix.dangerousdemos.net and see a valid &quot;It works! Synapse is running&quot; page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, you should enable registration on your synapse by switching <code>enable_registration: true</code> in <code>/etc/matrix-synapse/homeserver.yaml</code> and restarting synapse via <code>systemctl restart matrix-synapse</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you need to tell the rest of Matrix how to find your server.  The easiest way to do this is to publish a file at https://dangerousdemos.net/.well-known/matrix/server which tells everyone the hostname and port where they can find the synapse for dangerousdemos.net - in this instance, it's <code>matrix.dangerousdemos.net:443</code>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>mkdir -p /var/www/dangerousdemos.net/.well-known/matrix
</span><span>cd /var/www/dangerousdemos.net/.well-known/matrix
</span><span>echo &#39;{ &quot;m.server&quot;: &quot;matrix.dangerousdemos.net:443&quot; }&#39; &gt; server
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternatively</strong>, you could advertise the server via DNS, if you don't have write access to <code>/.well-known</code> on your main domain.  However, to prove you are allowed to host the Matrix traffic for dangerousdemos.net, you would have to configure nginx to use the dangerousdemos.net TLS certificate for the matrix.dangerousdemos.net vhost (i.e. the &quot;wrong&quot; one), and in general we think that <code>/.well-known</code> is much easier to reason about.  In this case you would advertise the server with an SRV record like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>_matrix._tcp.dangerousdemos.net. 300    IN  SRV 10 5 443 matrix.dangerousdemos.net.
</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="riot-web">Riot/Web</h3>
<ul>
<li>Then, install Riot/Web.  Grab the latest .tgz release from https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases.  You should check its GnuPG signature too:</li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>mkdir /var/www/riot.dangerousdemos.net
</span><span>cd /var/www/riot.dangerousdemos.net
</span><span>wget https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases/download/v1.5.15/riot-v1.5.15.tar.gz
</span><span>
</span><span># check its GnuPG signature (particularly advisable, given Riot is what stores
</span><span># your end-to-end encryption keys)
</span><span>apt install -y gnupg
</span><span>wget https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases/download/v1.5.15/riot-v1.5.15.tar.gz.asc
</span><span>
</span><span># grab the signing key for the riot releases repository, ideally from a keyserver...
</span><span>gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --search-keys releases@riot.im
</span><span>
</span><span># ...and/or you can grab or cross-check the signing key from packages.riot.im
</span><span>wget https://packages.riot.im/riot-release-key.asc
</span><span>gpg --import riot-release-key.asc
</span><span>
</span><span>gpg --verify riot-v1.5.15.tar.gz.asc
</span><span># hopefully this will report &quot;Good signature&quot;, even though it won&#39;t know to trust the riot release key.
</span><span>
</span><span># you could also choose to explicitly trust the key by editing it, entering &#39;trust&#39; and then &#39;5&#39; for ultimate trust.
</span><span>gpg --edit-key 74692659bda3d940
</span><span>
</span><span>tar -xzvf riot-v1.5.15.tar.gz
</span><span>ln -s riot-v1.5.15 riot
</span><span>chown www-data:www-data -R riot
</span><span>cd riot
</span><span>cp config.sample.json config.json
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>You then tweak the <code>config.json</code> to change the <code>base_url</code> of the homeserver to be <code>https://matrix.dangerousdemos.net</code> (i.e. where to find the Client Server API for your server), and change the <code>server_name</code> to be <code>dangerousdemos.net</code> (i.e. the name of your server).</li>
<li>You should then be able to go to https://riot.dangerousdemos.net, register for an account, sign in, and talk to the rest of Matrix!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jitsi">Jitsi</h3>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we install Jitsi so you can run your own video conferencing.  We take the instructions from <a href="https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/quick-install.md">Jitsi's quick install guide</a>:</li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>echo &#39;deb https://download.jitsi.org stable/&#39; &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list
</span><span>wget -qO -  https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
</span><span>apt-get update
</span><span>apt-get -y install jitsi-meet
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We give the installer the hostname <code>jitsi.dangerousdemos.net</code>.  <strong>Make sure this DNS is already set up, otherwise the installer will fail!</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The installer magically detects you have nginx installed and adds in an appropriate vhost!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We select a self-signed certificate for now, and then upgrade it to LetsEncrypt after the fact with <code>/usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, you could have specified manual certificates, and then used <code>certbot</code> alongside the rest of nginx to create a certificate for <code>jitsi.dangerousdemos.net</code> - both work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should now be able to go to https://jitsi.dangerousdemos.net and use the Jitsi directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, and this is the cool new bit: you can now point Riot to use the new Jitsi by going to its config.json at <code>/var/www/riot.dangerousdemos.net/riot/config.json</code> and changing the <code>preferredDomain</code> of the <code>jitsi</code> block from <code>https://jitsi.riot.im</code> to your own self-hosted <code>https://jitsi.dangerousdemos.net</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You then refresh your Riot/Web, and you should be all set to use Jitsi from within your new Riot - as Riot/Web 1.5.15 and later has the ability to natively embed Jitsi straight into the app without needing to use an integration manager.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Matrix nowadays provides an excellent alternative to the centralised solutions.  It gives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full autonomy over how to host and store your own conversations</li>
<li>Full freedom to talk to anyone else on the wider global Matrix network (or indeed anyone else bridged into Matrix)</li>
<li>Full privacy via full end-to-end-encryption for chats, file transfer and 1:1 voice/video calls (when enabled)</li>
<li>Full transparency by being 100% open source (as well as benefiting from the overall open source community)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this gives some confidence that it's pretty easy to run your own fully functional Matrix instance these days.
If not, then hopefully someone will do a similar one to show off Docker!
And if that's still too scary, please take a look at a hosting services like <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a>.</p>

<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p>Update from Jason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>End-to-end encryption support has landed in Construct. The server now supports cross-signing, secret storage, and key backups for clients. I'm pleased with how this all came together on schedule for the upcoming transition to e2ee by default for Matrix. If you haven't been paying attention in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> last week full support for push-rules including efficient highlight-counting also landed. Next week Application Service support is scheduled.</p>
<p>Construct is quickly nearing complete coverage over the full breadth of the Matrix protocol, and the transition into release packaging is fast approaching. Construct is the C++ homeserver built for maximum performance with the lowest possible cost of ownership. If you're in need of a faster homeserver please show your support in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> and tell all your friends to lend a hand today!</p>

<h3 id="new-rust-homeserver">New Rust Homeserver</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! This week I worked on a Matrix homeserver written in Rust. Registering and logging in works already and I am currently adding support for sending events and inserting them into the event graph. I spent most of my time reading the Matrix specification to understand how this process works, because with federation (which I plan to add to my homeserver in the future) servers might disagree on which event was created first and there are strictly defined rules to resolve this. The Matrix homeserver uses the Ruma libraries as it's base and handles requests and responses using the Rocket crate. I use sled to store information as (key, value) pairs in a database. Most of these libraries are still experimental and I take this attitude myself by straying off from the reference implementations and changing algorithms in hopes of better performance.

<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-asmux">mautrix-asmux</a> wasn't made this week, but I haven't mentioned it on TWIM before. Basically, it acts as a proxy between appservices and the homeserver. The primary point is to make it possible to dynamically provision appservices.</p>
<p>The dynamically provisioned appservices connect to mautrix-asmux with individual access tokens, which asmux checks and then proxies the requests to Synapse with its own global access token. Synapse is only aware of one appservice, which will have a large user ID and alias namespace (e.g. everything starting with <code>_</code>). In the other direction, mautrix-asmux maintains a room ID -&gt; appservice mapping, which it uses to send incoming events to the correct appservice. As a side effect, mautrix-asmux implements <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2190">MSC2190</a>, which is needed for end-to-bridge encryption.</p>

<p>mautrix-telegram now has experimental support for end-to-bridge encryption. It's intended for cases where you don't want the homeserver to have access to messages, e.g. user-hostable appservices. It's currently on the <code>e2be</code> branch and should be merged to master soon. You can find setup instructions on the wiki: <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram/wiki/End%E2%80%90to%E2%80%90bridge-encryption">https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram/wiki/End‚Äêto‚Äêbridge-encryption</a></p>

<p>I got annoyed by how difficult plumbing IRC rooms is and wrote a simple Python script to do it more easily from command line. Also cleaning old rooms and chats in Riot is quite tedious so I added support for easily leaving rooms to the script.

It's still in infancy but more features are already planned such as more IRC management stuff and creating tombstone events to point rooms to other rooms. The tool uses Python and matrix-nio library.

I've started working on a new project called <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/node-jitsi">node-jitsi</a>, which will allow people to connect their services to Jitsi Meet conferences. It's designed to allow bridges to start bridging across actual calls into Matrix via Jitsi, but could really be used by any project which is Node.JS based and wants Jitsi call functionality. The goal is to keep the interface clean and simple, and do all of the heavy lifting (WebRTC negotiations, XMPP handling) itself.</p>

<p>We released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/03/23/synapse-1-12-0-released">1.12.0</a> this week which contains some decent performance wins. Our theme for the moment is to continue working on performance, and the sharding project is starting to make some real progress. Hopefully we get onto breaking out event persistence next week.</p>
<p>Aside from that you'll see a lot of work to improve SSO support, in particular the ability for SSO and User Interactive Auth to work together is just around the corner. </p>
<p>Sorry for all the matrix.org slowness, we're doing everything we can!</p>

<ul>
<li>The image overlay you get, when you click on an image, should now stay out of your way, when downloading an image (adasauce)</li>
<li>Nheko now shouldn't show a console on launch on Windows anymore (abma)</li>
<li>Typing notifications now won't sanitize users twice. This shouldn't increase Corona infections, just make special characters like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&amp;</code> show up correctly, so you can put more <code>&lt;3</code> into your names. (Emi)</li>
<li>A lot of edge cases, where avatars didn't show up correctly were fixed. One issue with dynamic thumbnailing and synapse is still waiting for a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7124">synapse pr</a> to be merged.</li>
<li>If you restart your server, Nheko should now use less CPU in the time the server is down. It may take a bit longer to reconnect though.</li>

<p>It also has a locale system. You can set locales with <code>!reminder locale &lt;list of locales&gt;</code>. The system is fairly simple: it just tries to parse the input with each locale in the order specified and uses the first match.

            <p>Synapse 1.12.0 is here.</p>
<p>The most important reason to upgrade to 1.12.0 is that it contains performance improvements to boost the efficiency of state resolution in room versions greater than v1 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7095">#7095</a>).</p>
<p>It also contains an implementation of (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2432">MSC2432</a>) designed to limit room alias abuse. The MSC contains the full details, but in short admins now have more control over aliases as they appear on their local server.</p>
<p>There is also plenty of ground work for our master process sharding project. Nothing that can be used today unfortunately, but expect big improvements for worker based deployments over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Please pay special attention to the security advisory in the changelog, TL;DR make sure your installation is using Twisted 20.3.0.</p>
<p>Also, note that once Synapse 1.13.0 is released, the default branch will change to being <code>develop</code> rather than <code>master</code>. Again more details follow in the changelog.</p>
<p>Get the new release from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.12.0">github</a> or any of the sources mentioned at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md.</p>
<p>Changelog since Synapse 1.11.1</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-12-0-2020-03-23">Synapse 1.12.0 (2020-03-23)</h1>
<p>No significant changes since 1.12.0rc1.</p>
<p>Debian packages and Docker images are rebuilt using the latest versions of
dependency libraries, including Twisted 20.3.0. <strong>Please see security advisory
below</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="security-advisory">Security advisory</h2>
<p>Synapse may be vulnerable to request-smuggling attacks when it is used with a
reverse-proxy. The vulnerabilities are fixed in Twisted 20.3.0, and are
described in
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10108">CVE-2020-10108</a>
and
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10109">CVE-2020-10109</a>.
For a good introduction to this class of request-smuggling attacks, see
https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn.</p>
<p>We are not aware of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild, and
do not believe that they are exploitable with current versions of any reverse
proxies. Nevertheless, we recommend that all Synapse administrators ensure that
they have the latest versions of the Twisted library to ensure that their
installation remains secure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrators using the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixdotorg/synapse/"><code>matrix.org</code> Docker
image</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md#matrixorg-packages">Debian/Ubuntu
packages from
<code>matrix.org</code></a>
should ensure that they have version 1.12.0 installed: these images include
Twisted 20.3.0.</li>
<li>Administrators who have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md#installing-from-source">installed Synapse from
source</a>
should upgrade Twisted within their virtualenv by running:<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span>&lt;path_to_virtualenv&gt;/bin/pip install </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&#39;Twisted&gt;=20.3.0&#39;
</span></code></pre>
</li>
<li>Administrators who have installed Synapse from distribution packages should
consult the information from their distributions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>matrix.org</code> Synapse instance was not vulnerable to these vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2 id="advance-notice-of-change-to-the-default-git-branch-for-synapse">Advance notice of change to the default <code>git</code> branch for Synapse</h2>
<p>Currently, the default <code>git</code> branch for Synapse is <code>master</code>, which tracks the
latest release.</p>
<p>After the release of Synapse 1.13.0, we intend to change this default to
<code>develop</code>, which is the development tip. This is more consistent with common
practice and modern <code>git</code> usage.</p>
<p>Although we try to keep <code>develop</code> in a stable state, there may be occasions
where regressions creep in. Developers and distributors who have scripts which
run builds using the default branch of <code>Synapse</code> should therefore consider
pinning their scripts to <code>master</code>.</p>

<p>Aside from that we had some problems with push reliability, this should now be fixed. Sorry if you were bitten!</p>
<p>We also put out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.12.0rc1">1.12.0rc1</a> expect a full release early next week.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-bridge">mx-puppet-bridge</a> is a general bridging library that supports (double)bridging and relays.

<li>more tests</li>
<li>unified namespaces!</li>
</ul>
<p>Unified namespaces is a big update! This means that, if the remote protocol has globally unique IDs (e.g. as discord has the case) it will only create one room on matrix for any amount of puppets. Combining this with the advanced relay option, this means that protocol implementations (e.g. discord) now can act like a normal relay bridge only with super awesome puppeting! As in, the for the puppets, the DMs work and channels&amp;guilds that the relay bot is not in. All this is possible without any changes to the protocol implementation, should the protocol have unique global IDs.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emi added a new sorting method to the room list, that keeps rooms with unread messages on top, even when the messages are older than the messages in silenced or read rooms. It makes the room list a lot nicer to use and after being skeptical at the start, I now use it on all my systems. Huge thanks to Emi for bearing with my long and confusing review!</p>

<ul>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts are more discoverable with a help popup that explains them</li>

<li>Self-hosted Riots can be configured to use a different Jitsi server if desired</li>
<li>Encrypted messages are faster to encrypt and send</li>
<li>The room directory server selector has been reworked and is much easier to use and understand</li>
<li>Many cross-signing polish fixes continue to land, hoping to ship cross-signing in a few weeks</li>
