<h3 id="p2p-dendrite">P2P/Dendrite</h3>
<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite has seen a number of improvements this week, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Backfill will now backfill more messages than before, resulting in a snappier experience when scrolling back in a room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite is now compliant with Synapse on backfill behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inline CS API filters will now honour the timeline <code>limit</code> value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making more Sytests pass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modifications to how Dendrite tracks memberships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Addition of an <code>-api</code> flag to expose internal HTTP APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clearer separation of internal/external HTTP APIs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This has culminated in the following values for Are We Synapse Yet:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>Client-Server APIs: 34% (227/672 tests) - up from 33%
</span><span>Federation APIs: 34% (35/103 tests) - up from 27%
</span></code></pre>
<p>As for P2P....</p>
<h4 id="p2p-riot-im-v0-1-0-released">p2p.riot.im v0.1.0 released!</h4>
<p>This is a significant milestone because we now persist Dendrite databases to IndexedDB, greatly improving UX and giving users a consistent identity on the P2P network. In addition to this, the following changes have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We now bake in the Dendrite commit SHA into the logs on startup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite will now restart itself in case of panics/segfaults.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues with this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Databases are only flushed to IndexedDB every 30 seconds, making it possible to lose the most recent messages. This has a variety of effects on the Dendrite instance, but in testing it has been able to mostly gracefully recover. Messages that you have sent will be backfilled but will be redacted. Rooms you have joined will be forgotten, and you need to be kicked/re-invited/re-join for communication to be re-established. We're looking into a better flushing mechanism going forwards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have previously visited p2p.riot.im, you <strong>MUST</strong> manually clear your service worker via <code>chrome:serviceworker-internals</code> or <code>about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox</code> or else you might get errors such as &quot;LinkError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): memory import 37 has no maximum limit, expected at most 4294967295&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please <strong>do not rely</strong> on p2p.riot.im to have any form of stability. Patch version bumps (0.1.0 -&gt; 0.1.1) will not remove databases but minor version bumps will (0.1.1 -&gt; 0.2.0) so we can continue to progress with Dendrite development at speed.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lkito has been contributing this week to Nheko as part of his homework for university or so? Anyway, he added an option to highlight whatever message you are currently hovering over, so that you have an easier time locating the proper timestamps and buttons for that specific message. He's now working through a few other issues to improve his coding skills, like optionally having big emojis in the timeline or showing tooltips to explain the settings Nheko has.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now set a /roomnick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now tag rooms using the room context menu. You can assign multiple tags and create new tags as you like. This helps organizing your rooms, since Nheko supported filtering you room list using tags for a few years already, but until now you couldn't assign them.</p>

<p>This week, we worked on <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-serde/pull/5">support for endpoints with multiple values for one query parameter</a> (in a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/624060294">livestream</a>), <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-federation-api/pull/3">federation endpoints for joining rooms</a> and the next revision of ruma-events [<a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/87">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/88">2</a>] (that will, once finished, allow us to finally support redacted events properly, amongst other things). We also fixed two <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-client-api/issues/170">small</a> <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-client-api/issues/171">bugs</a> in ruma-client-api.

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We‚Äôre very excited indeed to announce that <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, the creators of <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>, are jumping head first into the Matrix ecosystem with a strategic investment of almost $5M into <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a> (the company which makes <a href="https://riot.im">Riot</a> and <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a>, founded by the core Matrix team in 2017).  More importantly, Matt Mullenweg (co-founder of WordPress and founder of Automattic) and the Automattic gang are committing to make the most of Matrix in their work going forwards!</p>
<p>This is huge news, not least because WordPress literally runs over 36% of the websites on today‚Äôs web - and the potential of bringing Matrix to all those users is incredible.  Imagine if every WP site automatically came with its own Matrix room or community?  Imagine if all content in WP automatically was published into Matrix as well as the Web?  (This isn‚Äôt so far fetched an idea - turns out that Automattic already runs a XMPP bridge for wordpress.com over at <a href="https://im.wordpress.com">im.wordpress.com</a>!).  Imagine there was an excellent Matrix client available as a WordPress plugin for embedding realtime chat into your site? Imagine if <a href="https://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> (which is part of Automattic these days) became decentralised!?</p>
<p>In fact, if you‚Äôre a developer in either the Matrix or WordPress communities, now might be a good time to think about how to cross the streams.... not least because Automattic just opened up a role for a <a href="https://automattic.com/work-with-us/matrix-integrations-engineer/">Matrix.org/WordPress Integrations Engineer</a>! Quite aside from the investment, this shows Automattic is serious about Matrix - and we‚Äôd like to thank them for opening up jobs in these challenging times to further accelerate Matrix.  Perhaps some day Matrix Engineer will be as common a career choice as Web Developer ;)</p>
<p>That said, it‚Äôs super early days for integration work, and there isn‚Äôt a concrete project to announce yet beyond the investment in New Vector (which is effectively an extension of the funding NV raised in October) and Automattic‚Äôs Job opening - but these are the sort of ideas we‚Äôve been kicking around. And at the very least, we should expect to see Automattic‚Äôs communities migrating over to Matrix in the coming months.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs been loads of fun working with Matt and the team on this: we see a huge overlap in terms of a genuine love for the open web, open source and open standards.  It‚Äôs also no coincidence that Matt (independently of Automattic) donated substantially to Matrix via Patreon back in 2017 when we needed it the most.  We‚Äôre also looking forward to benefiting from Automattic‚Äôs experience in sustainably and responsibly funding and growing open source projects in general - WordPress.com is an excellent example of how one can support development of a project like WordPress without compromising its open source nature.</p>
<p>So, we‚Äôd like to formally welcome WordPress and the rest of the Automattic family into Matrix.  It‚Äôs incredibly exciting times, and we can‚Äôt wait to see what will come of the partnership!  And meanwhile, if any other massive open source organisations want to join Automattic and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/12/19/welcoming-mozilla-to-matrix">Mozilla</a> in leaping into Matrix, you know where to find us‚Ä¶ :D</p>
<p>Huge thanks go to Matt for believing in Matrix - watch this space for updates.</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.13.0 is here and it's a whopper!</p>
<p>Highlights include new support for User Interactive Authentication (UIA) for Single Sign-on (SSO) installations. This means that for the first time features that require the user to re-authenticate are available for servers that authenticate by SSO. Notably this means that these servers now support cross signing!</p>
<p>SSO admins should take a look at the SSO notes in the changelog.</p>
<p>We have been working hard on performance for large scale installations. Anyone supporting more than a few thousand users is probably running Synapse in worker mode. This means splitting out functionality from the master process and making use of multiple cores (or machines) to spread the load. Cross process communication was previously handled by a home grown TCP based replication protocol. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve performance we have replaced this replication system with Redis and have been running Redis in production on matrix.org for the past 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Redis itself does not provide a significant performance win directly but it means that it is much less expensive to add new workers to a cluster. The topology of the old system meant that every additional worker carried a small but not insignificant overhead to the master process. Since moving to Redis we have doubled the number of workers backing matrix.org.</p>
<p>We still consider Redis to be experimental and admins should not feel obliged to upgrade. However it looks very promising and we are likely to deprecate the old replication system in future. So watch this space - Redis is the future.</p>
<p>Finally we've seen lots of improvements to our documentation and many thanks for those in the community making contributions in this area.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting for those of you contributing to Synapse that the <code>develop</code> branch is now the default. More details in the changelog, so take a look.</p>
<p>Get 1.13.0 from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.13.0">github</a> or any of the sources mentioned at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md.</p>
<p>Changelog since v1.12.4</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-13-0-2020-05-19">Synapse 1.13.0 (2020-05-19)</h1>
<p>This release brings some potential changes necessary for certain configurations of Synapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your Synapse is configured to use SSO and have a custom <code>sso_redirect_confirm_template_dir</code> configuration option set, you will need to duplicate the new <code>sso_auth_confirm.html</code>, <code>sso_auth_success.html</code> and <code>sso_account_deactivated.html</code> templates into that directory.</li>
<li>Synapse plugins using the <code>complete_sso_login</code> method of <code>synapse.module_api.ModuleApi</code> should instead switch to the async/await version, <code>complete_sso_login_async</code>, which includes additional checks. The former version is now deprecated.</li>
<li>A bug was introduced in Synapse 1.4.0 which could cause the room directory to be incomplete or empty if Synapse was upgraded directly from v1.2.1 or earlier, to versions between v1.4.0 and v1.12.x.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please review <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/UPGRADE.rst">UPGRADE.rst</a> for more details on these changes and for general upgrade guidance.</p>
<h2 id="notice-of-change-to-the-default-git-branch-for-synapse">Notice of change to the default <code>git</code> branch for Synapse</h2>
<p>With the release of Synapse 1.13.0, the default <code>git</code> branch for Synapse has changed to <code>develop</code>, which is the development tip. This is more consistent with common practice and modern <code>git</code> usage.</p>
<p>The <code>master</code> branch, which tracks the latest release, is still available. It is recommended that developers and distributors who have scripts which run builds using the default branch of Synapse should therefore consider pinning their scripts to <code>master</code>.</p>

<p>This week I worked on presence and end to end encryption, but they are not working yet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Valkum got sytest integration working! This means each time a new commit is pushed to a branch, CI automatically picks up on that and lets a lot of tests run on the homeserver - the same tests that synapse uses. Currently we have 8% of all tests positive on Conduit.</p>

<li>
<p>Some admin api improvements and additions</p>

<p>...as well as all the usual bug fixes and especially performance improvements. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.13.0/CHANGES.md">changelog</a> for the full details and please test if you can! A full release is expected early next week.</p>
<p>Speaking of next week: work will involve getting room version 6 ready to ship, alongside even more performance work - especially moving event processing off the master process (the code for which is already running successfully on Half-Shot's own homeserver)!</p>

<p>I got really bored in lockdown, as we all have. I stared at my TV, and it stared back at me. While it's definitely a privacy nightmare to start developing apps for these things, I couldn't help myself. I got stuck in, and secured myself a LG Developer Account.</p>
<p>The LG set of smart TVs use WebOS, as like the name suggests, runs apps in it's special variant of Chromium. I was lucky to be running a recent OS and had access to Chromium 53! And NodeJS 0.12!! Sarcasm aside, there are some very troubling versions of WebOS with much older versions of the browser, so I was happy to be developing against something with strong ES6 support. Despite the absolutely <a href="https://twitter.com/Half_Shot/status/1259471146308775943">awful</a> onboarding experience, the WebOS SDK itself was pretty good. <code>matrix-tv</code> was written to be a general large screen matrix client, so it talks to the TV's own libraries through an abstraction layer :)</p>
<p>Anyway, this client is the culmination of a lazy Sunday afternoon's work. It features very basic support for viewing a room, but I hope to expand it at some point. It  supports running in a web browser and the aforementioned OS, but support for more variants is easy to add. I'm looking into how to design for the large screen beyond making fonts bigger, because the unique constraints on memory and UI are fun challenge.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="what-is-jupybot">What is JupyBot</h4>
<p>The purpose of the bot is to provide a link with Jupyter kernels running either on your local computer or somewhere else on a server. You can access your kernels through the bot with the chat interface. The kernels will answer to your commands through the same interface.</p>
<p>Since this is still a proof of concepts, the number of features is limited (command line text, string and pictures are the only output formats supported. No widget, no funny javascript) and they are few safeguards against infinite loops and other entertaining bugs.</p>
<h4 id="todo">TODO</h4>
<p>This is right now just a proof of concept. We want to see if such a bot can be useful for people and how. What features would be interesting, what can be integrated in the present clients,... Therefore, in the short term, we want to focus on the possibility of easy testing for users and easy contributions for people who want to add their ideas. On the mid- and long term, a lot of ideas can be realized; it will depend on the feedback. These are just some examples. Short term:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>proper error catching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fallback for non supported Jupyter formats on riot.im (i.e. a lot)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>testing on termux on a tablet or smartphone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>solve the problem with nio-matrix and upload in chunks of images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dockerized version</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Middle term:</p>
<ul>
<li>use of opsdroid as a framework</li>
</ul>
<p>Longer term:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>local server integrated to locally command the bot service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make full use of jupyter capabilities with a client suited for it (for instance a Jupyterlab plugin)</p>

<p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> participants were announced last week. <strong><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696/">This year Matrix was assigned SIX students!</a></strong></p>
<p>This is the most students we've have taken on in a single year, made possible by Matrix now acting as an umbrella organisation for multiple projects - this year that's Ruma, Nheko and OpsDroid. There are also students working on projects from the core team: go-neb, matrix-js-sdk and matrix-ircd.</p>
<p>We received dozens of applications this year, which made narrowing our focus to six students difficult, but we are proud to announce:</p>
<p><strong>Devin Ragotzy</strong>, who has been involved with the Ruma project in the past, will work on <em><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4756651216732160">Ruma procedural macro refactoring and more</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Arnav Tiwari</strong> will work with Travis and myself to create <em><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5751467312414720">HTML Embeddable Matrix Chat Rooms</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Nikolaos Filippakis</strong> will work to support <em><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5910277670830080">E2E encryption for go-neb</a></em>. Kegan, one of the original go-neb authors is particularly excited about this one</p>
<p><strong>Brooks Karlik</strong> will update matrix-ircd: <em><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5911643604647936">Move matrix-ircd to async/await</a></em>. This will be a welcome upgrade for anyone using that project!</p>
<p><strong>Tyagdit</strong> will work with Cadair and the <a href="/blog/2020/05/01/this-week-in-matrix-2020-05-01">OpsDroid team</a> on <em><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6107552447725568">Enabling E2EE in Opsdroid Matrix Connector</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Chethan Reddy</strong>, last but not least, will work with Nico and the Nheko gang on <em><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6274781747347456">Adding Features in End-to-End encryption for Nheko-Reborn</a></em></p>
<p>Congratulations all, and also congratulations and thank you to the projects the students will be working on!</p>
<p>Find out all about <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696/">Matrix @ GSoC on Google's dedicated site</a>, and keep reading the Matrix blog where we'll have updates from the students.</p>
<hr />
<p>PS <strong>Alejandro Dom√≠nguez</strong> has a Matrix related project too: they'll be working under the GNOME organisation to <em><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6726209787920384">add Multi account support to Fractal</a></em>.</p>

<h3 id="dendrite-gomatrixserverlib">Dendrite / gomatrixserverlib</h3>
<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some of the work for <code>/get_missing_events</code> has been done now for filling gaps in the room DAG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation sender performance and parallelisation have been dramatically improved, which helps a lot in big rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retries, backoff and blacklisting have also been implemented in the federation sender to handle cases where remote homeservers are unavailable much more gracefully</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retrieving missing state when receiving incoming events over federation is a bit more robust now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating direct chats now works</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invites are mostly working now overall, both locally and over federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>RespState</code> and <code>RespStateJoin</code> have been fixed in gomatrixserverlib</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room joins and leaves are now handled by new code across the roomserver and federation server perform APIs, which reduces complexity significantly</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Redis live in production for m.org! We did not expect this to translate into a significant improvement in performance directly, but it means that we can add new workers without any extra overhead on the master process which has been <em>very</em> useful in supporting cross signing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing bugs leading to messages getting stuck at the bottom of the timeline as well as messages not making it to sync at all. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of improvements to deal with the extra load generated by cross signing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these changes will be available in v1.13.0 which should have a release candidate ready rsn.</p>
<p>Next week, we continue to work on sharding changes, further SSO support and ensuring that cross signing adoption is as smooth as possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnu_ponut:matrix.org">Gnuxie</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/cal-coop/architect">Architect</a> is a homeserver project written in <a href="https://common-lisp.net">Common Lisp</a>. We intend to create a high performance homeserver using the meta-programming features of Common Lisp to reduce the amount of redundant and timely code that needs to be written and maintained.</p>
<h4 id="architect-events">architect events</h4>
<p>I created a <a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/json-schema2">json-schema</a> library, to generate class definitions directly from the Matrix specification. These classes also have information attached to them to allow for serialisation, using a metaclass from <a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/json-clos">json-clos</a>.</p>
<p>This is done entirely dynamically without writing to source files. <a href="https://gitlab.com/cal-coop/architect/architect.events">The invocation</a> of json-schema that creates classes for the <code>client-server</code>, <code>server-server</code> and <code>application-service</code> protocols is only about 20 lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I definitely approve of separating out the event library and generating it from the spec - Ruma also has this approach.</p>
<h3 id="conduit">Conduit</h3>
<p>Conduit is a Matrix homeserver written in Rust <a href="https://conduit.rs">https://conduit.rs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I refactored most of the data handling code to make it both more efficient and easier to read. I started by splitting a file called &quot;data.rs&quot; into multiple smaller files that handle just one part of the database, like &quot;users.rs&quot;, &quot;rooms.rs&quot; or &quot;edus.rs&quot;. I continued improving the code by making methods return iterators instead of vectors and propagating errors instead of crashing directly. Lastly, I added a few comments here and there and made sure everything works.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, @Valkum experimented with CI and @MTRNord is working on FluffyChat Flutter support.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank my supporters on <a href="https://liberapay.com/timokoesters">Liberapay</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apart from some further speedups, we've been working on reactions. Nheko can now display them and sending them should be done soon too. We also fixed a few bugs, when people reported them and you can now select, who you want to reply to by using a keyboard shortcut (Alt+Arrow keys for now). We will probably release a new version once reactions are done.</p>

<p>We also released MatrixSDK 0.16.4 with the last version of AFNetworking. That means apps using the MatrixSDK should be able to publish to the App Store again. There is no more usage of <code>UIWebView</code>.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>As of today, Matrix is end-to-end encrypted <strong>by default</strong> for private conversations.</p>
<p>Three years have passed since we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last">first announced End-to-end Encryption in
Matrix</a>
and started to beta test it in Riot - and after an enormous amount of
polishing and refinement on its user experience, we are finally declaring it
out of beta and enabling it by default for all new private conversations in
Riot.  As Riot is currently the most common Matrix client, this means that
Matrix as a whole should now be considered end-to-end encrypted by default for
DMs and invite-only rooms.</p>
<p>Work on E2EE in Matrix has progressed in waves since we first shipped it - including:</p>
<ul>
<li>adding keysharing (letting you share encryption keys between your devices to improve reliability)</li>
<li>making Riot Web's encryption resilient to running concurrently in multiple tabs</li>
<li>adding online key backup (so you don't lose all your history if you lose all your devices)</li>
<li>making encryption resilient to restoring the app from a backup</li>
<li>adding interactive key verification via emoji to make the verification process easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, our goal was always to enable E2EE by default for all private rooms,
which means having feature parity between unencrypted and E2EE Matrix so that
we can enable encryption without <em>any</em> negative impact on usability.  The
high-level remaining items were significant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-signing: verifying your own logins so others don‚Äôt have to.</li>
<li>Adding QR codes for even better verification UX, to make cross-signing as painless as possible.</li>
<li>Replacing the old prototype UI for E2EE with final polished UI/UX.</li>
<li>Ability to support non-E2EE clients.</li>
<li>Ability to search encrypted rooms.</li>
<li>Ability to view file indexes in encrypted rooms.</li>
<li>Fixing the remaining ‚ÄúUnable to decrypt‚Äù errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the last few months the Riot team has been almost entirely focused on
implementing solutions to these items - and we're finally at the point where
the switch can be flipped and as of Riot Web/Desktop 1.6, Riot iOS 0.11.1 and
RiotX Android 0.19, all new private rooms will be encrypted by default;
completing the transition we began at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/matrix/">FOSDEM
2020</a> when we landed
cross-signing E2E-by-default in the development branches of Riot.</p>
<p><strong>For full details, please go check out the <a href="https://blog.riot.im/e2e-encryption-by-default-cross-signing-is-here/">massive deep dive over at the Riot
blog</a></strong> - also featuring all the other recent progress in Riot!</p>
<p>Heads up that encrypted traffic is slightly heavier on the server than
unencrypted (due to exchanging keys, verification traffic, and keybackup
traffic), and so there is a risk that the already-over-popular Matrix.org
server instance may feel a little hugged to death.  However, unprecedented
Synapse performance breakthroughs are on the horizon in the coming weeks which
will fix this - and, of course, you can (and should!) be using your own
instance anyway.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for helping us test encryption over the years and getting us
to this point: cross-signing provides a more secure way of tracking device
trust than almost any other comms system out there, and we hope that you'll
agree the improved UX has been worth the wait.</p>
<p>Next stop: Synapse performance, and rebuilding Riot's first time user experience!</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the Matrix Team.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over 3 million people from Telegram and Discord have now been brought into the Matrix universe through t2bot.io. Of those people, around 230 thousand are active each month and 15 thousand are dedicated users of the bridges daily.</p>
<p>While this is a huge milestone for t2bot.io,it underlines the importance of self-hosting: having a couple giant bridges is great for accessibility, though where possible it‚Äôs heavily encouraged that people self-host. Hosting the bridges yourself on your own homeserver gives you better control of what passes through your server, reduces your dependence on third parties like t2bot.io, and gives you better performance.</p>
<p>During peak periods, t2bot.io sees about 10 messages per second passing through it. Half of those messages are generated by the Telegram bridge alone. The other half is dealing with federation and the various other bridges and bots on t2bot.io. In terms of media, a new image is uploaded every 2 seconds, leading to 5.8 TB of media being stored. The database is 3 TB and holds 236 Million events - roughly 131 Million of which are sent by t2bot.io.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has used t2bot.io in the past 3 years - it‚Äôs been more successful than ever imagined. Here‚Äôs to another year and a bunch of self-hosting. :)</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôve spent time this week working with the Riot teams to tweak matrix.org performance for cross signing. We‚Äôve also fixed a few performance regressions ahead of next week's 1.13.0 release (which will be a big one, more details when it lands).</p>
<p>With any luck we‚Äôll have Redis in production on matrix.org next week, we don‚Äôt think this will give us a huge performance win, but there is certainly overhead in having so many workers using the previous replication streaming method.</p>
<p>Our sharding project continues, and Erik has been trying to move the event stream entirely away from the master process which in itself could be significant for overall perf once ready for production.</p>
<p>Aside from that we continue to improve SSO support and we have a really great community PR from <a href="https://github.com/sandhose">sandhose</a> that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7256">implements OpenID Connect support</a>. We are really looking forward to getting that merged. The admin API is also getting plenty of community love with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6881">awesome-manual</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pulls/dklimpel">dklimpel</a> leading the charge.</p>

<p><a href="https://maunium.net/go/gomuks">gomuks</a> is a terminal based Matrix client written in Go. <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">Source on GitHub</a></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gomuks now has experimental support for end-to-end encryption on the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks/tree/e2ee"><code>e2ee</code> branch</a>. It supports both text messages and media downloads. The majority of the work happened in mautrix-go (also on the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-go/tree/e2ee"><code>e2ee</code> branch</a>). This also means that mautrix-whatsapp will get support for end-to-bridge encryption in the near future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>RiotX will finally be an update of Riot-Android on the PlayStore and RiotX beta will then be removed from the PlayStore. We will implement everything to let users upgrade their application without being forced to log in again.</p>
<p>While we are finalizing cross-signing, quadS, bootstrap, etc. on RiotX, we have started studying and implementing the main missing features: identity server and related functionality (terms of service consent, invite by email, search in contact list, bind emails and phone numbers, etc.), integration manager (terms of service consent,widgets, send stickers), WebRTC audio and video calls, Jitsi conference integration, and other important missing features like UI and UX to invite people to a room, etc. We are also fighting an annoying bug related to the navigation inside a timeline.</p>
<p>It's also now possible to deactivate your account using RiotX.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that people can contribute to translate RiotX by using new dedicated <a href="https://translate.riot.im/projects/riot-android/">Weblate projects</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:pattle.im">Wilko</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole SDK has been refactored!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All data objects such as <code>MyUser</code>, <code>Room</code>, etc. are now immutable</p>

<li>
<p>Add <code>MoorStore</code>, which uses <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/moor">moor</a>

<p><code>LocalUser</code> has been renamed to <code>MyUser</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And a <em>lot</em> of other changes!</p>
<h4 id="how-it-works">How it works</h4>
<p>The user has a stream of <code>Update</code>s, <code>user.updates</code>. An <code>Update</code> contains the latest 'snapshot' of data associated with the user. It also contains a <code>delta</code> <code>MyUser</code>, where all properties are <code>null</code>, except those that are changed. For example, if a user started typing in a certain room, and we're syncing, there will be an <code>Update</code> in <code>user.updates</code>, where <code>delta</code> has 1 <code>Room</code> in <code>delta.rooms</code>, with only the room where the user started typing, reflected in <code>room.typingUserIds</code>. All other properties of the <code>Room</code> will be null. This is all assuming that this is the only change in the sync. If more happened, it will be reflected in <code>delta</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a bot to share Jitsi call URLs. The main objective is to allow people on the other side of bridges to get the URL for a jitsi call. When a jitsi widget is added to a room (v2 widget from riot-web) it will post a message with the plain jitsi URL. It also provides a !jitsi command which allows people to create a jitsi call with a custom URL, and if the bot has permission it will be added as a widget in the matrix room. It has a bunch of other config options you can tweak it with. The main thing you might find it useful for if you are not in a bridged room is you can use it to quickly add a jitsi widget for any conference URL. The bot can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/skill-jitsi/">https://github.com/Cadair/skill-jitsi/</a> and it uses the opsdroid framework. I have also hosted a version @jitsibot:cadair.com</p>

        <div>
            <p>On April 14th, the Spec Core Team conducted a long-overdue retrospective
about the things that were working in the
<a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">Matrix Spec Proposal process</a>,
and those that were not.</p>
<p>The most glaring item on the list was the sluggish pace that many Matrix
Spec Changes (MSCs) take throughout the proposal process, as well as the
general lack of activity from the Spec Core Team members on proposals that
have not yet started a Final Comment Period.</p>
<p>We deeply apologize for the frustration this has likely caused many MSC
authors, and want to shed some light on the reasoning behind it, and what we
plan to do to prevent leaving authors in the dark about why there may be no
Spec Core Team activity on their proposal.</p>
<h2 id="proposal-triaging">Proposal Triaging</h2>
<p>There are currently 136 open MSCs that have yet to undergo Final Comment
Period (FCP), 75 of which are marked as proposal-in-review, and 20 that have
a FCP proposed. Relative to the 65 MSCs that have ever been closed, this is a
lot of outstanding ideas, features and maintenance changes.</p>
<p>The Spec Core Team itself is made up of 8 members, each of which have
separate full-time jobs. All team members are well-placed to be on the team
given their wide breadth of knowledge across the Matrix ecosystem,
however the majority are some of the most busy pushing forward Matrix's
reference implementations - without which, Matrix will unquestionably fail.
This limits the amount of MSCs that the team can effectively work on at a
given time.</p>
<p>The team understands that there are MSCs that provide incredibly useful
features, such as
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2191">support for LaTeX in messages</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">the ability to &quot;knock&quot; on rooms</a>,
and would undoubtedly like to see them land at some point.</p>
<p>But there is also a large backlog of MSCs that provide even more fundamental
fixes and additions to the protocol that the team needs to prioritise. These
include things like
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2472">cross-signing devices</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">the communities rewrite</a> and
finally merging
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849">reactions and edits</a> into the spec.</p>
<p>While we announce what MSCs we're focusing on during a given week during
<a href="https://matrix.org/twim">TWIM</a>, it's not as clear which items we're looking
to pull from the backlog next. To help tackle this, and to help keep us
honest, we've begun putting each MSC into either &quot;feature&quot;, &quot;maintenance&quot;, or
&quot;core&quot; buckets. This materialises in the form of github tags, which can be
used to filter the list of MSCs like so:

For a given timespan, we‚Äôll pick a track and pull MSCs out of that category
when possible. More information about MSC categories are now detailed on
<a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals#categories">the proposals page</a>.</p>
<p>As for the next 6 to 12 months, we plan to work on items from the ‚Äúcore‚Äù
category. We need to get Matrix to a point where it can compete with other,
proprietary chat protocols and items in &quot;core&quot; are decidedly the proposals
that will take us the furthest in that direction. This doesn't mean we won't
occasionally look at an MSC in a different category, but it will heavily
influence our prioritisation.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>We'll try this approach out over the next few months and see how it goes. The
next Spec Core Team retro will occur in the middle of May, where we will
review the process once again.</p>
<p>For now, if you have any feedback please come and chat with us in

<p>Last week</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shipped <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/23/synapse-1-12-4-released">1.12.4</a> a patch release to fix some cross signing related bugs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redis support to replace our existing cross replication system, merged to develop. This is a precursor to the sharding project. We have a PR to support cache invalidation across workers which, once merged should make it relatively easy to pull off event persistence from the master process. Just removing event persistence could give some decent perf wins, but the prize is then splitting persistence to run across across multiple workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A final PR to support SSO for user interactive auth will merge imminently, thereby freeing up full cross signing support for worker installs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aside from that we‚Äôve been working on fixing a weird bug where rooms can end up with zero forward extremities and generally showing Sygnal some love. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upcoming</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Put Redis into production</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ship 1.13.0 which will contain Redis support as well as a host of SSO bug fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge our new caching config logic to give finer granularity on cache settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge cache invalidation and try to get events persistence running in its own worker.</p>
</li>

<p>This week I worked a lot on getting the first bit of federation working. My goal was to query the public room list of another server and forward it to a client.</p>
<p>This involved setting up a keypair to sign the json I send to the server and putting authorization headers into my requests. Most of the work is already done and <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/">https://federationtester.matrix.org/</a> reports it's all good.</p>

<p>Sadly there seems to be a problem with the signing, because other homeservers reject requests: <code>Unable to verify signature: &lt;class 'nacl.exceptions.BadSignatureError'&gt; Signature was forged or corrupt</code>. I'll continue to work on this in the next week(s).</p>

<li>
<p>Dendrite now uses a newer version of the Sarama library</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some caching has been added to the roomserver API for room versions, which should help quite a bit with performance over federation and handling transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auth checks for <code>/send_join</code> are now quite a bit more robust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed where the default state filter limited the amount of room state that was visible after a join</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gomatrixserverlib has quite a bit of new support for backfilling now, which will be wired into Dendrite soon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gomatrixserverlib has new primitives for v2 invite responses and <code>/get_missing_events</code> requests</p>
