<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@florian:dsn.tm.kit.edu">Florian</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/">We</a> published another scientific paper on Matrix, this time it is called <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3381991.3395399">Matrix Decomposition: Analysis of an Access Control Approach on Transaction-based DAGs without Finality</a>!
Its main topic is the question of how access control can work based on a structure that only provides a partial order on events and no consensus on the current state, i.e. the Matrix Event Graph. We found some concrete, non-critical security issues related to both incorrect specification  as well as divergent homeserver behaviour. While the last remaining mitigations found their way into Synapse 1.14.0, we provide ideas on structural solutions to avoid both problem classes in the future using formal verification.</p>
<p>The paper was published at the <a href="http://www.sacmat.org/2020/index.php">ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies(SACMAT)</a> last week.
My talk went well (üéâ), it was recording and is yet to be published by the conference.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has seen a lot of work put into fixing broken tests and refactoring parts of the codebase.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The media API has had quite a bit of attention this week and now media over federation works properly, as well as much better filename handling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new user API component is now responsible for user accounts, devices, access tokens and account data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server key API has been updated with more reliable validity checking and new tests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logging into Dendrite using Riot iOS is now supported thanks to some minor tweaks/fixes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>URL handling for version 3 rooms has been improved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug in the format of <code>/v1/send_join</code> has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/joined_members</code> response has now been fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to that, we've made good progress on embedding the Dendrite-powered Yggdrasil demo into Riot iOS, which we'll hopefully be demoing in a couple of weeks!</p>
<p>Spec compliance has improved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 40%, up from 36% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 38%, up from 35% last week</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Highlights this week</p>
<ul>
<li>We released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/16/synapse-1-15-1-released">1.15.1</a>, this is a bug fix release, sorry if you were bitten.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changelog-in-full">Changelog in full</h4>
<p>Bugfixes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug introduced in v1.15.0 that would crash Synapse on start when using certain password auth providers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug introduced in v1.15.0 which meant that some 3PID management endpoints were not accessible on the correct URL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implemented unread message counts (MSC 2625) - This is part of the a more general notifications improvement project in conjunction with the Riot teams. The aim being to make Notifications easier to configure. We‚Äôve also been working on push rule definitions for the default behaviour. More on that next week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have the ability to shard the media repository worker. This means we can now run an arbitrary number in parallel, thereby improving upload reliability and performance, we are running this on Matrix.org. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-enabled Jaeger on matrix.org - previously we needed to switch it off due to the performance overhead, we needed a few tweaks but now it is working well and helping us to determine the cause of slow requests. It seems like the HTTP requests between the event creator  and event persister workers can sometimes be slow - we are not sure of the cause yet, we are working on it but it will mean further performance improvements to message sending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next up performance wise is working on sharding the federation sender to improve federation lag. We‚Äôll also try replacing simplejson with stdlib json which seems to be much faster at dumps nowadays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we‚Äôve fixed a bug that meant that quarantining media would from time to time include quarantining sticker packs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other interesting bugs</p>
<p>We fixed a spec compliance bug in fetching remote media raised by our pals in Dendrite-land. We fixed a bug causing federation .well-known requests to fail due to not including the user-agent header. We removed references to six (thanks @ilmari) and finally, fixed a bug that caused stream id to go backwards on the replication stream.</p>
<p>Next week we‚Äôll continue to work on notifications and performance. You can track our progress here <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8</a></p>

<p>Wondering how quick this weeks synapse release was adopted by homeserver admins? Head over to <a href="https://graph.settgast.org/">https://graph.settgast.org/</a> and see yourself that it only took a little over 2 days for 1.15.1 to become the most used synapse version. I plot hourly distribution of synapse versions there. (Disclaimer: Only collects stats for homeservers that my homeserver sees in any of its rooms, which are around 2000 at the moment)</p>

<p>This is super cool! I love that this has been created, and also how well it reflects on homeserver admins! /me scurries to update to 1.15.1...</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>As with every release we are currently working through the new bug reports. :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I started working on SSSS and online key backup support. For this I wrote my own base64 and base58 encoders. As a result of this we dropped libsodium as a dependency, which should make Nheko a bit easier to package or build. It's also fun to write base conversions, although 58 is a horrible base!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>From the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reactions
<ul>
<li>React to a message with an emoji! üéâ</li>
<li>Reactions are shown below a message in a small bubble with a counter.</li>
<li>By clicking on that, others can add to the reaction count.</li>
<li>It may help you celebrating a new Nheko Release or react with a üëé to a failed build to express your frustration.</li>
<li>This uses a new emoji picker. The picker will be improved in the near future (better scrolling, sections, favorites, recently used or similar) and then probably replace the current picker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support for tagging rooms [tag]
<ul>
<li>Assign custom tags to rooms from the context menu in the room list.</li>
<li>This allows filtering rooms via the group list. This puts you in a focus mode showing only the selected tags.</li>
<li>You can assign multiple tags to group rooms however you like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SSO Login
<ul>
<li>With this you can now login on servers, that only provide SSO.</li>
<li>Just enter any mxid on the server. Nheko will figure out that you need to use SSO and redirect your browser to the login page.</li>
<li>Complete the login in your browser and Nheko should automatically log you in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Presence
<ul>
<li>Shows online status of the people you are talking to.</li>
<li>You can define a custom status message to tell others what you are currently up to.</li>
<li>The status message appears next to the usernames in the timeline.</li>
<li>Your server needs to have presence enabled for this to work.</li>

<p>after a couple of setbacks that didn't let us to make the releases earlier, the Quotient project has finally made two new releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GTAD (the piece of code magically producing readable C++ code from a Swagger API description) has achieved version 0.7 (https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad/releases/tag/v0.7.0) adding a few tricks in order to make...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...libQuotient 0.6 beta2 (https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.6-beta2) rely entirely on the upstream matrix-doc specification, rather than a soft fork closely following the main sources! From now on it's &quot;upstream first&quot;, in a sense that the original matrix-doc will be used to build Quotient codebase. Let's see how often it breaks ;)
In other news from the last few weeks:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some housekeeping and deprecation work in the API has been done in preparation to getting User Interactive Authentication along the next (post-0.6) release cycle of libQuotient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>also thanks to the updated code generator, the CS API code has been optimised, consolidating more code in the header files and making data deserialisation lazy; this helped significantly reduce compilation times, and runtime performance also improved a bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the number of configurations tested by CI has been extended, allowing to chase down a few more bugs that managed to go under the radar before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when used with new enough Qt, CBOR is used to cache data locally - entirely transparently for clients.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect more news in the coming weeks, including continued work on matrix: URI proposal and its implementation in Quotient.</p>

<p>This week in ruma-events' Google Summer of Code project, after trying out the new <code>Any*Event</code> enums <a href="https://github.com/DevinR528/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2"><code>matrix-rust-sdk</code></a>, we found a few big flaws. There was no easy way to go from <code>StateEvent&lt;AnyStateEventContent&gt;</code> to <code>StateEvent&lt;SpecificEventContent&gt;</code>, the other issue was one could create a <code>StateEvent</code> with differing <code>content</code> and <code>prev_content</code> fields using the <code>AnyStateEventContent</code> enum. The <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/68">0.22 ruma-events</a> will be similar to the existing API; each event type has a corresponding event enum variant.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever since <code>m.room.aliases</code> was replaced with <code>alt_aliases</code>, there hasn't really been any way to find aliases on other servers, since most room admins don't bother finding and publishing alternate aliases. To help solve that problem, I made a maubot plugin to let users publish alternate aliases in rooms: <a href="https://github.com/maubot/altalias">https://github.com/maubot/altalias</a></p>
<p>By default it lets users publish aliases with the same localpart as any already published alias. If that behavior is sufficient, you can simply invite it to a room and give it permissions to send <code>m.room.canonical_alias</code> events. Alternatively, it can be configured to allow aliases that match specific regexes.</p>
<p>Once it's set up, users can create a local alias and use <code>!altalias publish &lt;their alias&gt;</code> to publish it. The bot will make sure the alias points to the right room, check that the localpart is allowed and then add it to <code>alt_aliases</code>.</p>
<p>I have it running at @alias:maunium.net and I've added it to all my rooms already. Other rooms are also free to use that instance.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Regular readers of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix/">TWIM</a> may be familiar with the <a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/english/index.php">Decentralized Systems and Network Services Research Group</a> at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, who have been busy over the last few years analysing Matrix from an independent academic point of view.  The work started in 2018 with Florian Jacob‚Äôs <a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/matrix/traveller/explained.html">DSN Traveler</a> spidering project, resulting in the <a href="https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000100364">Glimpse of the Matrix</a> paper analysing Matrix‚Äôs scale and room/server distribution (at least as it was back then).</p>
<p>Last week, they released an entirely new paper: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3381991.3395399">Matrix Decomposition: Analysis of an Access Control Approach on Transaction-based DAGs without Finality</a> by Florian Jacob, Luca Becker, Jan Grash√∂fer and Hannes Hartenstein, presented at <a href="https://www.sacmat.org/2020/index.php">ACM SACMAT ‚Äò20</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the new paper is an absolutely fascinating deep dive analysis into <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">State Resolution v2</a> - the algorithm at the heart of Matrix which defines how servers merge together their potentially conflicting copies of a given room, such that everyone ends up eventually with a consistent view‚Ä¶ even in the face of bad actors. This means that Matrix effectively implements a decentralised access control system - ensuring that users stay banned, and only users with permission can ban, etc.  You can see the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/img/SACMAT_2020_Talk_Matrix_Decomposition.pdf">slides</a> below, and read the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3381991.3395399">full paper</a> here. The video of Florian‚Äôs talk from SACMAT should be published shortly.</p>
<br/>
<p><object data="https://matrix.org/blog/img/SACMAT_2020_Talk_Matrix_Decomposition.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="1024" height="768"></object></p>
<br/>
<p>To give some context from the Matrix side: designing and implementing State Resolution v2 back in 2018 was a bit of a mission. Our original v1 implementation had some bugs which meant that the result of the merge could unexpectedly favour historical state over the current state (so called ‚Äòstate resets‚Äô) - thus giving an attacker a way to maliciously revert the state of the room.  In v2 we thought much more carefully about the algorithm, considering state present in one version of the room but not the other as a conflict, separating and applying access control events from regular events, and adding additional ordering of the state in the room by considering events in the context of their authorisation chain (the ‚Äòauth DAG‚Äô).  The end result is that we feel confident in v2 State Res, and we haven‚Äôt seen any problems with it in the wild since we shipped it in July 2018.</p>
<p>However: state resolution is not intuitive at first - for instance, when you merge two versions of a room together, you treat the state events as unordered sets‚Ä¶ even though they are ordered in the context of the room DAG.  The reason is that state res needs to work even if you don‚Äôt have a copy of the whole room DAG (otherwise you‚Äôd have to download way too much data to participate in a large room).  Another example is the sequence in which orderings are then applied to the state events - and how that interacts with re-authorising those events, to stop malicious ones creeping in.  In the core team, we‚Äôve end up describing it several different ways to try to help folks understand: first Erik‚Äôs original <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/state_res_msc/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">MSC1442</a>, then uhoreg‚Äôs <a href="https://matrix.uhoreg.ca/stateres/reloaded.html">literary Haskell implementation</a>, then the terse reference version in <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v2">the Spec</a> itself, and most recently Neil Alexander‚Äôs <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/implementing-stateres">State Resolution v2 for the Hopelessly Unmathematical</a>.</p>
<p>As a result we are <strong>very</strong> excited and happy that Florian and the DSN team have now published the first ever independent in-depth analysis of the algorithm, particularly in the context of decentralised access control (i.e. enforcing bans, power levels, etc).  We‚Äôre pleasantly surprised that apparently ‚ÄúTo the best of our knowledge, Matrix is the only system that implements access control based on an eventually consistent partial order without finality and without a consensus algorithm‚Äù.</p>
<p>Even better, the DSN team found some remaining thinkos in Synapse‚Äôs implementation and the Matrix specification, which could have caused resolution results to diverge from other implementations, specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>we weren‚Äôt enforcing integers in JSON to be within range [-2<sup>53</sup>+1, 2<sup>53</sup>-1], fixed in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7381">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7381</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/clokep/json-validation-room-ver/proposals/2540-stricter-event-validation.md">MSC2540</a></li>
<li>we forgot to include the notification field when authing power level events, fixed in  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7501">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7501</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lucavb/matrix-doc/blob/master/proposals/2209-auth-rules-other-keys-in-m.room.power.levels.md">MSC2209</a> (thanks to Luca from DSN for the MSC!)</li>
<li>we forgot to spec the limit that one should apply to the number of parents of an event in the DAG (fixed in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2538">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2538</a>)</li>
<li>we missed that moderators could set server ACLs which could let them undermine room admins (fixed in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6834">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6834</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these have now been fixed in Synapse and the latest versions of the spec (room v6), and we‚Äôd like to sincerely thank Florian and Luca for rapidly and responsibly disclosing the issues to us.  In other words: this research is directly improving Matrix, and it‚Äôs even more exciting that the stated future work for the DSN team is to work on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">formal verification</a> for the security of Matrix‚Äôs authorisation rules and state resolution.  This stuff is tough, as anyone who‚Äôs played with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA%2B">TLA<sup>+</sup></a> will know, and we are incredibly glad that the research community is helping out to formalise and hopefully prove that State Res v2 is as good as we think it is.</p>
<p>We should stress that DSN‚Äôs work is completely independent of The Matrix.org Foundation or anyone else building on the protocol; we‚Äôre just writing about it here because we think it‚Äôs incredibly cool and deserves the attention of the whole Matrix ecosystem.</p>
<p>Thanks again to Florian and the team - we look forward to seeing what comes next!</p>

<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we're sticking with the same three from last week: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2366">MSC2366</a> (verification flows), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2403">MSC2403</a> (knocking), and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2630">MSC2630</a> (SAS security).</p>
<p>In possibly more exciting news, the Spec Core Team has decided to start separating the scattered casual implementation tips and notes in the spec out and putting them in a series of implementation guides! These will take the form of gitbook-style things, and will initially feature front-to-back implementation guides for a generic Matrix client and homeserver.

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implementing end-to-end encryption for go-neb turns out to be a lot easier than expected thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix">https://github.com/tulir/mautrix</a> library, which contains out of the box e2ee support!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first week of GSoC was spent switching go-neb's usage of gomatrix for mautrix, which was easy as the latter is a fork of the former. This caused a pretty big PR that touched most of go-neb's files, although the changes were simple and easy to review. The PR was merged shortly after into go-neb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the second week, it was time to add some basic e2ee support to go-neb. This was complicated slightly due to the bot's ability to create multiple clients and its treatment of /sync responses, however in the end e2ee is now working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code is still of course a mess and session keys are often lost in the void. The code will be cleaned up and tested further next week, bugs will be (hopefully) fixed and another PR will be submitted to go-neb then to officially add e2ee support!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/nikofil/go-neb/tree/e2ee">https://github.com/nikofil/go-neb/tree/e2ee</a> until it can be cleaned up</p>

<p>From <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@arnav-t:matrix.org">arnav-t</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrix has enormous potential to be used in many different use cases be it embedded chat rooms, comments section, chat boxes, etc. This project aims to fill that niche by providing an easy to use and easy to deploy client for users to embed on their webpages.<br />
The client would mesh well wherever it is embedded by providing a <code>postMessage</code> interface to allow the parent webpage to interact with the client and dynamically modify it whenever needed (For example:-  A comments section that is always the same theme as its parent webpage).</p>
<h4 id="features">Features</h4>
<p>As of now, the following features have been added (with more on the way)</p>
<ul>
<li>List of joined rooms that can be selected </li>
<li>Live room timeline events</li>
<li>Support for image-based messages</li>
<li>Message composer and ability to send messages to a room</li>
<li>Dark and light themes for the client</li>
<li>Changeable highlight colors</li>
<li>Toggleable room header, room timeline, and message composer components</li>
<li><code>postMessage</code> interface for sending commands from the parent window</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, I'm working on adding more options to the <code>postMessage</code> interface as well as adding more interactivity to the client itself.</p>

<p>Ruma is a Rust project to create a comprehensive set of APIs for Matrix. Previously there was a Ruma homeserver project.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@devinr528:matrix.org">devinr528</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in ruma-events' Google Summer of Code project, I was able to finish the macros needed to generate the event content enums and trait implementations required for events. I started by defining the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/107">generic event structs</a> (state, message, etc.) and manually writing the <code>Serialize</code> and <code>Deserialize</code> implementations. Over the next few days, this was moved into a custom derive macro called <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/108"><code>Event</code></a>. The derive now implements all necessary traits with appropriate bounds, so a <code>StateEvent&lt;C&gt;</code> can not contain any ephemeral event content and so forth. I have removed the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/111"><code>raw</code></a> mod and related <code>FromRaw</code> and <code>TryFromRaw</code> traits, moving the validation into the deserialization and constructor for the few types that needed it. On the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/pull/106">event content</a> side of things, a function like procedural macro was used to allow declaring the enum using Matrix event type identifiers.</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span>event_content_enum! {

<blockquote>
<p>Much of this week's work has been maintenance-related with refactoring, cleaning up etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Key fetching/expiry behaviour has been fixed, improving the reliability of federation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The monolith and component setup has now been refactored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of unused internal APIs have now been removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other internal roomserver APIs have been streamlined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also started building an <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io">Yggdrasil</a>-powered P2P demo (as opposed to the previous demos built using libp2p) and even includes support for embedding Riot Web in the single binary. It's not very stable/usable yet but there will be more news on that to follow within the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>We have also started building and releasing Docker images for Dendrite on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixdotorg/dendrite">Docker Hub</a> for those who want to use Docker to test Dendrite deployment.</p>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged from last week:</p>

<h3 id="conduit">Conduit</h3>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome back! This week I focused my efforts on better error handling. My goal was that every problem would be forwarded to the client (e.g. InternalServerError response) and also be logged. Yesterday I merged the <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit/pulls/116/files">giant PR this resulted in</a>. Hopefully this will make Conduit easier to debug in the future.</p>
<p>Here are some other things I finished this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>User-interactive authentication (e.g. you need to type your password again if you want to delete devices)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Config option to disable registration</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also found the problem with Riot not showing notifications for new messages and created <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/14000">a bug report</a>. With a few tweaks, I managed to solve this on my account and now mentions, DMs and more play the notification sound (it also works on Riot X!). </p>
<p>@gnieto fixed a bug that prevented Riot from loading history when you join a room and @PublicByte implemented the /whoami endpoint.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from that we continue out push towards improving performance both in terms of sharding workers but also improving tools to manage disk space usage. Specifically this week and next we are looking at db tuning and sharding the media repo worker. We are also noticing that the typing handler is chewing more CPU than would be expected. It could be a good candidate for moving away from the master process.</p>
<p>More broadly we are changing the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5745">defaults for notifications</a> and making changes to support a more general overhaul of notifications.</p>
<p>Finally we are looking at how to not only delete messages after a certain time period, but also how to delete the associated media (which becomes difficult when considering e2e content along side long lived content such as avatars and sticker packs).</p>
<p>For more detail on what is coming next, take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">public task board</a>.</p>

<p>Since <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2190">MSC2190</a> and the related Synapse PR aren't moving much, all my bridges now generate appservice registration files with the workaround. The workaround is needed to avoid patching synapse or using other hacks, and I decided to enable it by default as many people had problems related to having to apply it manually.</p>
<p>The WhatsApp, Facebook and Hangouts bridges now have an option to use double puppeting to disable notifications when backfilling. It can be useful if you want to copy chat history to Matrix, but don't want to be spammed with hundreds of notifications while it's happening.</p>

<p>a set of Matrix bridges configured to run on a private server called a <a href="https://gitlab.com/nova/bridgebox">bridgebox</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Matrix bridges are awesome but generally require you to run own homeserver. NovaChat removes that restriction, without sacrificing security and privacy. Your remote chat network credentials never leave your bridgebox, and messages are encrypted* on the bridgebox before being sent to the NovaChat homeserver.</p>
<p>*Encryption is currently enabled on Telegram/FB/Hangouts/Whatsapp bridges, mx-puppet-bridges coming shortly)</p>
<p><em>Very rough system diagram:</em></p>
<p><code>&gt; NovaChat desktop client &lt;&gt; NovaChat homeserver &lt;&gt; bridgebox &lt;&gt; remote chat networks</code></p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fancy new UI, heavily inspired by Telegram. See photo below or <a href="https://app.tella.tv/story/ckar1ock0000007mi7x5t3qdn">see it in action</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy graphical bridge set up (no more fiddling with config files)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliable bridging, with delivery confirmations and bridge disconnect warnings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Includes 8 pre-configured bridges: Facebook/Whatsapp/Hangouts/Telegram/Slack/Instagram/Twitter/Skype. Planning to add more soon, or submit a PR!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Works on Mac OS, Linux and Windows</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't need to be technical to use NovaChat, it's designed to Just WorkTM. If you need help setting up a bridgebox, we are offering hosting and maintenance for USD $5 per month.</p>
<p>The vast majority of this software has been created by the talented tulir and dm0141. I personally am a terrible coder (you can tell which parts I did), but I do have experience building products and teams, and I'm excited to begin working in the Matrix universe. I wrote recently about how I believe Matrix is the <a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/the-universal-communication-bus-42dfb9a141ad">Universal Communication Bus</a>! Thanks goes to Sorunome for creating the mx-puppet-bridges!</p>
<p>We're developing the whole project in the open (though not all components are open source), check the <a href="https://gitlab.com/nova/issues/-/boards?scope=all&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;state=opened">issue backlog</a> :)</p>
<p><strong>Want to help?</strong> We're hiring Matrix developer to work on the project with us. Send me a message if you're interested! Particularly looking for a React dev to help with frontend on nova-web.</p>

<h3 id="nheko-1">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@red_sky:ocean.joedonofry.com">red_sky</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nheko 0.7.2 is ready for release. Here's the summary of changes:</p>
<h4 id="highlights">Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reactions</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>React to a message with an emoji! üéâ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reactions are shown below a message in a small bubble with a counter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By clicking on that, others can add to the reaction count.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may help you celebrating a new Nheko Release or react with a üëé to a failed build to express your frustration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This uses a new emoji picker. The picker will be improved in the near future (better scrolling, sections, favorites, recently used or similar) and then probably replace the current picker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for tagging rooms <code>[tag]</code></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assign custom tags to rooms from the context menu in the room list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This allows filtering rooms via the group list. This puts you in a focus mode showing only the selected tags.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can assign multiple tags to group rooms however you like.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>SSO Login</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With this you can now login on servers, that only provide SSO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just enter any mxid on the server. Nheko will figure out that you need to use SSO and redirect your browser to the login page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete the login in your browser and Nheko should automatically log you in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="features-1">Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for showing users presence and status message as well as setting your own status message&quot;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><code>/roomnick</code> to change your displayname in a single room.</p>
</li>

<p>Preliminary support for showing inline images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warn about unencrypted messages in encrypted rooms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="improvements">Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>perf: Use less CPU to sort the room list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit size of replies. This currently looks a bit rough, but should improve in the future with a gradient or at some other transition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>perf: Only clean out old messages from the database every 500 syncs. (There is usually more than one sync every second)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve the login and register masks a bit with hints and validation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Descriptions for settings (contributed by lkito)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A visual indicator, that nheko is fetching messages and improved scrolling (contributed by Lasath Fernando)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix not being able to join rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix scale factor setting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buildfixes against gcc10 and Qt5.15 (missing includes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Settings now apply immediately again after changing them (only exception should be the scale factor)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Join messages should never have empty texts now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timeline should now fail to render less often on platforms with native sibling windows.</p>
</li>
<li>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the work this past week was on ruma-events, for more on that see the GSoC section! Devin got far enough with that so we now know it all works out and can replace the previous ruma-events API. When that was clear, ruma-events was also merged into our new <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">monorepo</a>; now the only remaining crate to be merged is ruma-client (where I'm also waiting for some pending changes).</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.15.0 release day folks.</p>
<p>We continue our push to improve performance across the board. Factoring out event persistence into a separate worker pointed the way to a host of small but collectively important improvements. Expect further changes in coming releases.</p>
<p>Aside from that the admin API continues to grow (this time device management) and we have improved device list syncing to aid e2ee reliability.</p>
<p>We are receiving an increasing number of high quality PRs from the community, please keep them coming. Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cg505">cg505</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WGH">WGH</a>, <a href="https://github.com/olof">olof</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ilmari">ilmari</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/mascarene/mascarene">Mascarene</a> is a quite new homeserver implementation project started a few months ago. Now it's time to introduce it.</p>
<p>Mascarene is written in <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, runs on JVM and relies on <a href="https://akka.io/">Akka</a> actor model. Out of the box it provides features like efficient streaming I/O, clustering and live data distribution. Data are backed in a PostgreSQL database.</p>
<p>The project is in early stage but already provides a few endpoints which make Mascarene able to talk to Riot. </p>
<p>You can test it at <a href="https://snapshot.mascarene.org">https://snapshot.mascarene.org</a>. You should be able to register, login, create a room and talk to yourself.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome back! This week I went through the whole Client-Server API and wrote down everything that is still missing from Conduit. You can find issues for all of them in the <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit/milestones">milestone for Conduit 1.0</a>. This should make it more easy for contributors to find something to work on and gives a lot more structure to the repo (maybe I also did it, because it's so satisfying to close issues and see the milestone percentage go up üòõ).</p>
<p>Some of the issues I could already close this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implement redaction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement loading the message someone replied to (/context)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix bugs with notifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't send typing events when nothing happened</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bundle typing events into one EDU</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't send notification counts every /sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement heroes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can tell, a lot of work is starting to go into smaller improvements, which is a good thing, because it means most of the core work is already done!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Synapse land we have been focusing on bug fixes especially SSO and soft logout. </p>
<p>We also spent some time thinking about how to further improve performance for large scale deployments (like matrix.org). In short this will mean sharding contested workers such as the media repo worker, the federation sender and the federation reader. We also want to remove some more functionality from the master process because it is still sitting at about 80% and we‚Äôd like some more head room. We'd also like to fix up the state compressor so it can easily be run as a background progress to save on disk space, this will benefit all installations big and small. Finally we want to speed up joins over federation. Exciting times.</p>
<p>Next week, more of the same and we should start on some of the perf items. Also look out for changes to notification defaults.</p>

<p>RiotX v0.21.0 has been released on May 28th. It adds support to identity server configuration and e-mail/phone binding and unbinding. It's also now possible to switch between languages inside the app and to display the list of attachments (media and file) of a room. A new setting has been also added to hide redacted (deleted) events in the timeline. As Riot-Android SAS v2 is also included in this release. Also <code>formatted_body</code> for <code>m.notice</code> and <code>m.emote</code> are now taken into account.</p>
<p>This week we were still working on implementing VoIP (audio and video call). Support for integration manager, widgets and sending stickers has been merged to develop.

<p>This week, we finalised our work around the iOS13 SDK. The coming public TestFlight (0.12.2) is the result of this work. It comes with a lot of changes including a full rewrite of the push handling codebase, trying to find solutions to make matrix e2ee compatible with iOS Notification Service Extension. Most of these changes are unfortunately invisible for end users. Please report any issues. Note this is safe to switch between this TF and 0.11.5.</p>
<p>In parallel, we started to implement the cross-signing bootstrap and the recovery management. The UX of this is going to be refined on Riot-Web and RiotX-Android. Riot-iOS will implement the refined UX directly.</p>

            <p>TL;DR: we shipped a major update (v0.1.1) to <a href="https://p2p.riot.im">https://p2p.riot.im</a> - fire up a desktop Chrome or Firefox in not-private-browsing mode and give it a go!</p>
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>As many know by now, a few of us have been working away since mid-December on experimenting with running Matrix in a peer-to-peer architecture - one where every user has absolute total autonomy and ownership of their conversations, because the only place their conversations exist is on the devices they own.</p>
<p>In some ways this is the logical end goal of Matrix: our aim has always been to empower users to have full control over their communication rather than being beholden to any given service provider, and in a P2P world we completely return power over secure communication to the people.</p>
<h3 id="why-p2p">Why P2P?</h3>
<p>P2P Matrix is about more than just letting users store their own conversations: it can also avoid dependencies on the Internet itself by working over local networks, mesh networks, or situations where the Internet has been cut off.  Even more interestingly, without homeservers, there is nowhere for metadata to accumulate about who is talking to who, and when - which is a legitimate complaint about today‚Äôs Matrix network, given the homeservers of all users in a given conversation necessarily have to store that conversation‚Äôs metadata.  P2P also lets us radically simplify signup for new users if they don‚Äôt have to pick a server to get going - and we avoid the unintentional centralisation of users piling onto public servers.</p>
<p>P2P also forces us to solve many of the hardest remaining problems in Matrix: e.g multi-homed accounts, given multi-device P2P requires your account to exist in multiple places. This in turn unlocks high availability and geo-redundancy for accounts on today‚Äôs Matrix network (imagine having a primary and backup homeserver that magically did the right thing!), as well as account portability, and thus also vhosting and load-balancing accounts between servers, and even improved GDPR compliance (for if your user IDs are ephemeral they are no longer personally identifying information baked into your Matrix rooms).  We‚Äôll also need better safety mechanisms to avoid folks exploiting the anonymous nature of the network for abuse, accelerating the work we‚Äôre already doing for today‚Äôs Matrix network.</p>
<p>The way we‚Äôve been approaching P2P is the ‚Äú<a href="https://twitter.com/Lucid00/status/1263974339294175232">hamfisted but genius</a>‚Äù approach of taking homeservers and running them on the client, alongside or within your Matrix client - meaning that there are literally <strong>no</strong> changes required for any Matrix client to talk P2P Matrix, and so P2P Matrix can instantly benefit from all the work which has gone into Riot and other apps.  As a result, P2P is also a huge motivator towards developing much smaller homeservers which can run efficiently clientside (e.g. Dendrite!) - which is of course great news for Matrix as a whole.  It also forces us to develop more scalable routing algorithms (as you don‚Äôt want your client to have to talk to every other device in a room every time it sends a message!) and also spurs development of low bandwidth Matrix transports (as you don‚Äôt want the additional chatter of talking to multiple peers to consume all your bandwidth).  Finally, it forces us to really ruggedize federation, given nodes are constantly appearing and disappearing, giving the federation much more of a stress test than we see with today‚Äôs relatively static homeservers.</p>
<h3 id="p2p-in-practice">P2P in Practice</h3>
<p>So, P2P has been acting as fuel for a lot of our longer term Matrix work over the last few months.  There have been three main experiments so far: at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/dip_p2p_matrix/">FOSDEM</a> we showed off running our next-gen Dendrite homeserver running clientside using HTTP over <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> as the transport.  We also highlighted Timoth√©e Floure‚Äôs <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dedis/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/presentation-2019-2-Timothee-Floure-Experimenting-with-Matrix-federation-over-Yggdrasil.pdf">project at EPFL</a> experimenting with Synapse talking P2P CoAP over yggdrasil as the transport via a proxy.</p>
<p>Most recently, however, we‚Äôve been experimenting with compiling Dendrite down to Web Assembly and running it embedded in Riot Web as a Service Worker, using HTTP over libp2p‚Äôs websocket transport (coordinated via a websocket rendezvous server).  Architecturally, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/p2p-diag.png" alt="P2P Architecture Diagram" /></p>
<p>Today, we‚Äôre shipping a major new alpha (v0.1.1) of this P2P demo up at <a href="https://p2p.riot.im">https://p2p.riot.im</a> (requires desktop Chrome or Firefox in non-private-browsing mode) - which hopefully should give a really usable and concrete taste of the shape of things to come.</p>
<p>The main features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your conversations are now persisted in your browser storage (via IndexedDB), meaning that as long as all the browsers participating in a given conversation don‚Äôt clear their local storage, rooms on the P2P network are here to stay!</li>
<li>Your room directory lists all the aliases for all the rooms published by active nodes on the network.  Moreover, we now automatically publish a local room alias whenever you join a public room, so that others will be able to discover that room via you, even if the server who originally created the alias has disappeared.</li>
<li>Lots and lots of federation improvements between the nodes - for instance, when a node comes online, others should now automatically detect and send scrollback to it.  Invites should work, and there should no longer be any unexpectedly redacted messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, all the code for this is open source under the Apache license, and if you‚Äôre feeling particularly adventurous you can embed your very own P2P Dendrite into Riot Web by using the Dockerfile at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/build/docker/DendriteJS.Dockerfile">https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/build/docker/DendriteJS.Dockerfile</a> or following the instructions at  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/docs/p2p.md">https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/docs/p2p.md</a>.</p>
<p>Please report bugs to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues">https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues</a>!</p>
<p>Finally, please understand that the demo is very likely <strong>not</strong> what the final version of P2P Matrix will look like - this is just one step in a series of experiments as we investigate the best paths forward :)</p>
<h3 id="what-s-next">What‚Äôs next?</h3>
<p>For the current demo, there‚Äôs still lots of stuff remaining, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>More federation debugging (and hooking in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/tardis">tardis</a> and writing up everything we‚Äôve learned about implementing federation in Dendrite!)</li>
<li>Making the content repository work in-browser (gotta fill up those IndexedDBs with some GIFs!)</li>
<li>Hooking up E2E Encryption APIs in Dendrite (not that it buys us much in a pure P2P world)</li>
<li>WebRTC transports.  Turns out that service workers aren‚Äôt allowed to speak WebRTC, so we‚Äôll have to shim through to Riot to speak true peer-to-peer WebRTC data channels rather than relaying all the traffic through the websocket rendezvous server.</li>
<li>Decentralised accounts for multidevice support - reviewing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/proposal/remove_mxids_from_events/proposals/1228-removing-mxids-from-events.md">MSC1228</a> and getting Dendrite supporting multihoming accounts!</li>
<li>Finishing all of Dendrite‚Äôs other remaining APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond this, there are some bigger picture questions left to be answered in future experiments.</p>
<p>Firstly: we do not yet have a solution for ‚Äústore and forward‚Äù nodes which can relay messages on behalf of a room if all the participating devices are offline.  A first cut will be to run a P2P-capable homeserver server-side for this, but then metadata will start to accumulate server-side for the conversations it hosts.  A more interesting approach would be to use a store and forward system which obfuscates who is talking to who, such as a mixnet, and could even provide resistance to network traffic pattern analysis.  This is very much an open area of research, but one we are getting into :D</p>
<p>Secondly: we want to experiment more with other transports, and find out which works best for Matrix.  Libp2p has some really exciting new stuff in the form of <a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-05-20-gossipsub-v1.1">Gossipsub v1.1</a> - a much smarter routing algorithm for pubsub traffic in libp2p, which David Dias gave us a <a href="https://youtu.be/APVp-20ATLk?t=3598">VIP tour</a> of at the first Open Tech Will Save Us meetup.  So we‚Äôll need to restructure our libp2p transport as pubsub to see how it works in practice.  Separately, we also want to play with hooking up <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/">Yggdrasil</a> (the encrypted overlay network) as a transport as a totally different approach - Yggdrasil will easily let us span different underlying network transports, but comes with different tradeoffs (e.g. no browser support yet).  We also want to take a look at the <a href="https://dat.foundation/">DAT</a> / <a href="https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/hypercore">hypercore</a> / <a href="https://github.com/hyperswarm/hyperswarm">hyperswarm</a> / <a href="https://cabal.chat/">Cabal</a> ecosystem to see if there‚Äôs a match :)</p>
<p>Thirdly and finally: we obviously want to unify the new P2P Matrix network with today‚Äôs federated one.  The ideal outcome here would be to have a hybrid model, where teams who want their users to have a dedicated homeserver (for availability, IT policies, etc) can continue to have one as they do today - but newbies who have just installed Riot would float around on P2P unless they decided to consciously put down roots on a server or two.  Best of all, it would let us turn off the matrix.org homeserver: the best public homeserver is one you run yourself on your own phone ;)  The approach we take for linking P2P and today‚Äôs Matrix will depend very much on the transport we select for P2P in the long run, but the likelihood is that today‚Äôs homeservers will sprout P2P gateways to link the networks.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, there you have it.  P2P Matrix exists, and is developing at an alarming speed - and pushing Dendrite development along with it.  Most excitingly, there have been no changes yet to the Matrix spec for P2P at all; we‚Äôve just swapped https for http-over-libp2p as the transport.  So <strong>all</strong> of the work we‚Äôve been doing making Dendrite work in a P2P world has directly translated into making Dendrite work on today‚Äôs Matrix too  You can now stand up a Dendrite and have it federate pretty reliably with the wider Matrix network, although we‚Äôre still rushing through implementing APIs (we‚Äôre up to 35% passing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">sytest</a> coverage - although that 35% does contain most of the important tests :)</p>
<p>Finally, in case you‚Äôre worried about why the Matrix core team is off chasing P2P dreams rather than improving Riot‚Äôs UX, or implementing Communities, or Extensible Profiles, or working through the MSC backlog etc... in practice only two people (ignoring Matthew) have been working on P2P - Neil Alexander (author of the original FOSDEM demo, Dendrite wrangler and Yggdrasil co-maintainer) and Kegan Dougal (of the original Matrix dev team, one of the original authors of Dendrite, and now wrangling the WASM P2P work too).  Huge thanks to Kegan &amp; Neil for pushing P2P forwards - and huge thanks to everyone else on the core team and the wider community for keeping today‚Äôs Matrix advancing too!</p>
<p>Hope this has given a tempting glimpse of the shape of things to come.  Honestly we never thought we‚Äôd get as far as P2P when we started Matrix back in 2014, but it‚Äôs really fun to be finally catching up with the future :D</p>

<p>Says TravisR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been a little while since we've done a round of spec releases, so we have a bunch of spec releases to share. If you're implementing something from the spec, please have a look at the news: https://matrix.org/blog/2020/05/27/room-version-6-client-server-r-0-6-1-and-federation-r-0-1-4-spec-releases/</p>

<h3 id="conduit">Conduit</h3>
<p>Conduit is a Matrix homeserver written in Rust <a href="https://conduit.rs">https://conduit.rs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello again! This week I worked on access control, which means that private rooms are private and invite-only rooms are invite-only. The public room directory only shows rooms marked as such now.</p>
<p>I also made <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit/milestones">a milestone to track progress on Conduit 1.0</a>. This release marks the point where Conduit is fully usable as a non-federating homeserver. All features of the client server specification should be implemented, unless they can be seen as optional extensions (e.g. alternative registrations methods like email). Conduit should also be free of all known bugs with those features.</p>
<p>Adding federation on top of the 1.0 release will very likely require breaking changes. This means that the release which brings federation will be 2.0 or later and will require a partial or full database deletion.</p>
<p>@TravisR wrote a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/1304">fix for Riot Web</a>, so you should be able to create accounts on Conduit from &lt;<a href="https://riot.im/app">https://riot.im/app</a>&gt; soon.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The monolith now has a &quot;hybrid&quot; mode that uses the full HTTP APIs instead of short-circuiting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of the internal HTTP APIs are now tested fully and have been fixed as a result, which will also improve running a full polylith component deployment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server keys are now managed by a separate server key API component</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Batched sends in the federation sender are now working properly, improving send performance significantly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Error handling in the federation <code>/send</code> endpoint has been tweaked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/get_missing_events</code> now returns events that don't fail signature checks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federated room joins by room alias now attempt the server specified in the alias much more reliably</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The correct room ID is now returned from the PerformJoin API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much of the room server storage code has been deduplicated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed some bugs in the device database storage code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync streams are now managed per-user-per-device, rather than just per-user</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We no longer incorrectly default to federated joins in response to local invites</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 34% (228/672 tests)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation APIs: 34% (35/103 tests)</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Says Neil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main news this week is that we switched event persistence away from the matrix.org master process which has made a big difference to overall performance. The impact is best demonstrated by graphing message send times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-05-29-synapse-perf.png" alt="synapse perf" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also shipped <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/05/28/synapse-1-14-0-released">1.14.0</a> which includes OpenId Connect support and improved cache control granularity. It also contains rooms v6. </p>
<p>Next week will be having a think about what to do next for matrix.org performance. Watch this space.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made a TARDIS (Time Agnostic Room DAG Inspection Service) - a simple time-travelling debugger for Room DAGs which plugs into Dendrite's internal APIs to visualise room DAGs.  The intention is to provide it as a widget which Riot can use to visualise DAGs for debugging, particularly for P2P Matrix.  The time-travel bit is simply that it could let you filter out the newer events to show how the DAG has evolved over time, although that isn't hooked up yet. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/tardis">https://github.com/matrix-org/tardis</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>iinuwa added some new endpoints to ruma-federation-api</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>devinr528 wrote lots of macro code for the next major revision of ruma-events as part of his GSoC project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timo (author of the Conduit homeserver) reported lots of small issues with ruma-client-api of which some are now fixed already</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we released two new bugfix library versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events/releases/tag/0.21.3">ruma-events 0.21.3</a> fixes an event serialization issue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ruma-serde 0.2.2 (an internal dependency) fixed an incomplete part of querystring deserialization, so Conduit (and other future homeservers building on ruma-*-api) can properly handle querystrings in which parameters are repeated (like the <code>server_name</code> in <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1#post-matrix-client-r0-join-roomidoralias">/join/{roomIdOrAlias}</a>)</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.14.0 has landed.</p>
<p>This release contains OpenId Connect support, so that admins can configure a whole range of SSO options. We're really excited about what this means for helping users sign up and are considering it for matrix.org.</p>
<p>1.14.0 also contains finer grained cache configuration support, so that admins can tune caches in a more granular way. Our experience is that cache tuning can make a big difference to Synapse performance and over time we hope to continue improving cache tooling. Potentially we could even have caches auto-tune.</p>
<p>You'll also find support for <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v6">rooms v6</a>. v6 contains some small but important changes to improve the security of the room model. As with all room version upgrades we can't switch to v6 as the default version immediately since we need to build up a critical mass of servers that can support it. So upgrade and watch this space for when we switch over properly.</p>
<p>As an aside we continue to be very happy with using Redis for worker inter-communication and will likely recommend it for production use in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Get 1.14.0 from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.14.0">github</a> or any of the sources mentioned at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md.</p>

<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>It's been <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/11/08/client-server-r-0-6-0-and-identity-service-r-0-3-0-releases">a little while</a> since we've done a spec release, so here we are with <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v6">Room Version 6</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1">Client-Server r0.6.1</a>, and <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.4">Federation r0.1.4</a>.</p>
<p>Room Version 6 (and the associated Federation r0.1.4 release) is largely something for implementations to worry about. It contains new event authorisation rules, changes to the redaction algorithm, and stricter compliance for JSON.</p>
<p>Client-Server r0.6.1 contains a number of clarifications as well as SSO support for authorisation, &quot;soft logout&quot; to avoid needlessly destroying e2e history, and new ways to publish aliases within rooms.</p>
<p>If you're wondering where all the E2E-by-default related MSCs are - we're doing final iterations based on the real-world feedback from the E2E-by-default launch a few weeks ago, and they are then expected to land in the upcoming Client-Server r0.7.</p>
<p>Here's all the MSCs that got merged since the last release:</p>
