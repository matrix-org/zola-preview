Fixing notifications (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3966">MSC3966</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3873">MSC3873</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3758">MSC3758</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3952">MSC3952</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3958">MSC3958</a>) as per last week, as well as trying to finally get <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2677">MSC2677</a> (spec'ing the current state of Annotations and Reactions) into FCP.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3972">MSC3972</a>: Lexicographical strings as an ordering mechanism!</p>
<p>While there already is an MSC for a top-level ordering of Spaces in use across some client implementations today (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3230">MSC3230</a>), the algorithm recommended for clients to implement apparently has some consistency flaws, leading to edge cases. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3972">MSC3972</a> attempts to address this by providing a different algorithm that does not have these flaws. A real-world implementation of the algorithm is also available today in Kotlin at https://github.com/Dominaezzz/MatrixSort.</p>
<p>Neither of these algorithms have been merged to the spec yet, but this new MSC may finally push this conversation forwards! I recommend client developers give it a read and leave their feedback as Pull Request Review comments on the MSC.</p>

<p>An open source Matrix homeserver implementation written from scratch in ANSI C and designed to be lightweight and simple, yet functional</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jordan:bancino.net">Jordan Bancino</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey everyone, it's been a while since I've posted an update here, but I'm pleased to report that progress on <strong>Telodendria</strong> is still steady. Here's a small glimpse into what's happening with the project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>v0.2.1:</strong> The second major release of <strong>Telodendria</strong> was published earlier this week. <strong>Telodendria</strong> still isn't much yet, but the user authentication section of the client-server specification is just about complete. This means you can register for accounts, log in and get access tokens, and then log out. All the stuff that goes with that, including the static login fallback page, and user interactive authentication is in place.</li>
<li><strong>What's Next:</strong> I'm hoping to start working on the account management endpoints next. I also want to start building out an HTTP client for federation, and I want to move the configuration file into the database, so that <strong>Telodendria</strong> is configured via an admin API endpoint instead of a file. The thinking here is that this enables <strong>Telodendria</strong> to be configured at runtime, without having to restart the process to apply configuration changes.</li>
<li><strong>Help Wanted:</strong> As always, I could use your help. This is a huge project, and I am very busy so I can't dedicate as much time as I'd like to it. If you find <strong>Telodendria</strong> interesting and want it to continue, feel free to join us over in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria-general:bancino.net">#telodendria-general:bancino.net</a>, write some code and documentation, donate to the project, or any and all of the above!</li>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/farooqkz/chooj">chooj</a>, the Matrix client for KaiOS feature phones, has seen many changes in the last few weeks. Many bugs were fixed and many others are probably added. We now support many other events other than message events which you can view in the rooms plus an experimental image viewer to better investigate the received images. Other than that, by removing the files KaiOS doesn't use, the production bundle size is half now. A big internal change also happened and still is not finished yet. With the assist of Simon Laux, a big portion of chooj is now <a href="https://github.com/farooqkz/KaiUIng">a separate library</a> which makes maintenance easier and also lets other KaiOS apps use them. I have written my plans for chooj in <a href="https://blog.bananahackers.net/farooqkz/chooj-is-back-into-the-game">my last post</a> in the BananaHackers blog. If you like to see Matrix chat on the KaiOS feature phones, you can donate an amount to help with the development of the project. Or you can donate me a debug enabled KaiOS phone with the mentioned features.</p>

<h3 id="nheko-website">Nheko (<a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lorendb:nheko.im">LorenDB</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've had some fun and useful things happening in the past two weeks!</p>
<ul>
<li>red_sky (nheko.im) worked on automating the release process to automatically create a release when a tag is pushed. This might not sound like much, but it makes life easier for maintainers who would otherwise have to waste time manually creating releases. After all, why would you want to write release notes when you could be writing code?</li>
<li>Nico tweaked styling for HTML tables to increase the padding. Thanks to Cadair for the suggestion!</li>
<li>Nico also fixed a bug that showed avatar changes as somebody joining a room. I seem to recall this also happening when users changed their display names, but I can't reproduce that behavior. Either way, it is nice to have this fix in place!</li>
<li>I worked on closing some of our issues, and I'm happy to report that there are fewer ways to be unpleasantly surprised by the UI. For example, if you have turned on the setting to make emoji-only messages larger, all other emojis will also get a bit of a size boost to make them easier to read.</li>
<li>On that note, I recently went through the issue list and closed a number of outdated issues that had already been fixed, because 260+ issues is obviously too many for any self-respecting project... right? ;)</li>
<li>I also overhauled nheko's behavior when you attempt to use an invalid /command. Originally, nheko would eat any invalid commands (e.g. sending <code>/foo</code> would clear the input box but would not send a message). Now, if you type <code>/foo</code>, you will see a warning informing you that you are about to send a message that says <code>/foo</code> into the chat instead of running a command <code>/foo</code>. If you choose to disregard the warnings and hit Enter, nheko will indeed send a message saying <code>/foo</code>!</li>
</ul>
<p>But that's not all: this week, mtxclient gained the ability to properly handle <code>m.room.message</code> events that have an unknown <code>msgtype</code>. With that in place, I'm working on implementing that on the nheko side. Once this work is done, you will be able to read messages that others send from Element with fireworks! Furthermore, I'm adding a bonus feature to nheko: as a proof-of-concept for fully implementing this unknown message handling, I've got a working implementation of Element's rainfall effect for those of you who like fancy effects! (All the rest of you can just turn those off in the settings, I guess.)</p>
<p>A note for our Mac users: somebody opened <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/1401">an issue</a> last week notifying us that nheko couldn't be installed on OS X 11.1. Nico has fixed this, but you will need to either wait for the next release or install one of our nightly builds (#nheko-nightlies:neko.dev).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el">Ement.el</a>, a Matrix client for the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> text editor and Lisp environment, has been released at v0.7. Changes in this version include:</p>
<p><em>Additions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Command <code>ement-room-override-name</code> sets a local override for a room's display name. (Especially helpful for 1:1 rooms and bridged rooms.  See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3015#issuecomment-1451017296">MSC3015</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Changes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve display of room tombstones (displayed at top and bottom of buffer, and new room ID is linked to join).</li>
<li>Use descriptive prompts in <code>ement-leave-room</code> and <code>ement-forget-room</code> commands.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fixes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Command <code>ement-view-space</code> when called from a room buffer.  (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MagicRB">Richard Bre≈æ√°k</a> for reporting.)</li>
<li>Don't call <code>display-buffer</code> when reverting room list buffer.  (Fixes <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/121">#121</a>.  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mekeor">mekeor</a> for reporting.)</li>
<li>Retry sync for network timeouts. (Accidentally broken in v0.6.) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Internal</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Function <code>ement-put-account-data</code> accepts <code>:room</code> argument to put on a room's account data.</li>

<p>It's been some time since <code>synadm</code> last showed up on TWIM, it was around summer 2022. The biggest news is that <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@martin:matrix.ascurius.com">Ascurius</a> and me just welcomed a new member to the team: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jacksonchen666:jacksonchen666.com">jacksonchen666</a>. We reached out since he seemed to care about <code>synadm</code>. He had submitted a feature but we also caught him tidying up &quot;unloved&quot; issues. He has a good sense for concise solutions and accurate documentation. He runs <a href="https://jacksonchen666.com/">a website</a> and <a href="https://jacksonchen666.com/posts/">a blog</a> where he talks about &quot;things&quot;.</p>
<p>Here's more we'd like to spread:</p>
<ul>
<li>A random list of new commands, <a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index_cli_reference.html">read details in the docs to learn what they do</a>: <code>synadm notice send</code>, <code>synadm user 3pid</code>, <code>synadm user auth-provider</code>, <code>synadm room block/unblock</code> <code>synadm room block-status</code>, <code>synadm media unquarantine</code>, <code>synadm user modify --user-type ...</code>, <code>synadm user deactivate-regex</code>.</li>
<li>A new output mode <code>minified</code> was added and the original <code>json</code> mode was improved to now produce nicely human readable json.</li>
<li>We finally have <a href="https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">a contributing documentation</a> and hope it'll make collaboration with our contributors even better.</li>
<li>We introduced an auto-linter based on <code>flake8</code> into our CI pipeline to catch code formatting issues quicker.</li>
<li>The new <a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">Scripting Examples chapter</a>. Please submit your one-liners or other helpful scripting examples via a pull-request or just let us know in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at">#synadm:peek-a-boo.at</a></li>

<p>By the way, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jacksonchen666:jacksonchen666.com">jacksonchen666</a> searched for <code>synadm</code> occurrences in the TWIM history and we found an article &quot;next to us&quot; about the <a href="https://cfp.summit2022.matrixmeetup.de/matrix-summit-conference-2022/">Matrix Community Summit 2022</a> that took place in Berlin last summer.

<blockquote>
<p>Shortly after releasing <a href="https://effektio.org/whitepaper/">our whitepaper</a> end of last year, Effektio was approached by another organization, who has been building a NGO communication platform for a few years called <a href="https://acter.global">Acter</a>. Acter wanted to move away from their current centralized stack and had found Matrix.org 's Federated Model to be their preferred ideal. Very quickly within the talks that followed it became clear that both organization have the same goals and visions for the future and are perfectly matching in terms of what they already bring and what each lacks: Effektio has the technological stack, expertise and ability to build the product while Acter has existing a network of organizations, partners and even existing users, who are happy to provide feedback. Long story short, we decided to merge both into a newly funded <strong>Acter Association</strong>, which we established Jan 1st, developing the next (third) generation of the Acter Platform (&quot;A3&quot;) on top of the existing effektio tech stack. Since then a major part of our work has been merging all the admin and tech stuff, up to moving the github repo over to <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3">acterglobal/a3</a>, where you will find it from now on.</p>
<p>Next to that, we still have continued working on the product itself. Among other things we have <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/505">merged the first implementation of the Adaptive Layout in A3</a> this week, implemented the next acter object, <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/503">Pins</a>, added <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/522">Rageshake Bug Reporting</a> to the nightly builds, started out with the new <a href="https://docs.acter.global/docs/architecture/templates/">Templates</a> infrastructure and improved our quality assurance by  reactivate rust integration tests, add widget unit tests and a new cucumber desktop tests infrastructure.</p>

<p>Other than spec text fixes in the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc">matrix-spec repo</a>, the Spec Core Team has mainly been focusing on push notifications, push rules and generally improving notifications across Matrix. This includes improving behaviour such as accidentally notifying someone when you mention their name, accidentally notifying people when you reply to a message, accidentally notifying when you edit a message and so on. The relevant MSCs are <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3958">MSC3958</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3873">MSC3873</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3966">MSC3966</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758">MSC3758</a>.</p>

<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3013">MSC3013: Encrypted Push</a>!</p>
<p>When you get a push notification for a new message on your phone, you may wonder how that message travels from your homeserver to you. Typically it isn't done directly - instead, when you receive a message that should notify you, your homeserver will generate a push notification specifically for you, and send this off to a Matrix Push Gateway. That Push Gateway is then configured to send your notification off to a service which knows how to route it to your device. This is usually Apple's Push Notification Service in the case of iOS devices, or Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging service in the case of Android devices (though FCM supports iOS devices too!). Your phone's OS will keep a consistent connection to one of these services if an app has registered for push notifications, and thus you can receive notifications from apps even when your Matrix client is not running.</p>
<p>But doesn't that leak all of your message notifications to Apple or Google? üò± Not quite. While clients can choose to include all contents of a message in a push notification, most instead opt for only including the event's ID. When the push notification containing that event ID reaches your phone, it wakes up a small portion of your Matrix client which goes and fetches the full message content from the homeserver (plus encryption keys if the message needs to be decrypted). This way, you can still get a notification without your Matrix client needing to be open all the time. However, some metadata (such as when you are getting a notification) is still leaked to Apple/Google. Since the third-party service knows the event ID, it can correlate which users are in the same room by cross-referencing event IDs in notifications across multiple users.</p>
<p>It's also a bit of a resource drain that the client needs to go and talk to the homeserver to fetch the full event content. Ideally we'd just include it all in the notification - but then we end up sharing too much information with the push provider!</p>
<p>This MSC proposes a solution; encrypt the message content and send that in the notification! Message contents are encrypted using a public key provided by the client to the homeserver when registering for push notifications. The ciphertext passes through the Push Gateway (which may be run by a separate entity to your homeserver) and the Push Notification service (run by Apple, Google, etc.) and then finally down to your client where it is decrypted without the need for a web request as the private key will just be stored in the client.</p>
<p>And since a separate encryption key is being used per-device, ciphertexts of the same event will differ when encrypted for different users - eliminating the Push Gateway/Push Notification Service from being to correlate notifications across users (timing attacks are still possible, but this can be reduced by introducing a small amount of jitter into when notifications are sent out).</p>
<p>Anyhoo, if you're big on privacy (or security against those running Push Gateway/Notification Services), check out this MSC!</p>

<p>Some notable highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>an update to the command line export data tool</li>
<li>implemented the experimental <code>exact_event_match</code> push rule condition from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758">MSC3758</a></li>
<li>implemented <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3873">MSC3873</a> to disambiguate push rule keys with dots in them.</li>
<li>allow Synapse to use a specific Redis <a href="https://redis.io/commands/select/">logical database</a> in worker-mode deployments.</li>
<li>fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.76 where 5 second delays would occasionally occur in deployments using workers.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>This week, seven additional endpoints from the synapse admin API have been ported to Construct. These include user room listings, account data, devices, pushers, and forward extremities pruning. This week it also became easier for admins to tune database options to meet their needs through the configuration system. To put things into perspective, the server now has 2184 configurable items which can be set by an environment variable. Construct also has 6177 statistical items which can be reported to a Prometheus metrics daemon.</p>
<p>Lastly I would like to share good news on the compatibility front after taking some time to investigate why Construct and Conduit have trouble federating. I reached out with a patchset to the folks over at Ruma and I would like to take this opportunity to commend their hospitality. Their conduct has been nothing short of diplomatic, giving confidence we can now iron out any kinks in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The team maintaining matrix-js-sdk are currently discussing deprecation of the browserify-based distribution channel. By our current analysis, usage seems fairly low while at the same time it's posing drastic technological challenges to us during the integration of matrix-rust-sdk's cryptography module. If you are a current user of the browserified release of the SDK, we'd like to hear from you in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/issues/3189.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>mautrix-go has had e2ee support for a few years already, but previously the interface was quite difficult to use for making bots and other small programs, as it required implementing parts of the storage and other things manually. That has changed with the upcoming 0.15 release, which adds a crypto helper that can handle everything for you with just a few extra lines of code. The documentation is unfortunately not great yet, but the <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/go/blob/master/example/main.go">example</a> has been updated to use the new helper, so it should be a decent starting point for writing e2ee-capable bots in Go (and if it explodes, you can ask for help in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#:maunium.net">#:maunium.net</a>)</p>

<p>I'm excited to share that I've made significant progress on my Elm SDK for Matrix! Last time, I mentioned that a version 1.0.0 release was approaching, and today I have great news - I've got a working MVP! While it's not ready for use yet, it's a significant step forward.</p>
<p>To give you a taste of what the SDK can do, I've written some simple code that demonstrates how to use it to authenticate with a Matrix server and send messages to a room. Take a look:</p>
<pre data-lang="elm" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-elm "><code class="language-elm" data-lang="elm"><span style="color:#608b4e;">-- Example code from the MVP of the new Elm SDK for Matrix

</span></code></pre>
<p>I've built an incredibly basic client that managed to compress to under 36kB (for scale: Hydrogen is around 748kB) of gzipped JavaScript. The final version will be a bit larger, but this SDK might make way for very compact asset sizes.</p>

            <p>Greetings Matrix fans! We've published Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.78.0">version 1.78</a>
as the new stable release this week. Synapse admins are encouraged to upgrade
to it at their convenience. Please take a look at the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.78/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1780">upgrade notes</a>
for any important information about upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="announcements">Announcements</h2>
<p>Please note that Synapse 1.78.0 replaces the <code>/_synapse/admin/v1/media/&lt;server_name&gt;/delete</code> admin API with an identical
endpoint at <code>/_synapse/admin/v1/media/delete</code>. Please update your tooling to use the new endpoint. The deprecated version
will be removed in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-stuff">The new stuff</h2>
<p>In case you were unaware, Synapse has a command line export data command which allows administrators to export data for
a specific user (you can read more about this command <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_faq.html#how-can-i-export-user-data">here</a>).
Synapse 1.78.0 updates this command adding account data to the user information that is returned by the export data command.</p>
<p>This version of Synapse also features a few changes to push rules, with implementations for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758">MSC3758</a>:
Add <code>event_property_is push</code> rule condition kind,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3966">MSC3966</a>: <code>event_property_contains</code> push rule condition, and the removal of the spurious <code>dont_notify</code>
action from the defaults for the <code>.m.rule.reaction</code> pushrule. These changes empower end users to more fully customise their
notification rules - MSC3758 allows users to ask to be notified when a field in an event contains any type of value, rather
than only matching on strings, and MSC3966 provides crucial scaffolding for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3952">MSC3952</a>: Intentional Mentions,
which aims to eliminate unintentional mentions and improve the experience of mentions in general.</p>
<p>Synapse v1.78.0 includes some fixes for faster-joins related bugs as we work out the kinks. Some of these include a fix
for a bug introduced in Synapse 1.76.0 where partially-joined rooms could not be deleted using the
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#delete-room-api">purge room API</a>, and
a fix for a bug introduced in Synapse 1.75 where the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/postgres.html#porting-from-sqlite">portdb script</a>
would fail to run after a room had been faster-joined. We continue to work to polish faster joins, and thank everyone who
filed an issue.</p>
<p>Finally, for those deployments using workers, v1.78.0 fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.76 where 5s delays would
occasionally occur.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>See the full <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.78.0">changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in the release. Also please have a look at the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.78/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1780">upgrade
notes</a>.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our
thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular
order): jahway603, williamkray, 999lakhisidhu, hari01584, saddfox, dklimpel, realtyem

<p>Howdy, welcome to another week in Synapse-land. We've released  v1.78.0rc1
with some cool bugfixes and features. Some notable additions in this version are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a long-standing bug where the room aliases returned could be corrupted. </li>
<li>Fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.76.0 where partially-joined rooms could not be deleted using the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#delete-room-api">purge room API</a>. </li>
<li>Fixed a long-standing bug where federated joins would fail if the first server in the list of servers to try is not in the room.</li>
<li>Implement the experimental <code>exact_event_match</code> push rule condition from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758">MSC3758</a>.</li>
<li>Added account data to the command line <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.78/usage/administration/admin_faq.html#how-can-i-export-user-data">user data export tool</a></li>
</ul>
<p>and much more! Take a closer look <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases">here</a> in the release notes and have a happy Friday.</p>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's been progress in several areas for Construct 0.9 this week, cut with 71 new commits. First I'd like to give special thanks for @bgiovanni for continuing to drive the progress this week; they have on several occasions been able to navigate the codebase and the specification to provide concise reports so I can fix anything in mere minutes. I hope we can keep this up.</p>
<p>Construct can now be configured to purge a room from the database after the last local user leaves. This week I also took the plunge on implementing a controversial clause in the specification which requires a server to broadcast a join event on behalf of another server. This is problematic because it's technically an amplification attack, so I've done my best to narrow the conditions for when to actually perform this: only if the counter-party is not already joined, and only if Construct has an alias set for the room being joined.</p>
<p>In other news, I <a href="https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio/pull/1215">fixed a bug</a> in <code>boost::asio</code> but since that won't land for a while and Construct's <code>io_uring(7)</code> might be susceptible on Arch and Gentoo <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/commit/884c2e68b71c92d223d312f60f35b9be81960a8c">I hacked a workaround</a> just for us, especially since the old <code>epoll(7)</code> + <code>aio(7)</code> makes my desktop much less responsive (I can't believe I dealt with that for years!).</p>
<p>Next week Yan Minari might have a deeper look at Sytest and Complement integration and maybe mdad, while I plan on implementing local room policies and user management to make Construct safe for public registration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello all! Fractal 4.4.2-beta2 is available on Flathub Beta.</p>
<p>You read correctly, it's not Fractal 5 yet. This is a maintenance release that fixes the compilation of Fractal 4.4 with recent libraries and allows to build the Flatpak with the latest GNOME runtime. That means no more warning that the GNOME 41 runtime is outdated!</p>
<p>There are no new features, but since we updated a lot of Rust dependencies we preferred to release a beta version before using it to update our stable release to the latest runtime. So please test it and if no major regression is reported, we will release it as stable in two weeks.</p>
<p>To get it, run the following commands:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo
</span><span>flatpak install flathub-beta org.gnome.Fractal
</span><span>flatpak run --branch=beta org.gnome.Fractal
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that if you always want to use this beta version instead of the stable one, and run it from the icon in your launcher, you will need to change its desktop file to use the command in the last line.</p>
<p>See you soon with some news regarding Fractal 5 hopefully!</p>

The widget allows to plan meetings, invite other users, configure meetings rooms, view your calendar, and perform video conferences.
All data is stored in Matrix, no external service required. As the Widget API is a bit limited for this use-cases, it's a combination of a widget and a bot.</p>

<p>If you didn't already catch it this week, Gitter has fully migrated to Matrix! üòé</p>
<p>We brought over all of the historical Gitter content to the <code>gitter.im</code> homeserver and gave everyone free rein over it via <a href="https://app.gitter.im/">app.gitter.im</a>, a Gitter branded Element instance.</p>
<p>Of course, since it's Matrix, you can use whatever client you want to access your public, private and one to one (now DM) conversations!</p>

<h2 id="ietf-mimi-dma">IETF/MIMI/DMA</h2>
<p>With the Extensible Events Core (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) being accepted last week, the focus now turns to all the other extensible event MSCs for images, files, etc. How does extensible events relate to IETF/MIMI/DMA, you ask? In our mission for having Matrix be the standard for interoperability, we need a content format that works for everyone. Events prior to MSC1767 <em>could</em> work with enough effort, though MSC1767's system makes things <em>a lot</em> easier when representing arbitrarily complex messaging features.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to TWIM for progress in this area. It's a relatively slow process, but we're working through it.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>This week's random MSC is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2785">MSC2785: Event notification attributes and actions</a>! This is effectively a replacement for the push rules system we have today, and a super interesting one (how do you even design a notifications system?). Focus has shifted a little bit since this MSC was first opened, though its ideas still comes up frequently when aiming to make smaller changes to push rules today.</p>

<p>We released another breaking change this week :p bump to v0.17.0</p>
<p>Introduced a couple of new features like upgrading voice calls to video calls, some neat helper functions for group calls. Fixes include cleaning group call state events, fixing the searchEvent function, a way to get own profile from server and then fallback to room profile and also fixes to the /markasdm command.</p>
<p>Complete changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>fix: ability to upgrade audio calls to video calls (td)</li>
<li>chore: add a fetchOwnProfileFromServer method which tries to get ownProfile from server first, disk then (td)</li>
<li>fix: clean expired member state events in group calls (td)</li>
<li>fix: hasActiveGroup call now checks all group calls (td)</li>
<li>fix: Check if argument is valid mxid in /maskasdm command (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>fix: Fake User object (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>fix: Request key in searchEvent method crashes because of wrong preconditions (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>refactor: Check config at file sending after placing fake event and add error handling (Krille)</li>
<li>chore: bump dart to 2.18 (Nicolas Werner)</li>
<li>fix: setMicrophoneMuted is now async to match setVideoMuted (td)</li>
<li>fix: implement activeGroupCallEvents to get all active group call state events in a room (td)</li>
<li>refactor: (BREAKING CHANGE) move staleCallChecker and expires_Ts stuff to an extension on Room, instead of Voip because it makes much more sense per room rather than on voip, also makes testing easier (td)</li>
<li>fix: populate local groupCalls list on instantiating VOIP() (td)</li>
<li>fix: starting stale call checker is now handled by the sdk itself because clients can forget to do so (td)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>It's been a while since our last update in November, but it just means we have been busier than ever! A lot has happened to follow changes in the Matrix specification as well as fixing bugs in our codebase or making our API easier to use.</p>
<p>We have released Ruma 0.8.0 and 0.8.1 at the beginning of the month. It was long overdue with a lot of improvements, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stabilized support for all the changes and features of Matrix 1.4 and Matrix 1.5</li>
<li>Making our request types use owned instead of borrowed data</li>
<li>Replacing <code>ruma_api!</code> with more flexible macros</li>
<li>Fixing the serialization and deserialization of redacted events</li>
<li>Reorganizing our <code>*EventContent</code> traits to allow event content types to only implement what is really needed</li>
<li>Removing sensitive data from the <code>Debug</code>-format representation of our types </li>
</ul>
<p>And on the 15th we released Ruma 0.8.2 with a few bug fixes but also stabilized support for all the changes and features of Matrix 1.6!</p>
<p>Although it might be less visible in our changelogs, we also regularly add support for MSCs, and try to keep our implementations up-to-date. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sliding sync (MSC3575 and others, currently used by Element X via the matrix-rust-sdk)</li>
<li>Extensible events (MSC1767 and others)</li>
<li>Push rule condition for room version features (MSC3931 and MSC3932)</li>

            <p>Greetings Matrix fans! We've published Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.77.0">version 1.77</a>
as the new stable release this week. Synapse admins are encouraged to upgrade
to it at their convenience.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-stuff">The new stuff</h2>
<h3 id="experimental-support-for-intentional-mentions-msc3952">Experimental support for intentional mentions (MSC3952)</h3>
<p>Mentioning other users on Matrix is difficult: it is not possible to know if mentioning a user
by display name or Matrix ID will count as a mention, but is also too easy to mistakenly mention a user.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3952">MSC3952</a> proposes a solution. Its idea is to make the mentioning explicit in the protocol using a dedicated event property,
instead of relying on searching the body of the message as before.</p>
<p>Synapse now implements this as an experimental feature.</p>
<h3 id="experimental-support-to-suppress-notifications-from-message-edits-msc3958">Experimental support to suppress notifications from message edits (MSC3958)</h3>
<p>Have you ever been annoyed by a noisy notification that keep coming back, but you can't pinpoint
where it's coming from?
This is usually because edits to a message where you are mentioned (or that mention <code>@room</code>) will
retrigger a noisy notification. That can be pretty annoying when the message is edited 10 times!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3958">MSC3958</a>
is here to solve that, and Synapse now implements it as an experimental feature.</p>
<h3 id="the-quest-for-speed-continues">The quest for speed continues!</h3>
<p>Some iterative optimizations have been implemented that should make <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14971">joining or leaving</a>
large rooms even faster, and should also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14962">improve sending message</a>.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>See the full <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.77.0">changelog</a>, for a
complete list of changes in the release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our
thanks to everyone who contributed to these releases, including (in no particular
order) icp1994, dklimpel, Fizzadar and realtyem.</p>
<p>We are also grateful to anyone helping us make Synapse better by sharing their
feedback and reporting issues, or helping with community support questions.</p>

            <p>Hey all,</p>
<p><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/">Matrix 1.6</a> is out there! Like Matrix 1.5 <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/11/17/matrix-v-1-5-release">back in November</a>, this release is largely a maintenance update. Matrix 1.1 through 1.4 have been relatively major upgrades, so a little time between features doesn‚Äôt feel like a bad idea :)</p>
<p>As with all spec releases, we encourage implementations to gradually update over the next few months rather than have support for everything on release day - please be kind to the projects you use, and help them gain support if able.</p>
<p>Matrix 1.6 sees just 7 MSCs get merged, though this is to be expected from a maintenance release. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPJ9zFV5IE">Matthew‚Äôs Matrix 2.0 talk</a> at FOSDEM for an idea of what‚Äôs expected over the next few releases.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve covered a couple of the MSCs below, but read on to the full changelog for the full picture.</p>
<h2 id="msc3030-jump-to-date-api">MSC3030: Jump to date API</h2>
<p>_It‚Äôs here! The time machine we‚Äôve been waiting for! _</p>
<p>Primarily part of the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Gitter feature parity project</a> (congratulations to the team <a href="https://blog.gitter.im/2023/02/13/gitter-has-fully-migrated-to-matrix/">going all-in on Matrix</a>, by the way) to drive the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive">Matrix Public Archive</a>, the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1roomsroomidtimestamp_to_event">new API</a> gives clients the ability to jump back in time to a nearby event. Being able to find something that was posted on a given day/week, but not being sure of which keywords to look for is a major usability improvement - many thanks to the Gitter team for making Matrix better!</p>
<h2 id="msc3706-faster-joins-part-1">MSC3706: Faster joins (part 1)</h2>
<p><em>Matrix is going voom</em></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/01/31/synapse-1-76-released">Synapse 1.76</a> enabled faster joins by default, and while there‚Äôs a lot of Python going into making joins as fast as possible, the specification side is a relatively small change at the moment: <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/server-server-api/#put_matrixfederationv2send_joinroomideventid">just don‚Äôt send as many events during joins</a> (<code>omit_members</code>).</p>
<p>There‚Äôs potentially more work on the horizon for making faster joins even faster and more robust, and some of that might involve spec work: keep an eye on Synapse releases and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix">TWIM</a> for updates as we make our way to faster joins in Matrix 2.0 :)</p>
<h2 id="the-full-changelog">The full changelog</h2>
<p>MSCs are how the spec changes in the way it does - adding, fixing, and maintaining features for the whole ecosystem to use. Check out the full changelog below, and the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/proposals/">Spec Change Proposals</a> page for more information on how these MSCs got merged (hint: they submitted a proposal, which anyone can do - take a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkZz60RRfc">Matrix Live episode</a> where Matthew covers the proposal process).</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>In keeping with our (roughly) quarterly release schedule of the Matrix Spec, v1.6 is due to be released on February 14th. That's only four days from now! The headline features are a new Jump-to-Date Client-Server API (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>) and initial work on speeding up room joins (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706">MSC3706</a>), along with many other fixes and clarifications to the spec text itself.</p>
<p>If you haven't yet seen it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPJ9zFV5IE">Matthew's Matrix 2.0 talk</a> at FOSDEM walks through some of the upcoming features in the spec. Each will land in subsequent, future releases of the spec. Once all have landed, we'll call that Matrix 2.0 (in name and in actual version number).</p>
<p>Extensible events is one such upcoming feature. While the core proposal outlining the feature (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) will land in v1.6, the smattering of MSCs which describe how various event types will work under extensible events will span multiple upcoming spec versions. Watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2974">MSC2974: Widgets: Capabilities re-exchange</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC is relatively simple; proposing a method for widgets to ask the client for additional capabilities after it has already been initialised. Doing so allows for increased security and privacy workflows, as the widget need only ask for access to certain pieces of data at the point that it needs it (rather than all up front).</p>
<p>A similar transition of permission granting happened in mobile devices and apps. Initially mobile apps would ask for all permissions they would need up front - which users would blindly accept. These days, mobile OS's have shifted to a model where individual permissions are requested upon attempting to complete an action in an app. This way, users have better context on the reason for the permissions request. (Oddly, browsers have yet to reach this stage with extensions - those still ask for all permissions up front.)</p>
<p>Do check out the proposal and its technical details if widgets are your thing!</p>

<p>The UK Online Safety Bill is shaping up to be a catastrophic piece of legislation, mandating clientside scanning of end-to-end-encrypted communication to attempt to intercept CSAM (child sexual abuse material). By adding the requirement for a scanner which executes ambiguous rulesets to submit encrypted content to the authorities, it would massively undermine the security of encryption: you simply wouldn't be able to trust whether content stays encrypted, or the rules used to scan it and submit it to the authorities. We wrote about it at https://element.io/blog/the-online-safety-bill-an-attack-on-encryption/ to try to sound the alarm before it's too late.</p>

<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>/sync</code> is now using significantly less database round trips when using Postgres, resulting in faster initial syncs, allowing larger accounts to login again</li>
<li>Many under the hood pinecone improvements</li>
<li>Publishing rooms is now possible again</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a Dendrite homeserver, staying up-to-date is highly recommended so please upgrade when you can. Otherwise, if you want to play with Dendrite without having to set up your own infrastructure, the dendrite.matrix.org homeserver is open for registration (upon completion of a CAPTCHA, so you may need to register using Element Web).</p>
<p>As always, please feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for related discussion.</p>

<p>Although having lost a lot of popularity in the last few years, <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> has a great performance and tiny asset size, which means great Matrix support for tiny browsers like on <a href="https://www.kaiostech.com/">KaiOS</a> or for small-size projects and games that wish to use Matrix as a simple back-end.</p>
<p>I hope to release a version v1.0.0 in the near future, but I wanted to share my first breakthrough as I managed to write a simple program that sends message (and state) events in versions that the homeserver supports. See the image below!</p>
<p>Support will mostly be from spec version v1.2 and on, but some legacy endpoints will remain available. You can find the project on <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk">GitHub</a> for now. Hopefully I'll have more to show you in the next few weeks!

<p>Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org">Ivan, the Language Mangler</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in the Rust SDK team is a bit special. We are making our farewells to Ben, as he is leaving Element. He will continue to hang around as its new gig involves Matrix, feel free to take a glance at <a href="https://effektio.org/">Effektio</a>. Once our tears have dried, we carried on with our current main focus: Sliding Sync, and Crypto.
The Sliding Sync client has seen improvements in terms of documentation, along with some clean ups, and stabilisation patches (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1439">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1440">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1449">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1482">4</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1467">5</a>‚Ä¶). The team has decided it's time to write a small testing framework to improve the safety of this code specifically. Indeed, it's quite challenging to test it, and as it's a fundamental piece of the user experience in ElementX and other Matrix clients, there is no debate to have: the quality requirements are high.
The Crypto part now. The Crypto Store has been refactored a little bit (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1477">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1457">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1462">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1465">4</a>‚Ä¶). There is other patches to handle inconsistencies if they happen, and to always mark our own device as verified (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1452">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1456">2</a>).
Apart from that, they have been many work on setting and exposing OpenTelemetry logs for multiple clients and platforms. It will help the teams to coordinate on bugs when they happen.
Finally, a new release of the <code>matrix-sdk-crypto-js</code> has landed: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1444">v0.1.0-alpha.4</a>.
Outside Matrix itself, we have a merge window for <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">the uniffi-async project</a>, along with more contributions to improve errors (<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1468">1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1467">2</a>). It means that the bindings to Swift and Kotlin will soon support native Rust async functions. More contributions are in the pipe to generate documentations for the foreign languages (Swift, Kotlin etc.) directly from Rust documentations.
I will conclude by saying that we were also quite busy preparing the demos for FOSDEM. It was a huge success and it makes us extremely happy :-).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 2017, <a href="https://t2bot.io/">t2bot.io</a> has provided communities on Matrix bots and bridges to use for free, and while there‚Äôs no plan to charge for access, the cost of running the service is about $12k USD/year just to exist.</p>
<p>Since August 2020, t2bot.io‚Äôs primary source of funding has been from the Matrix.org Foundation, though with the Foundation‚Äôs latest focus on raising funds for itself, it feels like the right thing to do is get t2bot.io independently funded.</p>
<p><strong>If you are able, please donate to t2bot.io <a href="https://t2bot.io/donations/">here</a>.</strong> All donations go towards the cost of operation, with any excess (if t2bot.io is so lucky‚Ä¶) going towards hiring developers to work on/build bridges as well as into the Foundation to thank them for keeping t2bot.io online all these years.</p>
<p>Currently, t2bot.io serves <em>86 thousand</em> Discord and Telegram communities, bridging 325 thousand users <em>each month</em>, and <em>11.3 million</em> users since 2017. There‚Äôs also 962 thousand rooms with a t2bot.io user in them, leaving only about 94 thousand rooms as archived, across 25 thousand different homeservers.</p>
<p>Operating at this scale requires, well, $12k USD per year: if you‚Äôre able, please consider donating. There‚Äôs also a question of whether t2bot.io should even be operating at this scale in the first place: Matrix is all about decentralization and owning your own conversations, which naturally means there should be many smaller bridges for communities or even a discord.com-provided bridge for everyone to use. For the time being though, t2bot.io is offered as a convenience and aims to adapt itself as needed to keep providing value.</p>
<p>Questions, concerns, etc are best discussed in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#help:t2bot.io">#help:t2bot.io</a> on Matrix. Nearly every detail of how t2bot.io works is intended to be shared openly, which includes the financial aspect of running the service, so ask away üôÇ</p>

<h4 id="fosdem23-community-meetup-matrix-org"><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org">#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org</a></h4>
<p>Exactly one week ago, a good chunk of the community gathered in Brussels for the <strong>Matrix Community Meetup/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a></strong> in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/fringe/">fringe</a> of FOSDEM.</p>
<p>While we expected the need for everyone to just meet and exchange their ideas, we still wanted to provide a framework for things to get going.
After a &quot;quick&quot; introductory round of everyone presenting themselves and their connection to Matrix, constantly expanding the circle around the table as more people kept pouring through the <a href="https://hsbxl.be/enter">pink gate</a>, we built a timetable of topics from the introduction using the <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-barcamp/tree/nic/env/fosdem-2023">BarCamp Widget</a> developed and slightly modified for the physical BarCamp use case by Nordeck.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/hFUNxEWMiTLgMXRzZzWKfyRt.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Having this way to find people to discuss a topic was a great way to get started, and the discussions quickly took their own directions from there. Highlights included discussions about topics very dear to some people and finding others who are also interested, deep dives into the protocol, brainstorming, or even meeting random strangers on the (notoriously packed) tram to have technical discussions with. A lot of online friends connected, a lot of new friends were made, and even some old friends got to reconnect. It felt very familiar very quickly and leaving Ananace feeling &quot;I've spoken to more friendly and passionate people this last week than I've done for the last six months, that's for certain.&quot; DMs were opened and master keys were cross signed thanks to IRL QR code scanning. Drinks were drunk, Pizza was eaten, and Swedish candy was appreciated to the fullest extent. The scenery only added to the real REAL hackerspace experience, having to <del>make a call</del> ping on Matrix to have someone open the gate to the &quot;desolated courtyard, surrounded by crumbling buildings with broken windows&quot; and a door literally labeled &quot;A&quot;.</p>

Further, we would like to thank <a href="https://famedly.com">Famedly</a> and <a href="https://nordeck.net">Nordeck</a> who's generosity enabled us to provide free-as-in-beer food üçï and drinks üçª to everyone at the event through their financial support.</p>
<p>We are overjoyed by the incredible response by the community. Most of the people came there for a reason, and that was Matrix. And then they used the time to have some good time together. It was nice that we could help satisfy the huge demand for a get-together in the meat-space with this event.
We look forward to more physical meetups in the future (watch this space!).
Personally I had the best FOSDEM ever, and not just because it was my first one! üòâ</p>

            <p>For the past two years, FOSDEM couldn‚Äôt happen in-person. Fortunately we could
help, and Matrix hosted the world's largest free &amp; open source software
conference online! This year we were finally back in-person‚Ä¶ but not only.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/15/how-we-hosted-fosdem-2021-on-matrix">The set-up we have arranged in 2021</a>
and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/07/hosting-fosdem-2022-on-matrix">polished in 2022</a>
has proved to be robust and served us well during the pandemic. Returning to an
in-person conference didn‚Äôt mean we had to throw it all away‚Ä¶ quite the
opposite!</p>
<p>This year the OSS community could gather in-person, go see each other‚Äôs stands,
and attend all too few of all the fascinating talks the speakers had prepared
for us‚Ä¶ but the conference was yet more.. Some of us couldn‚Äôt make it in person
but could attend FOSDEM online from its Matrix Space. Devrooms were broadcasted
live into the Matrix rooms where devroom managers and speakers could interact
with the online audience.</p>
<p>In total, thousands of users joined us online, both locally and remotely as 
seen from the FOSDEM homeserver: an amazing audience given the possibility to be
on site.</p>
<p>For us, it was also an opportunity to announce Matrix 2.0 to a live audience!
Matrix 2.0 doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre making breaking changes in the spec. It‚Äôs more of
a nickname we gave to the milestone <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/08/15/the-matrix-summer-special-2022#matrix-20">we had promised in summer to deliver by the
end of the year</a>
and had far too much giving the mother of all demos to a packed room of nearly
1500 people.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-ever-in-person-matrix-devroom">The first ever in-person Matrix devroom</h2>
<p>This year was also the first ever in-person devroom for the Matrix Foundation
and Community. We had many proposals and could have used the whole day, but we
had to share with many other deserving communities. We‚Äôre extremely grateful to
FOSDEM organisers for the devroom‚Ä¶ and it was a huge success! At many points the
room was completely packed, with no seats left at all.</p>
<p>We could <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/matrix/">shoehorn 8 talks</a> in
the in-person devroom. Picking them was really difficult! When one of the
speakers unfortunately called in sick, the devroom healed the wound and filled
the gap very quickly.</p>
<p>The devroom started with a quick intro to Matrix from Matthew &amp; Amandine.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dPgYy-Y4f7w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Florian followed with a talk about MatrixRTC to explore what Matrix can do
beyond instant messaging</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P--LwIB3deA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Then Matthew did an awesome demo of Third Room and ‚Äú3D widgets‚Äù (user generated
content) that can be embedded into its worlds. Of course with a nice ‚ÄúThe Matrix
in Matrix‚Äù scene.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nG8qJ4on00Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Stunning 3D worlds are great, but the most popular use case for Matrix today is
instant messaging. And we did a lot as the Matrix Foundation to significantly
improve the performance with Sliding Sync, using matrix-rust-sdk as the showcase
implementation. Kegan and Ben covered Sliding Sync and matrix-rust-sdk
respectively, while Mauro showed us how Element X, the first client to use it,
doesn‚Äôt stop here and goes way beyond to provide a snappy, sturdy, polished
client.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5iIs1zWuVOU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Kim and Oliver from Nordeck made an interesting presentation about how widgets
can make Matrix a rich app creation environment.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hhEUe414scU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The Trixnity project then introduced their fast, multi-purpose, well-tested SDK.
A talk you don‚Äôt want to miss, particularly if you‚Äôre into Kotlin.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zDftIZm-DZ0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Pierre from Technostructures introduced us to <a href="https://technostructures.org/projects/kazarma/">Kazarma</a>
a bridge between Matrix and ActivityPub. In Pierre‚Äôs own words: ‚Äúwe talked a lot
about interoperability, and we found it sad that we talked about
interoperability for proprietary platforms, not with alternative decentralised
networks, so we tried doing that‚Äù. And they did. Bravo Pierre and the team!</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3olH1aUCkQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Finally Yan concluded the in-person devroom with a speedrun of all the Matrix
projects he could find around. The video is not out yet, so we‚Äôll add it to the
second follow-up blog post: the one with the online devroom conferences!</p>
<h2 id="matrix-for-more-than-remote-attendance">Matrix for more than remote attendance</h2>
<p>FOSDEM staff used the Matrix rooms for on-site support. Whether the camera was
blurry, microphones didn‚Äôt work, or there was a missing power plug: staff could
be notified and answer very quickly before sending someone to actually solve the
issue. But it also allowed staff to notify devroom managers for small
adjustments, if speakers ever disappeared from the scene.</p>
<p>Staff also told us Matrix worked much more reliably than anything other than
walkie talkies from a coordination perspective and was more versatile. They
consider narrowing down their use of walkies next year in favour of a deeper
integration with Matrix. We‚Äôre excited to see that Matrix was yet again a great
solution in the stressful, high paced context of a conference that gathered
several thousand people in-person and several thousand more online.</p>
<h2 id="attending-in-person">Attending in-person</h2>
<p>Finally, a large part of the joy of attending FOSDEM comes from the people you
meet there. The least we can say is that our stand was busy. We ran out of
stickers and medium size t-shirts early on Sunday morning, but above all we had
plenty of interesting discussions.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/fosdem2023_stand_blurred.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>A few people discovered Matrix during FOSDEM and were blown away by messages
making it from Slack to Discord before their eyes, all thanks to Matrix and
bridges. The overwhelming majority of people who came to us were already happy
users willing to discuss architecture, our plans for the future, or even to
verify each other with QR Codes or emoji.</p>
<p>We want to thank the FOSDEM staff for organising this edition and using Matrix
again: a successful return to the in-person format that builds on the online
experience of the past two years. See you next year folks!</p>

<p>I managed to find some time to commit <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/develop/contrib/lnav"><code>lnav</code> configuration files for Synapse</a> this week. <code>lnav</code> is a log-viewing tool with too many bells and whistles for its own good. I particularly like it because it can interleave multiple log files by timestamp, and highlight log lines based on their severity. If you spend a lot of time looking at logs, these things can lower your blood pressure. Take a look if you think you'd find it useful.</p>

<p>Hello TWIM! It's another week and here at Synapse we released
v1.76.0. The big news for this release is that faster joins are now 
enabled by default. It has arrived üöÄ! In addition, some other notable 
features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the default room version to v10</li>
<li>Added a <code>set_displayname()</code> method to the module API for setting a user's display name</li>
<li>Implemented support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3890">MSC3890</a>: Remotely silence local notifications</li>
<li>Implemented experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3930">MSC3930</a>: Push rules for (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3381">MSC3381</a>) Polls</li>
<li>Add index to improve performance of the <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> endpoint used for jumping to a specific date in the timeline of a room</li>
</ul>
<p>and much more! You can read all about it <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.76.0">here</a>. Also, please note that the upgrade from 1.75 to 1.76 changes the account data replication streams in a backwards-incompatible manner. Server operators running a multi-worker deployment should consult <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.76/docs/upgrade.md#changes-to-the-account-data-replication-streams">the upgrade notes</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<h1 id="nheko">Nheko</h1>
<p>We did a lot of work on our markdown input this week. mauke finally fixed those pesky links with a closing parenthesis at the end from dropping that when linkified, without breaking links inside parentheses. Yes, it is still a regex and possibly outlawed in many civilized countries for having detrimental side-effects on society, but it works, so who am I to argue! Additionally we changed the newline behaviour (and fixed a bug related to line-breaks as well). A single line-break now corresponds to a line-break. You can find more about that decision <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@deepbluev7/109771668066978726">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/757">here</a>. You can opt out of that behaviour and other changes we do to the default cmark/commonmark behaviour using the new <code>/cmark</code> command. Speaking of other changes, we now support <code>||warning|spoiler||</code> as a way to enter spoilers, with the warning being optional as well as <code>~~text~~</code> for strike-through.</p>
<p>There is also now a workaround for Wayland users, who were bothered by stuck menus. This still needs to be fixed in Qt eventually, but in the meantime you can now close menus by clicking somewhere inside of Nheko thanks to a contribution by enigma9o7. Decodetalkers also made Nheko clean up notifications on exit and the fullscreen image overlay hide, when the save dialog is open. You can create DMs by pasting an mxid again now. Previously you needed to delete and re-enter the last character... The username completer should also now open around twice as fast and clicking notifications now once again restores Nheko from the tray. The last goodie was contributed by Malte. The invite dialog inside a room can now search for users you have a DM open or the server side userdirectory for suggestions.</p>
<p>Also, I am attending FOSDEM, so let's see if you can find me!

<h1 id="matrix-call-multitrack-recorder">Matrix Call Multitrack recorder</h1>
<p>Resulting from some past discussion of how matrix live may be improved, I did open https://github.com/vector-im/element-call/issues/789 to support multitrack recordings of participants.
However, it turns out this can quite easily be solved using a bot:</p>
<p>Therefor https://git.nordgedanken.dev/mtrnord/matrix-call-multitrack-recorder has been created. This is an early alpha bot using matrix-nio which can participate in both legacy WebRTC matrix native calls and Element-Call style calls.
Its purpose is to record each stream of a user to either a WAV or mp4 file.</p>
<p>However, since this is very early, it should be noted there currently exist some UX issues and some features are missing.</p>

<p>Most profoundly sliding sync has been upgraded to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1399">latest JSON schema with named views</a> giving the team time to test that before shipping it to a wider audience post FOSDEM. In spirit of that, a first version of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1390">sqlite-based crypto-store has also been merged</a>.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I've written a small bot-api in Rust that used (and still uses) Fractals Matrix-implementation. Since that has been abandoned <em>quite</em> a while ago, I wanted to look into porting my crate to the matrix-rust-sdk. As it turns out, there wouldn't really be any point in doing so. The SDK can be used more or less directly. Which I've learned, by writing a small <a href="https://github.com/msirringhaus/matrix_exif_bot">demo-bot</a>.</p>
<p>This rather simple bot parses the exif-data of pictures that are posted, extracts the GPS-data (if available) and replies with a Matrix location-event for the image location. The plan was to do this with threads, but the SDK sadly doesn't support those. So good old replies it is.
As a bonus, which turned out to be uglier than I thought, it'll also remove it's location-posts automatically, if the corresponding image gets removed.
Configurable autojoin on invite and a command to leave are implemented as well.</p>
