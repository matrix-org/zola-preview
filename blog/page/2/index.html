<p>This last week the core team has been working on Linearized Matrix, which now exists in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3995">MSC form</a>. The idea is still very much in flux, but the MSC covers a large part of the backing context for the overall approach. More detail about IETF116, Linearized Matrix, and the overall mission can be found in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/03/31/this-week-in-matrix-2023-03-31#spec-updates">last week's TWIM</a>, and we're happy to answer any questions in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> on Matrix.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Spec Core Team (SCT) has been focusing on Matrix 2.0 MSCs for OIDC, VoIP, etc alongside quite a few other smaller MSCs. You can follow along with the SCT's weekly priorities in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> room on Matrix.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>Today's random proposal is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3860">MSC3860: Media Download Redirects</a>! Quite a few medium-large servers use a CDN of some kind to host media shared in rooms, and currently the usefulness of that CDN is diminished by servers not necessarily being able to tell clients that the media is actually found on another URL. This proposal formalizes HTTP 307 redirects, and the SCT is interested to hear if this will break any clients - check it out, leave some comments, and let us know :)</p>

<h3 id="construct-website">Construct (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">website</a>)</h3>
<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct features a Github webhook bot built into the server as a loadable module. This is something which existed from the very first days of the project and something I've worked on intermittently. For those that don't remember shortly after reactions were released in Riot, Construct was the first to make use of them as status indicators for continuous integration by reacting with üü° and üü¢. Sometime later we were one-upped by the creativity of the folks over at #nheko whose bot sends a very baroque set of reactions for individual Gitlab jobs.</p>
<p>Last week Construct added a rather large Docker image matrix both for release consumption and to replace the the Appveyor CI. I'm sad to see Appveyor go since only a couple weeks ago they were very helpful with a support ticket of mine, but our needs now have exceeded that and I prefer to do things myself.</p>
<p>This week I'd like to present Construct's live-action continuous-integration status bar. Each box is actually a clickable hyperlink to the Github actions page, so when something turns red you can find the error.</p>
<p>If you're interested in a demonstration, I would have some screencasts but nothing I've tried yet seems to work in wayland. As always, feel free to check out <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> for a live demonstration of the real thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2 id="quaternion-0-0-96-beta">Quaternion 0.0.96 beta</h2>
<p>The first beta of Quaternion's new version has been published earlier this week, with (still work-in-progress and incomplete at the moment) E2EE support as the main highlight. The release notes can be found at <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/tree/0.0.96-beta1">the usual place at GitHub</a>. Most of the changes are actually due to using libQuotient 0.7 under the hood so it's a short read this time; but make sure to check <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.7.0#user-content-e2ee">the E2EE section in the library release notes</a> (two key things: don't use encryption if it's the only device you're logged in from, and don't expect Quaternion to decrypt historical messages). Translators are welcome to update the strings at <a href="https://app.lokalise.com/project/730769035bbc328c31e863.62506391">the usual place</a> (you only need strings tagged <code>dev</code>).</p>
<p>For this beta, both the pre-built packages at GitHub and the Flatpak (NB: you have to use the Flathub <a href="https://discourse.flathub.org/t/how-to-use-flathub-beta/2111">beta channel</a> to get it) have E2EE switched on and you <em>cannot</em> turn it off; so please don't use this version for anything serious (I know you waited for so long; it's still the first beta, okay?). The work on <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/issues/603">making E2EE opt-in on a per-account basis</a> is ongoing, and there's still a <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/projects/2#column-5799377">laundry list</a> of things to do before the final 0.0.96 is released, with a lot of quick and easy fixes - so please help with closing them off to make the release come sooner!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bram:noordstar.me">Bram</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As by <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/help/design-guidelines#design-for-a-concrete-use-case">Elm's guidelines</a>, packages and SDK's in Elm aren't just published as they're being developed - they're published when they're finished and can be used widely.</p>
<p>For this reason, the final phase of developing <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk">the Elm SDK</a> is to test, make examples, and ask the community for feedback. For this reason, I've built <a href="https://github.com/BramvdnHeuvel/Matrix-Chess">a chess client as a demo version</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully,</p>
<ul>
<li>This shows the performance optimization of Elm to the Matrix community. The entire client fits in a 57,22kB JavaScript file, which is quite small when considering that Hydrogen's JavaScript file is 13 times as large.</li>
<li>This shows the potential of using Matrix to the Elm community as a simple back-end for the purpose of <em>&quot;and now you can do this with other Elm clients&quot;</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, I am asking both communities for feedback - what tiny Elm clients would you like to see created?</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Last week we mentioned that we'd have more to share this week about an easier API for accessing rooms in Matrix, and while it was our intention to have an MSC out by now, our priorities shifted slightly after the MIMI working group session at IETF 116. Some exciting news on that front though: our proposed easier API, called Linearized Matrix (apologies to all the mathematicians), is very much in line with what the working group is thinking about. So much so that we're going through the effort of writing up Matrix as a series of proper Internet-Draft specifications.</p>
<p>We don't currently have an up-to-date document which covers Linearized Matrix completely, but the short version is it allows a server to support individual rooms being linear arrays instead of DAGs. This doesn't prevent a DAG-capable server from joining the room and speaking full-blown DAG either, which is particularly important for compatibility with the existing Matrix network. Currently our efforts on Linearized Matrix are in implementation rather than documentation, though once things are slightly more stable we'll be getting an MSC out there for everyone to review more easily. Watch this space for news.</p>
<p>Following IETF 116, we have an immense amount of work ahead of us to define Matrix as the standard for interoperable chat, but we're well on our way on getting through it all. Namely, we're going around and mapping Matrix's functionality onto MIMI's concepts, defining Matrix as a proper IETF standard along the way. The expected outcome of this for the implementation authors of Matrix is a spec that is significantly easier to follow, finally.</p>
<p>For an idea of what's ahead, here's what the SCT will be looking at over the next several months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linearized Matrix (implementation &amp; MSC)</li>
<li>Extensible Events (at least the core types) - this will serve as the basis for an interoperable messaging format in our IETF drafts</li>
<li>Decentralized MLS &amp; interoperability of crypto</li>
<li>Clarification gaps and bugs in the current spec</li>
<li>Pseudonymous user IDs and account portability</li>
<li>Almost certainly something that was missed when writing this list</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering the above list, the Matrix 2.0 objectives (sliding sync, OIDC, native VoIP conferencing, and faster room joins), and the core team's work around mentions, abuse reporting, and more, the SCT will be a bit busy. That said, if you have MSCs you think we should be looking at, let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> room. We've recently started doing our weekly planning in that room too, which should help give an idea for what the SCT is expecting to look at each week.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2966">[WIP] MSC2966: Usage of OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration in Matrix</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC provides a mechanism for implementing Dynamic Client Registration (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591">RFC 7591</a>) for OAuth 2.0 between Matrix clients and homeservers. Without this, homeserver admins would need to manually configure OAuth metadata (Redirect URIs, application names, client secrets, <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/oauth-parameters/oauth-parameters.xhtml#client-metadata">and more</a>) for every Matrix client that wanted to connect to the homeserver. Since that doesn't really scale in an environment that allows anyone to use any client they like, dynamic registration is critical! Dynamic registration allows clients to communicate this metadata to the homeserver at the login/registration step.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2966">MSC2966</a> is part of a series of MSCs that add first-class OpenID Connect (OIDC) support to Matrix. You can see an overview of the related MSCs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861">here</a>) and https://areweoidcyet.com/ for the latest progress on integrating OIDC into the Matrix spec!</p>

<li>Fixed a bug in which the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3roomsroomidreporteventid"><code>POST /_matrix/client/v3/rooms/{roomId}/report/{eventId}</code></a> endpoint would return the wrong error if the user did not have permission to view the event. This aligns Synapse's implementation with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2249">MSC2249</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.75.0rc1 where the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/postgres.html#porting-from-sqlite">SQLite port_db script</a>would fail to open the SQLite database</li>
<li>Stabilized support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3966">MSC3966</a>: <code>event_property_contains</code> push condition</li>
<li>Fixed a long-standing bug in which the user directory would assume any remote membership state events represent a profile change</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been quiet for a while, but mostly because I was busy or I felt like there was nothing worth talking about. But this time I fixed a bug, that I am actually so proud of, that I need to share it!</p>
<p>I regularly ban users in my rooms temporarily, if they are behaving like an asshole and I want to show them, that such a behaviour is not accepted, even if they usually contribute useful stuff. This tactic has in general worked pretty well and led to a noticeable improvement in the conversation culture in those rooms.</p>
<p>HOWEVER one bug has plagued us for ages and made this method way more destructive, than it should be. Everytime you banned someone on a single user homeserver or even just if they were the only user in the room from that server, you couldn't unban them. That is because there is no member in the room anymore to send the unban event to, so the other server never received an unban. Now, you might think, why is that a problem, you can join the room initially as well. And that was my thought as well, but considering that this bug was transferred to Github in 2016 and several people looked at it, I thought it was just way more complicated to fix. But since I hit this a few times a year and sometimes even multiple times a month, I spent a lot of time looking at the issue on Github. And I did see a few times, that there was a Complement test for it and every server passed that test, but only Synapse got blocklisted. So it couldn't be a fundamental problem...</p>
<p>So I thought, okay, this is annoying me regularly now, I will just get my hands dirty this time and fix it. Even if it takes me weeks or months. So I set up Complement, allowed the test to run on Synapse and watched it fail. Sadly, the complement logs were so long, that I couldn't find the actual error, but a few tries (and hours of runtime) later I got useful output, searched for the error message in synapse and looked at the code. It looked more complicated than Dendrite, all of the membership transitions were in 1 function instead of different ones. But apart from that, the obvious thing that jumped out was that Synapse verified against the room state if the user was allowed to join before checking if it was in the room and then attempting a remote join. Now usually it makes sense to verify the state locally, but not if you are not in the room, so I just moved the in room check up a bit and moved the local verification behind that check, so that the local state is only used for verification, if we are in the room. And it worked! So apart from indentation changes, this was a 1 line change in Complement, a 1 line change in Sytest (to make it fail on the right error) and a 3 line change in synapse (+ 50 lines or so of indentation changes...). This bug has been bothering me for ages and that was all it took to fix!</p>
<p>Now, bugs often look easy in hindsight, so don't use this to judge the Synapse devs or anyone. I just had the right motivation and a bit of luck finding the problem quickly (and help from Synapse devs). Possibly that change broke something else deep down in Synapse and we get to deal with demons soon. But I am happy for now!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we focused on build system improvements. First, a huge thank you to Giovanni Bottaro for digging into the Ubuntu docker image
and slimming it down to nearly half its size. It's still not as compact as our Alpine image, which is the smallest of any of the Matrix
servers, but it's the one I would say is the most stable at this time. On the heels of this, I decided to overhaul the docker image matrix.
Construct now offers several dozen combination docker images from Ubuntu 22.04, 22.10, Alpine 3.16, 3.17, gcc-10, 11, 12,
clang 14, 15, and on arm64 with neon, amd64 with avx, avx2, and avx512.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While I was mostly spelunking in CI land, some people did some really cool stuff!</p>
<p>Dtelsing implemented screenshare support on Wayland. This requires a proper pipewire + xdg-desktop-portal ScreenCast interface setup, but it means Nheko will properly ask your OS for a screenshare and your OS then gets to decide, what screen or window you are allowed to share. Especially considering how little documentation there is for this, I am pretty impressed how quickly they got this working and it seems to work quite nicely on the platforms I have tested, but feel free to test it yourself and report issues you find!</p>
<p>LorenDB tweaked the design of our switches, because they bothered him. Now, I have no eye for that, so I can't tell you what changed, but I assume people who can tell if something is pretty will be happy! Ryandesign also fixed the macOS build on case sensitive filesystems, a pseudonymous contributor added querying your own status message to the dbus interface and Nheko now linkifies improperly encoded matrix.to links again.</p>
<p>I think that is all, thank you all for the cool contributions!</p>

            <p>Today we are issuing security releases of matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk to
patch a pair of High severity vulnerabilities
(<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2023-28427">CVE-2023-28427</a>
/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-mwq8-fjpf-c2gr">GHSA-mwq8-fjpf-c2gr</a>
for matrix-js-sdk and
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2023-28103">CVE-2023-28103</a>
/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-6g43-88cp-w5gv">GHSA-6g43-88cp-w5gv</a>
for matrix-react-sdk).</p>
<p>Affected clients include those which depend on the affected libraries, such as
Element Web/Desktop and Cinny. Releases of the affected clients should follow
shortly. We advise users of those clients to upgrade at their earliest
convenience.</p>
<p>The issues involve prototype pollution via events containing special strings in
key locations, which can temporarily disrupt normal functioning of
matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk, potentially impacting the consumer's
ability to process data safely.</p>
<p>Although we have only demonstrated a denial-of-service-style impact, we cannot
completely rule out the possibility of a more severe impact due to the
relatively extensive attack surface. We have therefore classified this as High
severity and strongly recommend upgrading as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>We found these issues during a codebase audit that we had <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/08/31/security-releases-matrix-js-sdk-19-4-0-and-matrix-react-sdk-3-53-0">previously
announced</a>
in an earlier security release of matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk. The
earlier release had already addressed a set of similar vulnerabilities that
were assigned
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE%2D2022%2D36059">CVE-2022-36059</a>
/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32">GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32</a>
and

/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-2x9c-qwgf-94xr">GHSA-2x9c-qwgf-94xr</a>,
which we had initially decided not to disclose until the completion of the
audit. Now that the audit is finished, we are disclosing those previous
advisories as well.</p>

<p>The Matrix.org Foundation (mostly Travis) are beavering away preparing for the MIMI meeting at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/116/">IETF 116</a> this weekend! This is part of our continual work to contribute to a IETF standard that can be used for interoperable messaging between gatekeepers (large companies in the chat world) under the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220315IPR25504/deal-on-digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-competition-and-more-choice-for-users">EU's Digital Markets Act</a>. See <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/29/how-do-you-implement-interoperability-in-a-dma-world">our earlier blogpost</a> for more context on this topic.</p>
<p>In terms of our previous proposals on this subject; it turns out that implementing full-scale DAGs is a bit difficult, particularly when aiming to achieve interoperability on a short timeline. So we've been working on building an API surface for Matrix which makes rooms easier to access/implement in chat settings. We unfortunately don't have much to share today, but keep an eye on next week's TWIM for details üëÄ</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3480">MSC3480: Make device names private</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC proposes hiding device names from <em>any</em> other user, while still allowing your own devices to see the names of the others.</p>
<p>You may question why device names being shown to other users was considered a good idea at all in Matrix. Initially these being public was really useful for verifying the devices of other users! Back in the days before <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#cross-signing">cross-signing</a> (where you only need to verify another user once), you had to verify every one of your friend's devices from every one of your own devices. It was an n * m problem, whereas if you had 4 devices, and your friend had 5, you'd need to do 20 verifications! And 4 more if your friend got a new phone!</p>
<p>So having device names back then were handy, but today any justification is moot and they're just a metadata leak. So we should get rid of them!</p>
<p>This MSC is blocked on a proven implementation. I actually <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/anoa/msc3480">wrote one up</a> for Synapse a little while ago, and I plan to polish and merge it soon. Anyone else is free to do so in the meantime as well (just let me know first if you plan to do so in Synapse :).</p>
<p>Here's to improved privacy by default in Matrix!</p>

would fail to open the SQLite database</li>
<li>Fix a long-standing bug in which the user directory would assume any remote membership state events represent a profile change.</li>
<li>Mirror images to the GitHub Container Registry (<code>ghcr.io/matrix-org/synapse</code>)</li>
<li>Allow loading <code>/register/available</code> endpoint on workers</li>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week Construct introduced Peristalith Mode in an effort to fill the void left by last week's unfortunate demise of Dendrite's Polylith mode. Peristalith allows multiple instances of Construct to scale together in a hub-and-spoke configuration. This is a single-writer/multiple-reader strategy which uses the filesystem to share data between instances. In the long run, we're still working on Construct Cluster which is a homogeneous multiple-reader/multiple-writer design using Matrix itself for communication. For now, this is an improvement over simply not having any solution in case your deployment really needs to shed some load quickly. I'd like to thank Yan Minari for coming up with some Traefik configs for this and we're going to be spending the weekend playing around with it.</p>

<h3 id="nheko-website">Nheko (<a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0xDEADCADE fixed a few dialog windows, that would get a width of 0 on some window managers. Meanwhile tastytea made the scroll down button automatically refocus the message input.</p>
<p>The other work (apart from some cool work in progress stuff, was mostly minor improvements to communities. LcsTen made unjoinable and unpreviewable rooms in a community now hidden by default. This matches what the /hierarchy API does and as such what other clients show and since you have no way to fix it, why bother you with it? Admins of a community can still see those rooms and are suggested to remove them, since nobody will be able to join them. While the upsides generally outweigh them, there are a few downsides to this approach. Some users will never see some rooms in a community now and will have no way of telling you about the room not being joinable. Note that this only affects rooms added using a m.space.child event. The correct way to add a hidden room to a community, is by only setting a parent in that room. But many clients don't do that or rooms just naturally become unjoinable because of membership changes.</p>
<p>The last one is now properly handled in Nheko. Nheko will regularly update the join information for community rooms now. Each space child or parent event usually includes some routing information to figure out, what servers are in the room. If that server list is outdated, you will not be able to join the room, because none of the servers in the list know about the room anymore. Nheko now checks every 20 minutes if any of your space relation events haven't been updated in more than a week and if that is the case (and you have space edit permissions), it verifies that the routing information would still be the same if Nheko updated it. If it isn't, Nheko will write the new routing information into the state event. This is a bit of a compromise, since you might have more member changes in 7 days and the room can still become unroutable, but this is done to prevent to frequent updates if clients come to different results for the routing information. This should improve the long term experience of communities by a lot, since you won't have them randomly break anymore.</p>
<p>I talked a lot about routing information now. The spec actually has a section for how to calculate that: https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/appendices/#routing. Nheko now implements that algorithm slightly more correctly, but we still don't implement everything. This should make room links look more reasonable and prevents some of the problems talked about in the previous section. Some parts I haven't implemented yet though. Nheko does not ignore ip address only servers (for now). And we also decided to ignore the powerlevel &gt;= 50 requirement and changed it to users that have a <code>powerlevel &gt;= max(events_default, state_default)</code>. This is done, because the spec handwaves away concerns, that rooms might have non-default powerlevels, but I am in a lot of those and it would be annoying to me.</p>
<p>I guess this was a bit of a more technical update this time, but maybe it had some interesting bits. I spent a lot of time the last weeks fixing stuff in Qt, profiling memory usage as well as code size and others are working on cool stuff as well, so stay tuned for next week. :3</p>

<p>(with a familiar bridge backing it!)</p>
<p>I am once again happy to report on our latest integrations work at Element.
<a href="https://youtu.be/HlsMMzTFZ_A">A couple of weeks ago</a> you heard from me and Justin on the new Integration manager
that we've been working away on and we're pleased to announce it's now LIVE
and has replaced our old IM, Scalar.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/20230324-im.png" alt="New integration manager screenshot" /></p>
<p>Alongside the new IM, we've replaced the old Go-NEB powered bots with their
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot</a> equivalents. This means you can now <a href="https://ems-docs.element.io/books/element-cloud-documentation/page/migrate-to-the-new-github-and-feeds-bots#If-you-have-issues">press buttons</a> to migrate yourselves off the old bots.  As an aside, all the changes we've made to hookshot to scale up for the big release are of course landing in the open source project, should you wish to spin up your own bots instead. We're hoping that the ability to now embed our all-powerful config widgets directly into the integration manager will make it easier to add new features to these already-powerful bots.</p>
<p>If you encounter any issues, please post an issue in https://github.com/vector-im/element-integration-manager/issues where we will be happy to assist!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3980">MSC3980: Dotted Field Consistency</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3979">MSC3979: Revised feature profiles</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3977">MSC3977: Matrix as a Messaging Framework (IETF/MIMI)</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1796">MSC1796: improved e2e notifications</a> (close)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accepted MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Closed MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3978">MSC3978: Deprecate room tagging</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The Spec Core Team has started to publish their weekly list of MSCs to focus on reviewing in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">Office of the Spec Core Team</a> room. The list consists of the MSCs that are ready for immediate review, and would most help advance the Matrix protocol on any given week. This used to happen internally (they started out as weekly ping by a bot, and then slowly became curated by our resident human, Travis). But the idea to publish the list both allows people to easily follow along with what they're doing on a weekly basis (much like these posts, but in real time!), as well as helps push subsequent discussion to public channels.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Travis continues to be hard at work integrating Matrix into the IETF process. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3923">MSC3923</a> - initially published in November 2022 - was proposed for FCP this week (and has nearly passed!). Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3977">MSC3977</a> was published this week and talks about how Matrix is a great fit for the goals of the IETF's MIMI working group.</p>
<p>This is all ahead of the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/116/">IETF 116</a> event which starts on March 26th. The Matrix.org Foundation will be attending remotely.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3735">MSC3735: Add device information to m.room_key.withheld message</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC proposes adding a new field, <code>from_device</code>, to <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#mroom_keywithheld"><code>m.room_key.withheld</code></a> messages. This to-device message type is used to inform devices why a megolm session was not sent to them after they requested it.</p>
<p>Devices can request megolm sessions from multiple devices at once, but upon receiving a <code>m.room_key.withheld</code> message from one of them is currently unable to tell <em>which</em> of the devices responded with that message.</p>
<p>The proposed <code>from_device</code> field should not be added to <code>m.room_key.withheld</code> messages that are sent outside of key request flows.</p>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct is inching closer toward public-registration safety for its upcoming 1.0 release. This week I'd like to thank tiix for helping me fix a bug in the registration availability checker, and @dynfox for dropping some documentation for how to launch Construct dockers with certbot.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank @qg:schildi.chat and @bgiovanni for helping me hunt down an elusive auth-rules divergence between Synapse and Construct. This bug affects Synapse users who have been kicked from a room before the summer of 2022 by an admin who runs Construct. After Synapse 1.62, those users are not able to rejoin that room -- ever. This was due to a bug which added unnecessary <code>m.room.join_rules</code> to the <code>auth_events</code> which is no longer accepted by Synapse after that version. This is now fixed on our end going forward, but fixing this retroactively is something I'll be working on over the weekend. I'd like to send my regards to Philantrop üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà who first brought this to my attention and is still trying to get back into <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> even at this very moment. Don't worry, we haven't forgotten you! üòÅ</p>
<p>Construct has over five years of battle-tested experience federating at scale from the very first days of Matrix. If you're looking for an alternative to Synapse to run on a cheap host: less than or equal to 100% CPU usage is our guarantee or your money back. I use it every day at</p>

<p>Howdy folks, another big release for you coming up. So you remember how last week Justin and Myself came onto <a href="https://youtu.be/HlsMMzTFZ_A">Matrix Live</a> to talk about the new
bridge widgets and show off how sleek and snappy they are? Well, Hookshot is <strong>also</strong> getting some updates of a similar flavor. The more observant of you may be starting to notice a pattern
of us tarting up our public integrations. Something might well be on the horizon very, very soon :)</p>
<p>In the meantime, here are the latest changes for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/3.0.0">Hookshot 3.0.0</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add support from migrating go-neb services to Hookshot (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/647">#647</a>)</li>
<li>Implement grant system to internally record all approved connections in hookshot. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/655">#655</a>)</li>
<li>Add support for logging into GitHub via OAuth from bridge widgets. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/661">#661</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>and a bunch of other changes too!</p>
<p>You'll notice we're migrating to a grant system for approving connections, which is why this is considered a breaking major release. <strong>Please check the
notes before updating</strong> and give us a quick message if you have any issues or concerns.</p>
<p>And with that, I wish you all a great weekend!</p>

<p>As predicted 3 weeks ago, Fractal 4.4.2 has been released and is available on Flathub.</p>
<p>As a reminder, there are no new features, but it makes Fractal compatible with newer versions of our dependencies. Big thanks to everyone who tested the beta version and feel free to uninstall it.</p>
<p>In another news, let's talk a bit about Fractal 5‚Ä¶</p>
<p>We have finally implemented one of the most annoying missing features: sending read receipts and updating the fully-read marker. What is doubly great about this, is that we are now only one feature away from being regression-free compared to our stable release (and a merge request is opened for the last one)!</p>
<p>This means that a beta release is around the corner, but we also have serious performance issues to resolve first. We hope that switching to the new store backend currently developed in the Matrix Rust SDK will fix some of it, but we still need to investigate properly how we can improve the situation.</p>

<p>The Elm SDK has reached an unofficial alpha version! It can be downloaded and used for testing purposes.
Now that the core has been finished, the exposed modules <code>Matrix</code>, <code>Matrix.Room</code> and <code>Matrix.RoomInvite</code> are available with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated login &amp; sync</li>
<li>Joining / leaving rooms</li>
<li>Accepting / rejecting invites</li>
<li>Receiving the latest events of a room</li>
</ul>
<p>Before publishing a version 1.0.0, I aim to implement the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated login &amp; sync for spec version <code>v1.1</code> and legacy versions <code>r.0.0.0</code> - <code>r0.6.1</code> using sync v1</li>
<li>Room membership manipulation <em>(invite, kick, ban, knock users/rooms)</em></li>
<li>A few QOL functions to explore a room's state</li>

<p>In the past two weeks, there have been a bunch of small improvements. The <a href="https://friendlylinuxplayers.org/events">events page</a> of the community website now lists upcoming events, and the event pages themselves have received some polish. As a result, links to event web pages are now included in the output of several commands. This makes it easier to see the event time in your local time and to share the event with people who are not in the Matrix room.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, improving these web pages brings us a step closer to integrating with <a href="https://gitlab.com/FriendlyLinuxPlayers/flip-matrix-bot/-/issues/23">Steam</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/FriendlyLinuxPlayers/flip-matrix-bot/-/issues/16">Mastodon</a>. I've started to investigate these further, but there isn't much to report yet.</p>
<p>Besides website-related improvements, I took some time to add unit tests for the lowest-hanging fruit parts of the code. There are more tests to be added, and further testing improvements may be possible in the future after some refactoring, but this is not a high priority for me right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Searching for people to hand over a business idea of paid bridges for Matrix users to other messengers, for free!</strong></p>
<p>I have a business idea to make a paid service for bridging Matrix (<a href="http://matrix.org/">matrix.org</a>) with other messengers using the Bridges feature (https://matrix.org/bridges/). It's like <a href="http://beeper.com/">beeper.com</a>, but which works with any MXID on any homeserver. And like <a href="http://t2bot.io/">t2bot.io</a>, but commercial one and with more bridges available. Yes, t2bot.io is a great project, but free services usually got occupied by a lot of accounts, especially by spammers, and managing all of them for free sounds not so perspective to me. But <a href="http://bridged.to/">bridged.to</a> could also provide some free services for the community.</p>
<p>For that purposes I‚Äôve bought a <a href="http://bridged.to/">bridged.to</a> domain several years ago, to make cool identifiers of bridges like <code>@telegram:bridged.to</code>, <code>@whatsapp:bridged.to</code>, etc.</p>
<p>But I still can‚Äôt find time to implement this idea at all. So, I‚Äôve decided to stop paying for this domain and want to hand over this domain and the whole idea to someone else, who has the time and energy to implement this project.</p>
<p>The idea was to make the payments flexible, per-bridge, for example, $1 per month for each bridge. So, if a user will use bridges to Telegram + FaceBook + Instagram + WhatsApp, they will pay $4 per month, if they stop using some bridges - they pay less. And give a free trial period of 2 weeks for new users, to give it a try.</p>
<p>From the technical point of view, this should look like a standard Synapse server with a custom python module that just block-unblocks sending of messages by the user‚Äôs account balance, and also can gather some usage statistics (number of bridged messages per user, etc), and bridges instances, connected via appservices. And some admin panel with UI to manage and administrate this.</p>
<p>All this sounds easy to implement, but I have a lot of tasks at my main job, so have no time to accomplish this, and have decided to hand over this idea to someone else, who might be interested in it, for free.</p>
<p>So, if you‚Äôre interested in this idea or want to know more, or even just want to grab the cool <a href="http://bridged.to/">bridged.to</a> domain for free - please feel free to contact me via Matrix - @murz:ru-matrix.org.</p>
<p>The domain annual cost is $41.98, it's on namecheap.com, expires at Mar 28, 2023.</p>

            <p>A few weeks ago we found ourselves in Brussels to participate in the second <a href="https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/dma/dma-workshops_en">stakeholder workshop for the Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">DMA</a> is new antitrust/competition regulation from Europe which came into force in November, whose objective is to make digital markets more competitive by forcing gatekeepers (i.e. large tech companies) to reconsider some of their anti-competitive or self-preferencing practices. Gatekeepers are defined as companies which have a clear position of influence in a given market (based on revenue / market cap / number of users thresholds), and ‚Äúan entrenched and durable position‚Äù. The process for designating which companies count as gatekeepers will start in May 2023.</p>
<p>The DMA touches upon different key topics, from self-preferencing behaviour to app store management practices - but most importantly includes interoperability for ‚Äúnumber-independent interpersonal communication services‚Äù (NIICS), otherwise known as chat and voice/video calling and conferencing services (social media was left out for now). </p>
<p><a href="https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/dma/dma-workshops/interoperability-workshop_en">This particular workshop</a> was focused on the latter: interoperability between messaging services, with the aim of getting the different stakeholders of the industry in the same place to discuss how the legislation could be implemented.  The whole idea is to figure out a practical way in which WhatsApp could interoperate with iMessage, Google Messages and others, creating an interoperable communication network where users are no longer locked into communication silos and pick their preferred service provider without compromising on who they can talk to. </p>
<p>About 900 people participated online, and around 80 people were present in person: the maximum the room could hold. It was particularly fun to see representatives from the whole industry turning up in person, including folks from XMPP, MIMI (the new IETF working group on messaging interoperability), MLS, us from Matrix obviously (alongside Matrix ecosystem representatives from Beeper and NeoChat!) - all together with the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (<a href="https://www.berec.europa.eu/en/berec/what-is-berec">BEREC</a>), civil society representatives (like the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (<a href="https://VZBV.de">VZBV</a>) and European Digital Rights (<a href="https://edri.org">EDRi</a>)), mobile network operators, local network agencies, and obviously some of those who are likely to be designated as gatekeepers, such as Meta, Apple and Google.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-was-discussed">So what was discussed?</h2>
<p>All of the workshop proceeds were livestreamed and archived by European Commission‚Äôs <a href="https://webcast.ec.europa.eu/dma-workshop-2023-02-27">webcasting service</a> and <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice_en#copyright-notice">released</a> under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence, so we‚Äôve taken the liberty of republishing them split up into chapters so that folks can quickly refer to the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="panel-1-introduction-to-horizontal-interoperability-between-messaging-services-goals-challenges-and-potential-solutions">Panel 1: Introduction to horizontal interoperability between messaging services: goals, challenges and potential solutions</h3>
<p>The first panel focused on setting up the scene and highlighting the challenges expected during the implementation phase, featuring <a href="https://www.soi.unitn.it/staff/simonetta-vezzoso/">Simonetta Vezzoso</a> (Professor of Economics at The University of Trento), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiaracaccinelli">Chiara Caccinelli</a> (Co-chair - Digital Markets WG at <a href="https://www.berec.europa.eu/">BEREC</a>), <a href="https://www.vzbv.de/en/policy-work/experts">Suzanne Blohm</a> (Policy officer at <a href="https://www.vzbv.de/">Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverbands (VZBV)</a>) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-penfrat">Jan Penfrat</a> (Senior Policy Advisor at <a href="https://edri.org/">EDRi</a>). There was a lot of emphasis around the risks of gatekeepers dragging their feet, or choosing the solution which makes it harder for SMEs or self-hosters to interoperate, as well as the challenge of introducing the new paradigm of interoperability for messaging without losing the usability aspect - see below for the full scope:</p>

<h3 id="panel-2-exploring-the-technical-aspects-of-interoperability-part-1-end-to-end-encryption-security-of-the-service">Panel 2: Exploring the technical aspects of interoperability (Part 1): end-to-end encryption, security of the service</h3>
<p>Then, after a quick lunch, the second panel went into the nitty gritty of how end-to-end encrypted interoperable messaging (1:1 messaging is the first milestone to be delivered, hence the focus) could actually be implemented by the gatekeepers. The panel starred <a href="https://www.roeslpa.de/">Paul R√∂sler</a> from <a href="https://fau.de/">FAU Erlangen-N√ºrnberg</a>, who gave a great overview of end-to-end encryption in general, <a href="https://alissacooper.com/">Alissa Cooper</a> from Cisco who explained the merits of open interoperable protocols, <a href="https://educatedguesswork.org/about/">Eric Rescorla</a> from Mozilla explaining the merits of standardisation, yours truly from Matrix explaining and demonstrating how one can actually use a standardised open protocol to interoperate without sacrificing privacy (effectively fleshing out our <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/29/how-do-you-implement-interoperability-in-a-dma-world">blog</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/25/interoperability-without-sacrificing-privacy-matrix-and-the-dma">posts</a> from last year) and then finally <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-hurley-24424231">Stephen Hurley</a> from Meta to explain how they are thinking about DMA obligations.</p>
<p>The panel ended up being a relatively exciting tour through the landscape of DMA practicalities, and it was a lot of fun to actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDnUJXzVn3s&amp;t=3715s">demonstrate a minimum viable prototype of client-side bridging</a> thanks to Travis‚Äôs work packaging up standalone client-side bridges for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dma-demo-app-bridge-whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dma-demo-app-bridge-googlechat">Google Chat</a> (strictly for demonstration illustrative purposes only). The slides (and demo) were sadly a bit fuzzy on the recording, but you can see our slides below and grab everyone‚Äôs presentations from the <a href="https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/document/download/c59e04bc-f96c-49d9-b161-ad9c24d82367_en?filename=20230227_dma_stakeholders_workshop_panelists_material_0.zip">European Commission website</a>:</p>
<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="/blog/img/matrix-dma-slides.pdf"></iframe>
<br/>
<p>When DMA first became headline news last year, there was a lot of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/28/23000148/eu-dma-damage-whatsapp-encryption-privacy">very vocal concern</a> that it would somehow end up undermining end-to-end encryption (despite the legislation explicitly requiring that E2EE must be preserved when interoperating). Hopefully this session demonstrated that both the European Commission and the various panellists are dead serious about achieving interoperability without sacrificing privacy - whether that‚Äôs via the brute-force approach of client-side bridges, or the more sophisticated approach of client-side bridges which bridge to client-side APIs, or by incrementally or entirely adopting a true open standard protocol like Matrix, XMPP, or whatever MIMI comes up with.</p>

Relative to the second panel, there were more questions than answers here, as the panellists discussed whether users would need to consent or opt-in/opt-out of interoperability, and debated the various data privacy implications of DMA.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was a fascinating opportunity to have a front-row seat at history being made, as the various key players finally got down to business on the practical implications of DMA interoperability.</p>
<p>We saw the full spectrum of options on the table, from Meta‚Äôs implications that they would simply open their existing API complete with the existing Double Ratchet Encryption, to the pragmatic approach of Matrix (‚Äúat first we‚Äôll bridge, and then the players should gradually converge on an open standard‚Äù) to the more idealistic approach of MIMI (‚Äúeveryone should natively adopt an entirely new open standard built on MLS‚Äù).  The next step is to establish a reference implementation and approach, and in the end it seems likely that the approach that works will be the one which the gatekeepers can actually practically adopt within the punchy timeframes built into the legislation:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/dma.jpg" alt="DMA timeline" /></p>
<p>You can also check out <a href="https://carlschwan.eu/2023/03/02/digital-market-act-workshop-in-brussels/">Carl Schwan‚Äôs writeup</a> (from NeoChat), as well as Eric Rescorla‚Äôs braindump on <a href="https://educatedguesswork.org/posts/dma-interop/">DMA interoperability</a> that accompanies his talk.</p>
<p>We live in interesting times, and it‚Äôs fascinating to see Matrix‚Äôs vision of interoperable communication being cemented into regulation by the EU.  Our view is that as long as the gatekeepers open their APIs and add support to model remote users in their systems, then at least the wider world can implement client-side bridges to crack the door of the gatekeepers open - and then as gatekeepers refresh their stacks and new players emerge, they‚Äôll likely implement the common protocol (if it‚Äôs fit for purpose) rather than burn time reinventing the wheel on proprietary solutions.  Meanwhile, the DMA provides welcome encouragement to ensure that open protocols like Matrix can rise to the challenge and fill the gap - whether that‚Äôs <a href="https://spec.matrix.org">independently</a> or as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ralston-mimi-matrix-framework/">part of IETF‚Äôs MIMI</a> initiative. May the best solution win!</p>

<p>Review this week from the SCT focused on the future of OIDC and logging in via a QR code (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3906">MSC3906</a>) - a feature other platforms have and one I would love immensely. Fixing notifications (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3966">MSC3966</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3873">MSC3873</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3758">MSC3758</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3952">MSC3952</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3958">MSC3958</a>) as per last week, as well as trying to finally get <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2677">MSC2677</a> (spec'ing the current state of Annotations and Reactions) into FCP.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3972">MSC3972</a>: Lexicographical strings as an ordering mechanism!</p>
<p>While there already is an MSC for a top-level ordering of Spaces in use across some client implementations today (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3230">MSC3230</a>), the algorithm recommended for clients to implement apparently has some consistency flaws, leading to edge cases. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3972">MSC3972</a> attempts to address this by providing a different algorithm that does not have these flaws. A real-world implementation of the algorithm is also available today in Kotlin at https://github.com/Dominaezzz/MatrixSort.</p>
<p>Neither of these algorithms have been merged to the spec yet, but this new MSC may finally push this conversation forwards! I recommend client developers give it a read and leave their feedback as Pull Request Review comments on the MSC.</p>

<h3 id="telodendria-website">Telodendria (<a href="https://telodendria.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>An open source Matrix homeserver implementation written from scratch in ANSI C and designed to be lightweight and simple, yet functional</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jordan:bancino.net">Jordan Bancino</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey everyone, it's been a while since I've posted an update here, but I'm pleased to report that progress on <strong>Telodendria</strong> is still steady. Here's a small glimpse into what's happening with the project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>v0.2.1:</strong> The second major release of <strong>Telodendria</strong> was published earlier this week. <strong>Telodendria</strong> still isn't much yet, but the user authentication section of the client-server specification is just about complete. This means you can register for accounts, log in and get access tokens, and then log out. All the stuff that goes with that, including the static login fallback page, and user interactive authentication is in place.</li>
<li><strong>What's Next:</strong> I'm hoping to start working on the account management endpoints next. I also want to start building out an HTTP client for federation, and I want to move the configuration file into the database, so that <strong>Telodendria</strong> is configured via an admin API endpoint instead of a file. The thinking here is that this enables <strong>Telodendria</strong> to be configured at runtime, without having to restart the process to apply configuration changes.</li>
<li><strong>Help Wanted:</strong> As always, I could use your help. This is a huge project, and I am very busy so I can't dedicate as much time as I'd like to it. If you find <strong>Telodendria</strong> interesting and want it to continue, feel free to join us over in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria-general:bancino.net">#telodendria-general:bancino.net</a>, write some code and documentation, donate to the project, or any and all of the above!</li>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/farooqkz/chooj">chooj</a>, the Matrix client for KaiOS feature phones, has seen many changes in the last few weeks. Many bugs were fixed and many others are probably added. We now support many other events other than message events which you can view in the rooms plus an experimental image viewer to better investigate the received images. Other than that, by removing the files KaiOS doesn't use, the production bundle size is half now. A big internal change also happened and still is not finished yet. With the assist of Simon Laux, a big portion of chooj is now <a href="https://github.com/farooqkz/KaiUIng">a separate library</a> which makes maintenance easier and also lets other KaiOS apps use them. I have written my plans for chooj in <a href="https://blog.bananahackers.net/farooqkz/chooj-is-back-into-the-game">my last post</a> in the BananaHackers blog. If you like to see Matrix chat on the KaiOS feature phones, you can donate an amount to help with the development of the project. Or you can donate me a debug enabled KaiOS phone with the mentioned features.</p>

<h3 id="nheko-website">Nheko (<a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lorendb:nheko.im">LorenDB</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've had some fun and useful things happening in the past two weeks!</p>
<ul>
<li>red_sky (nheko.im) worked on automating the release process to automatically create a release when a tag is pushed. This might not sound like much, but it makes life easier for maintainers who would otherwise have to waste time manually creating releases. After all, why would you want to write release notes when you could be writing code?</li>
<li>Nico tweaked styling for HTML tables to increase the padding. Thanks to Cadair for the suggestion!</li>
<li>Nico also fixed a bug that showed avatar changes as somebody joining a room. I seem to recall this also happening when users changed their display names, but I can't reproduce that behavior. Either way, it is nice to have this fix in place!</li>
<li>I worked on closing some of our issues, and I'm happy to report that there are fewer ways to be unpleasantly surprised by the UI. For example, if you have turned on the setting to make emoji-only messages larger, all other emojis will also get a bit of a size boost to make them easier to read.</li>
<li>On that note, I recently went through the issue list and closed a number of outdated issues that had already been fixed, because 260+ issues is obviously too many for any self-respecting project... right? ;)</li>
<li>I also overhauled nheko's behavior when you attempt to use an invalid /command. Originally, nheko would eat any invalid commands (e.g. sending <code>/foo</code> would clear the input box but would not send a message). Now, if you type <code>/foo</code>, you will see a warning informing you that you are about to send a message that says <code>/foo</code> into the chat instead of running a command <code>/foo</code>. If you choose to disregard the warnings and hit Enter, nheko will indeed send a message saying <code>/foo</code>!</li>
</ul>
<p>But that's not all: this week, mtxclient gained the ability to properly handle <code>m.room.message</code> events that have an unknown <code>msgtype</code>. With that in place, I'm working on implementing that on the nheko side. Once this work is done, you will be able to read messages that others send from Element with fireworks! Furthermore, I'm adding a bonus feature to nheko: as a proof-of-concept for fully implementing this unknown message handling, I've got a working implementation of Element's rainfall effect for those of you who like fancy effects! (All the rest of you can just turn those off in the settings, I guess.)</p>
<p>A note for our Mac users: somebody opened <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/1401">an issue</a> last week notifying us that nheko couldn't be installed on OS X 11.1. Nico has fixed this, but you will need to either wait for the next release or install one of our nightly builds (#nheko-nightlies:neko.dev).</p>

<p><em>Additions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Command <code>ement-room-override-name</code> sets a local override for a room's display name. (Especially helpful for 1:1 rooms and bridged rooms.  See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3015#issuecomment-1451017296">MSC3015</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Changes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve display of room tombstones (displayed at top and bottom of buffer, and new room ID is linked to join).</li>
<li>Use descriptive prompts in <code>ement-leave-room</code> and <code>ement-forget-room</code> commands.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fixes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Command <code>ement-view-space</code> when called from a room buffer.  (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MagicRB">Richard Bre≈æ√°k</a> for reporting.)</li>
<li>Don't call <code>display-buffer</code> when reverting room list buffer.  (Fixes <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/121">#121</a>.  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mekeor">mekeor</a> for reporting.)</li>
<li>Retry sync for network timeouts. (Accidentally broken in v0.6.) </li>

We reached out since he seemed to care about <code>synadm</code>. He had submitted a feature but we also caught him tidying up &quot;unloved&quot; issues. He has a good sense for concise solutions and accurate documentation.

<li>A new output mode <code>minified</code> was added and the original <code>json</code> mode was improved to now produce nicely human readable json.</li>
<li>We finally have <a href="https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">a contributing documentation</a> and hope it'll make collaboration with our contributors even better.</li>
<li>We introduced an auto-linter based on <code>flake8</code> into our CI pipeline to catch code formatting issues quicker.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Shortly after releasing <a href="https://effektio.org/whitepaper/">our whitepaper</a> end of last year, Effektio was approached by another organization, who has been building a NGO communication platform for a few years called <a href="https://acter.global">Acter</a>. Acter wanted to move away from their current centralized stack and had found Matrix.org 's Federated Model to be their preferred ideal. Very quickly within the talks that followed it became clear that both organization have the same goals and visions for the future and are perfectly matching in terms of what they already bring and what each lacks: Effektio has the technological stack, expertise and ability to build the product while Acter has existing a network of organizations, partners and even existing users, who are happy to provide feedback. Long story short, we decided to merge both into a newly funded <strong>Acter Association</strong>, which we established Jan 1st, developing the next (third) generation of the Acter Platform (&quot;A3&quot;) on top of the existing effektio tech stack. Since then a major part of our work has been merging all the admin and tech stuff, up to moving the github repo over to <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3">acterglobal/a3</a>, where you will find it from now on.</p>
<p>Next to that, we still have continued working on the product itself. Among other things we have <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/505">merged the first implementation of the Adaptive Layout in A3</a> this week, implemented the next acter object, <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/503">Pins</a>, added <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/522">Rageshake Bug Reporting</a> to the nightly builds, started out with the new <a href="https://docs.acter.global/docs/architecture/templates/">Templates</a> infrastructure and improved our quality assurance by  reactivate rust integration tests, add widget unit tests and a new cucumber desktop tests infrastructure.</p>

<p>Other than spec text fixes in the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc">matrix-spec repo</a>, the Spec Core Team has mainly been focusing on push notifications, push rules and generally improving notifications across Matrix. This includes improving behaviour such as accidentally notifying someone when you mention their name, accidentally notifying people when you reply to a message, accidentally notifying when you edit a message and so on. The relevant MSCs are <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3958">MSC3958</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3873">MSC3873</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3966">MSC3966</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758">MSC3758</a>.</p>

<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3013">MSC3013: Encrypted Push</a>!</p>
<p>When you get a push notification for a new message on your phone, you may wonder how that message travels from your homeserver to you. Typically it isn't done directly - instead, when you receive a message that should notify you, your homeserver will generate a push notification specifically for you, and send this off to a Matrix Push Gateway. That Push Gateway is then configured to send your notification off to a service which knows how to route it to your device. This is usually Apple's Push Notification Service in the case of iOS devices, or Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging service in the case of Android devices (though FCM supports iOS devices too!). Your phone's OS will keep a consistent connection to one of these services if an app has registered for push notifications, and thus you can receive notifications from apps even when your Matrix client is not running.</p>
<p>But doesn't that leak all of your message notifications to Apple or Google? üò± Not quite. While clients can choose to include all contents of a message in a push notification, most instead opt for only including the event's ID. When the push notification containing that event ID reaches your phone, it wakes up a small portion of your Matrix client which goes and fetches the full message content from the homeserver (plus encryption keys if the message needs to be decrypted). This way, you can still get a notification without your Matrix client needing to be open all the time. However, some metadata (such as when you are getting a notification) is still leaked to Apple/Google. Since the third-party service knows the event ID, it can correlate which users are in the same room by cross-referencing event IDs in notifications across multiple users.</p>
<p>It's also a bit of a resource drain that the client needs to go and talk to the homeserver to fetch the full event content. Ideally we'd just include it all in the notification - but then we end up sharing too much information with the push provider!</p>
<p>This MSC proposes a solution; encrypt the message content and send that in the notification! Message contents are encrypted using a public key provided by the client to the homeserver when registering for push notifications. The ciphertext passes through the Push Gateway (which may be run by a separate entity to your homeserver) and the Push Notification service (run by Apple, Google, etc.) and then finally down to your client where it is decrypted without the need for a web request as the private key will just be stored in the client.</p>
<p>And since a separate encryption key is being used per-device, ciphertexts of the same event will differ when encrypted for different users - eliminating the Push Gateway/Push Notification Service from being to correlate notifications across users (timing attacks are still possible, but this can be reduced by introducing a small amount of jitter into when notifications are sent out).</p>
<p>Anyhoo, if you're big on privacy (or security against those running Push Gateway/Notification Services), check out this MSC!</p>

<li>implemented the experimental <code>exact_event_match</code> push rule condition from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758">MSC3758</a></li>
<li>implemented <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3873">MSC3873</a> to disambiguate push rule keys with dots in them.</li>
<li>allow Synapse to use a specific Redis <a href="https://redis.io/commands/select/">logical database</a> in worker-mode deployments.</li>
<li>fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.76 where 5 second delays would occasionally occur in deployments using workers.</li>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, seven additional endpoints from the synapse admin API have been ported to Construct. These include user room listings, account data, devices, pushers, and forward extremities pruning. This week it also became easier for admins to tune database options to meet their needs through the configuration system. To put things into perspective, the server now has 2184 configurable items which can be set by an environment variable. Construct also has 6177 statistical items which can be reported to a Prometheus metrics daemon.</p>
<p>Lastly I would like to share good news on the compatibility front after taking some time to investigate why Construct and Conduit have trouble federating. I reached out with a patchset to the folks over at Ruma and I would like to take this opportunity to commend their hospitality. Their conduct has been nothing short of diplomatic, giving confidence we can now iron out any kinks in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>mautrix-go has had e2ee support for a few years already, but previously the interface was quite difficult to use for making bots and other small programs, as it required implementing parts of the storage and other things manually.

The documentation is unfortunately not great yet, but the <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/go/blob/master/example/main.go">example</a> has been updated to use the new helper, so it should be a decent starting point for writing e2ee-capable bots in Go (and if it explodes, you can ask for help in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#:maunium.net">#:maunium.net</a>)</p>

<p>I've built an incredibly basic client that managed to compress to under 36kB (for scale: Hydrogen is around 748kB) of gzipped JavaScript. The final version will be a bit larger, but this SDK might make way for very compact asset sizes.</p>

            <p>Greetings Matrix fans! We've published Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.78.0">version 1.78</a>
as the new stable release this week. Synapse admins are encouraged to upgrade
to it at their convenience. Please take a look at the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.78/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1780">upgrade notes</a>
for any important information about upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="announcements">Announcements</h2>
<p>Please note that Synapse 1.78.0 replaces the <code>/_synapse/admin/v1/media/&lt;server_name&gt;/delete</code> admin API with an identical
endpoint at <code>/_synapse/admin/v1/media/delete</code>. Please update your tooling to use the new endpoint. The deprecated version
will be removed in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-stuff">The new stuff</h2>
<p>In case you were unaware, Synapse has a command line export data command which allows administrators to export data for
a specific user (you can read more about this command <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_faq.html#how-can-i-export-user-data">here</a>).
Synapse 1.78.0 updates this command adding account data to the user information that is returned by the export data command.</p>
<p>This version of Synapse also features a few changes to push rules, with implementations for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758">MSC3758</a>:
Add <code>event_property_is push</code> rule condition kind,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3966">MSC3966</a>: <code>event_property_contains</code> push rule condition, and the removal of the spurious <code>dont_notify</code>
action from the defaults for the <code>.m.rule.reaction</code> pushrule. These changes empower end users to more fully customise their
notification rules - MSC3758 allows users to ask to be notified when a field in an event contains any type of value, rather
than only matching on strings, and MSC3966 provides crucial scaffolding for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3952">MSC3952</a>: Intentional Mentions,
which aims to eliminate unintentional mentions and improve the experience of mentions in general.</p>
<p>Synapse v1.78.0 includes some fixes for faster-joins related bugs as we work out the kinks. Some of these include a fix
for a bug introduced in Synapse 1.76.0 where partially-joined rooms could not be deleted using the
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#delete-room-api">purge room API</a>, and
a fix for a bug introduced in Synapse 1.75 where the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/postgres.html#porting-from-sqlite">portdb script</a>
would fail to run after a room had been faster-joined. We continue to work to polish faster joins, and thank everyone who
filed an issue.</p>
<p>Finally, for those deployments using workers, v1.78.0 fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.76 where 5s delays would
occasionally occur.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>See the full <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.78.0">changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in the release. Also please have a look at the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.78/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1780">upgrade
notes</a>.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our
thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular
order): jahway603, williamkray, 999lakhisidhu, hari01584, saddfox, dklimpel, realtyem
V02460, and thezaidbintariq.</p>

feedback and reporting issues, or helping with community support questions.</p>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's been progress in several areas for Construct 0.9 this week, cut with 71 new commits. First I'd like to give special thanks for @bgiovanni for continuing to drive the progress this week; they have on several occasions been able to navigate the codebase and the specification to provide concise reports so I can fix anything in mere minutes. I hope we can keep this up.</p>
<p>Construct can now be configured to purge a room from the database after the last local user leaves. This week I also took the plunge on implementing a controversial clause in the specification which requires a server to broadcast a join event on behalf of another server. This is problematic because it's technically an amplification attack, so I've done my best to narrow the conditions for when to actually perform this: only if the counter-party is not already joined, and only if Construct has an alias set for the room being joined.</p>
<p>In other news, I <a href="https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio/pull/1215">fixed a bug</a> in <code>boost::asio</code> but since that won't land for a while and Construct's <code>io_uring(7)</code> might be susceptible on Arch and Gentoo <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/commit/884c2e68b71c92d223d312f60f35b9be81960a8c">I hacked a workaround</a> just for us, especially since the old <code>epoll(7)</code> + <code>aio(7)</code> makes my desktop much less responsive (I can't believe I dealt with that for years!).</p>
<p>Next week Yan Minari might have a deeper look at Sytest and Complement integration and maybe mdad, while I plan on implementing local room policies and user management to make Construct safe for public registration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello all! Fractal 4.4.2-beta2 is available on Flathub Beta.</p>
<p>You read correctly, it's not Fractal 5 yet. This is a maintenance release that fixes the compilation of Fractal 4.4 with recent libraries and allows to build the Flatpak with the latest GNOME runtime. That means no more warning that the GNOME 41 runtime is outdated!</p>
<p>There are no new features, but since we updated a lot of Rust dependencies we preferred to release a beta version before using it to update our stable release to the latest runtime. So please test it and if no major regression is reported, we will release it as stable in two weeks.</p>
<p>To get it, run the following commands:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo
</span><span>flatpak install flathub-beta org.gnome.Fractal
</span><span>flatpak run --branch=beta org.gnome.Fractal
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that if you always want to use this beta version instead of the stable one, and run it from the icon in your launcher, you will need to change its desktop file to use the command in the last line.</p>
<p>See you soon with some news regarding Fractal 5 hopefully!</p>

<li>On Element X, we're focused on laying the foundations for the app, improving our tools and processes for distributing the updated Rust SDK as an Android module and refining the initial screens of the app, matching the new designs and UX flows.</li>
<li>On Element Android, we've released a new version 1.5.26 with more fixes and improvements for the Rich Text Editor, Polls and Location Sharing features, to name a few of them.</li>

<p>After we had some great time at <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix#fosdem-2023">FOSDEM</a> and where we were able to test our <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-barcamp">Barcamp widget</a> with a broader group, we are thrilled to announce that we finally made the next widget public:</p>
<p>Entering the <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-meetings"><em>matrix-meetings-widget</em></a>!
The widget allows to plan meetings, invite other users, configure meetings rooms, view your calendar, and perform video conferences.
All data is stored in Matrix, no external service required. As the Widget API is a bit limited for this use-cases, it's a combination of a widget and a bot.</p>
<p>As a small teaser: We are in the progress of building a whiteboard widget that is fully based on Matrix without an external storage.
