This week we continue Matrix Live Season 3 by talking to community member <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@axx:jaccu.se">axx</a>, Axel Simon from <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/">La Quadrature du Net</a>, a French advocacy group that promotes digital rights and freedoms of citizens. We talk about the work La Quadrature du Net do, with a focus on the importance of decentralisation and how Matrix helps support this.

<blockquote>A new stable version of mxisd is out: <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.2.0">v1.2.0</a>. It comes with:
<ul>
 	<li>The ultimate identity store that lets you run any command on the system to fetch info, making it the most generic yet. The sky is now your limit!</li>
 	<li>The ability to send email notifications about room invites when done using a Matrix ID regardless if their users is already provisioned on synapse, using emails found in an Identity store. Targeted at onboarding/migration to Matrix for any org/corp.</li>

<h2 id="dendriteandbrendan">Dendrite and Brendan</h2>
Welcome to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a>, who has started working on Dendrite as his new day job at New Vector:
<blockquote>There's been some progress on Dendrite (?), with a couple of bug getting fixed along with some progress in the implementation of Matrix endpoints, such as the <code>/backfill</code> federation one (documented <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/unstable.html#get-matrix-federation-v1-backfill-roomid">here</a>), which has already been merged, and the <code>/messages</code> one from the client-server API (documented <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#get-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-messages">here</a>) for which a pull request <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/591">has been opened</a> and is currently under review.</blockquote>

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a>:
<p>I have pushed my asyncio wrapper of the Python matrix client api class to pypi, so I can use it in a few different projects while the PR to the Python SDK is in an unmerged state.

<h2 id="discordbridge030released">Discord bridge 0.3.0 released</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> is working on so many bridges that these days he just casually mentions a huge release like <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/releases/tag/v0.3.0">Discord bridge v0.3.0</a>. Some of the many many new features:
<ul>

</ul>
There are many more features and bugfixes on <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/releases/tag/v0.3.0">the release notes</a>. Also:
<blockquote>Shoutout to our new member of the team, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a> who did a lot of the review work behind the scenes for this release. Also, thank you to everyone who submitted a PR or an issue!</blockquote>
<h2 id="matrixpuppetslackv180released">matrix-puppet-slack v1.8.0 released</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@root:thomasprofitt.com">tom</a> came out of the wild to tell us about <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack">matrix-puppet-slack</a>:
<blockquote>TWIM (but actually over the last few weeks), thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://github.com/d3m3vilurr">a new contributor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack">matrix-puppet-slack</a> v1.7.0 and v1.8.0 have been released, fixing a number of old and new issues and adding support for new types of Slack events, including bidirectional @-mentions, Slack-to-Matrix typing notifications, fixing Slack-to-Matrix image/file uploads with comments, and more!
The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-bridge/">matrix-puppet-bridge</a> projects have gotten relatively quiet over the past year or so, but there's still plenty of bridges with plenty of features to implement and plenty of bugs to fix (and, even more importantly, bugs to <em>report</em>!) for any would-be-contributors who'd like to use a trusted Matrix homeserver as their double-puppetting Slack/iMessage/Facebook/GroupMe/iChat/Skype/Hangouts/Signal/Tox client from which to brag to their friends on the other platforms about how great Matrix is.</blockquote>

<h2 id="maubotmanagementuiprogress">maubot management UI progress</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been making big progress on his <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a> management UI:
<blockquote>The maubot management UI has progressed well, but isn't quite ready yet. I think it should be usable by Next Week in Matrix.
It can be used to set up and configure a maubot instance and plugins. Once it's ready, it should be possible to do everything except installing maubot itself through the UI: installing and updating plugins, adding matrix clients, configuring plugin instances, viewing logs, etc.</blockquote>

<h2 id="hkbotisanantiabusebot">HK Bot is an anti-abuse bot</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee">Coffee</a> continues his streak of TWIM mentions by bringing a new bot to combat abuse:
<blockquote><a href="https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/HKBot">HK Bot</a> is an anti-abuse bot for public <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a> chatrooms.
This is a bot that really shouldn't exist, but since some people just like to make others' lives more difficult, here we are.
The purpose of this bot is twofold. It can automatically oversee rooms and respond to abuse, based on programmable pattern rules, providing a stop-gap measure in case no human moderators are nearby. It can also automate some tedious tasks via its command interface, the primary one being the complete redaction of all of an abuser's messages.
HK Bot is still under construction and contains dangerous features. Use with caution.</blockquote>
<h2 id="xsampatoipabot">X-SAMPA to IPA bot</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dandellion:dodsorf.as">Dandellion</a> "made an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA">X-SAMPA</a> to IPA bot based on matrix-bot-sdk and discord's conniebot". This bot essentially lets you use ASCII characters to get an output in IPA. The advantage of this is that you can much more easily type and transmit pronunciation (because you don't need to find the characters).
<blockquote>I'll just have to make it a bit more configurable, but then I'll throw the source up
When making constructed languages and talking about linguistics, it's nice to get an easily readable IPA representation of a word, but it's really hard to write IPA, which is why x-sampa exists as a way to input IPA with a normal keyboard!</blockquote>

It's a simple mechanism, you give it an image, it gives you a JSON object with the result. For example:
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nsfw-bot.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3734" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nsfw-bot.png" alt="" width="936" height="1004" /></a></p>

We continue the new season of Matrix Live. This re-booted season has a slightly different format to previous: in each outing, there will be a single deep-dive topic. This week, Matthew and recent-Matrix-arrival Nad discuss UX for E2E encryption key handling. This is an unsurprisingly complex design question, both in terms of how it should behave and how it should look. Nad shared his <a href="/blog/2018/11/02/user-experience-preview-end-to-end-encryption-by-default/">latest thinking in a blog post earlier today</a>, and you can watch the video below.

            <p><span style="font-weight: 400">It's been a long-standing goal to enable end-to-end encryption by default for private communication in Matrix. The technical effort so far has included </span>
<a href="/docs/guides/e2e_implementation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">our libolm library</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span>
<a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/matrix-olm-cryptographic-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400">an independent cryptographic review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span>
<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/6779"><span style="font-weight: 400">a massive backlog of feature development and bug fixes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Today, instead I'd like to focus on some of the User Experience challenges and goals we're facing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should also introduce myself—I'm Nad Chishtie (</span>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nadonomy:matrix.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">@nadonomy:matrix.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">) and I recently joined the Matrix core team (at New Vector) as Lead Designer, most recently focusing on end-to-end encryption.</span></p>
<p>When using encrypted messages, most existing services fall short in one or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">They don't allow you to use multiple devices independently. For example, a web session might be locally tethered to a mobile device.</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">They don't support a way to restore or temporarily access message history. For example, if you don't have physical access to your main device because it's broken or has been stolen.</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">They don't allow you to verify that devices are controlled by their owners rather than eavesdroppers, and persist that trust across multiple devices, sessions or rooms.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Modern users, even those we talk to at security and privacy-led organisations, expect these features to 'just work' by default out of the box. Before enabling end-to-end encryption by default, we've been hard at work figuring out how we can deliver these features without compromising security or usability.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(For some users, restrictions such as limiting the number of places encryption keys reside, and not having a synchronised message history may be desirable </span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400">security features.</span>
</i><span style="font-weight: 400"> We'll support these cases, but just not as the default behaviour.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let's dive in to some of the fundamental concepts we'll be putting forward to deliver a default end-to-end encryption experience that makes sense for most modern users. In this post we'll look at an overview of</span>
<b> work-in-progress wireframes</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, in the spirit of designing in the open and gathering feedback from the wider Matrix community. Please note that these don't represent the actual interface design.</span></p>
<h2>Cross-signing personal devices</h2>
<a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Cross-signing.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3708 size-large" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Cross-signing-1024x576.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When logging in to a new device, you'll be able to use an existing device to verify your new one. Verification is done by </span>
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1543"><span style="font-weight: 400">scanning a QR code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on whichever device has the most convenient camera to use, or by </span>
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1267"><span style="font-weight: 400">comparing a short text string</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. You only have to complete this process once to mutually verify both devices.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1680"><span style="font-weight: 400">Verifying your new device by cross-signing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> transfers encryption keys, giving it access to your encrypted messages, and also signals to other users that the new device is trustworthy.</span></p>
<h2>Secure Message Recovery</h2>
<a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Secure-Message-Recovery.gif.gif"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3725" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Secure-Message-Recovery.gif.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /></a>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To the end user, Secure Message Recovery works a lot like setting up disk encryption or a password manager. A user can optionally secure their message history using a recovery passphrase and/or key. If logged out, or using another device, the user can use the recovery passphrase or key to access their encrypted message history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In practise, this </span>
<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/5675"><span style="font-weight: 400">incrementally encrypts and backs up encryption keys to a user's homeserver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, kept secure by the homeserver never having access to the passphrase or key. Like cross-signing, using a recovery passphrase or key will also signal to other users that a device is trustworthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We think that in most cases users will cross-sign personal devices, but as a safety net (for example, if a user's devices are broken or lost) Secure Message Recovery is an invaluable tool for users to minimise the chance of them losing their encrypted message history.
</span></p>
<h2>People should trust people</h2>
<a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Verification.gif"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3726" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Verification.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /></a>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With both cross-signing and Secure Message Recovery in place, we think that people should trust people, instead of individual devices. Now, when you verify a device, it'll mark all of that users trusted devices as trusted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gone are the days of every person you talk to having to independently verify your new device upgrade. Like cross-signing, you can verify a device by scanning a QR code or comparing a short text string.</span></p>
<h2>Sensible and extensible</h2>
<a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Settings.gif"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3727" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Settings.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /></a>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Riot, we're implementing these features with a sensible default experience that strikes a balance between usability and security. We think most people would prefer to trust cross-signed devices, and that user trust shouldn't block encryption. However, if you aren't most people, you'll be free to configure whatever level of security you need.
</span></p>
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400">With all of the above in place, and after resolving any remaining technical issues, users will be able to:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>Use end-to-end encryption by default in private rooms.</li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Use an existing device or Secure Message Recovery to access their encrypted message history on multiple devices, and to signal device trust to other users.</span>
</li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Access their encrypted message history using Secure Message Recovery, by storing encrypted message keys on their homeserver.</span>
</li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Mark a user as trusted by verifying one of their devices, persisting across all rooms and devices.</span>
</li>
 	<li>Keep their encrypted messages out of the hands of eavesdroppers.</li>
 	<li>Opt out, or further configure if they have more specific security requirements.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400">There's more nuance to making all this work than we can cover in this overview post; things like recovery key management and immutable security notifications are all important pieces of the puzzle. For further reading, we're filling up more detail in </span>

            <p>Wowzers - our 8th dot release for v0.33!</p>
<p>This time we have a bunch of bug fixes and db performance improvements as well as better support for auto-join rooms and the ability for admins to limit who can create rooms aliases.</p>
<p>v0.33.8 also contains more python 3 fixes: we are running most of matrix.org on python 3 as of right now and seeing some pretty impressive performance improvements. Look out for Hawkowl's write up coming soon.</p>
<p>For those interested in what we are working on right now, take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/2">task board</a>.</p>
<p>As ever, you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.8">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>. Note, Synapse is now available from PyPI, pick it up <a href="https://pypi.org/project/matrix-synapse/">here</a>.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Back in June we blogged about <a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">the plan of action to establish a formal open governance system</a> for the Matrix protocol: introducing both the idea of the Spec Core Team to act as the neutral technical custodian of the Matrix Spec, as well as confirming the plan to incorporate the Matrix.org Foundation to act as a neutral non-profit legal entity which can act as the legal Guardian for Matrix's intellectual property, gather donations to fund Matrix work, and be legally responsible for maintaining and evolving the spec in a manner which benefits the whole ecosystem without privileging any individual commercial concerns.  We published a draft proposal for the new governance model at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318">MSC1318: a proposal for open governance of the Matrix.org Spec</a> to gather feedback and to trial during the <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">day-to-day development of the spec</a>. Otherwise, we refocused on getting a 1.0 release of the Spec out the door, given there's not much point in having a fancy legal governance process to safeguard the evolution of the Spec when we don't even have a stable initial release!</p>
<p>We were originally aiming for end of August to publish a stable release of all Matrix APIs (and thus a so-called 1.0 of the overall standard) - and in the end we managed to <a href="/blog/2018/09/03/matrix-spec-update-august-2018/">publish stable releases of 4 of the 5 APIs</a> (Client-Server, Application Service, Identity Service and Push APIs) as well as a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/commits/master/specification/server_server_api.rst">major overhaul</a> of the Server-Server (SS) API.  However, the SS API work has run on much longer than expected, as we've ended up both redesigning and needing to implement many major changes to to the protocol: the new State Resolution algorithm (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">State Resolution Reloaded</a>) to fix state resets; versioned rooms (in order to upgrade to the new algorithm); changing event IDs to be hashes; and fixing a myriad federation bugs in Synapse.  Now, the remaining work is progressing steadily (you can see the progress over at <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/2">https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/2</a> - although some of the cards are redacted because they refer to non-spec consulting work) - and <strong>the end is in sight</strong>!</p>
<p>So, in preparation for the upcoming Matrix 1.0 release, we've been moving ahead with the rest of the open governance plan - and we're happy to announce that as of a few hours ago,<strong> the initial incarnation of The Matrix.org Foundation exists!</strong></p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Certificate.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3691" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Certificate-723x1024.png" alt="" width="496" height="702" /></a></p>
<p>Now, it's important to understand that <strong>this process is not finished </strong>- what we've done is to set up a solid initial basis for the Foundation in order to finish refining <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318">MSC1318</a> and turning it into the full Articles of Association of the Foundation (i.e. the legal framework which governs the remit of the Foundation), which we'll be working on over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>In practice, what this means is that in the first phase, today's Foundation gives us:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>A UK <strong>non-profit company</strong> - technically incorporated as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_company_limited_by_guarantee">private company, limited by guarantee</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Guardians</strong>, whose role is to be legally responsible for ensuring that the Foundation (and by extension the Spec Core Team) keeps on mission and neutrally protects the development of Matrix.  Matrix's Guardians form the Board of Directors of the Foundation, and will provide a 'checks and balances' mechanism between each other to ensure that all Guardians act in the best interests of the protocol and ecosystem.<br/ ><br />For the purposes of initially setting up the Foundation, the initial Guardians are Matthew &amp; Amandine - but in the coming weeks we're expecting to appoint at least three independent Guardians in order to ensure that the current team form a minority on the board and ensure the neutrality of the Foundation relative to Matthew &amp; Amandine's day jobs at New Vector.The profile we're looking for in Guardians are: folks who are independent of the commercial Matrix ecosystem (and especially independent from <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a>), and may even not be members of today's Matrix community, but who are deeply aligned with the mission of the project, and who are respected and trusted by the wider community to uphold the guiding principles of the Foundation and keep the other Guardians honest.</li>
 	<li>An immutable <strong>asset lock</strong>, to protect the intellectual property of the Foundation and prevent it from ever being sold or transferred elsewhere.</li>
 	<li>An immutable <strong>mission lock</strong>, which defines the Foundation's mission as a non-profit neutral guardian of the Matrix standard, with an initial formal goal of finalising the open governance process.  To quote article 4 from the initial Articles of Association:
<ul>
 	<li>
<div class="page" title="Page 8">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">4. The objects of the Foundation are for the benefit of the community as a whole to:</div>
<div class="column">
<p>4.1.1  empower users to control their communication data and have freedom over their communications infrastructure by creating, maintaining and promoting Matrix as an openly standardised secure decentralised communication protocol and network, open to all, and available to the public for no charge;</p>
</div>
</div>
4.1.2  build and develop an appropriate governance model for Matrix through the Foundation, in order to drive the adoption of Matrix as a single global federation, an open standard unencumbered from any proprietary intellectual property and/or software patents, minimising fragmentation (whilst encouraging experimentation), maximising speed of development, and prioritising the long-term success and growth of the overall network over the commercial concerns of an individual person or persons.
</div></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>You can read the initial <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Constitution.pdf">Articles of Association</a> here (although all the rest of it is fairly generic legal boilerplate for a non-profit company at this point which hasn't yet been tuned; the Matrix-specific stuff is Article 4 as quoted above).  You can also see the initial details of the Foundation straight from the horse's mouth over at <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11648710">https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11648710</a>.</li>
</ul>
Then, in the <strong>next and final phase</strong>, what remains is to:
<ul>
 	<li>Appoint 3+ more Guardians (see above).</li>
 	<li>Finalise<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318"> MSC1318</a> and incorporate the appropriate bits into the Articles of Associations (AoA).  (We might literally edit MSC1318 directly into the final AoA, to incorporate as much input as possible from the full community)</li>
 	<li>Tune the boilerplate bits of the AoA to incorporate the conclusions of<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318"> MSC1318</a>.</li>
 	<li>Register the Foundation as a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-regulator-of-community-interest-companies">Community Interest Company</a>, to further anchor the Foundation as being for the benefit of the wider community.</li>
 	<li>Perform an Asset Transfer of any and all Matrix.org property from New Vector to the Foundation (especially the Matrix.org domain and branding, and donations directed to Matrix.org).</li>
</ul>
So there you have it! It's been a long time in coming, and huge thanks to everyone for their patience and support in getting to this point, but finally The Matrix.org Foundation exists.  Watch this space over the coming weeks as we announce the Guardians and finish bootstrapping the Foundation into its final long-term form!  Meanwhile, any questions: come ask in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org</a> or in the blog comments here.
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine, and the forthcoming Guardians of [the] Matrix!</p>

            <p>We have a LOT of updates this week, so let's dive straight in!</p>
<h2 id="matrixdockeransibledeploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</h2>
We've covered the growth of this project several times in TWIM, but I wanted to give a little more attention to the work <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> has been doing with <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>. Synapse is a large Python project with many configurable options, and many optional components, so installing it has sometimes been a challenge. I have seen many reports that using Ansible and Docker, and in particular using these playbooks from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a>, is a more sane way to install Synapse. The tools get a lot of attention and updates. This week, Slavi reports:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> now has a <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/maintenance-checking-services.md">self-check command</a> that can help diagnose various configuration problems with the setup (DNS records being misconfigured, firewall ports not being open, etc).</blockquote><br />For support and more info, come join the associated room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com">#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com</a><br /><br /><em>Late breaking news</em> from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a>:<br /><blockquote>One more <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> update: the playbook can now <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-whatsapp.md">set up Whatsapp-bridging</a> via <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/izissise">@izissise</a>!</blockquote>
<h2 id="dimension">Dimension</h2>
Dimension is an integration manager for Matrix. It's written and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>, and allows you to an a pre-defined selection of widgets, bots and bridges to improve your self-hosted Matrix experience. Check out: <a href="https://dimension.t2bot.io/">https://dimension.t2bot.io/</a>. This week, TravisR reports:
<blockquote>Dimension has received quite a lot of updates over the last week. Here's what's hot off the press:
<ul>
 	<li>4 new bridges can be self-hosted and managed in Dimension: Telegram, Webhooks, Slack, and Gitter.</li>
 	<li>3 new widgets are available: Grafana, TradingView, and Spotify.</li>
 	<li>Add your own custom bots for people to add to their rooms.</li>
 	<li>A dark theme has been added and is automatically applied if you use the dark theme in Riot.</li>
 	<li>The overall UI has been updated to be slightly more modern and less bright orange.</li>
 	<li>Various bug fixes and improvements (is it even possible to have a changelog without this?)</li>
</ul>
As per usual, if you find any bugs or have ideas for things to add to Dimension feel free to come by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dimension:t2bot.io">#dimension:t2bot.io</a></blockquote>
<h2 id="mautrixtelegram">mautrix-telegram</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been working on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>, and has made some massive performance improvements:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> now uses the non-ORM part of SQLAlchemy for database tables that are used often. That change made the CPU usage on the t2bot.io instance drop from ~100% to ~7%</blockquote>
We have graphs to illustrate the improvements:

<h2 id="newcommunities">New communities</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@swedneck:swedneck.xyz">swedneck</a> has created a new gaming community on Matrix:

<h2 id="greetingsfrommozfest">Greetings from Mozfest</h2>
<a href="https://mozillafestival.org">Mozfest</a> is a tech-focused event happening this weekend in London. Neil and I have been along tonight and we've been chatting to a lot of people about Matrix, decentralisation and all those things we love! Check out our very short and sweet video below!
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZqfTYwDz9HM" width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>This is the start of Season Three of Matrix Live. Matrix Live seasons are variable in length, based on the data available so far. From this season, Matrix Live with change the format slightly, based on feedback. The videos will try to be a bit more interesting, varied, and deep. With this video being the start of a new season, it was meant to be more substantive with us talking to Mozfest-ites, but I lost track of time, so this shorter but still energetic video will hopefully convey the idea.</p>

            <p>Olm 3.0.0 has been released, which features several big changes. It can be downloaded from <a href="https://git.matrix.org/git/olm/">https://git.matrix.org/git/olm/</a>. The npm package for JavaScript can be downloaded from <a href="/packages/npm/olm/olm-3.0.0.tgz">https://matrix.org/packages/npm/olm/olm-3.0.0.tgz</a></p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>The biggest change is the merge of <a href="https://github.com/poljar/">poljar's</a> improved Python bindings. These bindings should be much easier to use for Python programmers, and are used by <a href="https://github.com/Zil0/">Zil0's</a> <a href="https://github.com/Zil0/matrix-python-sdk/tree/e2e_sample">E2E support in the Matrix Python SDK</a>.</p>
<p>Since the binding API has changed, existing Python code will need to be rewritten in order to work with this release.</p>
<p>poljar has also included <a href="https://poljar.github.io/python-olm/html/index.html">comprehensive documentation</a> for the new API.</p>
<h2 id="cmake">CMake</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mujx/">mujx</a> contributed support for building olm using CMake. This should allow for easier building on different platforms. Currently the library can be built using either make or CMake. In the future, make support may be removed.</p>
<h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>
<p>The JavaScript bindings now use <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> by default. WebAssembly is much faster than the previous <a href="http://asmjs.org/">asm.js</a> build, and is supported by recent versions of the most popular browsers. For compatibility with browsers that do not support WebAssembly, the asm.js version is still provided.</p>
<p>Due to adding support for WebAssembly, the API had to be changed slightly.
There is now an <code>init</code> function that must be called before the library can be used. This function will return a promise that will resolve once the library is ready to be used. The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">matrix-js-sdk</a> has not yet been updated to do this, so users of matrix-js-sdk should continue using olm 2.x until it has been updated.</p>
<h2 id="key-backups">Key backups</h2>
<p>The public key API has been updated to support the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1538">proposal for server-side key backups</a>. More details on how to use these functions will be published in the future.</p>

            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Today is one of those pivotal days for the Matrix ecosystem: we're incredibly excited to announce that the world's first ever dedicated homeserver hosting service is now fully available over at <a href="https://modular.im">https://modular.im</a>!  This really is a massive step for Matrix towards being a mature ecosystem, and we look forward to Modular being the first of many hosting providers in the years to come :D</p>
<p>Modular lets anyone spin up a dedicated homeserver and Riot via a super-simple web interface, rather than having to run and admin their own server.  It's built by New Vector (the startup who makes Riot and hires many of the Matrix core team), and comes from taking the various custom homeserver deployments for people like Status and TADHack and turning them into a paid service available to everyone.  You can even point your own DNS at it to get a fully branded dedicated homeserver for your own domain!</p>
<p><a href="https://modular.im"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3662 size-full" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/181022-Modular-featured.png" alt="" width="800" height="241" /></a></p>
<p>Anyway, for full details, check out the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/introducing-modular-awesome-hosting-for-riot-matrix-665a7a0c616">announcement over at the Riot blog</a>.  We're particularly excited that Modular helps increase Matrix's decentralisation, and is really forcing us to ensure that the Federation API is getting the attention it deserves.  Hopefully it'll also reduce some load from the Matrix.org homeserver! Modular will also help Matrix by directly funding Matrix development by the folks working at New Vector, which should in turn of course benefit the whole ecosystem.</p>
<p>Many people reading this likely already run their own servers, and obviously they aren't the target audience for Modular.  But for organisations who don't have a sysadmin or don't want to spend the time to run their own server, hopefully Modular gives a very cost-effective way of running your own dedicated reliable Matrix server without having to pay for a sysadmin :)</p>
<p>We're looking forward to see more of these kind of services popping up in the future from everywhere in the ecosystem, and have started a <a href="/hosting/">Matrix Hosting page</a> on the Matrix website so that everyone can advertise their own: don't hesitate to get in touch if you have a service to be featured!</p>
<p>If you're interested, please swing by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#modular:matrix.org">#modular:matrix.org</a> or feel free to shoot questions to <a href="mailto:support@modular.im">support@modular.im</a>.</p>

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>, master of the bridge, has been working with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> to produce a new RC for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack">bridging Matrix and Slack</a>.
<blockquote>We've got a Slack RC out at long last! Rejoice! It's absolutely massive and full of features.</blockquote>
Half-Shot even provided this explanation of how it works:

See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/0.2.0-rc1">release notes</a>:

<h3 id="riotweb017riotandroid0818lazyloading">Riot Web 0.17, Riot Android 0.8.18: Lazy Loading</h3>
This week saw the launch of Riot Web 0.17, and two bug-release updates (0.17.1 and 0.17.2) to fix issues on the Windows desktop app. This version is substantially faster due to its use of Lazy Loading room members. <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/riot-im-web-0-17-and-ios-0-7-6-smaller-footprint-faster-launch-5ddd18a65abb">Read more here</a>.   Meanwhile, Travis continues his foray into 'first impressions' bugs - including an initial implementation of .well-known URI support!
<p>Riot Android 0.8.18 is also available from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app">Play Store</a> and <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.alpha/">F-Droid</a>, with Lazy Loading option available in the Labs menu (but still has a few bugs left).</p>
<p>Riot iOS meanwhile is busy implementing incremental server-side E2E key backups, and there's generally been a huge amount of work on E2E encryption UX across the board in preparation for all-new E2E on Web and iOS.  More details will be coming soon!</p>
<p>With this done, Riot is now getting a lot more attention on the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/a-sneak-peek-at-a-whole-new-riot-im-1114df653782">impending redesign</a>, with Bruno <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+redesign+author%3Abwindels">starting to merge</a> code to the experimental branch.</p>

<h3 id="coffeeonmatrixconsoleforandroid">Coffee on Matrix Console for Android</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee">Coffee</a> rolled a natural twenty for bravery this week.
<blockquote>I have decided to take up maintainership of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-console">Matrix Console for Android</a> client. This is still the only multi-account capable Android client, but it is unmaintained and growing long in tooth. In particular, the API endpoints it uses may be removed from Synapse soon.
I will not be developing new features for it, but I will integrate reasonable patches if others want to take that on.
My own goals are to remove GCM and analytics, and get it added to F-Droid. And of course to switch to the latest API.
As part of this work, I have been fighting Gradle and its bugs to get <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">matrix-android-sdk</a> to build together with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-console">matrix-android-console</a> as a git submodule, so it's no longer necessary to inject the precompiled sdk into the source code.

If you like blog posts about Matrix (and if you're reading this, you may well do), then you'll be interested to see that Matrix was featured on the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Hacks</a> blog: <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/dweb-decentralised-real-time-interoperable-communication-with-matrix/">Decentralised, Real-Time, Interoperable Communication with Matrix</a>.

<h2 id="raidennetworkusesmatrixfortransportthisarticleexplainsit">Raiden Network uses Matrix for transport - this article explains it</h2>
The Raiden Network enables fast payments for Ethereum. From <a href="https://raiden.network/">their website</a>:
<blockquote>The Raiden Network is an off-chain scaling solution, enabling near-instant, low-fee and scalable payments. It's complementary to the Ethereum blockchain and works with any ERC20 compatible token.</blockquote>
To help explain their use of Matrix in their solution, they have prepared an article: <a href="https://medium.com/raiden-network/raiden-transport-explained-939d7741b6f4">Raiden Transport Explained</a>.
<h2 id="synapse0337">Synapse 0.33.7</h2>
Soon, so soon, there will be a full Python 3 release for those running Synapse in worker configuration, but this one is not it. Check out <a href="/blog/2018/10/18/synapse-0-33-7-released/">Synapse 0.33.7 changes here</a>.

<blockquote>tracking the latest synapse release on my <a href="https://github.com/ananace/matrix-synapse">K8s optimized image</a>. Got no real time to work on things due to deadlines at work, but that should end come November, so expect more odd Ruby stuff after that point.</blockquote>
"Odd Ruby stuff" will hopefully include a return to the <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Matrix Ruby SDK</a>!

<h2 id="cadairatgsoc">Cadair at GSOC</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> was at the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a> Mentors Summit in Mountain View last week:
<blockquote>I attended the GSOC mentor summit. I had some great conversations with people who are using matrix and with people about bridging in different chat services. A lot of matrix stickers all vanished off the overloaded sticker table. I have lots of ideas for GSOC next year, and plan to try and get many more community projects involved. Finally, I dont need to eat chocolate for a month.</blockquote>

<h2 id="untilnextweek">Until next week</h2>
Next Friday <code>/me</code> is going to be at <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/">MozFest 2018</a>, promoting Matrix, Open Source, decentralisation etc. (all the stuff we know and love), so I may change the schedule a little next week.  We're also going to reboot Matrix Live, so consider this a hiatus before Season 3 begins next week!!
