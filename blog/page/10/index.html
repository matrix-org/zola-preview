The <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> room is a portal to its energy tank, and we had received a distress signal!</p>

<p>The end of the year is drawing to a close. Thus many of the Spec Core Team members are focusing on implementation in order to meet deadlines. Review is still occurring though! As above, we have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a> (allow guests to send more event types). This was born out of next-generation VoIP work, but it should have a positive impact on improving the guest experience in Matrix on the whole.</p>

<p>And finally, Alexandre Franke has <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3542">PR'd some work</a> to allow for matrix.org's OpenAPI spec to be widely available, meaning anyone with a <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> (or other <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> viewer) client can easily pull it and start sending requests against a Matrix homeserver.

<p>Goooood evening TWIM readers!</p>
<p>I want to start by drawing attention to a blog post which we published today: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/03/type-coverage-for-sydent-motivation">Type coverage for Sydent: motivation</a>. This the first in a series of three articles discussing what we've learned from making Sydent pass the <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/">mypy</a> type checker in strict mode. Improving type coverage across Synapse, Sygnal, and Sydent has been a major focus of the backend team at Element for the past few months, and we think we've learned a few useful things in the process.</p>
<p>This week we also <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/30/synapse-1-48-0-released">released Synapse 1.48</a> with loads of internal improvements, new Admin APIs, better alignment with the Matrix 1.1 spec, and more. We're planning one more release for the year, 1.49 on December 14th, and then we're taking a break until Synapse 1.50 on January 11th.</p>
<p>Importantly: Synapse 1.49 will be the last release to support Python 3.6, PostrgreSQL 9.6, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) ‚Äî if you're reliant on any of these platforms, please ensure you have plans to upgrade.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think of the article (and the Synapse release!), and we'll see you next week!</p>

<h3 id="gitter">Gitter</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org">madlittlemods (Eric Eastwood)</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the vein of <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Gitter feature parity</a> on Matrix, we've made the first steps towards a better public static archive. We merged an experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> into <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> which lets you use the unstable <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> client API endpoint go from a given timestamp to the closest event ID. This will allow us to implement a calendar jump to date interface to be able to navigate to any day in the rooms history. Our first target to add the jump to date UI in is <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen</a> since we plan to server-side render Hydrogen for the actual public static archive as well.</p>
<p>To enable the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> unstable API endpoints in Synapse, add <code>experimental_features</code> -&gt; <code>msc3030_enabled: true</code> to your <code>homeserver.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/client/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/rooms/&lt;roomID&gt;/timestamp_to_event?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;
</span><span>{
</span><span>    &quot;event_id&quot;: ...
</span><span>    &quot;origin_server_ts&quot;: ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Also as part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>, when you use the client API endpoint, if your homeserver sees that the closest event it has locally in the database is next to a gap in the history, it will go out and ask other federated homeservers what they have as the closest event instead.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/timestamp_to_event/&lt;roomID&gt;?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;
</span><span>{
</span><span>    &quot;event_id&quot;: ...
</span><span>    &quot;origin_server_ts&quot;: ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> to import batches of historical messages is still marching along getting some polishing passes and strengthening the assertions in the Complement tests to make sure things are going absolutely correctly. It's also good to see <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> utilizing it and catching a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11241">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11219">bugs</a> along the way üí™.</p>

<p>Stop the press. This is a last minute TWIM. We've been beavering away on <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot</a>. It's gained many features in the last week, but the big thing is that hookshot has gained the ability to provision connections over a provisioning API, which means it should hook nicely into Dimension (and other integration managers, in the future)!</p>
<p>Other notable features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple webhooks per room</li>
<li>Support for the username/text fields on an incoming webhook (slack style)</li>
<li>Named webhooks, so each hook now has a sensible displayname</li>
<li>The ability to spawn GitHub actions from rooms using the <code>!gh workflow run</code> command</li>
<li>Lots of new supported events from GitLab, such as reviews and tag pushes</li>
<li>Hosted documentation (so all of the above is easy to setup), it's a bit in progress atm.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're aiming for a release very very soon, hopefully in the next week or so!

<p>We finally figured out what caused the issues with the flatpak on GNOME, especially on Arm. It should now work properly, if you use Flathub. On the Pinephone (and other systems, that don't set a locale/use the C locale), timestamps should now not be needlessly long anymore. Redactions got a face-lift to distinguish them better from normal messages. We added a workaround for Synapse not allowing you to leave a banned room. We now delete the room from the room list permanently if Synapse returns &quot;unknown room&quot; when trying to leave it. Spaces can now show the entire hierarchy in the sidebar (if you pull it out) and you can navigate to subspaces by clicking on them in the roomlist, even if you collapsed the space hierarchy in the sidebar.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">Krille Fear</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we have released FluffyChat 1.0.0 with a whole new design, a lot of bug fixes and huge performance improvements.</p>
<h3 id="new-design">New design</h3>
<p>The new design has bigger message bubbles with fancy shadows and bigger fonts. The contrast has been improved and some elements, like the time on every single message bubble, are now hidden by default. But they are not gone! Detailed message information are now accessible in the new message info page, where we not also can see the message type and the timestamp, but also the whole JSON source code of each timeline event.</p>
<h3 id="spaces">Spaces</h3>
<p>Spaces have got a lot improvements and bug fixes. They have moved to the bottom bar of the chat list (while this bottom bar is still hidden if you have not joined any space yet). The multi account switcher have instead been moved to a top left drop-down menu. So we finally got rid of the drawer, which seems to be a deprecated material design feature anyway. This new UX makes spaces much easier to use. You can long press on them to go to the space settings and long press on any chat in the chat list, to add or remove a chat to (or from) a space.
We still have no support for the spaces summary API though so we don't have yet the ability to discover new rooms inside of a space but this feature might land soon in the Matrix Dart SDK.</p>
<h3 id="multi-account">Multi Account</h3>
<p>FluffyChats multi account is still in beta but got a lot of bug fixes as well. You are now able to sort your accounts in &quot;bundles&quot; which can be very handy. The new account switcher button gives you a much better overview over your connected Matrix accounts now.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>We did a lot refactoring under the hood in our Matrix Dart SDK and have improved our in-app database a lot. On the web it now uses IndexedDB natively while it tunes all database transactions on all platforms. This leads to the fastest FluffyChat experience we ever had and makes the app finally kinda usable with bigger accounts on all platforms. The room list is now lazy loaded which speeds up the app start (especially with multi account enabled) a lot.
Choose your own primary color
This was a long requested feature. You can now choose your favorite color to style your FluffyChat for your needs:</p>
<p>What will you choose? Let me know in the comments. I mostly like blue on my Ubuntu desktop.</p>
<h3 id="new-major-version">New major version?</h3>
<p>Ahhh by the way... What does it mean that we now have FluffyChat 1.0.0? It does NOT mean that the previous versions were not yet stable or ready for daily use. It just means that we make so many changes at once that we thought, bumping the first digit of our pseudo-semver version string might make sense. We totally messed up our versioning and are now going to do it better. Promised!!
What's next?
We are often asked: What is the roadmap of FluffyChat?
Well... we still don't have a clear roadmap and might never have. FluffyChat is completely driven by volunteers. But what I can say that we would like to do in the next months is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better QA -&gt; We would like to write some integration tests, push release candidates before new releases and involve everyone in testing them to offer the best stability possible.</li>
<li>Native video calls -&gt; Yes! There will soon land support for native video calls in the Matrix Dart SDK and we are going to implement this in FluffyChat.</li>
<li>Stories -&gt; Like you might know from SnapChat, WhatsApp or Instagram, stories are little messages you can send to all of your contacts and which will disappear after 24 hours. I would really like to implement this in FluffyChat!</li>
<li>Better notifications for iOS</li>
<li>Deeper support for spaces</li>
<li>Knocking feature</li>
<li>Drag&amp;Drop for web</li>
</ul>
<p>But as I said this is what we would like to do. We can't give any warranties on anything. We can only do our best. But you can help us if you like (You don't have to).</p>

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a>, a multiplatform Matrix SDK written in Kotlin, has grown up since the last release 6 month ago! It has it first release candidate for v1.0.0!</p>
<p>If you don't heard about Trixnity: Trixnity aims to be strongly typed, customizable and easy to use. You can register custom events and Trixnity will take care, that you can send and receive that type.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing is the new trixnity-client module. It provides a high level client implementation and allows you to easily implement clients for Desktop, Mobile and Web. You just need to render data from and passing user interactions to Trixnity. The key features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
exchangeable database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
fast cache on top of the database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
E2E (olm, megolm)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
verification</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
room list</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
timelines</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
user and room display name calculation</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
asynchronous message sending without caring about E2E stuff or online status</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
media support (thumbnail generation, offline &quot;upload&quot;, etc.)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
redactions</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, Trixnity only supports JVM in all modules, but JS and Native will follow soon (to be exact: when Kotlin 1.6.10 and ktor 2.0.0 is released). I also implemented the module trixnity-olm, which implements the wrappers of libolm for Kotlin JVM/JS/Native.</p>
<p>Cross signing is one of the next big features, I want to implement.</p>

            <p><em>This is the first of three posts on improving type coverage in Sydent. Join us next Friday for the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/10/type-coverage-for-sydent-annotation">second part</a>!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent">Sydent</a> is the reference Matrix Identity server. It provides a <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/identity_service/r0.3.0">lookup service</a>, so that you can find a Matrix user via their email address or phone number (if they've chosen to share it).</p>
<p>We recently worked on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/issues/414">improving Sydent's type coverage</a>: the proportion of its source code with explicit annotations denoting the kind of data that each variable, expression and return value is expected to hold. These annotations are optional, but if present, they allow tools like <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">mypy</a> to analyze your programs and spot entire classes of bugs <em>before</em> you ship them! In this instance, we aimed to make Sydent pass <code>mypy --strict</code>, which <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/commit/7bdaac2774840e1f9697d30515f367c5c8c16866">it now does</a>. Here's what the process looked like:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/TWGXKTFpjYxlbnHRkZFAzljQ.png" alt="Coverage as measured by mypy. Precision and the number of typed expressions increase over the latter half of 2021." /></p>
<p>Two lines show two different measures of how well-typed the project is. The grey region covers our two-week sprint towards improving coverage; the earliest data point is from just before previous efforts to improve typing earlier in the year.</p>
<p>In a series of posts, I'd like to reflect on this sprint and share what we've learned. In particular, I aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>explain why we wanted to improve type coverage <em>now</em>;</li>
<li>work through examples to see how (if?) mypy could have spotted bugs;</li>
<li>describe the annotation process;</li>
<li>illustrate common patterns I learned along the way;</li>
<li>discuss the checks that <code>mypy</code> provides; and finally</li>
<li>reflect on the state of Python's typing ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this first part, we'll concentrate on the first two topics; the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/10/type-coverage-for-sydent-annotation">second</a> covers the middle two; and the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/17/type-coverage-for-sydent-evaluation">third</a> the last two.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-this-now">Why do this now?</h2>
<p>It took us a long time (too long) to notice that the Sydent instance serving <code>matrix.org</code> <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/19317">was failing to send SMS messages for verification</a>. We suspected that something was going wrong with our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/main/sydent/sms/openmarket.py">API call to OpenMarket</a>. Our first step was to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/issues/410">improve logging</a>, so we could start to deduce what was going wrong and why. Whilst trawling through logs, we spotted <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/413#pullrequestreview-775154313">
one problem</a> which meant we weren't actually sending off the API request in the first place. Further investigation revealed a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/415">strings-versus-bytes confusion</a> which meant that we would always (incorrectly) interpret the API response as having failed.</p>
<p>All in all, phone number verification was unknowingly broken in the 2.4.0 release, to be fixed in 2.4.6 a month later. How could we do better? Better test coverage is (as ever) one answer. But <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/413#pullrequestreview-775154313">it struck me</a> that the two bugs we'd encountered might be ripe for automatic detection:</p>
<ul>
<li>we created an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Awaitable">Awaitable</a> but didn't <code>await</code> it or use it in any way, and</li>
<li>we tried to look up a <code>str</code> key in a dictionary which mapped <code>bytes</code> to <code>bytes</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Could a static analysis tool like <code>mypy</code> detect these? How much work would it take to do so? Are there other bugs and problems we could spot with it? I was curious to answer these questions and learn more about the tools that Python's typing ecosystem provides.</p>
<h2 id="could-typing-have-spotted-these-problems">Could typing have spotted these problems?</h2>
<p>Let's start with the first of question: what can <code>mypy</code> detect?</p>
<h3 id="the-missing-await">The missing <code>await</code></h3>
<p>Instead of writing <code>x = await foo()</code>, we simply had <code>x = foo()</code> and didn't then go on to <code>await x</code>. Mypy doesn't have means to detect this at present. There was interest in <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/2499">this issue</a> on such a feature, with related threads <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5597">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5650">here</a>.</p>
<p>Are there other opportunities to spot the error? Here's the relevant bit of source code from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/2e3b7576b17e92080319e08c0c0ebf566935636c/sydent/http/servlets/msisdnservlet.py#L93-L98">before the fix</a>.</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>            sid = self.sydent.validators.msisdn.requestToken(
</span><span>                phone_number_object, clientSecret, sendAttempt, brand
</span><span>            )
</span><span>            resp = {
</span><span>                </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;success&quot;</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">True</span><span>,
</span><span>                </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;sid&quot;</span><span>: str(sid),
</span><span>                </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;msisdn&quot;</span><span>: msisdn,
</span><span>                </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;intl_fmt&quot;</span><span>: intl_fmt,
</span><span>            }
</span></code></pre>
<p>The call to <code>requestToken</code> produces a value of type <code>Awaitable[int]</code>. If we tried to assign that to an expression of type <code>int</code> we'd get an error that mypy can spot.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>$ cat example.py
</span><span>async def foo() -&gt; int:
</span><span>    return 1
</span><span>
</span><span>async def bar():
</span><span>    x = foo()      # no error
</span><span>    y: int = foo() # error: rhs is Awaitable[int], but lhs expects int
</span><span>
</span><span>$ mypy --check-untyped-defs example.py
</span><span>example.py:6: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type &quot;Coroutine[Any, Any, int]&quot;, variable has type &quot;int&quot;)
</span><span>Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that we have to specifically ask mypy to typecheck the body of <code>bar</code> by passing <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-check-untyped-defs">--check-untyped-defs</a>; by default, <code>mypy</code> will only typecheck annotated code.</p>
<p>We might also have been able to detect the error by looking at how we used <code>sid</code>. Unfortunately, the only use of was in a conversion <code>str(sid)</code>, which is a perfectly type-safe call for both <code>sid: int</code> and <code>sid: Awaitable[int]</code>. But let's put that aside for a second‚Äîsuppose we added <code>&quot;sid&quot;: sid</code> directly into the <code>resp</code> dictionary. Could mypy have spotted there was a problem with <em>that</em>?</p>
<p>Unfortunately not. Because <code>resp</code> has no annotation, we have to rely on how it's used to spot any type inconsistencies. There's only one use of <code>resp</code>: as the return value from its enclosing function, <code>render_POST</code>. Mypy's only chance to spot a type problem would be to compare the mypy's inferred type for <code>resp</code> to the return type of <code>render_POST</code>. What are those types? We can use <code>reveal_type</code> to see the former is <code>Dict[str, object]</code>. For the latter:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>    @jsonwrap
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>render_POST(self, request: Request) -&gt; JsonDict:
</span></code></pre>
<p>The return type is <code>JsonDict</code>, which is an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/2e3b7576b17e92080319e08c0c0ebf566935636c/sydent/types.py#L17">alias</a> for <code>Dict[str, Any]</code>. This is bad news, because <code>Dict[str, object]</code> and <code>Dict[str, Any]</code> are compatible. Digging a level deeper, this is because <code>sid: Any</code> holds true for both <code>sid: int</code> and <code>sid: Awaitable[int]</code>‚Äîso there's no error to spot here. The <code>Any</code> type is compatible with any other type whatsoever! Mypy uses <code>Any</code> as a way to <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/kinds_of_types.html#the-any-type">defer all type checking to runtime</a>; mypy won't (and can't!) statically analyse the usage of an expression of type <code>Any</code>. Indeed, mypy's reports will tell you how many <code>Any</code>s you're working with, and offer a variety of options to <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#disallow-dynamic-typing">warn or error on usages of <code>Any</code></a>.</p>
<p>If we were inserting <code>sid</code> directly into a dictionary, we could do better by annotating the dictionary (or the function's return type) as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict">TypedDict</a>. This is a way to specify a dictionary with a fixed set of keys, each with a fixed type. It comes in really handy for Sydent, Sygnal and Synapse‚Äîall of <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/">the Matrix APIs</a> exchange JSON dictionaries, so anything we can do to teach mypy about their shape and types is gold dust.</p>
<p>In short, there were options for detecting this with some code changes, but no magic wand that would have spotted the error in the code as written.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/415/files#diff-4b3e0551612818927c87fe0100262ec230e0342def9d3f09214b93dea3efacb8L103-R107">error</a> was here:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>In this sample, <code>resp.headers</code> is a <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.web.http_headers.Headers.html">twisted.web.http_headers.Headers</a> instance. <code>getAllRawHeaders</code> is <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.web.http_headers.Headers.html#getAllRawHeaders">documented</a> as returning an iterable of <code>(bytes, Sequence[bytes])</code> pairs. Even better, mypy can see this because <code>getAllRawHeaders</code> is <a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/5c24e99e671c4082a1ddc8dbeb869402294bd0dc/src/twisted/web/http_headers.py#L261">annotated</a> (many thanks to the twisted authors for this). Mypy should be able to deduce that we build a dictionary <code>headers: Dict[bytes, Sequence[bytes]</code>. We can check this using <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html#when-you-re-puzzled-or-when-things-are-complicated"><code>reveal_type</code></a>:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>        headers = dict(resp.headers.getAllRawHeaders())

</span></code></pre>
<p>(The <code>*</code> in <code>builtins.bytes*</code> here means mypy has <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50499509/5252017">inferred</a> that the dictionary's keys are bytes, rather than being told explicitly that they must be bytes.)</p>
<p>That's all fine and dandy. But why didn't we spot this before if the annotations were all in place in twisted? Let's put aside the fact that, erm, we weren't running mypy in Sydent's CI <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/416">until the recent sprint</a>, unlike our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/5640992d176a499204a0756b1677c9b1575b0a49/.github/workflows/tests.yml#L21">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/blob/4a7367e84476a4b1054b1fe20e9e06f9f66e27f8/.github/workflows/pipeline.yml#L18-L26">projects</a>. Checking out the problematic version, we can run mypy on the file we know to contain the bug.</p>

<p>Huh. Mypy spots something, but not the error we were hoping for. What's going on here? We can ask mypy to show its working with <code>reveal_type</code> again.</p>

<p>Ahh, the <code>Any</code> type. As mentioned above, this represents a value whose type can't be statically determined. We're left to runtime checks to detect the problem. But we won't detect it at runtime, because dictionaries don't enforce any kind of type requirements on their keys and values.</p>
<p>The problem here is that mypy can't see that <code>resp.headers</code> is a twisted <code>Headers</code> object. If we could inform it of this, mypy would spot our bug:</p>

<p>There it is, on line 114: <code>Invalid index type &quot;str&quot; for &quot;Dict[bytes, Sequence[bytes]]&quot;; expected type &quot;bytes&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it'd be a pain to annotate our application code to mark every use of <code>IResponse.headers</code> as a <code>Headers</code> object. We'll see a better way to do things in this <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/10/type-coverage-for-sydent-annotation">the next post</a>, which discusses the nitty-gritty details of adding annotations file-by-file.</p>

            <h2 id="a-full-day-of-matrix-talks">A full day of Matrix talks</h2>
<p>This year, the Matrix.org Foundation is excited to host the first ever <em>Matrix.org Foundation and Community</em> devroom at FOSDEM. A full day of talks, demos and workshops around Matrix itself and projects built on top of Matrix.</p>
<p>Matrix is the open source project that publishes the Matrix open standard for secure, decentralised, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed reference implementations.</p>
<p>We encourage people working on the Matrix protocol or building on it in an open source project to submit a proposal! Note that companies are welcome to talk about the Matrix details of their open source projects, but marketing talks are not welcome.</p>
<p>We want this devroom to be a space where the Matrix community can show its work, where developers can talk about the challenges they faced and how they overcame them, and where people can get a glimpse of the future of the Matrix protocol and ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="talk-details">Talk Details</h2>
<p>The talks will be pre-recorded in January. They will be played during FOSDEM, followed by a session of live Q&amp;A depending on the format. During the playback of the talk, people will be able to comment and ask questions in the chat (via Matrix!).</p>
<p>The talks can follow one of three formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 min lightning talk, ideal to showcase your project and make people want to have a look at it</li>
<li>20 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A, for topics that can be covered briefly</li>
<li>50 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A for more complex subjects which need more focus</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly encourage you to prepare a demo when it makes sense, so people can actually see what your work looks like in practice!</p>
<p>Of course, the proposal must respect the FOSDEM terms as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conference language is English. All content must relate to Free and Open Source Software. By participating in the event you agree to the publication of your recordings, slides and other content provided under the same licence as all FOSDEM content (CC-BY).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="submitting-a-proposal">Submitting a Proposal</h2>
<p>Proposals must be <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22">submitted on FOSDEM's conference management system Pentabarf</a> before December 17th 2021. If you are not used to Pentabarf, you can follow this <a href="https://eyskens.me/beginners-guide-to-pentabarf/">beginners guide to Pentabarf</a>.</p>
<p>We expect to receive more requests than we have slots available. The devroom organisers (two community members and one core team rep) will be reviewing the proposals and accepting them based on the potential positive impact the project has on Matrix (as defined in by the Mission section of https://matrix.org/foundation).</p>
<p>If a project proposal has been turned down, it doesn't mean we don't believe it has good potential. Maintainers are invited to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> Matrix room to give it some visibility.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Synapse 1.49, due out on December 14th, will be the <strong>last release of Synapse to support Python 3.6 or PostgreSQL 9.6</strong> per our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.48/deprecation_policy.html">platform dependency deprecation policy</a>. Accordingly, we will remove support for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) at the same date, as it ships with Python 3.6.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="password-resets-and-identity-servers">Password resets and identity servers</h2>
<p>This release removes the long-deprecated <code>trust_identity_server_for_password_resets</code> configuration option. This option was initially deprecated in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.4.0">Synapse 1.4.0</a> back in October 2019.</p>
<p>Admins of servers still using this configuration option will need to update their Synapse configuration to send password resets through an SMTP server directly rather than relying on identity servers to send them on their behalf.</p>
<h2 id="new-admin-apis-and-improved-alignment-with-matrix-1-1">New <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin APIs</a> and improved alignment with Matrix 1.1</h2>
<p>This release also introduces a handful of new admin APIs, allowing administrators to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#controlling-whether-a-user-is-shadow-banned">un-shadow-ban users</a>, <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#block-room-api">block a room</a>, and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/background_updates.html#run">run specific background updates</a> (but we'll talk about this last one a bit later on). The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#delete-room-api">delete room API</a> has also been updated to be able to run in the background or to block a room pre-emptively, even if the server doesn't know about it yet.</p>
<p>This release also brings Synapse into greater alignment with version 1.1 of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">the Matrix specification</a> by adding support for API paths beginning <code>/_matrix/client/v3</code> and <code>/_matrix/media/v3</code>.</p>
<h2 id="background-updates">Background updates</h2>
<p>When Synapse updates from one version to another, it might need to run large scale updates on its database. In order to avoid blocking startup for too long while waiting for these updates to run, Synapse runs them in the background after starting.</p>
<p>Lately the Synapse team has been doing some work to improve the performance of these background updates. More specifically, this release includes a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11421">performance fix</a> for a background update introduced in Synapse 1.47.0, as well as a <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/background_updates.html#run">new admin API</a> to let admins rerun specific updates.</p>
<p>Future Synapse updates will also include <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11306">module capabilities</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11260">more configuration options</a> for controlling background updates.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release also includes some improved support of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> to help threading. It also adds support for the stable identifiers from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2778">MSC2778</a>, bringing Synapse closer to supporting end-to-end (or end-to-bridge) encryption support for application services.</p>
<p>We also now publish a Docker image, <code>matrixdotorg/synapse:develop</code>, which tracks the development head of Synapse.</p>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.48.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/binarymaster">Stanislav Motylkov</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tulir">Tulir Asokan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Neeeflix">Neeeflix</a>.</p>

This MSC is one of four which describe how aggregations should work in Matrix, and it's great to see them finally being properly spec'd, especially as further features start to be built on top of them (such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440/">threading</a>!).</p>
<p>And finally, a further thank you to community members <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3509">an OpenAPI schema fix</a>!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a>!</p>
<p>This proposal aims to allow appservices to get ever greater visibility into what is happening on the homeserver, while still maintaining full process separation.</p>
<p>A lot of the time solutions to complex problems require knowing when a user has registered or logged in, with what name/3pids etc, when users change their emails, etc. Hooking into these non-room-based actions can help with developing useful features. Maybe you want an appservice that plays a sound effect whenever a user signs up to your homeserver!</p>
<p>These days, that is often achieved by homeserver implementation-specific solutions, such as <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/">modules</a> in Synapse. Being able to notify of these events using a standard API shape would be hugely beneficial to generalisation of projects.</p>
<p>So give the proposal a look over and review if that interests you!

<p>Some exciting MSCs this week, I've been waiting for server-side aggregations for long!</p>

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As predicted last week, we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/23/synapse-1-47-1-released">released Synapse 1.47.1</a> on Tuesday. This is a security release which fixes an issue with Synapse's built-in media repository. Admins are strongly encouraged to upgrade.</p>
<p>Otherwise, relatively slow week: a handful of of the team have been away (Happy Thanksgiving, Americans!), but we <em>did</em> release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.48.0rc1">Synapse 1.48.0rc1</a>. Most importantly, this release candidate includes changes to improve the efficiency of large background updates from past releases, which should significantly reduce database load when upgrading. It also adds support for the <code>/v3</code> APIs defined in version 1.1 of the Matrix specification.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about 1.48 when it's formally released next week, but as always, we appreciate folks trying out the release candidates and letting us know how they behave.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bridging edits, deletions, reactions, formatting and read receipts in both directions (even <code>/rainbow</code> somewhat works from Matrix)</li>
<li>Bridging typing notifications and any types of files from Matrix to Google Chat</li>
<li>Bridging Google Meet links from Google Chat to Matrix</li>

</ul>
<p>(edits and deletions are only available on Google Workspace accounts, not normal accounts. I have no idea why they did that, but that's just how Google Chat works ü§∑)</p>
<p>There's still a bug where it sometimes silently stops receiving messages, which I'm currently trying to solve (or work around). After that I'll make a v0.3.0 release. Backfilling history may also happen in the near future</p>

<h3 id="matrix-webhook-receiver">Matrix Webhook Receiver <a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver">‚Üó</a></h3>
<p>An add-on for the matrix-appservice-webhooks bridge. Webhooks are essentially web interfaces for applications to &quot;push&quot; data to. The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver">Matrix Webhook Receiver</a></p>
<p>Do you like to receive notifications in matrix?
Matrix Webhook Receiver (MWR) is an add-on for the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-webhooks">matrix-appservice-webhooks</a> bridge. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">Webhooks</a> are essentially web interfaces for applications to &quot;push&quot; data to.
The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.</p>
<p>This is where MWR comes in:
It can receive any (JSON) content, optionally reformat it nicely (customizable!), and forward it to the webhooks bridge which will post it to a room for you. If you are running any software service, there is a good chance it can notify you via webhooks!</p>
<p>Right now, several example configurations exist, ready for you to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>GitLab (including Community Edition/self hosted)</li>
<li>Ansible Tower/AWX</li>
<li>Grafana Alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here is the GitHub webhook as seen in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org">#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org</a>:
<img src="/blog/img/webhook_receiver.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>More examples of apps currently in development: Prometheus Alertmanager, Jellyfin</p>
<p>It is also easy to use to send messages from the commandline with standard tools (<code>curl</code>), e.g. for your cron jobs! See the README for an example.</p>
<p>Some other webhook matrix things exist, but often require</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ûñ admin access to server (appservices)</li>
<li>‚ûñ installing and running and maintaining a specific bot per service</li>
<li>‚ûñ create and set up accounts and passwords for each bot to use</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, MWR requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ûñ matrix-appservice-webhooks set up on your server by your admin</li>
<li>‚ûñ some knowledge of how to send POST requests for one time setup. I want to improve that, suggestions are welcome!</li>
<li>‚ûï MWR can be installed and run by anyone who can access the bridge</li>
<li>‚ûï one single MWR supports any amount of notifying apps!</li>
<li>‚ûï you don't need admin access to the server to add more apps</li>
<li>‚ûï no need to develop a bot/plugin to support new apps, just write a quick jinja template</li>
<li>‚ûï multiple people can use a single MWR instance by sharing HTTP basic auth credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>Other features:</p>
<ul>
<li>can post into encrypted rooms (see readme)</li>
<li>automatically generated API docs</li>
<li>message formatting presets including html markup or m.notice</li>
<li>arbitrarily customizable webhook URLs</li>
<li>list and manage currently installed webhooks in your browser (<a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver/blob/main/examples/GUI_screenshot.png">screenshot</a>)</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks! Some exciting new news on the bridge front: I've renamed <code>matrix-github</code> to <code>matrix-hookshot</code> to better reflect it's not-just-GitHub-ness. That's not all though, as there are new features too:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridge now supports <strong>Rust</strong> as a companion language (we're aiming to rewrite critical sections in rust). Some parts of the formatting code have already been rewritten.</li>
<li>The bridge now supports JIRA (full puppeting!)</li>
<li>The bridge now supports generic webhooks too, with the ability to write <strong>custom handling code</strong> inside the state event to process these hooks into pretty messages.</li>
<li>Basic support for GitHub discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the works:</p>
<ul>
<li>A provisioning API to hook into integration managers</li>
<li>More GitLab support</li>
<li>Better GitHub discussions support</li>

<blockquote>
<p>After the 0.9.0 release last week, we have of course been busy fixing all the bugs different people reported. Messing around with the sticker pack editor and then leaving room should not make Nheko crash anymore. The problems where the flatpak has issues starting on Gnome systems are still under investigation. We thought we had a solution, but that seems to have broken other stuff! üí•</p>
<p>Apart from that we have been doing some after release party cleanup. Apart from some refactorings, you can now filter your rooms on whether they are a direct chat or not in the sidebar. This is in addition to the filters we already had for favourites, spaces and your other personal tags. User colors should also now be much less biased towards blue and jdenticons should have more variance. Expect the next release to be a much more colorful experience!</p>
<p>Speaking of colors, Twily made this awesome ZX Spectrum inspired logo after we changed our Gitlab bot to be more colorful! Check it out:

<p>Today is a good day for those calling me a spy, someone not wanting to care about privacy and for those who did publicly harass me for server_stats.</p>
<p>People using the API likely already noticed it wasn't reachable for a while. Effective immediately I am currently leaving all rooms  the bot is part of. This will take days or even months considering this are 6397 rooms at the time of writing. I am not going into the motives of why I am shutting it down. It comes down to personal reasons.</p>
<p>There won't be any dump of the data. The source will be kept public. Note though if anyone ever tries to run it that you need about 600GB of space for synapse, a lot of CPU, a lot of RAM and plenty of workers as this can easily crash synapse.</p>

<p>Server_Stats was an incredibly useful project. It pains me a lot to see it go, but it pains me even further that its author got harassed. This is not an acceptable behaviour, and we are better than that as a community. Thanks for this incredible project MTRNord, it's been both exciting and useful.</p>

            <p>Today we are releasing Synapse 1.47.1, a security update based on last week's release of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/17/synapse-1-47-0-released">Synapse 1.47.0</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.1">release</a> patches one high severity issue affecting Synapse installations 1.47.0 and earlier using the media repository. An attacker could cause these Synapses to download a remote file and store it in a directory outside the media repository. </p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>This only affects homeservers using Synapse's built-in media repository, as opposed to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse-s3-storage-provider">synapse-s3-storage-provider</a> or <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a>.</li>
<li>Attackers cannot control the exact name or destination of the stored file.</li>
</ul>
<p>To quote from the advisory:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="ghsa-3hfw-x7gx-437c-cve-2021-41281-path-traversal-when-downloading-remote-media"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-3hfw-x7gx-437c">GHSA-3hfw-x7gx-437c</a> / CVE-2021-41281: Path traversal when downloading remote media.</h3>
<h4 id="impact">Impact</h4>
<p>Synapse instances with the media repository enabled can be tricked into downloading a file from a remote server into an arbitrary directory, potentially outside the media store directory.</p>
<p>The last two directories and file name of the path are chosen randomly by Synapse and cannot be controlled by an attacker, which limits the impact.</p>
<p>Homeservers with the media repository disabled are unaffected. Homeservers configured with a federation whitelist are also unaffected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-3hfw-x7gx-437c">advisory</a> has full details, including workarounds.</p>
<p>This issue was discovered and fixed by our internal security team.</p>

            <p>Friday already? Did this week already happen? It looked like the spacetime continuum was broken and we didn't know who did it. We needed witnesses to solve the case: did things really happen this week? And the witnesses showed up! A huge thanks to everyone in the Matrix community who reported their progress, and to everyone currently working on making awesome projects around Matrix!</p>
<p>The case is closed: the week has not been stolen from us. Time appears to have wings, and flies faster than we had anticipated.</p>

<p>A very very dense and exciting wrap up of what's happening these days in the Matrix space by Matrix Foundation co-founders Matthew &amp; Amandine! Matrix is stepping up a gear with blazing fast Sync v3, Threading Support, VoIP, VR, a new release of the Spec, always more monthly active users, a full security audit and progress on P2P.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h3 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h3>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3489">MSC3489: Sharing streams of location data</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3488">MSC3488: Extending events with location data</a></li>

<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3283">MSC3283: Expose capabilities for profile actions</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>This week we finally, finally had one of the aggregation-related MSCs, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> (event relationships) enter final comment period! This MSC, along with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issue-406544216">several others</a>, document the stuff that powers message edit, reactions, the upcoming threading and polls MSCs, and much more! So it's really great to see the MSCs start to actually land.</p>
<p>Speaking of threading <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> has had a good amount of review from the Spec Core Team last week. Threading in Matrix has been a long awaited feature for chat applications - as well as helping extend the flexibility of Matrix as a data structure even further. The MSC relies on both <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (or a modified version of it), so the latter will be an area of focus for review for next week.</p>
<h3 id="spec-prs">Spec PRs</h3>
<p>It seems that the recent <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">Matrix v1.1</a> has drummed up some more community support for spec PRs. Thank you to everyone who's sent in clarifications, changes and even typo fixes. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aankur12-1610">fixes to the OpenAPI fields, and for typo corrections in the spec copy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for helping review them. Thank you both! </p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2867">MSC2867: Marking rooms as unread</a>!</p>
<p>This is definitely a feature that I would love to have for chat. Note that this MSC proposes marking <em>a room</em> as unread, rather than a specific point in the room's timeline. This is intentional as noted in the document, as the latter is more complicated, as it intersects with sending out read receipts to other users.

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> we plan to release a <strong>security release, Synapse 1.47.1</strong> on the coming <strong>Tuesday, 23rd of November</strong>; see the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/18/pre-disclosure-upcoming-security-release-of-synapse-1-47-1">predisclosure</a>.</p>
<p>We released Synapse 1.47.0 after squashing a couple of problems related to database migrations remaining in 1.47.0rc2.  Briefly, this release includes</p>
<ul>
<li>new features for users of the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin</a> and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">module</a> APIs;</li>
<li>a number of long-standing bug fixes, including a thorny bug which prevented joining certain old rooms; and</li>
<li>continuing efforts to prototype new MSCs and improve type coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/17/synapse-1-47-0-released">blog post</a> has a better summary, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0">GitHub</a> has the full gory details.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.1">Sydent 2.5.1</a>, a minor release which improves the way we handle and log various error cases.</p>
<p>Thank you as ever to our community contributors, and everyone out there who's using Synapse to communicate!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> also reminds us</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we release the fix, the changes will be publicly known and bad actors will have the ability to deduce the vulnerability. Most servers don't run release candidates, so releasing the fix in an RC will mean there's a larger window for an attacker to exploit the problem. Internally, there will be an RC deployed to test homeservers and eventually matrix.org. This means we'll be able to confidently recommend the upgrade to server administrators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dkasak:termina.org.uk">dkasak</a> adds</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that's the very reason we have dedicated security releases, instead of just rolling the security fixes into a feature release. The security release doesn't contain anything new apart from the security fix so it minimizes the chance of things going wrong.</p>

<p>Keep your servers up to date, and your users safe, administrators!</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.7.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement &quot;best effort&quot; basic IRC moderation in plumbed rooms if bot has ops on IRC</li>
<li>Allow configuring topic sync for plumbs (IRC&lt;-&gt;Matrix or one way)</li>
<li>Allow using forward slash (/) as MXID separator for IRC ghosts</li>
<li>Bump max mautrix version to &lt;0.12</li>
<li>Small fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Plumb moderation! If the bridge bot has ops on IRC it will do its best to map kicks and bans (regarding IRC users) from Matrix. This definitely isn't perfect and is meant as a convenience.</p>
<p>Topic synchronization is now configurable for plumbs as well to make it possible to share the same topic between an IRC channel and a plumbed Matrix room. Default is still off and it requires the bridge bot to have enough PL to work.</p>
<p>The separator for IRC ghosts can now be changed to forward slash (/) from the default underscore (_). This happens by modifying the regex in the registration file. Only do this for new installations and it will cause <em>all</em> IRC users to duplicate in rooms who you can't remove and probably other bad side effects as well. The default may be changed in the future.</p>
<p>There were lots of refactoring issues so I hope I fixed all of them üôà.</p>
<p>Best effort your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>after the Miounne update posted a minute ago here is another one, and it's about time: Time To Matrix (ttm) got v1.4.0 release!</p>
<p>Time To Matrix is a <code>time</code>-like command that will send end of an arbitrary command output and some other info (like exit status) to matrix room.</p>
<p>With new release, following things were added:</p>
<ul>
<li>arch linux AUR package</li>
<li>automatic room alias resolving, so you can use <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ttm:etke.cc">#ttm:etke.cc</a> instead of !XODRhTLplrymaFicdK:etke.cc</li>
<li>help message and human-readable errors</li>
<li>option to change message type (<code>m.text</code> or <code>m.notice</code>)</li>
<li>option to omit plaintext and send only html-formatted message (to get some more space for log)</li>
<li>option to override message type to <code>m.notice</code> if the command exits with non-zero exit code (by default <code>m.text</code> is sent, so you will get <code>m.notice</code> on failure)</li>

<h3 id="version-2-3-0-released">Version 2.3.0 Released!</h3>
<p>simplematrixbotlib is an easy to use bot library for the Matrix ecosystem written in Python and based on matrix-nio. Version 2.3.0 adds support for additional configuration via config files and other methods. Currently, there is only one setting that can be changed, however many existing and future features will be able to be enabled or disabled via this config.</p>
<p>Example usage is shown below:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>&quot;&quot;&quot;
</span><span>random_user
</span><span>     !echo something
</span><span>echo_bot
</span><span>     something
</span><span>&quot;&quot;&quot;
</span><span>
</span><span>import simplematrixbotlib as botlib
</span><span>
</span><span>creds = botlib.Creds(&quot;https://home.server&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;)
</span><span>
</span><span>config = botlib.Config()
</span><span>config.load_toml(&quot;config.toml&quot;)
</span><span>
</span><span>bot = botlib.Bot(creds, config)

</span><span>          await bot.api.send_text_message(room.room_id,
</span><span>                                &quot; &quot;.join(arg for arg in match.args()))
</span><span>
</span><span>bot.run()

<li>Many improvements to testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Any rumor of a v1.2.0 Docker image borked by yours truly is sadly true. There should be no risk in 1.2.0 but, to be on the safe side, if you have updated to 1.2.0, please update to 1.2.1.</p>

<p>An important note on the interesting projects using Matrix for the login: those are community projects, and there are MSCs in the works to &quot;do it right&quot; at the Spec level!</p>
<p>As Matthew Hodgson <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29242445">reported in a comment on Hacker News</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The direction we're headed in the Matrix spec core team is instead towards replacing Matrix's current auth mechanisms with normal Open ID Connect (rather than wrapping our own OIDC-like thing, as we do today) - as per https://github.com/sandhose/matrix-doc/blob/msc/sandhose/oauth2-profile/proposals/2964-oauth2-profile.md The common login flow would then be for users to be authed by their server using a trusted OIDC identity provider, rather than ever trusting arbitrary clients with their credentials.</p>

<p>I have compiled <a href="https://austinhuang.me/matrix-homeservers.html">a list of public homeservers</a> available for registration, since previous such efforts to make these homeservers more discoverable fell through. This list serves as a sanitized version of the asra.gr list, with only homeservers intended for public consumption included. It is a static list and does not include pings, but rather than focusing on the technical aspect, my list has an emphasis on the written rules of a homeserver, which I believe to play a larger role in the Matrix experience. Hope this can spark other efforts in maintaining a better list!</p>

            <p>On <strong>Tuesday, 23rd November</strong> we plan to release Synapse 1.47.1 at 12:00 UTC to address a single high severity issue. This vulnerability was discovered internally by our security team. Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org team and the wider Matrix community.</p>
<p>If you're a server administrator running Synapse, <strong>please be prepared to upgrade as soon as the patched version is released</strong>.</p>
<p>We will be reaching out to downstream packagers to ensure they can prepare patched versions of affected packages at the time of the release. The details of the vulnerability will be disclosed in a blog post on the day of the release. There is so far no evidence of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience while we work to resolve this issue.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We anticipate publishing a <strong>security release</strong>, Synapse 1.47.1, on the coming Tuesday, the 23rd of November.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.47.1 will contain a fix for a high severity issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Synapse 1.47.0 features additions to the admin and module APIs, a plethora of fixes for long-standing bugs, and a raft of internal improvements. Server administrators should note that this release removes a deprecated API for deleting a room and deprecates a module callback. Consult the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1470">upgrade notes</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="new-admin-and-module-apis">New <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin</a> and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">module</a> APIs</h2>
<p>Administrators can now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11099">search for rooms by their ID or alias</a>. We hope this will be particularly useful for projects like <a href="https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/synapse-admin">synapse-admin</a>! We've also exposed an API to allow admins to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11263">control Synapse's background updates</a>.  And while it's not strictly an API change, there's a small <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11211/files">patch</a> which makes it easier for homeservers to redirect matrix traffic to port 443.</p>
<p>Authors of pluggable modules have some new toys to play with. There's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11126">a way to listen for new events</a>; a means to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11204">retrieve room state</a> and the ability to edit a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11147">user's membership of a room</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixes-and-refactors">Bug Fixes and Refactors</h2>
<p>We fixed a variety of different bugs in this release, many of which were long-standing. It's good to see them dealt with! Worth mentioning in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10097">the</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11199">handling</a> of the <code>device_inbox</code> table, which trim redundant data to reduce database bloat.</li>
<li>Fixes related to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11255">restarting</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11262">workers</a>, to ensure a more reliable upgrade process.</li>
<li>Fix being <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11135">unable to join certain v1 rooms</a>, e.g. <code>#NextCloud:matrix.org</code>, whose state contained floating point numbers.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11207">Fix serialisation and duplication errors</a> when sending ephemeral events to application services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, work continues on improving type-checking coverage, both <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11205">in</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11164">Synapse</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/pull/264">in</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/pull/271">Sygnal</a>.</p>

This is a minor release which mainly tidies up error handling to reduce the amount of noise in logs. It should also make it easier for us to diagnose some outstanding bugs which remain to be squashed.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>In the background, we're still working away at implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> to facilitate threading. Early tests are promising. We're also exploring <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775</a> as a means to speed up room joins. Both will be long term projects that should hopefully reap major rewards for the Matrix ecosystem. Lastly, there's support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3288">MSC3228</a> to allow identity servers to provide bespoke invites to spaces. We mentioned this <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/02/synapse-1-46-0-released#sydent-250">last time</a> in Sydent release notes; now we've got support for it on the Synapse side.</p>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.47.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>

<p><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1">Matrix v1.1</a> was released! Read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">blog post here</a> if you missed it; it summarises everything that's new in v1.1, as well as plans for the future. Now that the new spec build pipeline and release infrastructure is in place, we're aiming for roughly quarterly releases going forward. Thank you all for being so patient in the meantime!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767: Extensible event types &amp; fallback in Matrix (v2)</a> (yes it really chose that).</p>
<p>Extensible events is something that has been a long time coming in Matrix. It unlocks so much potential, and is even currently being built on (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> (polls)). Definitely one of the next big ticket items to tackle in the medium term.

<blockquote>
<p>Dan (aka callahad) is away this week, so let me report on his behalf.</p>
<p>We cut a release candidate for Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0rc2">1.47.0rc2</a>, but see the changelog for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0rc1">rc1</a>). It exposes new functionality for <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">pluggable modules</a> and new endpoints to the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">Admin API</a>. We've fixed a bunch of long-standing bugs and continued to drive forward efforts to improve documentation and code quality. Thank you to all of our contributors!</p>
<p>With future releaes in mind, we've been continuing work to support threading and E2EE application services. We've also been prototyping a new Admin API to remove users from all rooms belonging to a certain space.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we've been doubling down on our effort to improve reliability and maintainability of our services as a whole. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent">Sydent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a> have a number of PRs in flight for both, aimed at improving type coverage and driving down error noise in the logs. We've drafted a blog post to summarise the process of type annotating mypy (keep your eyes out for that one). We also worked to make the matrix.org database more resilient, and made changes to improve the experience of rolling out upgrades to Synapse en masse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you love bugs as much as I do? ‚ô•üêõ‚ô•</p>
<p>I guess not. For that reason bug fixing in Nheko for the next release continues. We fixed a super annoying issue, where loading keys from the online backup could make Nheko stuck in a flickering mode with no way to interact with it anymore. You can now also click anywhere on a read receipt to open someones profile instead of just their avaitar, edited messages now also show as redacted, if only the original message got redacted and don't lose the reply in encrypted rooms, if the edit was sent by a client, that is not Nheko. You also used to get logged out after registration, which should finally be resolved. There were also a bazillion translation updates! Thank you, everyone who contributed to those.</p>
<p>We also finally merged the prettier video player, which also fixes a video playback issue on macOS. Try it out and give us feedback on it!</p>
<p>We are still hunting down some last bugs, but expect the release soon now. In the meantime, I did start summarizing the changes, if you want to see what will be in the next release: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#090----unreleased</p>
