It's currently missing an implementation if someone is looking for a medium complexity contribution this weekend üòâ </p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan Abolivier</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, we've released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/04/05/synapse-1-56-released">Synapse 1.56</a>! It includes only a couple of new features but quite a few bug fixes and internal improvements. One of the main changes included in this version is that Synapse will now refuse to start if configured with open registration with no verification (e.g. email, recaptcha, etc). This is an attempt at reducing the likelihood of spam across the federation, as most cases of abuse we've observed over time usually involves the attacker(s) finding homeservers with open registration and automatically creating a lot of accounts on them in order to evade sanctions.</p>
<p>This version of Synapse also deprecates the groups/communities feature of Matrix. This is a feature we introduced back in 2017, and was the predecessor of Matrix spaces. But now that it has been mostly replaced by spaces, we have decided to retire this feature, which we thank dearly for its 4 years of good and loyal service to the federation.</p>
<p>Read all about this, and more, in the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/04/05/synapse-1-56-released">release announcement</a> on the Matrix.org blog! üôÇ</p>

<p>Hello webhook fans! As teased last week, configuration widgets have landed in hookshot! <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.4.0">1.4.0</a> now contains all you need to setup your very own webhooks without having to leave the comfort of your GUI. The plan is for widgets to be greatly expanded over the new few releases to support more services. Eventually, this work is going to propagate out to other matrix.org bridgey projects üåâ.</p>
<p>The full feature list for this release looks a bit like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add support for configuring generic webhooks via widgets. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/140">#140</a>)</li>
<li>Show the closing comments on closed GitHub PRs. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/262">#262</a>)</li>
<li>Webhooks created via <code>!hookshot webhook</code> now have their secret URLs sent to the admin room with the user, rather than posted in the bridged room. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/265">#265</a>)</li>
<li>Automatically link GitHub issues and pull requests when an issue number is mentioned (by default, using the # prefix). (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/277">#277</a>)</li>
<li>Support GitLab release webhook events. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/278">#278</a>)</li>

<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p>Many updates this week!  New features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mentions &amp; replies, both incoming &amp; outgoing
<ul>
<li>Small exception: Matrix-&gt;KT replies don't yet work in KT &quot;open channels&quot; yet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ability to create a portal by inviting a KT puppet to a DM
<ul>
<li>Note that this currently only works for KT direct chat channels that already exist &amp; have been active recently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connection resilience between the Python and Node components of the bridge
<ul>
<li>i.e. If the Node component ever exits &amp; restarts, the Python component will reconnect to it automatically.  This helps both with deployment (since it allows the components to be started in any order) and crash tolerance (since a Node crash &amp; restart no longer requires a manual restart of the Python component) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clear warnings when receiving a KT message that the bridge doesn't yet support</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, the bridge should be fairly usable now.  Very soon I'll open a Matrix-bridged KT channel to act as a public stress-test!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Syphon is a Matrix client with heavy emphasis on privacy and ease of use; currently in open alpha.</p>
<p>Hi all üëã.</p>
<p>We released <a href="https://github.com/syphon-org/syphon/releases/tag/0.2.13"><code>0.2.13</code></a> this week mainly fixing an annoying bug that could cause messages sent while a configured proxy server was down to be re-sent multiple times once the proxy came back online. If you use a proxy with Syphon, this update is highly recommended!</p>
<p>In addition, this release will only show the option to use hidden read receipts if the feature is supported by your server.</p>
<p>Finally, a range of translation updates and improvements are included in this release.</p>
<p>More changes are coming soon, including a (currently work-in-progress) <a href="https://github.com/syphon-org/syphon/pull/660">implementation</a> of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2228">MSC2228</a> (self destructing events). As far as we know, we're on track to be the first user-facing implementation of this MSC, putting Syphon on the bleeding edge of Matrix!</p>

<h3 id="nheko-website">Nheko (<a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the awesome polyjuice client, Nheko now supports MSC3700, which slightly improves privacy in encrypted rooms. It also lead to us fixing issues with the secure symmetric secret storage, where some clients use a different base64 encoding than recommended in the spec, which could make unlocking the secrets with a recovery key or passphrase fail. And we also improved the key queries on initial login, which would sometimes fail to_device messages with a warning, that the device is unknown.</p>
<p>As a small feature, you can now close the currently open room using Ctrl-W, spaces are not treated as DMs under some circumstances anymore, you should get a less confusing error message than 500 when entering an invalid alias now and lots of fixes to the translations.</p>
<p>Thank you, LorenDB, Apurv and Mikaela for the contributions!</p>

<p>A Social Annotation Tool Powered by Matrix</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since last time, we've made a lot of small quality-of-life improvements, but a few changes that stand out are:</p>
<ol>
<li>We've improved support for offline PWA usage.</li>
<li>We've improved caching of space contents, reducing the number of times that we need to hit the spaceHierarchy endpoint and improving performance.</li>
<li>We've moved to a more in-the-spirit-of-the-spec way of handling hidden annotations: these are now represented by rooms with an <code>m.space.parent</code> event, and no correpsponding <code>m.space.child</code> event in the resource-space.</li>
<li>We've added a modal for viewing image messages at full-size.</li>
</ol>
<p>Number 4 works nicely with my teaching-assistant-bot (built with matrix-bot-sdk, mathjs, and chartjs), which helps me visualize information about student activity.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/opentower/matrix-doc/blob/text-markup/proposals/3752-markup-locations-for-text.md">MSC3752 - Markup Locations for Text</a>, has also filled out quite a bit! Implementation coming soon hopefully.</p>

<p>A decentralized and federated way of annotating the web based on Matrix.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@daniel:matrix.danilafe.com">Daniel</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrix highlight saw some &quot;under the hood&quot; changes this week, in particular a refactor to rely less on the Chrome/Firefox extension API. This should make it possible (in theory, and with some more work) to run Matrix Highlight on pages without installing anything! Aside from the obvious, I think that there are additional use cases opened up by this change; one such case I have in mind is as a commenting system on a site (a la cactus comments, but with the ability to highlight page snippets!). </p>
<p>In the process of all of this, I've spent some time running Matrix Highlight in Firefox. I've encountered no issues during this time, so it seems like the tool is usable from FF, too.

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a> 2.0.0-RC1 has been released.
This release candidate contains many breaking changes due to a large refactoring, which allows us to share a lot code between server and client implementations of the Matrix APIs.
Yes, that means Trixnity can be used to implement a matrix server!
We also made some progress to make the client module (with all the high level logic) multiplaform. This is the only module, which does not support Kotlin/Native and Kotlin/JS yet.
There are many other features (like client-side notifications!), which has been added. See the changelog for more details:</p>
<p>features/improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>clientserverapi-server: new module for server-side REST endpoints of the Client-Server-API (Server-Server-API will follow soon)</li>
<li>olm: libolm is bundled into trixnity-olm jars</li>
<li>client: push notification support (push rules are evaluated)</li>
<li>client: introduce helpers to get complete timeline as flow (no more complicated loops to get the timeline)</li>
<li>client: allow subscribing to all timeline events -&gt; really helpful for bots with e2e support</li>
<li>client: allow to sync once (e. g. for push notifications)</li>
<li>client: content field of TimelineEvent gets also set for unencrypted events</li>
<li>client: public access to keys</li>
<li>clientserverapi-model: allow custom field in pusher data</li>
<li>core: introduce BaseEventContentSerializerMappings</li>
</ul>
<p>bugfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>client: remove direct room, when other user leaves room</li>
<li>client: change varchar length to support MariaDB</li>
<li>clientserverapi-client: first sync after pause without timeout</li>

            <p>Happy release day everyone! <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.56.0">Synapse
1.56</a> is out! Let's
have a look at what's new in this release.</p>
<h2 id="additional-restrictions-around-registration">Additional restrictions around registration</h2>
<p>One common abuse scenario we have seen on Matrix over the years is attackers
making use of public homeservers with open registration to automatically create
multiple accounts in order to evade sanctions. Sometimes, this can lead to these
public homeservers being banned across multiple public rooms despite their
administrator(s) not being directly at fault.</p>
<p>In order to mitigate this, starting from this release, Synapse will refuse to
start by default if it is configured with open registration with no additional
verification. This means users wishing to register on these homeservers will
need to authenticate themselves, either via
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/8a519f8abc6de772167c2cca101d22ee2052fafc/docs/sample_config.yaml#L1285">email</a>,
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.56/CAPTCHA_SETUP.html">recaptcha</a> or
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.56/usage/administration/admin_api/registration_tokens.html">registration
tokens</a>.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.56/upgrade.html#open-registration-without-verification-is-now-disabled-by-default">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="so-long-groups-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish">So long groups, and thanks for all the fish</h2>
<p>Long-time users of Matrix might remember when, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2017/10/24/synapse-0-24-is-here">way back in
2017</a>, we introduced
groups (also known as communities in some clients). Groups would let users
define a curated set of users and rooms to represent a given community that
others could refer to. We even used to have <code>+matrix:matrix.org</code> which was
the official group for the Matrix team and community.</p>
<p>If this sounds a bit familiar to you (and remind you of a certain other feature
of Matrix), that's no coincidence. Some time ago, we had already identified a
good amount of shortcomings with groups, and decided to redesign the feature
entirely and release it under the name &quot;spaces&quot;. If you're curious about this,
then you may wish to read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/17/the-matrix-space-beta">spaces announcement
blogpost</a> we released
at the time.</p>
<p>Now that spaces have been out of beta for some time, and have shown to be a very
useful feature to the ecosystem, we decided it was time to retire support for
groups from Synapse, after more than 4 years of good and loyal service. This
release of Synapse deprecates the feature, with a plan to disable it by default
in Synapse 1.58 (which is expected to be released next month).</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>As of this version, Synapse will also refuse to start the if the Postgres
database it is running against has a non-<code>C</code> locale, in order to prevent
accidental database corruption. See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.56/upgrade.html#change-in-behaviour-for-postgresql-databases-with-unsafe-locale">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>This release also includes the ability for modules to register server
administrators through the <code>register_user</code> method, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.56.0/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L1290-L1312">new
method</a>
to allow modules to store external 3PID associations into Synapse's database.</p>

changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the

<p>Another MSC in the sphere of moderation, and one that aims to put moderation control more in the hands of room admins rather than homeserver admins. A similar MSC in this realm is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3215">MSC3215</a> (Aristotle), which aims to send event reports to room admins, rather than homeserver admins that may not even have control over the malicious user.

<p>Happy Friday everyone!</p>
<p>In case you missed it, we've released the first release candidate for Synapse 1.56 on Tuesday. This one includes a couple new module-related features, but also quite a few bugfixes and internal improvements. I'll talk about this in more details next week when Synapse 1.56 gets properly released, but the key points of this release is that Synapse will now refuse to start if it's configured with unsafe registration settings (i.e. open registration without any form of verification) as well as if it's running against a PostgreSQL database with the wrong locale values. Have a look at the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.56/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1560">upgrade notes</a> for more information about this.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the team still continuing work on the two main topics I've been mentioning in previous weeks: fast room joins and integrating <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a>.

<p>More updates! This week the bridge library itself gets a major update. We've made a few breaking changes, notably we now expect target homeservers to at least be Matrix v1.2 compatible. Also, this release brings the new &quot;Provisioning and Widgets API&quot; which allows developers to start creating HTTP APIs for their bridges which work for both provisioning mode (shared secret tokens) and widget API style (authenticating via Matrix OpenID token sharing). This stuff is still a little experimental, but it's starting to power our new experiments in the bridge world.</p>

<p>Media messages, both from or to KakaoTalk, are now supported!  The biggest exceptions are inbound files &amp; stickers.  The latter may be a hard sell to get working, due to how KT manages stickers, but I'll look into it some more before giving a concrete answer.</p>
<p>The bridge is also now responsive to disconnects, like when you log in from another KakaoTalk desktop client (since the bridge mimics the desktop client, and KT only allows one desktop client to be logged in at a time!).  Luckily, not all KakaoTalk APIs rely on the same connection that chatting does, meaning that some functionality can continue to work even when &quot;disconnected&quot;.  The bridge now takes advantage of this, meaning that profile-management commands (currently just the <code>list-friends</code> command) will work even if you get disconnected from chats for whatever reason.</p>
<p>The bridge is drawing ever closer to &quot;good enough&quot; status...  Please give it a try if curious!</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.0 is a big number and a step not taken lightly. But Nheko has been in development for half a decade and we think it is time to take a step forward! As such we worked hard to fix readability issues in the app. Your messages should now be readable on any theme, because we send the first half as white text and the second half as black text (thank you, rrogalski for the contribution). For accessibility reasons this is enabled by default. We also added an improved typing indicator. Sometimes it is hard to notice when a message is too long, as such we gradually adjust the background color the longer the message gets. It also helps a lot, if you have a bad theme and can't read the text against the background color. Just enter a few characters and the background will change, so the messages should become readable. But that is not all! We all know some people have  a harder time seeing colors than others. So for accessibility we also slowly rotate the screen, so that even if your display is monochrome, you don't miss out. Please see the attached video for a demo or check out our release candidates <a href="https://matrix.neko.dev/_matrix/media/r0/download/neko.dev/GsEuaoEXokYtZUStAmxrRcOs">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/tree/march-2022">here</a>.</p>

<p>Before this month we also rewrote the room creation dialogs to be less confusing. We now have separate dialogs for direct chats and group chats, which should cut down confusion between the options by a lot. You can also now edit the topic and name of a room inline and Malte added a jump to bottom button. On mobile you can also now drag to the sides to reply. Last but not least, you can now knock on rooms from Nheko using <code>/knock</code> or if an invite failed because you were not allowed to join a room and you can add a reason to room joins, leaves, invites, knocks and everything. Some of those features require the server to support Matrix v1.1, so make sure you update your servers to use them.</p>

Recordings of talks will be available soon after the conference, and tickets are still available to be there live in person or online! Here's the talk summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Matrix network provides messaging (like WhatsApp or Slack) that offers all the features you expect, but without centralised control: it's an open standard, and anyone can run a server. The servers link together, so you can talk to other people even if they use a different server (kind of like email).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first half of this session, we will explore the basics of the protocol: making simple HTTP requests to send and receive messages, and discuss some of the interesting distributed-systems issues that make writing a server exciting.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the second half we will explore the fact that messaging is only one potential use of this network, and look into some examples of other real-time use cases that are in active development, taking note of how these use cases benefit from the real-time and distributed nature of the network.</p>

<p>There was some silence lately on this, but activity is picking back up.</p>
<p>Mainly, the project is getting rewritten. Why? Well, I learned from the issues and ran into issues with the framework used. There are going to be various changes to the architecture (like no more SSR, no nextjs, pwa support and more).</p>
<p>Feel free to follow https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-art/pull/121 for progress.</p>
<p>Another big thing that's going to change is that I am working on a complete redesign.  While I am still fairly early in the iterations, I wanted to share the first art direction Matrix Art is going to go. The main changes are that I try to have an art language which distinguishes it from the other proprietary players, as well as compensating for the fact that Matrix Art has a much lower volume of images on it's feed.

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We've been flooded with questions about the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220315IPR25504/">DMA</a>
since it was announced last week, and have spotted some of the
gatekeepers jumping to the wrong conclusions about what it might entail.
Just in case you don't want to wade through
yesterday's <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/29/how-do-you-implement-interoperability-in-a-dma-world/">sprawling blog post</a>,
we've put together a quick FAQ to cover the most important points based on
our understanding.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-dma-mean-for-the-gatekeepers">What does DMA mean for the gatekeepers?</h3>
<p>The gatekeepers will have to open and document their existing APIs, so that
alternative clients and/or bridges can connect to their service. The DMA
requires that the APIs <em>must</em> expose the same level of privacy for remote
users as for local users. So, if their service is end-to-end-encrypted
(E2EE), the APIs must expose the same E2EE semantics (e.g. so that an
alternative client connecting would have to implement E2EE too). For
E2EE-capable APIs to work, the gatekeeper will likely have to model remote
users as if they were local in their system. In the short term (one year
horizon) this applies only to 1:1 chats and file transfers. In the long term
(three year horizon) this applies to group chats and voip calls/conferences
too.</p>
<h3 id="who-counts-as-a-gatekeeper">Who counts as a ‚Äúgatekeeper‚Äù?</h3>
<p>The DMA defines any tech company worth over ‚Ç¨75B or with over ‚Ç¨7.5B of
turnover as a gatekeeper, who must open their communication APIs. This means
only the tech giants are in scope (e.g. as of today that includes Meta,
Apple, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce/Slack - not Signal, Telegram, Discord,
Twitter).</p>
<h3 id="does-this-mean-the-gatekeepers-are-being-forced-to-implement-an-open-standard-such-as-matrix-or-xmpp">Does this mean the gatekeepers are being forced to implement an open standard such as Matrix or XMPP?</h3>
<p>No. They can keep their existing implementations and APIs. For
interoperability with other service providers, they will need to use a
bridge (which could bridge via a common language such as Matrix or XMPP).</p>
<h3 id="are-bridges-secure">Are bridges secure?</h3>
<p>If the service lacks end-to-end-encryption (Slack, Teams, Google Chat,
non-secret chats on Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Google Messages etc) then
the bridge does not reduce security or privacy, beyond the fact that bridged
conversations by definition will be visible to the bridge and to the service
you are interoperating with.</p>
<p>If the service has E2EE (WhatsApp, iMessage, secret chats on Messenger) then
the bridge will necessarily have to decrypt (and reencrypt, where possible)
the data when passing it to the other service. This means the conversation is
no longer E2EE, and thus less secure (the bridge could be compromised and
inspect or reroute their messages) - and so gatekeepers must warn the user
that their conversation is leaving their platform and is no longer E2EE with
something like this:</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-warning.jpg" width="430"/>
</div>
<br/>
<h3 id="why-is-the-dma-good">Why is the DMA good?</h3>
<p>The upside is that the user has the freedom to use an infinite number of
services (bots, virtual assistants, CRMs, translation services, etc) as well
as speak to any other user in the world, regardless what platform they use.</p>
<p>It also puts much-needed pressure on the gatekeepers to innovate and
differentiate rather than rely on their network effects to attract new
users - creating a much more vibrant, open, competitive marketplace for
users.</p>
<p>See &quot;<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/29/how-do-you-implement-interoperability-in-a-dma-world#whats-driven-the-dma">What's driven the DMA?</a>&quot;
for more details.</p>
<h3 id="if-the-dma-requires-that-remote-users-have-the-same-security-as-local-users-how-can-bridges-work">If the DMA requires that remote users have the same security as local users, how can bridges work?</h3>
<p>The DMA requires that the <em>APIs</em> expose the same level of security as for
local users - ie E2EE must be exposed. If the users in a conversation choose
to use a bridge and thus reencrypt the messages, then it is their choice to
tradeoff encryption in favour of interoperability for a given conversation.</p>
<h3 id="does-this-undermine-the-gatekeepers-current-encryption">Does this undermine the gatekeepers‚Äô current encryption?</h3>
<p>Absolutely not. Users talking to other users within the same E2EE-capable
gatekeeper will still be E2EE (assuming the gatekeeper doesn‚Äôt pull that rug
from under its users) - and in fact it gives the gatekeepers an excellent way
to advertise the selling point that E2EE is only guaranteed when you speak to
other users on the same platform.</p>
<h3 id="but-why-do-we-need-bridges-if-everyone-spoke-a-common-protocol-you-wouldn-t-ever-have-to-decrypt-messages-to-convert-them-between-protocols">But why do we need bridges? If everyone spoke a common protocol, you wouldn‚Äôt ever have to decrypt messages to convert them between protocols.</h3>
<p>Practically speaking, we don‚Äôt expect the gatekeepers to throw away their
existing stacks (or implement multihead messengers that also speak open
protocols). It‚Äôs true that if they natively spoke Matrix or XMPP then the
reencryption problem would go away, but it‚Äôs more realistic to focus on
opening the existing APIs than interpret the legislation as a mandate to
speak Matrix. Perhaps in future players will adopt Matrix of their own
volition.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-these-bridges-come-from">Where do these bridges come from?</h3>
<p>There is already a vibrant community of developers who build unofficial
bridges to the gatekeepers - eg Element, Beeper and hundreds of open source
developers in the Matrix and XMPP communities. Historically these bridges
have been hampered by having to use unofficial and private APIs, making them
a second class citizen - but with open documented APIs guaranteed by the DMA
we eagerly anticipate an explosion of high quality transparent bridges which
will be invisible to the end user.</p>
<h3 id="can-you-run-e2ee-bridges-clientside-to-make-them-safer">Can you run E2EE bridges clientside to make them safer?</h3>
<p>Maybe. For instance, current iMessage bridges work by running iMessage on a
local iPhone or Mac and then reencrypting the messages there for
interoperability. Given the messages are already exposed on the client
anyway, this means that E2EE is not broken - and avoids decrypting them on a
server. There is lots of development in this space currently, and with open
APIs guaranteed by DMA the pace should speed up significantly.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-you-tell-what-service-you-should-use-to-talk-to-a-given-remote-user">How can you tell what service you should use to talk to a given remote user?</h3>
<p>For 1:1 chats this is easy: you can simply ask the user which service they
want to use to talk to a given user, if that user is not already on that
service.</p>
<p>For group chats it is harder, and this is why the deadline for group chats is
years away. The problem is that you need a way to verify the identity of
arbitrary numbers of remote users on  different platforms - effectively
looking up their identity in a secure manner which stops services from
maliciously spoofing identities.</p>
<p>One possible way to solve this would be for users to explicitly link their
identity on one service with that on the gatekeeper‚Äôs service - eg ‚ÄúAlice on
AliceChat is talking in the same room as Bob on BobChat; Bob will be asked to
prove to AliceChat that he is the real Bob‚Äù - and so if AliceChat has already
validated Bob‚Äôs identity, then this can be used to spot him popping up on
other services. It also gives Bob a way to block themselves from ever being
unwittingly bridged to AliceChat.</p>
<p>There are many other approaches too - and the onus is on the industry to
figure out the best solution for decentralised identity in the next 3-4 years
in order to realise the most exciting benefits of the DMA.</p>

        <div>
            <p>With last week‚Äôs revelation that the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220315IPR25504/deal-on-digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-competition-and-more-choice-for-users">EU Digital Markets Act</a>
will require tech gatekeepers (companies valued at over $75B or with over
$7.5B of turnover) to open their communication APIs for the purposes of
interoperability, there‚Äôs been a lot of speculation on what this could mean
in practice, To try to ground the conversation a bit, we‚Äôve had a go at
outlining some concrete proposals for how it could work.</p>
<p>However, before we jump in, we should review how the DMA has come to pass.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-driven-the-dma">What‚Äôs driven the DMA?</h3>
<p>Today‚Äôs gatekeepers all began with a great product, which got more and more
popular until it grew to such a size that one of the biggest reasons to use
the service is not necessarily the product any more, but the benefits of
being able to talk to a large network of users. This rapidly becomes
anti-competitive, however: the user becomes locked into the network and can‚Äôt
switch even if they want to.  Even when people have a <strong>really</strong> good reason
to move provider (e.g. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/06/whatsapp_privacy_policy_demand/">WhatsApp‚Äôs terms of use changing</a> to
share user data with Facebook, <a href="https://blog.elcomsoft.com/2021/01/apple-scraps-end-to-end-encryption-of-icloud-backups/">Apple doing a 180 on end-to-end encrypting iCloud backups</a>,
or <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/telegram-encryption-end-to-end-features">Telegram not actually being end-to-end encrypted</a>),
in practice <a href="https://medium.com/@carlagriggio/the-great-messaging-app-migration-that-didnt-really-happen-56af637bc5d8">hardly anything changes</a> -
because the users are socially obligated to keep using the service in order
to talk to the rest of the users on it.</p>
<p>As a result, it‚Äôs literally harmful to the users. Even if a new service
launches with a shiny new feature, there is enormous inertia that must be
overcome for users to switch, thanks to the pull of their existing network -
and even if they do, they‚Äôll just end up with their conversations haphazardly
fragmented over multiple apps. This isn‚Äôt accepted for email; it isn‚Äôt
accepted for the phone network; it isn‚Äôt accepted on the Internet itself -
and it shouldn‚Äôt be accepted for messaging apps either.</p>
<p>Similarly: the closed networks of today‚Äôs gatekeepers put a completely
arbitrary limit on how users can extend and enrich their own conversations.
On email, if you want to use a fancy new client like Superhuman - you can. If
you want to hook up a digital assistant or translation service to help you
wrangle your email - you can.  If you want to hook up your emails to a CRM to
help you run your business - you can.  But with today‚Äôs gatekeepers, you have
literally no control: you‚Äôre completely at the mercy of the service
provider - and for something like WhatsApp or iMessage the options are
limited at best.</p>
<p>Finally - all the users‚Äô conversation metadata for that service (who talks to
who, and when) ends up centralised in the gatekeepers‚Äô databases, which then
become an incredibly valuable and sensitive treasure trove, at risk of abuse.
And if the service provider identifies users by phone number, the user is
forced to disclose their phone number (a deeply sensitive personal
identifier) to participate, whether they want to or not.  Meanwhile the user
is massively incentivised not to move away: effectively they are held hostage
by the pull of the service‚Äôs network of users.</p>
<p>So, the DMA exists as a strategy to improve the situation for users and
service providers alike by building a healthier dynamic ecosystem for
communication apps; encouraging products to win by producing the best quality
product rather than the biggest network. To quote C√©dric O (Secretary of
State for the Digital Sector of France), the strategy of the legislation came
from Washington advice to address the anticompetitive behaviour of the
gatekeepers ‚Äúnot by breaking them up‚Ä¶ but by breaking them open.‚Äù  By
requiring the gatekeepers to open their APIs, the door has at last been
opened to give users the option to pick whatever service they prefer to use,
to choose who they trust with their data and control their conversations as
they wish - without losing the ability to talk to their wider audience.</p>
<p>However, something as groundbreaking as this is never going to be completely
straightforward.  Of course while some basic use cases (i.e. non-E2EE chat)
are easy to implement, they initially may not have a UX as smooth as a closed
network which has ingested all your address book; and other use cases(eg E2EE
support) may require some compromises at first.  It‚Äôs up to the industry to
figure out how to make the most of that challenge, and how to do it in a way
which minimises the impact on privacy - especially for end-to-end encrypted
services.</p>
<h3 id="what-problems-need-to-be-solved">What problems need to be solved?</h3>
<p>We‚Äôve <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/25/interoperability-without-sacrificing-privacy-matrix-and-the-dma">already written about this</a>
from a Matrix perspective, but to recap - the main challenge is the trade-off
between interoperability and privacy for gatekeepers who provide end-to-end
encryption, which at a rough estimate means: WhatsApp, iMessage, secret chats
in Facebook Messenger, and Google Messages.  The problem is that even with
open APIs which correctly expose the end-to-end encrypted semantics (as DMA
requires), the point where you interoperate with a different system
inevitably means that you‚Äôll have to re-encrypt the messages for that system,
unless they speak precisely the same protocol - and by definition you end up
trusting the different system to keep the messages safe.  Therefore this
increases the attack surface on the conversations, putting the end-to-end
encryption at risk.</p>
<p>Alex Stamos (ex-CISO at Facebook) said that ‚Äú<a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1507366543360897028">WhatsApp rolling out mandatory
end-to-end encryption was the largest improvement in communications privacy
in human history</a>‚Äù ‚Äì and we agree.
Guaranteed end-to-end encrypted conversations on WhatsApp is amazing, and
should be protected at all costs. If users are talking to other users on
WhatsApp (or any set of users communicating within the same E2EE messenger),
E2EE should and must be maintained - and there is nothing in the DMA which says otherwise.</p>
<p>But what if the user consciously wants to prioritise interoperability over
encryption?  What if the user wants to hook their WhatsApp messages into a
CRM, or run them through a machine translation service, or try to start a
migration to an alternative service because they don‚Äôt trust Meta?  Should
privacy really come so spectacularly at the expense of user freedom?</p>
<p>We also have the problem of figuring out how to reference users on other
platforms.  Say that I want to talk to a user with a given phone number, but
they‚Äôre not on my platform - how do I locate them?  What if my platform only
knows about phone numbers, but you‚Äôre trying to talk to a user on a platform
which uses a different format for identifiers?</p>
<p>Finally, we have the problem of mitigating abuse: opening up APIs makes it
easier for bad actors to try to spam or phish or otherwise abuse users within
the gatekeepers. There are going to have to be changes in anti-abuse
services/software, and some signals that the gatekeeper platforms currently
use are going to go away or be less useful, but that doesn't mean the whole
thing is intractable. It will require changes and innovative thinking, but
we‚Äôve been making steady progress (e.g. the work done by <a href="https://element.io/blog/moderation-needs-a-radical-change/">Element‚Äôs trust and
safety team</a>). Meanwhile, the
gatekeepers already have massive anti-abuse systems in place to handle the
billions of users within their walled gardens, and unofficial APIs are
already widespread: adding official APIs does not change the landscape
significantly (assuming interoperability is implemented in such a way that
the existing anti-abuse mechanisms still apply).</p>
<p>In the past, gatekeepers dismissed the effort of interop as not being
worthwhile - after all, the default course of action is to build a walled
garden, and having built one, the temptation is to try to trap as many users
as possible.  It was also not always clear that there were services worth
interoperating with (thanks to the chilling effects of the gatekeepers
themselves, in terms of stifling innovation for communication startups).
Nowadays this situation has fundamentally changed however: there is a vibrant
ecosystem of open communication startups out there, and a huge appetite to
build a vibrant open ecosystem for interoperable communication, but like the
open web itself.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-requirements">What are the requirements?</h3>
<p>Before going further in considering solutions, we need to review the actual
requirements of the DMA.  Our best understanding at this point is that the
DMA will mandate that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gatekeepers will have to provide open and documented APIs to their services, on request, in order to facilitate interoperability (i.e. so that other services can communicate with their users).</li>
<li>These APIs must preserve the same level of end-to-end encryption (if any) to remote users as is available to local users.</li>
<li>This applies to 1:1 messaging and file transfer in the short term, and group messaging, file-transfer, 1:1 VoIP and group VoIP in the longer term.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-what-could-this-actually-look-like">So, what could this actually look like?</h3>
<p>The DMA legislation deliberately doesn‚Äôt focus on implementation, instead
letting the industry figure out how this could actually work in practice.
There are many different possible approaches, and so from our point of view
as Matrix we‚Äôve tried to sketch out some options to make the discussion more
concrete. Please note these are preliminary thoughts, and are far from
perfect - but hopefully useful as a starting point for discussion.</p>
<h4 id="finding-bob">Finding Bob</h4>
<p>Imagine that you have a user Alice on an existing gatekeeper, which we‚Äôll call
AliceChat, who runs an E2EE messaging service which identifies users using
phone numbers.  Say that they want to start a 1-to-1 conversation with Bob,
who doesn‚Äôt use AliceChat, but Alice knows he is a keen user of BobChat.
Today, you‚Äôd have no choice but to send them an SMS and nag them to join
AliceChat (sucks to be them if they don‚Äôt want to use that service, or if
they‚Äôre unable to for whatever reason - e.g. their platform isn‚Äôt supported,
or their government has blocked access, etc), or join BobChat yourself.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-bob-invite.jpg" width="430"/>
<img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-bob-invite-b.png" width="430"/>
</div>
<br/>
<p>However, imagine if instead the gatekeeper app had a user experience where the
app prompted you to talk to the user via a different platform instead.  It‚Äôd
be no different to your operating system prompting you to pick which app to
use to open a given file extension (rather than the OS vendor hardcoding it
to one of their own apps - another win for user rights <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Corp._v._Commission">led by the EU</a>!).</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-bob-invite2.jpg" width="430"/>
</div>
<br/>
<p>Now, the simplest approach in the short term would be for each gatekeeper to
pre-provision a set of options of possible alternative networks.  (The DMA
says that, on request, other service providers can ask to have access to the
gatekeeper‚Äôs APIs for the purposes of interoperability, so the gatekeeper
knows who the alternative networks may be).  ‚ÄúBob is not on AliceChat - do
you want to try to reach him instead on BobChat, CharlieChat, DaveChat
(etc)‚Äù.</p>
<p>Much like users can configure their preferred applications for file extensions
in an operating system today, users would also be able to add their own
preferred service providers - simply specifying their domain name.</p>
<h4 id="connecting-to-bob">Connecting to Bob</h4>
<p>Now, AliceChat itself needs to figure out how to query the remote service
provider to see if Bob actually exists there.  Given the DMA requires that
gatekeepers provide open APIs with the same level of security to remote users
as their local ones using today‚Äôs private APIs - and very deliberately
doesn‚Äôt mandate specific protocols for interoperability - they will need to
locate a bridge which can connect to the other system.</p>
<p>In this thought experiment, the bridge used would be up to the destination
provider.  For instance, bobchat.com could announce that AliceChat users
should connect to it via alicechat-bridge.bobchat.com using the AliceChat
protocol(or matrix-bridge.bobchat.com via Matrix or xmpp-bridge.bobchat.com
via XMPP) by a simple HTTP API or even a .well-known URL.  Users might also
be able to override the bridge used to connect to them (e.g. to point instead
at a client-side bridge), and could sign the advertisement to prove that it
hadn‚Äôt been tampered with.</p>
<p>AliceChat would then connect to the discovered bridge using AliceChat‚Äôs
vendor-specific newly opened API, and would then effectively treat Bob as if
they were a real AliceChat user and client to all intents and purposes.  In
other words, Bob would effectively be a ‚Äúghost user‚Äù on AliceChat, and
subject to all their existing anti-abuse mechanisms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other side of the bridge converts through to whatever the
target system is - be that XMPP, Matrix, a different proprietary API, etc.
For Matrix, it‚Äôd be chatting away to a homeserver via the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/latest/application-service-api/">Application Service
API</a> (using
<a href="https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/end-to-bridge-encryption.html">End-to-Bridge Encryption</a> via
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/travis/msc/otk-dl-appservice/proposals/3202-encrypted-appservices.md">MSC3202</a>).
It‚Äôs also worth noting that the target might not even be a bridge - it could
be a system which already natively speaks AliceChat‚Äôs end-to-end encrypted
API, thus preserving end-to-end encryption without any need to re-encrypt.
It‚Äôs also worth noting that while historically bridges have had a bad
reputation as being a second class (often a second class afterthought),
Matrix has shown that by considering them as a first class citizen and really
focusing on mapping the highest common denominator between services rather
than lowest common denominator, it‚Äôs possible for them to work transparently
in practice.  <a href="https://beeper.com">Beeper</a> is a great example of Matrix
bridging being used for real in the wild (rather amusingly they just
<a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1507827177374445569">shipped emoji reactions for WhatsApp</a> on iOS via their
WhatsApp&lt;-&gt;Matrix bridge before WhatsApp themselves did‚Ä¶)</p>
<p>Architecturally, it could look like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-alice-bob.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Or, more likely (given a dedicated bridge between two proprietary services
would be a bit of a special case, and you‚Äôd have to solve the dilemma of who
hosts the bridge), both services could run a bridge to a common open standard
protocol like Matrix or XMPP instead (thus immediately enabling
interoperability with everyone else connected to that network):</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-alice-bob-bridged.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Please note that while these examples show server-side bridges, in practice it
would be infinitely preferable to use client-side bridges when connecting to
E2EE services - meaning that decrypted message data would only ever be
exposed on the client (which obviously has access to the decrypted data
already).  Client-side bridges are currently complicated by OS limits on
background tasks and push notification semantics (on mobile, at least), but
one could envisage a scenario where you install a little stub AliceChat
client on your phone which auths you with AliceChat and then sits in the
background receiving messages and bridging them through to Matrix or XMPP,
like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-alice-bob-clientside.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Another possible architecture could be for the E2EE gatekeeper to expose their
open APIs on the clients, rather than the server.  DMA allows this, to the
best of our knowledge - and would allow other apps on the device to access
the message data locally (with appropriate authorisation, of course) - effectively
doing a form of realtime
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Data_Liberation_Front">data liberation</a>
from the closed service to an open system, looking something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-alice-bob-clientside-apis.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Finally, it's worth noting that when peer-to-peer decentralised protocols
like <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix/">P2P Matrix</a>
enter production, clientside bridges could bridge directly into a local
communication server running on the handset - thus avoiding metadata being
exposed on Matrix or XMPP servers providing a common language between the
service providers.</p>
<h4 id="locating-users">Locating users</h4>
<p>Now, the above describes the simplest and most naive directory lookup system
imaginable - the problem of deciding which provider to use to connect to each
user is shouldered by the users.  This isn‚Äôt that unreasonable - after all,
users may have strong feelings about what providers to use to talk to a given
user.  Alice might be quite happy to talk to Bob via BobChat, but might be
very deliberately avoiding talking to him on DaveChat, for whatever ominous
reasons.</p>
<p>However, it‚Äôs likely in future we will also see other directory services
appear in order to map phone numbers (or other identities) to providers -
whether these piggyback on top of existing identity providers
(gatekeepers, DNS, telcos, SSO providers, governments) or are decentralised
through some other mechanism.  For instance, Bob could send AliceChat a
blinded proof that he authorises them to automatically route traffic to him
over at BobChat, with BobChat maintaining a matching proof that Bob is who he
claims to be (having gone through BobChat‚Äôs auth process) - and the proofs
could be linked using a temporary key such that Bob doesn‚Äôt even need to
maintain a long-term one. (Thanks to James Monaghan for suggesting this one!)</p>
<p>Another alternative to having the user decide where to find each other could
be to use a decentralised Keybase-style identity system to track verified
mappings of identities (phone numbers, email addresses etc) through to
service providers - perhaps something like <a href="https://idx.xyz/">IDX</a> might fit
the bill?  While this decentralised identity lookups have historically been a
hard problem, there is a <em>lot</em> of promising work happening in this space
currently and the future looks promising.</p>
<h4 id="talking-to-bob">Talking to Bob</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, Alice still needs to talk to Bob. As already discussed, unless
everyone speaks the same end-to-end encrypted protocol (be it Matrix,
WhatsApp or anything else), we inevitably have a trade-off here between
interoperability and privacy if Bob is not on the same system as Alice
(assuming AliceChat is end-to-end encrypted) - and we will need to clearly
warn Alice that the conversation is no longer end-to-end encrypted:</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-warning.jpg" width="430"/>
</div>
<br/>
<p>To be clear: right now, today, if Bob were on AliceChat, he could be
copy-pasting all your messages into (say) Google Translate in a frantic
effort to workaround the fact that his closed E2EE chat platform has no way
to do machine translation.  However, in a DMA world, Bob could legitimately
loop a translation bot into the conversation‚Ä¶ and Alice would be warned that
the conversation was no longer secure (given the data is now being bridged
over to Google).</p>
<p>This is a clear improvement in user experience and transparency.  Likewise, if
I‚Äôm talking to a bridged user today on one of these platforms, I have no way
of telling that they have chosen to prioritise interop over E2EE - which is
frankly terrifying.  If I‚Äôm talking to someone on WhatsApp today I blindly
assume that they are E2EE as they are on the same platform - and if they‚Äôre
using an unofficial app or bridge, I have no way to tell.  Whereas in a DMA
world, you would expect the gatekeeper to transparently expose it.</p>
<p>If anything, this is good news for the gatekeeper in that it consciously
advertises a big selling point for them: that for full E2EE, users need to
talk to other users in the same walled garden (unless of course the platform
speaks the same protocol).  No more need for bus shelter adverts to remind
everywhere that WhatsApp is E2EE - instead they can remind the user every
time they talk to someone outside the walled garden!</p>
<p>Just to spell it out: the DMA does not require or encourage any reduction in
end-to-end encryption for WhatsApp or similar: full end-to-end encryption
will still be there for users in the same platform, including through to
users on custom clients (assuming the gatekeeper doesn‚Äôt flex and turn it off
for other reasons).</p>
<p>Obviously, this flow only considers the simple case of Alice inviting Bob. The
flow is of course symmetrical for Bob inviting Alice; AliceChat will need to
advertise bridges which can be used to connect to its users.  As Bob pops up
from BobChat, the bridge would use AliceChat‚Äôs newly open APIs to provision a
user for him, authing him as per any other user (thus ensuring that AliceChat
doesn‚Äôt need to have trusted BobChat to have authenticated the user).  The
bridge then sends/receives messages on Bob‚Äôs behalf within AliceChat.</p>
<h4 id="group-communication">Group communication</h4>
<p>This is all very well for 1:1 chats - which are the initial scope of the DMA.
However, over the coming years, we expect group chats to also be in scope.
The good news is that the same general architecture works for group chats
too.  We need a better source of identity though: AliceChat can‚Äôt possibly
independently authenticate all the new users which might be joining via group
conversations on other servers (especially if they join indirectly via
another server).  This means adopting one of the decentralised identity
lookup approaches outlined earlier to determine whether Charlie on
CharlieChat is the real Charlie or an imposter.</p>
<p>Another problem which emerges with group chats which span multiple service
providers is that of indirect routing, especially if the links between the
providers use different protocols.  What if AliceChat has a direct bridge to
BobChat (a bit like AIM and ICQ both spoke OSCAR), BobChat and CharlieChat
are connected by Matrix bridges, and AliceChat and CharlieChat are connected
via XMPP bridges?  We need a way for the bridges to decide who forwards
traffic for each network, and who bridges the users for which network.  If
they were all on Matrix or XMPP this would happen automatically, but with
mixed protocols we‚Äôd probably have to extend the lookup protocol to establish
a spanning tree for each conversation to prevent forwarding loops.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a deliberately twisty example to illustrate the above thought experiment:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-alice-bob-charlie.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>There is also a risk of bridge proliferation here - in the worst case, every
service would have to source bridges to directly connect to every other
service who came along, creating a nightmarish n-by-m problem.  But in
practice, we expect direct proprietary-to-proprietary bridges to be rare:
instead, we already have open standard communication protocols like Matrix
and XMPP which provide a common language between bridges - so in practice,
you could just end up in a world where each service has to find a
them-to-Matrix or them-to-XMPP bridge (which could be run by them, or
whatever trusted party they delegate to).</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>A mesh of bridges which connect together the open APIs of proprietary vendors
by converting them into open standards may seem unwieldy at first - but it‚Äôs
precisely the sort of ductwork which links both phone networks and the
Internet together in practice.  As long as the bridging provides for highest
common denominator fidelity at the best impedance ratio, then it‚Äôs
conceptually no different to converting circuit switched phone calls to VoIP,
or wired to wireless Ethernet, or any of the other bridges which we take
entirely for granted in our lives thanks to their transparency.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while this means a bit more user interface in the communication
apps in order to select networks and warn about trustedness, the benefits to
users are enormous as they put the user squarely back in control of their
conversations. And the UX will improve as the tech evolves.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, we should not be scared of interoperability, just because
we‚Äôve grown used to a broken world where nothing can interconnect.  There are
tractable ways to solve it in a way that empowers and informs the user - and
the DMA has now given the industry the opportunity to demonstrate that it can
work.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Yesterday the EU Parliament &amp; Council agreed on the contents of the Digital
Markets Act - new legislation from the EU intended to limit anticompetitive
behaviour from tech ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù, i.e. big tech companies (those with market
share larger than ‚Ç¨75B or with more than ‚Ç¨7.5B a year of revenue).</p>
<p>This is absolutely landmark legislation, where the EU has decided not to break
the gatekeepers up in order to create a more competitive marketplace - but
instead to ‚Äúbreak them open‚Äù.  This is unbelievably good news for the open
Internet, as it is obligating the gatekeepers to provide open APIs for their
communication services.  In other words: no longer will the tech giants be
able to arbitrarily lock their users inside their walled gardens - there will
be a legal requirement for them to expose APIs to other services.</p>
<p>While the formal outcomes of yesterday‚Äôs agreement haven‚Äôt been published yet
(beyond <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220315IPR25504/deal-on-digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-competition-and-more-choice-for-users">this press release</a>),
our understanding is that the DMA will mandate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gatekeepers will have to provide open and documented APIs to their
services, on request, in order to facilitate interoperability (i.e. so
that other services can communicate with their users).</li>
<li>These APIs must preserve the same level of end-to-end encryption (if any)
to remote users as is available to local users.</li>
<li>This applies to 1:1 messaging and file transfer in the short term, and
group messaging, file-transfer, 1:1 VoIP and group VoIP in the longer
term.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the best possible outcome imaginable for the open internet.  Never
again will a big tech company be able to hold their users hostage in a walled
garden, or arbitrarily close down or sabotage their APIs.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-s-the-catch">So, what‚Äôs the catch?</h3>
<p>Since the DMA announcement on Thursday, there‚Äôs been <a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1507145126006587411">quite a lot</a>
of <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecMuffett/status/1507366934412734491">yelling</a> from some very
experienced voices that mandating interoperability via open APIs is going to
irrevocably undermine end-to-end encrypted messengers like WhatsApp.  This
seems to mainly be born out of a concern that the DMA is somehow trying to
subvert end-to-end encryption, despite the fact that the DMA explicitly
mandates that the APIs must expose the same level of security, including
end-to-end encryption, that local users are using. (N.B. Signal doesn‚Äôt
qualify as a gatekeeper, so none of this is relevant to Signal).</p>
<p>So, for WhatsApp, it means that the API would expose both the message-passing
interface as well as the key management APIs required to interoperate with
WhatsApp using your own end-to-end-encrypted WhatsApp client - E2EE would be
preserved.</p>
<p>However, this does mean that if you were to actively interoperate between
providers (e.g. if Matrix turned up and asked WhatsApp, post DMA, to expose
an API we could use to write bridges against), then that bridge would need to
convert between WhatsApp‚Äôs E2EE‚Äôd payloads and Matrix‚Äôs E2EE‚Äôd payloads.
(Even though both WhatsApp and Matrix use the Double Ratchet, the actual
payloads within the encryption are completely different and would need to be
converted).  Therefore such a bridge has to re-encrypt the traffic - which
means that the plaintext is exposed on the bridge, putting it at risk and
breaking the end-to-end encryption guarantee.</p>
<p>There are solutions to this, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We could run the bridge somewhere relatively safe - e.g. the user‚Äôs client.
There‚Äôs a bunch of work going on already in Matrix to run clientside
bridges, so that your laptop or phone effectively maintains a connection
over to iMessage or WhatsApp or whatever as if it were logged in‚Ä¶ but then
relays the messages into Matrix once re-encrypted.  By decentralising the
bridges and spreading them around the internet, you avoid them becoming a
single honeypot that bad actors might look to attack: instead it becomes
more a question of endpoint compromise (which is already a risk today).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gatekeeper could switch to a decentralised end-to-end encrypted protocol
like Matrix to preserve end-to-end encryption throughout.  This is
obviously significant work on the gatekeeper‚Äôs side, but we shouldn‚Äôt rule
it out.  For instance, making the transition for a non-encrypted service is
impressively little work, as <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix#how-do-you-make-an-existing-chat-system-talk-matrix">we proved with Gitter</a>.
(We‚Äôd ideally need to figure out decentralised/federated identity-lookup
first though, to avoid switching from one centralised identity database
to another).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Worst case, we could flag to the user that their conversation is insecure
(the chat equivalent of a scary TLS certificate warning).  Honestly, this
is something communication apps (including Matrix-based ones!) should be
doing anyway: as a user you should be able to tell what 3rd parties
(bots, integrations etc) have been added to a given conversation.  Adding
this sort of semantic actually opens up a much richer set of communication
interactions, by giving the user the flexibility over who to trust with
their data, even if it breaks the platonic ideal of pure E2E encryption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On balance, we think that the benefits of mandating open APIs outweigh the
risks that someone is going to run a vulnerable large-scale bridge and
undermine everyone‚Äôs E2EE.  It‚Äôs better to have the option to be able to get
at your data in the first place than be held hostage in a walled garden.</p>
<h3 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h3>
<p>One other complaint which has come up a bunch is around speed of innovation:
the idea that WhatsApp or similar would be seriously slowed down by having
to (effectively) maintain stable documented federation APIs, and figure out
how to do backwards compatibility for new features.  It‚Äôs true that this will
take a bit more effort (similar to how adding GDPR compliance takes some
effort), but the ends make it more than worth it.  Plus, if the rag-tag
Matrix ecosystem can do it, it doesn‚Äôt seem unreasonable to think that a
$600B company like Meta can figure it out too...</p>
<p>Another consideration is that it might make it too easy to build malicious 3rd
party clients - e.g. building your own &quot;special&quot; version of Signal which
connects to the official service, but deliberately or otherwise has security
flaws.  The fact is that we're already in this position though: there are
illicit alternative clients flying around all over the place, and the onus is
on the app stores to protect their users from installing malware.  This isn't
reason to throw the baby of interoperability out with the bathwater of
bootleg clients.</p>
<p>The final complaint is about moderation and abuse: while open APIs are good
news for consumer choice, they can also be used by spammers, phishers and
other miscreants to cause problems for the users within the gatekeeper.  Much
like a mediaeval citadel; opening up your walled garden means that both good
and bad people can turn up.  And much like real life, this is a solvable problem,
even if it‚Äôs unfortunate: the benefits of free trade massively outweigh the
downsides of having to police strangers more effectively.  Frankly,
moderation and anti-abuse approaches on the Internet today are infamously
broken, with centralised moderation by gatekeepers producing increasingly
erratic results.  By opening the walled gardens, we are forcing a much-needed
opportunity to review how to empower users and admins to filter unwanted
content on their own terms.  There‚Äôs a recent write-up of the proposed
approach for Matrix at
<a href="https://element.io/blog/moderation-needs-a-radical-change/">https://element.io/blog/moderation-needs-a-radical-change/</a>,
which outlines one strategy - but there are many others.  Honestly, having to improve
moderation tooling is a worthwhile price to pay for the benefits of open
APIs.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. Hopefully you‚Äôll agree that the benefits here outweigh
the risks: without open APIs we wouldn't even have the <em>option</em> to talk about
interoperability.  We should be celebrating a new dawn for open access,
rather than fearing that the sky is falling and this is nefarious attempt to
undermine end-to-end encryption.</p>

<p>Hey everyone! This week we've released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.0">Synapse 1.55</a>, which includes a bunch of new features, performance improvements and bugfix. If you're using Mjolnir to moderate your rooms, and/or <code>synctl</code> to manage your homeserver, this release also introduces a few changes you definitely want to be aware of, head over to the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/22/synapse-1-55-released">announcement</a> on the matrix.org blog for more!</p>
<p>Yesterday, we noticed a compatibility issue with a newly released version of <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/">Jinja</a>, which is the tool we use in Synapse to render e-mail and web templates. We've quickly put out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.2">Synapse 1.55.2</a> to address this - so if you were unable to start Synapse because of it just update and you should be fine üôÇ
Note that this doesn't apply to deployments of Synapse using the <code>matrixdotorg/synapse</code> Docker image or Debian packages from <code>packages.matrix.org</code> since they are already using a compatible version of Jinja.</p>
<p>Apart from that, work continues towards integrating <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> with Synapse, which should prevent this kind of issues from happening in the future, and on improving room join times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We've just released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.7.0">Dendrite 0.7.0</a>, which has quite a lengthy list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The roomserver input API will now queue all events into NATS, which provides better crash resilience</li>
<li>The roomserver input API now configures per-room consumers, which should use less memory</li>
<li>Canonical aliases can now be added and removed</li>
<li>MSC2946 Spaces Summary now works correctly, both locally and over federation</li>

<li><code>/_dendrite/monitor/health</code>, which will return 200 if healthy and 503 if degraded for some reason</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>X-Matrix</code> federation authorisation header now includes a <code>destination</code> field, as per MSC3383</li>
<li>The <code>/sync</code> endpoint now uses less memory by only ranging state for rooms that the user has participated in</li>
<li>The <code>/messages</code> endpoint now accepts stream positions in both the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> parameters</li>
<li>Dendrite will now log a warning at startup if the file descriptor limit is set too low</li>
<li>The federation client will now attempt to use HTTP/2 if available</li>
<li>The federation client will now attempt to resume TLS sessions if possible, to reduce handshake overheads</li>
<li>The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.7.4</li>
<li>NATS streams that don't match the desired configuration will now be recreated automatically</li>
<li>When performing a graceful shutdown, Dendrite will now wait for NATS Server to shutdown completely, which should avoid some corruption of data on-disk</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool has seen a number of improvements, will now ask for passwords automatically</li>
<li>The <code>/sync</code> endpoint will no longer lose state events when truncating the timeline for history visibility</li>
<li>The <code>/context</code> endpoint now works correctly with <code>lazy_load_members</code></li>

<li>Some bugs around appservice username validation have been fixed</li>
<li>Roomserver output messages are no longer unnecessarily inflated by state events, which should reduce the number of NATS message size errors</li>
<li>Stream IDs for device list updates are now always 64-bit, which should fix some problems when running Dendrite on a 32-bit system</li>
<li>Purging room state in the sync API has been fixed after a faulty database query was corrected</li>
<li>The federation client will now release host records for remote destinations after 5 minutes instead of holding them in memory forever</li>
<li>Remote media requests will now correctly return an error if the file cannot be found or downloaded</li>
<li>A panic in the media API that could happen when the remote file doesn't exist has been fixed</li>
<li>Various bugs around membership state and invites have been fixed</li>
<li>The memberships table will now be correctly updated when rejecting a federated invite</li>
<li>The client API and appservice API will now access the user database using the user API rather than accessing the database directly</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are some minor changes for Docker users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Docker images are now published to GitHub Container Register as well as Docker Hub ‚Äî they can be found <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/packages?repo_name=dendrite">here</a></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi all üëã.</p>
<p>A little over a year has passed since our last update, but we're not dead! On the contrary, Syphon has seen some significant improvements over the last year both in terms of features and project structure; the project is more alive than ever before, and we're really excited to share some updates!</p>
<p><strong>Core Team</strong></p>
<p>Syphon now has a core team, consisting of @ereio:matrix.org (creator of Syphon), @ed:geraghty.london, @dnisbetjones:mozilla.org, and @0x1a8510f2:0x1a8510f2.space (me)! With some of the workload now being shared, we're hoping Syphon will grow even faster with less time needed to review and merge PRs, triage and fix bugs, evaluate and implement features and answer support requests.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-platform Availability</strong></p>
<p>Syphon has been steadily expanding its list of supported platforms over the past year:</p>
<ul>
<li>@ed:geraghty.london worked hard to bring Syphon to Windows with full feature parity, including (currently unofficial) Windows builds of Syphon.</li>
<li>@btdmaster:asra.gr has created an <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/syphon-bin">AUR package of Syphon</a> for Arch Linux users.</li>
<li>I've been busy creating a <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.syphon.Syphon">flatpak for Syphon</a> which is available on Flathub.</li>
<li>Regular and official ARM64 builds are also planned soon, with the first manual one already released. Once the CI infrastructure is properly set up, these will be included for every release and the flatpak will receive ARM64 support too!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Releases</strong></p>
<p>Between <code>0.1.7</code> (21 Mar 2021) and <code>0.2.12</code> (23 Mar 2022), 21 releases were published. Of course, too much changed to list everything, but here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-account support üéâ</li>
<li>Media messages üéâ</li>
<li>Markdown support üéâ</li>
<li>Message editing üéâ</li>
<li>Key import and export üéâ</li>
<li>App lock with encryption üéâ</li>
<li>HTTP proxy support üéâ</li>
<li>Theme tweaks</li>
<li>3pid auth support</li>
<li>EXIF data removal from sent images</li>
<li>System brightness setting</li>
<li>Various customisation options</li>
<li>(Unencrypted) chat message search</li>
<li>Ability to deactivate an account</li>
<li>Countless new translations</li>
<li>Massive performance improvements</li>
<li>Numerous bug fixes (including encryption and SSO)</li>
<li>Lots of refactoring and cleanup</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these would not have been possible without our awesome contributors.</p>
<p><strong>Translations</strong></p>
<p>We have also received many contributions in the form of translations and Syphon now supports, at least partially, 26 languages. Of these, 6 languages are fully or almost fully translated. To deal with all the incoming translations, there is now also an <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/syphon/syphon/">official Weblate page for Syphon</a>.</p>
<p>All of these translations are submitted by volunteers and we're really grateful for their contributions in making Syphon more accessible to an international audience.</p>
<p><strong>Syphon Space</strong></p>
<p>We also now have an official Syphon space which we use for support, development discussion or just friendly offtopic chat. Come join us if you like at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#syphon-space:matrix.org">#syphon-space:matrix.org</a>!

<h3 id="schildichat-website">SchildiChat (<a href="https://schildi.chat">website</a>)</h3>
<p>SchildiChat is a fork of Element that focuses on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list for both direct messages and groups, which is a more familiar approach to users of other popular instant messengers.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@spiritcroc:spiritcroc.de">SpiritCroc</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SchildiChat-Android now has more styles of message bubbles! So if you prefer the Schildi-bubbles over the Element ones (which you can use too in SchildiChat if you want), you can  now also select between bubbles with or without tail, and select some more round bubbles than what we had previously, which was a highly requested feature!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/TCXQEWpnvMjytkXtIIoHEPGj.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you wonder what makes SchildiChat special except for the different design now that Element has bubbles as well: it's hard to describe in a couple of short sentences, as it's mostly in the details.
So if you are interested in a list of things that we did on Android, I wrote up some aspects <a href="https://github.com/SchildiChat/SchildiChat-android/blob/sc/FEATURES.md">here</a>.
Note however that this list is usually not really kept up-to-date, and there might already be some things that are now outdated since I added them.
However, it might give you some general ideas of what SchildiChat has to offer :)</p>

<p>Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello folks, quick update on what major things happened in Fractal-next the last two month. The most exciting addition is definitely the SSO support we merged this week and therefore we could  close a 2 years old issue.</p>
<p>Timeline</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now send files via drag-n-drop and via the file send button to a room. It also includes a nice preview for Images.</li>
<li>The timeline now shows audio messages with a small inline player.</li>
<li>Fractal-next lets you now remove messages you sent</li>
</ul>
<p>Session verification</p>
<ul>
<li>During first login, Fractal checks if the user hasn't started session verification from another client before offering to start a new one</li>
<li>The QrCode scanning is now spec compliant,  and asks for user's confirmation after scanning.</li>
<li>We dropped screenshot support for QrCode scanning, since it makes the UX worse without adding any real benefit. </li>
</ul>
<p>Room details</p>
<ul>
<li>The room details show now the members of the room including the power level</li>
</ul>
<p>Login</p>
<ul>
<li>Fractal-Next now supports SSO üéâÔ∏è</li>
<li>We implemented auto-discovery of the homeserver via .well-known</li>

<p>Sorry that I was a little bit silent in the last weeks. So much stuff to do...</p>
<p>If you haven't heard it yet (because I have not made it that much public yet) there are experimental video calls in FluffyChat now. You need to enable them first under Settings &gt; Chat and then you can try them out. They should be fully compatible with the Element video calls. But be aware that they are very unstable at the moment and may let your app crash.</p>
<h2 id="fluffychat-1-3-1-has-been-released">FluffyChat 1.3.1 has been released</h2>
<p>This release contains a lot of updated translations and bugfixes. I'm very excited about the new keyboard shortcuts from TheOneWithTheBrain. Also in your stories you can now pick the background color and the size of the picture. This is still a little bit experimental but I will share of course update the stories MSC asap.
Thanks to all contributors and translators.</p>

            <p>Hi all, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.0">Synapse
1.55</a> is out! Let's
see the main talking points of this new release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update: After the initial release of Synapse 1.55, the developers of a
third-party tool (Jinja, which is the tool Synapse uses to render email and
web templates) released a new version of their project which proved
incompatible with Synapse. To address this issue, we have released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.2">Synapse
1.55.2</a>.</p>
<p>Deployments of Synapse using the <code>matrixdotorg/synapse</code> Docker image or Debian
packages from <code>packages.matrix.org</code> are not affected as they are already using
a compatible version of the tool.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the work we are doing to integrate
<a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> into Synapse (more on that a bit further
in this post) will, once completed, prevent this kind of issues from
happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="removing-support-for-mjolnir-1-3-1-and-older">Removing support for Mjolnir 1.3.1 and older</h2>
<p>Administrators of large homeservers and communities will already be familiar
with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir">Mjolnir</a>, which is a tool designed
to help them moderate a large number of rooms in an efficient way. It includes a
bot as well as a Synapse module to better interface with the homeserver.</p>
<p>Due to a change in how we manage some of Synapse's internal utilities, this
release of Synapse breaks compatibility with Mjolnir versions 1.3.1 and older.
Homeserver administrators using Mjolnir and upgrading to Synapse 1.55 should
make sure they're running Mjolnir version 1.3.2 or later.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.55/upgrade#compatibility-dropped-for-mjolnir-131-and-earlier">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="moving-synctl">Moving <code>synctl</code></h2>
<p><code>synctl</code> is a tool provided as part of Synapse to run and manage your instance
and its workers (if any).</p>
<p>As part of our work to integrate <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> in Synapse
(which in turn will enable a lot of cool things, such as reproducible builds),
we have recently moved the way we package this tool. As of this release,
homeserver administrators should stop invoking it using its direct path (e.g.
<code>/path/to/synctl start</code>), but should instead call it directly, e.g. <code>synctl start</code>.</p>
<p>This means homeserver administrators using <code>synctl</code> must make sure that the tool
is in their <code>PATH</code>. This is automatically done when installing and upgrading
Synapse using the <code>matrixdotorg/synapse</code> Docker image or Debian packages from
<code>packages.matrix.org</code>. When installing from a wheel, sdist, or PyPI, an
executable is created in your Python installation's <code>bin</code> directory.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.55/upgrade#synctl-script-has-been-moved">upgrade
notes</a>

<p>This release also introduces new module callbacks, allowing homeserver
administrators to more efficiently review which users are able to deactivate
users and shutdown rooms. More information on that in <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.55/modules/third_party_rules_callbacks.html#check_can_shutdown_room">Synapse's
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>We have also started experimenting with using the native Python asyncio event
loop in Synapse which, if successful, would make it easier to use building
blocks from the Python ecosystem when adding new features to Synapse.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.0">full
changelog</a> for a

<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone. It's been a quieter week for the Synapse team---many of us are away this week.</p>
<p>We released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.0rc1">Synapse 1.55.0rc1</a> yesterday, a little later than usual. A full release is still planned for the coming Tuesday (22nd March). Please note that this release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11700">breaks compatibility with Mjolnir 1.3.1 and earlier</a>. Administrators using Mjolnir should ensure it is upgraded before upgrading Synapse to 1.55.0rc1.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the release candidate includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12028">New tools in the module API</a> enabling modules to prevent administrators from deleting rooms and deactivating users. Half-Shot <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12026">explains the movtivation here</a>.</li>
<li>Experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12135">using Twisted's asyncio reactor</a>. If this is feasible, it might allow us to leverage tools and libraries for Python's growing <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html?highlight=asyncio#module-asyncio">asyncio</a> ecosystem.</li>
<li>A performance fix for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12132">logging in on large accounts</a>.</li>
<li>A variety of other bugfixes and internal tweaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please feel free to try it out and let us know how you get on: either in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new/choose">on GitHub</a> if you encounter any unexplained problems. As ever, many thanks to all contributors involved.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes we've been working on a few longer-term projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continued support for threading (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>) and the mechanism which supports it, relations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2674">MSC2674</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11537">Managing Synapse's dependencies</a> using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12028">poetry</a> to formally lock requirements across all our debian and docker releases.</li>
<li>Performance investigations: we're looking at getting better profiling information; and seeing if we can reclaim CPU cycles by cancelling processing when a requester terminates their request early.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully we'll see these plans come to fruition over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week brings some bugfixes to DMs, and general improvements to the way channels are synced on startup.</p>
<p>I've also written some <a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-appservice-kakaotalk/src/branch/master/SETUP.md">setup instructions</a> to assist anyone wanting to try this bridge out for themselves!</p>
<p>As for bugs, I just stumbled upon a big one just now: if a KakaoTalk channel hasn't had activity for a few days, sending a message in its Matrix portal may crash. This happens because of the KakaoTalk API's apparent eagerness in forgetting about inactive channels (IIRC content that's a few weeks old is deleted from their servers, for privacy reasons), and the likely fix is for the bridge to use the right API calls to trigger those channels back into an active state before trying to interact with them.</p>
<p>Once that's fixed, the next thing I'll get out of the way (for the sake of completeness) is the web-based login interface, which all of the other mautrix-python bridges support (and is quite nice for privacy-conscious users that would rather send their KakaoTalk passwords directly to the bridge, instead of through a Matrix homeserver).</p>
<p>After that, I'll work on contact searching &amp; inviting contacts to group chats or DMs.</p>

<p>After our release last week, of course all the bugreports came out of the woodworks. As such we fixed issues with device ids being set incorrectly after SSO, screensharing, overlapping in the reply popup and UIA flows without fallback support like https://github.com/devture/matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth showing up as UIA stages. Key backup is also now enabled by default (if it has the correct signatures and everything), various layouting fixes and more.</p>
<p>We'll probably make a bugfix release in the next few days.</p>

<p>There now exists a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/2242">JS-SDK PR</a> to add the core bits of Sliding Sync (along with E2EE/to-device extensions), and a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/tree/kegan/sliding-sync">React-SDK branch</a> which adds the Labs flag, <code>config.json</code> section for the proxy URL, and sets up room subscriptions when you select a room.

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Keeping in step with our quarterly spec releases, the release of Matrix v1.3 is expected to land sometime early Q2 2022. This release will include Threads (as defined by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>), as well as a number of other MSCs which land in the meantime.</p>
<p>Speaking of other MSCs, client developers should be aware of upcoming work to support live and static location sharing in the ecosystem. A <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!XXSJTvRPInupfUgQVb:matrix.org/$SM5oKCPu1OYu1uVhn73YMUcJ4kBaQZEp_Z9Xx4EZUgQ?via=pixie.town&amp;via=matrix.org&amp;via=element.io">notice</a> on the subject has been posted today in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-client-developers:matrix.org">Matrix Client Developers room</a>.</p>
<p>A reminder that the matrix-doc GitHub repository has been split into two new repositories: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec">matrix-spec</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals">matrix-spec-proposals</a>. Read more about this in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix#msc-status">the last edition of TWIM</a>.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2398">MSC2398: proposal to allow mxc:// in the &quot;a&quot; tag within messages</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC makes the case for allowing linking to MXC content by using of an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag in the HTML-formatted <code>formatted_body</code> field of a <code>m.room.message</code>. As MXC urls could contain HTML files, it could be rather useful to link directly to them, as you would any other webpage. Your client would then translate this to an http/s URL which can be used to view/navigate to the file.</p>

<p>We've released Synapse 1.54! It includes quite a lot of nice improvements, including around URL previewing, and new callbacks for third-party modules. Check out the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/08/synapse-1-54-released">release announcement</a> for more info on all this goodness.</p>
<p>We've also landed more of the ground work to improve the time it takes for new servers to join big rooms, which Rich was talking about last week. Aside from this, we're continuing the effort towards switching Synapse to use <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>, which will enable reproducible builds for Synapse. These are some very exciting projects which will be maturing in the coming weeks, so watch this space!</p>

<p>The basics of the bridge are now ready! Backfilling, message sending, and message receiving are now implemented...albeit quite buggy and untested.</p>
<p>For anyone curious to try it out, installation follows the same general steps as <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/setup/index.html">tulir's Python-based mautrix bridges</a>, plus a backend Node module that must be launched before the Python component of the bridge. I'll write a README with proper setup instructions soon!</p>
<p>Just note that for the time being, <em>updates to the bridge may invalidate its database!!</em>. I won't guarantee stable DB upgrades until the bridge's early growing pains have settled down.</p>
<p>Reminder that my KakaoTalk ID is <code>fair-mw</code> if anyone wants to help me test things out üôÇ</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Namaste</em>  üôè,</p>
<p>We are happy to announce that Cinny now support <strong>all the features of Spaces</strong> ‚Äî <em>a way to group rooms in Matrix</em>. This means that you can now create new spaces from client, add rooms or subspaces inside them or manage the added rooms.
We have also made our unique feature of <strong>Pinning spaces</strong> to sidebar more easy and organized. With this option all the spaces and subspaces will be visible at one place and you can select the one you want to pin or remove.
One more unique feature we added with update is the <strong>Categorized subspaces</strong>, what this do is make all the subspaces inside a space appear as categories. This is helpful when there are deep nested spaces inside a space and breadcrumb is pain to navigate back and fourth. Keep in mind that this ignore the nesting of subspaces and all of them will appear under mainspace, but nice thing is that you can select which subspace you want to categorized and which not.
Another exciting update related to spaces is the <em>Drag-and-Drop</em>. Earlier there was no option to reorder pinned spaces but now with DnD you can reorder them as you like.</p>
<p>Apart from spaces this update also include option to drag and drop files, ||sending spoiler||, desktop notification and viewing event source. (Thanks to @ginnyTheCat for these amazing additions.)</p>

<p><a href="https://gatho.party/">Gatho.party</a> is a replacement for Facebook Events for small social gatherings. I've used it for a number of parties and received great feedback, and I'm seeing others are starting to use it too üéâ</p>
<p>To receive confirmations of attendance you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the included Matrix bot to automatically sync RSVP emoji reactions in a linked Matrix room (great
for your friends on Matrix or in a bridged Signal chat)</li>
<li>Send a unique one-click RSVP links to you friends without Matrix (eg. Instagram DMs, SMS)</li>
<li>And as of this week, guests can &quot;self serve&quot; and add their own RSVP via the unique event link, so you can just drop the event link in a Facebook Messenger chat or iMessage group
(without email or phone verification at the moment, so hosts will need to moderate if
their guests go rogue and add multiple fake names!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other recent improvements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to delete guests</li>
<li>Improved call to action and copy text for when a guest with a &quot;magic&quot; link is prompted to RSVP</li>
<li>Confetti animations when your guests RSVP via the Gatho website as &quot;Going&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm currently testing an experimental chat embed using Matrix Live so your guests not on Matrix can optionally see your linked Matrix room - I've found some of my friends join Matrix after seeing this so they can join the action!</p>
<p>I'm keen to eventually use Cactus Comments once I figure out a bit of Elm and have more spare time so that non-Matrix guests can post too.</p>
<p>The Gatho website and bot is <a href="https://github.com/gatho-party/gatho-website">open source (AGPL-3.0) on Github</a>, PRs and Github issues are very welcome! It's built using Next.js in Typescript.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear your feedback! Join the Matrix room at https://matrix.to/#/#gatho-events:matrix.gatho.party</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/polyjuice/polyjuice_client_test">Polyjuice Client Test</a> is a tool for testing Matrix clients by creating a predefined environment for each test.  Since the last time it was mentioned in TWIM,</p>
<ul>
<li>more tests have been added: a test for basic end-to-end encryption message sending and receiving, symmetric key backup (MSC3270), and key withheld codes (MSC2399).  More tests (and improvements to existing tests) to come.</li>
<li>the UI has improved a bit.  Sorry, it's still ugly, but slightly less so.  Also, now you can search through the tests.</li>
<li>I am now running a publicly-accessible instance of it at https://test.uhoreg.ca/ so you can test your clients without having to set it up yourself.  This instance is stable-ish, in that it should always be available, but may be restarted randomly, in which case you may need to re-start your tests.</li>

<p>hello! wanted to show a small matrix web client made with unminified js/html/css &amp; web components (wip++)
https://libli.org/
https://gitlab.com/sctlib/libli + https://gitlab.com/sctlib/matrix-room-element
looking forward feedback comments or anything,
cheers &amp; viva la matrix!</p>
<p>for now it only uses default matrix messages, and it is read only, so users have to login/register/CRUD through element (or any other client)
the idea would be to give back users control on their data, allow them to &quot;collect&quot; (individually or as group), any type of content, gathered into matrix room</p>
<p>For now, the client is making HTTP requests to matrix API, to fetch the data of a (public) room, all message &amp; state events.
it also give a &quot;clean URL&quot; <code>libli.org/room:server.tld</code> so users can access their &quot;profile&quot; (chat room) easily (just like a twitter, instagram, medium) page</p>

It also covers the abbreviated forms of <code>m.message</code>: <code>m.text</code> and <code>m.html</code>, which can make it somewhat more confusing to understand.</p>
