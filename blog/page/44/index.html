<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Ben's away today, so this TWIM is brought to you mainly in association with Cadair's TWIMbot!</p>
<h2 id="spec-activity">Spec Activity</h2>
<p>Since <a href="/blog/2018/09/03/matrix-spec-update-august-2018/">last week's sprint to get the new spec releases</a> out, focus on the core team has shifted exclusively to the remaining stuff needed to cut the first stable release for the Server-Server API.  In practice this means fleshing out the MSCs in flight and implementing them - work has progressed on both improving auth rules, switching event IDs to be hashes and others.  Whilst implementing this in Synapse we're also doing a complete audit and overhaul of the current federation code, hence the <a href="/blog/2018/09/06/critical-security-update-synapse-0-33-3-1/">0.33.3.1</a> security release this week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the community, ma1uta reports:</p>
<blockquote><span class="mx_MTextBody mx_EventTile_content"><span class="mx_EventTile_body markdown-body" dir="auto">I am working on the <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon">jeon</a> (java matrix api) to update it to the latest stable release. Also I changed versions of api to form <code>rX.Y.Z-N</code> where <code>rX.Y.Z</code> is a API version and <code>N</code> is a library version within API. So, I have prepared Push API (r0.1.0-1), Identity API (r0.1.0-1) and Appservice API (r0.1.0-1) for the first release and current updating the C2S API to the r0.4.0 version.</span>

<h2 id="xmpp-bridging">XMPP Bridging</h2>
<p>Are you in the market for a Matrix-XMPP bridge? When I say &quot;market&quot;, I mean it because this week we have <em>two </em>announcements for bridging to XMPP! You can choose whether you'd prefer your bridge to be implemented as a puppet, or a bot.</p>
<p>Ma1uta has a new version of <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-jabber-java-bridge">his Matrix-Xmpp bridge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>It is a double-puppet bridge which can connects the Matrix and XMPP ecosystems. Just invite the <code>@_xmpp_master:ru-matrix.org</code> and tell him: <code>@_xmpp_master: connect test@conference.jabber.org</code> to connect current room with the specified conference.<br />You can ask about this bridge in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-jabber-java-bridge:ru-matrix.org">#matrix-jabber-java-bridge:ru-matrix.org</a> room.<br />Currently supports only conferences and only <code>m.text</code> messages. 1:1 conversations and other message types will be later.</blockquote><br />maze appeared this week and announced <a href="https://github.com/djmaze/mxbridge">MxBridge</a>, a new Matrix-XMPP bridge:<br /><blockquote>It works as a bot, so it is non-puppeting. Rooms can be mapped dynamically by the bot administrator(s). There is no support for 1-1 chats (yet). MxBridge is written as a multi-process application in Elixir and it should scale quite well (but don't tie me down on it ;)). <a href="https://github.com/djmaze/mxbridge">https://github.com/djmaze/mxbridge</a></blockquote>
<h2 id="seaglass">Seaglass</h2>
<p>Neil powers onwards with <a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass">Seaglass</a>, with updates this week including:</p>
<ul>

 	<li>Lazy-loading room history on startup to help with performance</li>
 	<li>Scrollback support (both forwards and backwards)</li>
 	<li>Support for Matthew's Account (aka retries on initial sync for those of us with massive initial syncs, and general perf improvements to nicely support &gt;2000 rooms)</li>
 	<li>Better avatar support &amp; cosmetics on macOS Mojave</li>
 	<li>Encryption verification support, device blacklisting and message information</li>
 	<li>Ability to turn encryption on in rooms</li>
 	<li>Responding to encryption being turned on in rooms</li>
 	<li>Paranoid mode for encryption (only send to verified devices)</li>
 	<li>Invitation support (both in UI and /invite)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="matrique">Matrique</h2>
<p>Blackhat announces that <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/matrique">Matrique's</a> new design is almost done, along with GNU/Linux, MacOS and Windows nightly build!</p>
<h2 id=""><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/matrique.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3546" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/matrique.png" alt="" width="960" height="674" /></a></h2>
<h2 id="fractal">Fractal</h2>
<p>Alexandre Franke says:</p>
<blockquote>Fractal 3.30 got release alongside the rest of GNOME. It includes a bunch of new and updated translations, and redacted messages are now hidden.</blockquote>
Meanwhile, hidden in this screenshot, uhoreg noted that E2E plans are progressing...

<h2 id="riot">Riot</h2>
<p>Bruno has been hacking away on Riot/Web squashing the remaining Lazy Loading Members defects and various related optimisations and fixes. We also released Riot/Web 0.16.3 as a fairly minor point release (which unfortunately has a regression with DM avatars, which is fixed in 0.16.4, for which a first RC was cut a few hours ago and should be released on Monday).  Meanwhile the first cut of Lazy Loading also got implemented on Android as well. Both are hidden behind labs flags, but we're almost at a point where we can turn it on now!  Otherwise, the Riot team has got sucked into working on commercial Matrix stuff, for better or worse (all shall be revealed shortly though!)</p>
<h2 id="construct">Construct</h2>
<p>Jason has been working heavily on Construct, and has new test users.  Construct is able to federate with Synapse and the rest of the Matrix ecosystem.  mujx has created a docker for Construct which streamlines its deployment.</p>
<blockquote>Construct development is still occurring here <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis</a> but we are now significantly closer to pushing the first release to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct">https://github.com/matrix-construct</a>. Also feel free to stop by in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net" rel="nofollow">#test:zemos.net</a> / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#zemos-test:matrix.org" rel="nofollow">#zemos-test:matrix.org</a> as well -- a room hosted by Construct, of course.<br /><br />tulir has now deployed using the standalone install instructions on a very small LXC VM using ZFS. Unfortunately ZFS does not support O_DIRECT (direct disk IO) which is how Construct achieves maximum performance using concurrent reads. This is not a problem though when using an SSD or for personal deployments. I'll be posting more about how Construct hacked RocksDB to use direct IO, which can get the most out of your hardware with multiple requests in-flight (even with an SSD).</blockquote>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Work was split this week into spec/security work, with the critical update for <a href="/blog/2018/09/06/critical-security-update-synapse-0-33-3-1/">0.33.3.1</a> - if you haven't upgraded, please do so immediately.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Hawkowl has been on a mission to finish the Python 3 port, which is now almost merged.  Testers should probably wait until it fully merges to the develop branch and we'll yell about it then, but impatient adrenaline enthusiasts may want to check out the hawkowl/py3-3 branch (although it may explode in your face, mangle your DB and format your cat, and probably misses lots of recent important PRs like the 0.33.3.1 stuff).  However, i've been running a variant on some servers for the last few days without problems - and it seems (placebo effect notwithstanding) incredibly snappy...</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Lazy Loaded Member implementation got sped up by 2-3x, which makes /sync roughly 2-3x faster than it would be without Lazy Loading.  This hasn't merged yet, but was the main final blocker behind Lazy Loading going live!</p>
<h2 id="matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</h2>
<p>Slavi reports:</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> now supports bridging to <a href="https://telegram.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telegram</a> by installing <a class="mx_UserPill" title="@tulir:maunium.net" data-reactroot="">tulir</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mautrix-telegram</a> bridge. This feature is contributed by <a href="https://github.com/izissise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@izissise.</a><br /><br />In addition, Matrix Synapse is now more configurable from the playbook, with support for enabling stats-reporting, event cache size configurability, password peppering.</blockquote>
<h2 id="matrix-python-sdk-needs-a-maintainer">Matrix Python SDK needs a maintainer</h2>
<p>We should say a huge <strong>Thank You</strong> to &amp;Adam for his work leading the Python SDK over the previous months! Unfortunately due to a busy home life (best of luck for the second child!) he has decided to step down as lead maintainer. Anyone interested in this project should head to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk/issues/279">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk/issues/279</a>, and also come and chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-python-sdk:matrix.org">#matrix-python-sdk:matrix.org.</a></p>

<blockquote>A new bot appears! Are you a pedantic academic who likes to correct others' misuse of Latin-derived plurals? This task can now be automated for you by means of <a href="https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/MatrixToyBots">SingularBot</a>! Also for people who just like to have some fun. Free PongBot and SmileBot included.</blockquote>
<h2 id="kitsune-on-hokkaido-island">kitsune on Hokkaido island</h2>
<blockquote>I ended up being on Hokkaido island right when a major earthquake struck it; so no activity on Matrix from me in the nearest couple of days. Also, donations to <a href="https://globalgiving.org/projects/hokkaido-earthquake-response/" rel="nofollow">GlobalGiving for the disaster relief are welcome</a> because people are really struggling here (abusing the communication channel, sorry).</blockquote>

<p>As referenced in yesterday's <a href="/blog/2018/09/05/pre-disclosure-upcoming-critical-security-fix-for-synapse/">pre-disclosure</a>, today we are releasing Synapse 0.33.3.1 as a critical security update.</p>
<p>We have patched two security vulnerabilities we identified whilst working on the upcoming r0 spec release for the Server-Server API (see details below). We do not believe either have been exploited in the wild, but strongly recommend everybody running a federated Synapse upgrades immediately. </p>
<p>As always you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.3.1">here</a> or from any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/</a></p>
<p>Many thanks for your patience and understanding; with fixes like this we are moving ever closer to Synapse reaching a 1.0 Thanks also to the package maintainers who have coordinated with us to ensure distro packages are available for a speedy upgrade!</p>
<p>Note, for anyone running Debian Jessie, we have prepared a 0.33.2.1 deb (as 0.33.3 dropped support for Jessie).</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>During the ongoing work to finalise a stable release of Matrix's Server-Server federation API, we've been doing a full audit of Synapse's implementation and have identified a serious vulnerability which we are going to release a security update to address (Synapse 0.33.3.1) on 
<b>Thursday Sept 6th 2018 at 12:00 UTC</b>.</p>
<p>We are coordinating with package maintainers to ensure that patched versions of packages will be available at that time - meanwhile, if you run your own Synapse, <strong>please be prepared to upgrade as soon as the patched versions are released</strong>.  All previous versions of Synapse are affected, so everyone will want to upgrade.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, patience and understanding while we resolve the issue,</p>

            <h2 id="introducing-client-server-api-0-4-and-the-first-ever-stable-is-as-and-push-apis-spec-releases">Introducing Client Server API 0.4, and the first ever stable IS, AS and Push APIs spec releases!</h2>
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>As many know, we've been on a massive sprint to improve the spec - both fixing omissions where features have been implemented in the reference servers but were never formalised in the spec, and fixing bugs where the spec has thinkos which stop us from being able to ratify it as stable and thus fit for purpose .</p>
<p>In practice, our target has been to cut stable releases of all the primary Matrix APIs by the end of August - effectively declaring Matrix out of beta, at least at the specification level.  For context: historically only one API has ever been released as stable - the Client Server API, which was the result of a similar sprint back in Jan 2016. This means that the Server Server (SS) API, Identity Service (IS) API, Application Service (AS) API and Push Gateway API have never had an official stable release - which has obviously been problematic for those implementing them.</p>
<p>However, as of the end of Friday Aug 31, we're proud to announce the first ever stable releases of the <a href="/docs/spec">IS, AS and Push APIs</a>!</p>
<p><a href="/docs/spec"><img src="/_matrix/media/v1/download/t2l.io/587a1a86905b1e0e8f9342d76e57ffbe" /></a>
To the best of our knowledge, these API specs are now complete and accurately describe all the current behaviour implemented in the reference implementations (sydent, synapse and sygnal) and are fit for purpose. Any deviation from the spec in the reference implementations should probably be considered a bug in the impl. All changes take the form of filling in spec omissions and adding clarifications to the existing behaviour in order to get things to the point that an independent party can implement these APIs without having to refer to anything other than the spec.</p>
<p>This is the result of a lot of work which spans the whole Spec Core Team, but has been particularly driven by TravisR, who has taken the lead on this whole mission to improve the spec.  Huge thanks are due to Travis for his work here, and also massive thanks to everyone who has 
<del>suffered
</del> <del>endured
</del> reviewed his PRs and contributed to the releases.  The spec is looking unrecognisably better for it - and Matrix 1.0 is feeling closer than ever!</p>
<p>Alongside the work on the IS/AS/Push APIs, there has also been a massive attempt to plug all the spec omissions in the Client Server API.  Historically the CS API releases have missed some of the newer APIs (and of course always miss the ones which postdate a given release), but we've released the APIs which /have/ been specified as stable in order to declare them stable.  However, in this release we've tried to go through and fill in as many remaining gaps as possible.</p>
<p>The result is the release of <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html">Client Server API version 0.4</a>. This is a huge update - increasing the size of the CS API by ~40%. The biggest new stuff includes fully formalising support for end-to-end encryption (thanks to Zil0!), versioning for rooms (so we can upgrade rooms to new versions of the protocol), synchronised read markers, user directories, server ACLs, MSISDN 3rd party ids, and .well-known server discovery (not that it's widely used yet), but for the full picture, best bet is to look at <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#changelog">the changelog</a> (now managed by <a href="https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/">towncrier</a>!).  It's probably fair to say that the CS API is growing alarmingly large at this point - Chrome says that it'd be 223 A4 pages if printed. Our solution to this will be to refactor it somehow (and perhaps switch to a more compact representation of the contents).</p>
<p>Some things got deliberately missed from the CS 0.4 release: particularly membership Lazy Loading (because we're still testing it out and haven't released it properly in the wild yet), the various GDPR-specific APIs (because they may evolve a bit as we refine them since the original launch), finalising ID grammars in the overall spec (because this is surprisingly hard and subtle and we don't want to rush it) and finally Communities (aka Groups), as they are still somewhat in flux.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the Server to Server API, there has also been a massive amount of work.  Since the beginning of July it's 
<b>tripled</b> in size as we've filled in the gaps, over the course of &gt;200 commits (&gt;150 of which from Travis).  If you take a look at the <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/unstable.html">current snapshot</a> it's pretty unrecognisable from the historical draft; with the main changes being:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adding the new State Resolution algorithm to address flaws in the original one.  This has been where much of our time has gone - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1441">MSC1442</a> for full details.  Adopting the new algorithm requires rooms to be recreated; we'll write more about this in the near future when we actually roll it out.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adding room versioning so we can upgrade to the new State Resolution algorithm.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Everything is now properly expressed as Swagger (OpenAPI), just like the CS API
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adding all the details for E2E encryption (including dependencies like to-device messaging and device-list synchronisation)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Improvements in specifying how to authorize inbound events over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document federation APIs such as /event_auth and /query_auth and /get_missing_events
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document 3rd party invites over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document the /user/* federation endpoints
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document Server ACLs
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document read receipts over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document presence over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document typing notifications over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document content repository over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Document room directory over federation
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">...and many many other minor bug fixes, omission fixes, and restructuring for coherency - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1464">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1464</a> for an even longer list :)
</li>
</ul>
However, we haven't finished it all: despite our best efforts we're running slightly past the original target of Aug 31.  The current state of play for the r0 release overall (in terms of pending issues) is:
<a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-16.56.18.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3525" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-16.56.18.png" alt="" width="576" height="214" /></a>...and you can see the full breakdown over at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/1">public Github project dashboard</a>.
<p>The main stuff we still have remaining on the Server/Server API at this point is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Better specifying how we validate inbound events. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1646">MSC1646</a> for details &amp; progress.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Switching event IDs to be hashes. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1640">MSC1640</a> for details and progress.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Various other remaining security considerations (e.g. how to handle malicious auth events in the DAG; how to better handle DoS situations).
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Merging in the changes to authoring m.room.power_levels (as per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1304">MSC1304</a>)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Formally specifying the remaining identifiers which lack a formal grammar - <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1598">MSC1597</a> and particularly room aliases (
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1607">MSC1608</a>)
</li>
</ul>
The plan here is to continue speccing and implementing these at top priority (with Travis continuing to work fulltime on spec work), and we'll obviously keep you up-to-date on progress.  Some of the changes here (e.g. event IDs) are quite major and we definitely want to implement them before speccing them, so we're just going to have to keep going as fast as we can. Needless to say we want to cut an r0 of the S2S API alongside the others asap and declare Matrix out of beta (at least at the spec level :)
<p>In terms of visualising progress on this spec mission it's interesting to look at the rate at which we've been closing PRs: this graph shows the total number of PRs which are in state ‘open' or ‘closed' on any given day:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-00.56.38.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3526" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-00.56.38-1024x722.png" alt="" width="1024" height="722" /></a></p>
<p>...which clearly shows the original sprint to get the r0 of the CS API out the door at the end 2015, and then a more leisurely pace until the beginning of July 2018 since which the pace has picked up massively.  Other ways of looking at include the number of open issues...</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3527" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/image-1-1024x691.png" alt="" width="1024" height="691" /></a>
...or indeed the number of commits per week…</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.02.27.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3528" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.02.27-1024x195.png" alt="" width="710" height="135" /></a>
...or the overall Github Project activity for August.  (It's impressive to see Zil0 sneaking in there on second place on the commit count, thanks to all his GSoC work documenting E2E encryption in the spec as part of implementing it in matrix-python-sdk!)</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.03.57.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3529" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-03-at-01.03.57-1024x925.png" alt="" width="744" height="672" /></a>
Anyway, enough numerology.  It's worth noting that all of the dev for r0 has generally followed the proposed <a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">Open Governance Model for Matrix</a>, with the core spec team made up of both historical core team folk (erik, richvdh, dave &amp; matthew), new core team folk (uhoreg &amp; travis) and community folk (kitsune, anoa &amp; mujx) working together to review and approve the changes - and we've been doing MSCs (albeit with an accelerated pace) for anything which we feel requires input from the wider community.  Once the Server/Server r0 release is out the door we'll be finalising the open governance model and switching to a slightly more measured (but productive!) model of spec development as outlined there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Matrix 1.0 gets ever closer.  With (almost) all this spec mission done, our plan is to focus more on improving the reference implementations - particularly performance in Synapse, 
UX in matrix-{'{'}react,ios,android{'}'}-sdk as used by Riot (especially for E2E encryption), and then declare a 1.0 and get back to implementing new features (particularly Editable Messages and Reactions) at last.</p>
<p>We'd like to thank everyone for your patience whilst we've been playing catch up on the spec, and hope you agree it's been worth the effort :)</p>
<p>Matthew &amp; the core spec team.</p>

<p>As many know, we've been aiming for the end of August to cut the first ever stable releases of the remaining APIs in the spec which have up to now been marked unstable - i.e. providing a snapshot of the spec which correctly matches the reference implementations (other than implementation bugs) and which can be used in isolation to develop production grade implementations of clients, servers, etc without need to reference any other implementations. There's been a massive sprint to pull this together, and as of the time of writing there are still <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr">PRs and commits</a> landing every few minutes.  We'll post a full update on our progress on Monday; meanwhile you can see a sneak peek over at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/1">August 2018 r0</a> project board.</p>

It's a project to separate out the IRC connections from the appservice so the two can be run independently, so that restarting the appservice doesn't affect the IRC connections. It's hopefully going to allow bridge stuff to run faster when it's done.</blockquote>
This project is still really early stage. You can take a look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NZRdUYHWltq9rh-nFZeSp3FYwtQQh5vBxa6Lw8YNtCo/">Proposal document here</a>.

            <p>Thank you to Half-Shot for all your work on Bridges over the last months and beyond. Today is your last day, but I'm sure we'll see you again before long. Text below is from Half-Shot.</p>
<hr />
<p>Today marks my last day of my 3 month internship at New Vector (the startup which hires many of the core Matrix team). For those of you who haven't been reading Ben's fabulous blog posts, I've been working exclusively on bridges; in particular the IRC bridge.</p>
<p>Tasked with the goal of making it crash less and run faster, I hope that the evidence is visible and people are generally having a better experience on it!</p>
<p>Some stats pulled from the matrix-appservice-irc repo:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>39 PRs closed (4 remain open)</li>
 	<li>27 issues closed, 27 issues opened.</li>
 	<li>334 commits, averaging 7.6 commits a PR.</li>
</ul>
Commits this year:
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3506" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/commits_year.png" alt="Commits this year" width="751" height="179" />
<hr />
<p>But aside from showing off some stats, I wanted to mention all the new features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Replies on Matrix translate well to IRC, or as well as IRC allows.</li>
 	<li>People mentioning your IRC nick now ping your matrix user, finally!</li>
 	<li>So. Many. Metrics. Everything you wanted to know about the internals of the bridge, but were too afraid to <code>--inspect</code>.</li>
 	<li>Not spamming homeservers with join requests on startup (it makes for a happy ops team).</li>
 	<li>No longer are IRC users shackled to a "(IRC)" extension on their displayname, you can be who you want
with group flairs!</li>
 	<li>Support for node 4 has been dropped, and support for 6,8 and 10 has been assured.</li>
</ul>
On the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> side, I optimised some calls to cache locally and avoid hitting the homeserver too often, and disabling presence for homeservers that don't support it.
<p>There are future plans to make bridging more visible to Matrix Clients as a first class citizen. Ideas like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1410">speccing a state event (MSC1410)</a> so that bridges can interact with each other properly and clients can create full bridge management views which are still decentralised from an integration manager.</p>
<p>I'd like to give a shoutout to Travis who has reviewed nearly all my changes that have made their way into the bridge, on top of all the other tasks he has on his plate. And of course a thank you to all of the Matrix team who have been very supportive during my time here.</p>

<h2 id="shared-secret-auth-and-matrix-corporal">Shared Secret Auth and Matrix Corporal</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> has been working on several operations tools for Synapse. Firstly <strong><a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth">Shared Secret Auth</a></strong> password provider module for Matrix Synapse.</p>
<blockquote>It allows external systems (which know the shared secret) to easily obtain access tokens for any user hosted on the homeserver. This is incredibly useful for all sorts of automation (no more pre-generated access tokens or plain-text passwords).</blockquote>
With this tool, you can pass a mxid, and get back an access_token for that user. With this, you can do whatever actions would normally be done with a token. For example, you for a new starter at a company, you could join a set of rooms known to be needed by new starters.
<p>Support room for Shared Secret Auth: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth:devture.com">#matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth:devture.com</a></p>
<p>Next, he has released <a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal">Matrix Corporal</a>, reconciliator and gateway for a managed Matrix server:</p>
<blockquote>It's a way to take control of Matrix (Synapse) in a corporate (or other such) environment.<br />Based on a configuration policy (generated by an external system, like your intranet), it can auto-create and auto-disable users, keep their profile and authentication details to date, auto-join/leave users to communities and rooms, etc.<br />It's also meant to sit in front of the Matrix Synapse Client API, inspecting and allowing/denying requests, in accordance with the configuration policy (preventing people from leaving certain rooms/communities, preventing them from messing around with their profile details, etc.)</blockquote>

<p>I was extremely young when I first read and understood Larry Wall's explanation about the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris">virtue of laziness</a>, but I did not expect it to lead here. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> has created (I think inspired by an idea from <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>), a &quot;<a href="https://github.com/Cadair/skill-twim">twimbot</a>&quot;. This bot works in conjunction with <a href="https://opsdroid.github.io/">opsdroid</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/connector-matrix">opsdroid connector-matrix</a> - it works by storing selected messages from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> in room state. In this way, it either assists the author by making it easier to produce the blog post you're reading, or it coldly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45240758">replaces the author</a>, leading to his sacking and penury. To view updates currently held by the bot, join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim_updates:cadair.com">#twim_updates:cadair.com</a>.</p>

<p>When he's not working away on the Matrix Spec, <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> continues to work on less [essential|sane] Matrix projects. This week we have <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hashtag:t2bot.io">@hashtag:t2bot.io</a>, a bot that converts #hashtags to Matrix groups.</p>

First <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">matrix-appservice-irc</a>:<br /><blockquote>Just pushed out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/blob/release-v0.11.0/CHANGELOG.md">matrix-appservice-irc 0.11.0-rc3</a> which contains a lot of nice things. The full changelog is there, hoping to get some of this tested and running on the matrix.org servers soon, but initial testing looks good :)</blockquote><br />Having worked so much on IRC bridging the last few months, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has this week managed to make improvements to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>:<br /><blockquote>Released matrix-appservice-bridge 1.6.0 which contains mostly things I was writing for the irc bridge and factored out instead. There's a couple of goodies like automatic caching of profiles/events, and getEvent as a way to fetch events from the homeserver without fiddling with context.</blockquote>
Full changelog: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/1.6.0/CHANGES.md">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/1.6.0/CHANGES.md</a></p>
<blockquote>Some <code>Intent</code> operations now cache requests that would otherwise fall through
to the homeserver which can be expensive. This is configurable for <code>Intent</code>s
via the <code>opts.caching.ttl</code> and <code>size</code> options.
AgeCounters now allow you to set your own time period buckets.
Added a new function <code>Intent.getEvent</code> which will fetch events
from the homeserver without any context information, which should
be quick.
<code>MembershipCache</code> is now exposed to let folks read and write to the cache
while also letting the bridge access it.
<p><code>a</code> release: Fix issue where <code>roomState</code> would fail.
<code>b</code> release: Fix issue where we were calling this.intent <em>inside</em> intent like fools!
<code>c</code> release: Fix issue where some stole js-sdk code was not checked thoroughly.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>It uses the <a href="https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp">go-whatsapp</a> library to talk with the WhatsApp Web API. Using the web API means that you'll still need WhatsApp on your phone connected to the internet, but it also means you won't get banned for using the bridge.<br />The bridge is still very alpha, but basic message bridging and some advanced features already work. There's a <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp/blob/master/ROADMAP.md">features &amp; roadmap</a> document about that.</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-construct-using-asynchronous-disk-io">The Construct using asynchronous disk IO</h2>
<p>Jason writes:</p>
<blockquote>the Construct has advanced to fully asynchronous disk IO in a single-threaded environment.<br />RocksDB is a highly configurable and customizable database with a very large callback surface to support many different environments, which is good to connect it with something like AIO.<br />Normally RocksDB gets its performance from concurrent standard POSIX system calls (blocking IO) with multiple threads. The callback surface and its internals are not specifically suited for deviating from the pthread model. However I hacked RocksDB and tricked it into believing that my userspace contexts, which mimic the <code>std::thread/pthread</code> interface, are threads.<br /><a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/blob/ac3b45604a8e7c6e4a8d3b3d84d62bfbc1070c46/ircd/db.cc#L4336">This is an example of a RocksDB callback to read from a file</a>, it expects this callback to return immediately (i.e as soon as the kernel returns from a blocking read(2).) Except, where I call <code>fs::read()</code> that is actually a stack-suspension which makes a request to linux AIO where the stack resumes after AIO has called back with the data (see: <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/blob/master/ircd/aio.cc">https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/blob/master/ircd/aio.cc</a>)<br />No modifications to the internals of RocksDB were necessary.

            <p>All the threes, Synapse 0.33.3!</p>
<p>This release brings together a lot of bugfixes, and also some preparation for support for Lazy Loading and Room Versioning.</p>
<p>We also have, as a great contribution from <a href="https://github.com/vojeroen">@vojeroen</a>, SNI extension support! With v0.33.3, Synapse now supports sending SNI over federation for vhosted servers, which resolves <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1491">this long-standing request</a>.</p>
<p>As always, you can get the new update from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.3">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.3</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.</p>
