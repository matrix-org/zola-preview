            <p>Synapse 1.46.0 is out now and includes support for Ubuntu 21.10: Impish Indri.</p>
<p>This release includes a fix for a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> that surfaced in Synapse 1.44.</p>
<h2 id="progress-on-threading">Progress on Threading</h2>
<p>While still disabled by default, we're beginning to land code in Synapse to support threaded discussions in Matrix. In particular, the <code>m.thread</code> event relationship defined in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> is now implemented behind a configuration flag.</p>
<p>There are still many open questions here, and MSC3440 has not yet been approved to merge into the Matrix spec, but it's a start. Threading is essential to Matrix's continued growth and adoption, and we're excited to provide server-side support to this effort.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixes-and-refactors">Bug Fixes and Refactors</h2>
<p>This release is mostly comprised of bug fixes and improvements to static typing. Of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>export-data</code> admin command now works and is tested in CI. This command helps server administrators respond to GDPR Subject Access Requests.</li>
<li>A weeks-long effort to refactor how Synapse validates the <code>auth_events</code> field of incoming PDUs has concluded, resolving a few corner cases which could incorrectly allow events into the room state which should instead be rejected.</li>
<li>Further static type hints have been added to Synapse, improving our precise type coverage to 85% of all lines. Currently, 13% of the Python files in <code>synapse/</code> are skipped during mypy runs. We'd like to cut this in half by the end of the year, as well as increasing overall precise coverage in the codebase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sydent-2-5-0">Sydent 2.5.0</h2>
<p>This week also saw the release of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.0">Sydent 2.5.0</a>, the reference implementation of a Matrix Identity Server. In addition to fixing bugs, Sydent 2.5.0 passes <code>mypy --strict</code>, uses Jinja2 for templates, and supports the <code>room_type</code> field from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3288">MSC3288</a> to better differentiate between invitations to rooms and invitations to Spaces.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Admin API to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.46/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#create-or-modify-account">create or modify accounts</a> now accepts a <code>user_type</code> field, allowing for accounts to be set as belonging to bots or support staff.</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.46/modules/password_auth_provider_callbacks.html">Password auth providers</a> can now be implemented using the new pluggable extension module APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.46.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/aaronraimist">aaronraimist</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AndrewFerr">AndrewFerr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Legogris">Legogris</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@denise.a:vector.modular.im">Denise</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: Europe is close to officially regulating big corporations and forcing them to open their silos via the Digital Markets Act. Element joined forces with other companies to make sure that the members of the European Commission about to vote on the regulation knew how important it is.</p>
<p>Matrix was created to break the silos, as an interoperable layer for all communications. We wanted to ensure people had the ability to choose where their data is stored, and had the choice of interface to access them. This was also a good way to enable better competition and innovation in the communication space, forcing the players to compete on value add. But whilst Matrix is already a 39M users open network in itself, it could be even better if the bigger silos decided to open up and participate into it.</p>
<p>In December last year, as part of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Commission proposed to update the competition law for digital markets with rules mandating ‘gatekeeping’ platforms to open up, in order to enable innovation and data sovereignty. </p>
<p>This move is so aligned with Matrix and Element’s mission, that Element joined over twenty other organisations to launch the Coalition for Competitive Digital Markets on Tuesday the 26th. The coalition supports stronger rules for large online platforms in the DMA, calling for amendments to it to make sure that major services offer a public API to interact with their core services and to ban the pre-installation and default setting of core platform apps.</p>
<p>Matrix is a perfect example of how technology can thrive through openness and collaboration. We will bring our experiences of using federated and decentralised technologies to MEPs and Council members, in the hope for a regulatory framework which supports European innovation, competition and interoperability. </p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Matrix 1.1 is just around the corner! The team continues to work hard on getting the infrastructure surrounding the new release process set up, as well as reviewing MSCs, including the ones you can see above!</p>
<p>The current speculative release date is in <strong>about a week or two</strong>. Keep your eyes peeled!</p>
<h2 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h2>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3192">MSC3192: Batch state endpoint</a>!</p>
<p>This is one of those MSCs that will likely be sorely needed at some point in time, but currently hasn't gotten a lot of attention. I can think of all sorts of usecases for this (on top of the many that the MSC puts forwards). Go ahead and give it a read!

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the weekend, one of the servers backing matrix.org suffered a hardware failure, leading to around half an hour of downtime as we failed over to another system. Remediating and monitoring that has been the focus of much of the Synapse team over the past week.</p>
<p>We also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.46.0rc1">shipped a release candidate</a> for Synapse 1.46, due for formal release next week. Notably, we believe this solves a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> which was introduced in Synapse 1.44. If you've been experiencing long hangs or other periods of unresponsiveness, please try upgrading to <code>1.46.0rc1</code> and let us know if it resolves your issues.</p>
<p>The Synapse team has also decided to aim for building a rough prototype of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775: Lazy loading over federation</a> by the end of the year, in hopes that this will pave the way to extremely fast joins of large rooms.</p>
<p>We're also continuing to work on static type checking in our projects: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/448">As of today</a>, Sydent passes <code>mypy --strict</code>! We hope to write about what we've learned in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's an addendum about Sydent. We can see the results of our efforts visually, thanks to mypy's reporting options. Two different metrics show increasing coverage since our typing efforts began in the summer. The grey strip shows the last fortnight's sprint in particular.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca">uhoreg</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the shortfalls facing XMPP users of the Bifröst Matrix bridge is the lack of support for <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html">Message Archive Management (MAM)</a>, which allows XMPP users to retrieve messages sent when they are offline, when they come online next time. Sunday Nkwuda and Olatunji Ajayi, with help from Pirate Praveen, are planning on writing support for MAM in XMPP.js (the XMPP library that Bifrost uses), and then adding MAM support to Bifröst. Since this requires some dedicated full-time effort, they are fundraising to support this project at https://opencollective.com/mam-plugin-for-xmppjs. Many thanks to the XMPP Standards Foundation for serving as fiscal host for the fundraising.</p>

<p>Release v1.4.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>Free form AUTOCMD after joining a channel, per channel</li>
<li>Automatic rejoin on invite or kick (invite enabled by default)</li>
<li>AVATAR network room command to set avatars for IRC users (admin only)</li>
<li>WHOIS room command for PMs, PART for channels</li>
<li>Add ROOM command in network room to run channel room commands safely</li>
<li>Move PLUMBCFG stuff under ROOM command</li>
</ul>
<p>A smaller release this time around which consists mostly of QoL stuff to make things a little easier. <a href="https://idlerpg.lolhosting.net/">IdleRPG</a> users can now rejoice and login to your character automatically with channel AUTOCMD when joining on reconnect as what's more important: running a bridge to engage in deep conversations or sit in a channel doing nothing?</p>
<p>Plumb users need to use the new generic ROOM command in network rooms to configure plumbs now that PLUMBCFG has been removed.</p>

<p>I work on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs">Collabs</a>, a library for making decentralized collaborative apps, and we have some demos that run on Matrix!  E.g., in a widget-capable client like Element, send the message:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>/addwidget https://compoventuals-tests.herokuapp.com/host.html?network=matrix&amp;container=demos/rich-text/dist/rich_text.html
</span></code></pre>
<p>to add a collaborative text editor widget.  (Fair warning: loading and saving is flaky, so don't type anything you can't afford to lose.)</p>
<p>All collaboration happens using messages sent to the Matrix room.  So, you're not dependent on any external service provider, and the document is end-to-end encrypted if your room is.</p>
<p>We have more demos <a href="https://compoventuals-tests.herokuapp.com/">here</a>, with instructions on how to use them in a widget.  You can follow those same instructions to run your own Collabs apps (<a href="https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/blob/master/collabs/docs/getting_started_guide.md">Getting Started Guide</a>), without needing to host any servers yourself!</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Collabs and see an app running on Matrix, check out my Strange Loop talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exr0iY_D-vw&amp;t=3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exr0iY_D-vw&amp;t=3s</a>.  The library is in an alpha state and not yet ready for production use, but we'll be improving it steadily over the next year.

<p>Behold, the <a href="https://houkime.itch.io/federated-triangle-of-doom">Federated Triangle of Doom</a>.
Game creates a chat. Any message with 'boom' posted into there spawns the Red Triangle of malice.

<h3 id="sync-v3">Sync v3</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> shared very exciting news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a brand new <code>/sync</code> mechanism, dubbed sync v3, for the past few months. This is a complete overhaul of how clients live-stream sync data from homeservers, and fixes numerous pain points with <code>/sync</code> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syncs taking minutes to complete.</li>
<li>Syncs sending back vast quantities of data (e.g read receipts for every room you're in).</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, this new API is designed around the idea of having dynamic sliding windows around a sorted room list for a user's account. The room list can be sorted in different ways and <em>only rooms in the window are returned to the client</em>. The room list can also be filtered down based on various criteria (e.g only rooms in these spaces, with events newer than this timestamp, etc) and a subset of current room state can be requested with each returned room.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>
</span><span>         All joined rooms on user&#39;s account
</span><span>Q W E R T Y U I O P L K J H G F D S A Z X C V B N M
</span><span>
</span><span>\                                                 /
</span><span> \                                               /
</span><span>
</span><span>  \      Subset of rooms matched by filters     /
</span><span>   Q W E R T Y U I O P L K J H G F D S A Z X C V
</span><span>
</span><span>                       |
</span><span>   A C D E F G H I J K L O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z     Rooms sorted by_name (or by_recency, etc)
</span><span>
</span><span>   |_______|
</span><span>       |
</span><span>
</span><span>   A C D E F                                         first 5 rooms requested
</span></code></pre>
<p>This list is kept sorted on the server and deltas are communicated to the client as a series of delta operations (e.g INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE). Multiple non-overlapping windows can be requested and the windows can also change their size dynamically.</p>
<p>This work is still currently in the pre-MSC stage as it's a huge undertaking, but an early, runnable, implementation lives at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sync-v3">sync-v3</a> repo. This works by setting up a proxy sync server which will make <code>/sync</code> requests to a target homeserver, and storing the data in a useful form for sync v3 queries. It then exposes the sync v3 API which can then actually show you real data from your account.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span> +---------+                     +--------------+                                 +----------------+
</span><span>
</span><span> | sync v3 | &lt;-- sync v3 API --&gt; |   sync v3    | &lt;--- normal /sync requests ---&gt; | Any Homeserver |
</span><span> | client  |                     | proxy server |                                 |      Impl      |
</span><span>
</span><span> +---------+                     +--------------+                                 +----------------+
</span></code></pre>
<p>The proxy server also hosts a barebones web client which talks sync v3 at http://localhost:8008/client/ - to get started just point the proxy server to any HS and then paste in your access token to the web client. The web client is <strong>just a test jig</strong> so only has a <em>read-only</em> view of your account and lacks any scrollback, only showing live data. IMPORTANT: generate a new access token before using this client. Do NOT use the token from an existing client (e.g Element web) or else you risk being unable to decrypt E2EE messages.</p>
<p>Intrepid people are encouraged to run a server and see how fast sync on their own account could possibly be in the future. Note that the <em>first</em> sync will be slow as it has to fetch all the user's data via v2 <code>/sync</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/20/synapse-1-45-1-released">released Synapse 1.45</a> this week!</p>
<p>This is the first release to support oEmbed autodiscovery, leading to richer link previews for many sites. See the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/20/synapse-1-45-1-released">release announcement</a> for an example.</p>
<p>We also believe that we've <em>finally</em> fixed stuck messages! A <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9424">race condition</a> would occasionally prevent your sent events from syncing back  down to all of your clients. This caused messages to look like they were stuck at the bottom of the room, waiting to finish sending, even though other users would receive and see them normally.</p>
<p>Please shout loudly in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9424">this GitHub issue</a> if you see a stuck message on a server running 1.45 or later. 😉</p>
<p>We've merged a further 9 pull requests to Sydent, making even more modules pass mypy --strict. We're not quite <em>all</em> the way there, but we're close! Most of the &quot;leaf&quot; modules are done, with the bulk of the remaining work to be done is on <code>sydent.http</code>. This is trickier because it's more exposed to the machinery of Twisted, but we'll get there.</p>
<p>We're already much more confident working in Sydent, and hope to apply these lessons to Synapse soon.</p>
<p>(Well, one lesson that won't apply is that type hints are <em>especially</em> valuable in codebases you don't touch as often... but we have no intention of slowing down on Synapse any time soon!)</p>

<p>CertFP authentication support</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>README has been improved</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Big ticket items this time around for privacy concerned users are connectivity improvements when using Tor/VPN with built-in SOCKS proxy support and CertFP authentication. Some WHOIS and CTCP has also been thrown in the mix for good measure!</p>
<p>Lately there has been quite a lot of people who are testing Dendrite or Conduit which has led to recurring support issues around some limitations they currently have with appservices. Heisenbridge now supports using and generating a &quot;compatible&quot; registration file (<code>--generate-compat</code>) for them that shouldn't be needed in the long run. I hope to drop this feature as soon as possible! 🍻</p>
<p>While Heisenbridge somewhat intentionally has very little documentation due to not having a refined UX yet the README has been updated with some frequently asked questions about installing and configuring it to the point you can talk with the appservice bot. A self-contained docker-compose setup has also been added to the repository to help testing it without installing anything on your system.</p>
<p>Go grab your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@carl:kde.org">Carl Schwan</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last Saturday we had an improvised NeoChat mini development sprint in a small hotel room in Berlin in the occasion of the 25th anniversary of KDE. In a good KDE tradition, Carl spent this time on improving NeoChat settings. He ported both the NeoChat general settings and the specific room settings to the new Kirigami.CategorizedSetting component. Tobias fixed a lot of papercuts and now the power level should be fetched correctly, we show the number of joined users instead of joined+invited users in the room information pane, the user search is now case insensitive. Nicolas focused on fixing our Android build by making the spellchecking feature compile on Android.</p>
<p>Aside from the mini-sprint, we also made a few more improvements during the week. Tobias fixed the flicking of the timeline on mobile and Carl made it possible for the user to resize the room information drawer.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thulinma added device management to Nheko. You can now also view your devices, that don't support encryption, delete devices, rename them and see their ip address. Additionally there were a few refactorings and code improvements. Most notably blurhashes should now decode twice as fast. Additionally there were a few small fixes to displaying hidden space rooms (we were checking the wrong power level, so in some cases fewer rooms got shown in a space, if they only had a parent set). That's all, was a busy week with lots of lasers!</p>

<p>a small, weird tool that just works.</p>
<p>Hey, TWIM. Did you ever face a situation where you need to run any command prefixed with <code>time command-name</code> and get a ping in matrix room when it's done? No? Well, doesn't matter, now you can do that with one small command!</p>
<p>That thing called <a href="https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/ttm">time-to-matrix (binary name: ttm)</a> it works like <code>time command-name</code> and sends results to matrix room. Yes, pretty simple. Now you can use it 😀</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Element One is here! We’re giving TWIM a sneak preview of the new Matrix hosting service from Element in advance of the official launch next week. Element One* is a consumer-focused hosting option which gives you an individual Matrix account on our shiny new one.ems.host homeserver (with a matching Element Web at one.element.io). However, in addition to being a fast, snappy Matrix account, it also comes with unlimited personal bridging to Whatsapp, Signal and Telegram thanks to mautrix-whatsapp/signal/telegram!</p>
<p>Hopefully this is good news for those of you who have chats with friends and family on these other platforms, as you can now chat with them in one place from Element without having to mess around having to run your own bridge - and accounts cost just $5 per month.</p>
<p>Right now this is a (relatively) private / limited beta intended for the TWIM and EMS inner circle, and we'll be announcing more generally in the next few days / weeks. So, if you are interested, please check it out and sign up at https://ems.element.io/element-one :)</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.45.1 is out now! Python 3.10 and PostgreSQL 14 are now tested and supported by Synapse. Support for Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6 will be removed by the end of the year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This release may require changes to how media storage providers access your homeserver's configuration. See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.45/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1450">Upgrade Notes</a> for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Synapse 1.45.0 was released yesterday and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10947">changed</a> how Synapse's monthly active user limits were calculated. Today's release of 1.45.1 <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11127">reverts</a> that change, but is otherwise identical to 1.45.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="support-for-oembed-autodiscovery">Support for oEmbed Autodiscovery</h2>
<p>Synapse can now automatically discover rich metadata when generating previews of links to sites which support <a href="https://oembed.com">oEmbed</a>.</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-10-20-synapse-1.44-link-preview.png" alt="synapse-1.44-link-preview" /></p>
<p>After:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-10-20-synapse-1.45-link-preview.png" alt="synapse-1.45-link-preview" /></p>
<p>Note that URL previews are generated server-side, and thus generally disabled in encrypted rooms to avoid leaking information about message content to your homeserver. You may need to adjust the room's settings to see the new oEmbed previews.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-stuck-messages">Fixing Stuck Messages</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9424">fixes a race condition</a> which would occasionally prevent your sent events from syncing back down to all of your clients. This caused messages to look like they were stuck at the bottom of the room, waiting to finish sending, even though other users would receive and see them normally.</p>
<h2 id="improved-privacy-for-per-room-nicknames">Improved Privacy for Per-Room Nicknames</h2>
<p>Matrix allows users to set their display names to be different things in different rooms. For example, you might use an alias in public rooms, but your real name in rooms shared with friends and family.</p>
<p>To make it easy to initiate conversations with people, each homeserver maintains a user directory with the Matrix ID, display name, and avatar of the users it sees. Previously, this directory would be updated with the most recent profile metadata that Synapse had seen for a user, even if it was only changed in a single room.</p>
<p>As of 1.45, Synapse only uses includes the <em>default</em> display name of local users in its user directory, ignoring room-specific nicknames or avatars. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5677">#5677</a>).</p>
<h2 id="internals">Internals</h2>
<p>This release includes numerous fixes and improvements to Synapse's internals.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We've added countless static type annotations to Synapse (and related projects like Sydent), giving us greater confidence in its correctness and reducing maintenance costs. Several modules newly have <em>all</em> of their definitions typed, allowing us to require and enforce complete type coverage for all future edits therein.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This release includes meaningful fixes and improvements to our OpenTracing and logging machinery, helping us better catch and eliminate bugs in Synapse. This work ultimately reduced matrix.org's Sentry event volume by an order of magnitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magic accessor methods have been removed from Synapse's <code>Config</code> class. Previously, Synapse would interpret references like <code>config.send_federation</code> by attempting to guess a reasonable full path, like <code>config.worker.send_federation</code>. As of Synapse 1.45, the full path must be specified directly. This prevents errors where values could be drawn from unexpected or incorrect sections of the server's configuration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>We'd like to extend a special thanks to Fizzadar from <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> for improving Synapse's <code>update_synapse_database</code> script (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10954">#10954</a>) to allow schema changes to occur while Synapse is running. This is a great step toward reducing the downtime associated with upgrades.</p>
<p>These are just the highlights; please see the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.45/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1450">Upgrade Notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.45.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>

<p>The actual spec changes for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2844">MSC2844: Global version number for the whole spec</a> have now been merged [<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3420">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3421">two</a>]. You can take a look at <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/#specification-versions">this section</a> of the unstable spec to now see an explanation of the Matrix spec version numbering scheme.</p>
<p>Additionally, take a look at the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/client-server-api/#rooms-1">Client-Server API</a>, where all current APIs have been bumped from <code>/r0/...</code> to <code>/v3/...</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/old_master/proposals/2844-global-versioning.md#endpoint-versioning">this bit of MSC2844</a> for the rationale behind this change.</p>
<p>The pieces are starting to fall into place for the upcoming Matrix 1.1 spec release!</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1840">MSC1840: Typed rooms</a>!</p>
<p>This is a concept that was used in the Spaces MSCs to allow servers and clients to denote a room as a Space vs. a typical Matrix room (and set up their UI appropriately). Only the type for a Space has been specified so far, but there are many different applications room types could serve; for example profile rooms!</p>
<p>This MSC aims to create a general concept for a typed room, whereas future MSCs would identify those types and their meaning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy Friday! The Synapse team has been sorting out what we hope to accomplish before the end of the year, and it's looking like our main focus will remain research and experimentation towards making large room joins go very fast. We don't yet see an incremental path from where we are now to where we want to end up, so progress will likely come as a few discrete milestones, rather than a gradual acceleration over time.</p>
<p>Aside from room joins, we expect to spend a good bit of time time on bug fixes and preventative maintenance. For example, we hope to get Sydent passing <code>mypy --strict</code> by this time next week. Doing so would have prevented recent production issues, including one which caused phone number verification to silently fail.</p>
<p>Preparations for releasing 1.45.0 continue apace; I'm loking forward to telling you about it next week!</p>

<p>Making steps towards stable E2EE, we have now implemented bootstrapping cross-signing on a new account. This allowed me to finally enable cross-signing on my Nico (nheko.im) account (which I intended to only use with Nheko). Thulinma also added a way to refresh the current device list as well as highlighting your current device in the device list, which should make it easier to recover, if a misscommunitcation with the server lead to an outdated device list. Meanwhile LorenDB has been plugging away on converting more dialogs to Qml and we merged like 3 converted dialogs!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks! This week I took a bit of time out of my day to create a new widget for Matrix. We have the concept of &quot;Spanners&quot; at Matrix where one person wants to take control of a resource, and they will say &quot;I am taking the spanner&quot;. This prevents other people (verbally at least) from trying to use the resource at the same time.</p>
<p>For years we have been getting by with sending messages into Matrix, but no more! For now anyone can use the Spanner widget to set up a similar system in their room.</p>
<p>You can try this out now with <code>/addwidget https://half-shot.uk/spanner?spannerName=YourSpannerName</code> (although no promises about the uptime of half-shot.uk)</p>
<p>The repo can be found https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-spanner-widget.</p>
<p>You will need to ensure that all users who plan to use it must be able to send state events of type <code>uk.half-shot.spanner</code>. Otherwise, it should be ready to go!</p>

<p>Hello TWIM, it's me, not-anoa, again with your weekly spec update. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to figure out how to run the tooling which generates fancy graphs, but it looks like you'll have a more qualified person next week 😇</p>
<p>This week we saw a couple new MSCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a> - Letting guests do more things (which is needed for things like full mesh conference calling)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3429">MSC3429</a> - A room preview API. Turns out this is more or less a duplicate of another MSC, but has a different approach. Be sure to check both out 🙂</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also been making progress on trying to get the spec release out by formally specifying all the new global version numbering and new endpoint versioning (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3420">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3421">this</a>), and have been <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3432">experimenting</a> with how room versions are represented by the spec.</p>
<p>From page 6 of the open MSCs there's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2723">MSC2723</a>. The MSC is relatively small, but solves a fairly important problem with forwarded messages in Matrix: where were they forwarded from? From a glance, it has minor technical feedback and could do with an implementation (psst: client authors, this should be easy and fit well into a North American Long Weekend project 😇).</p>
<p>That's all I have for you today, but if I've missed something: sorry, and you should be in capable hands next week.</p>

<p>This week I have completely rewritten the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone">Pinecone</a> router with the aim of improving code quality and boosting performance. It now uses significantly less resources, making it much easier to simulate larger networks and using less battery power on mobile devices.</p>
<p>While there is still some work to be done to ensure the Pinecone network gracefully handles large-scale mobility events, protocol development is slowly progressing and we will soon be looking at how Matrix federation can be made more efficient by using routing intelligence from the overlay network.</p>
<p>If you have a passion for routing protocols and/or peer-to-peer systems, we're looking to hire engineers to work in the P2P Matrix space — get in touch by <a href="mailto:elementio@jobs.workablemail.com">emailing your resume to us</a>!</p>

<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/05/synapse-1-44-0-released">released Synapse 1.44</a> this week! The release was mainly focused on bug fixes and internal cleanups. In particular, we've made significant strides toward enforcing static type annotations across several more Synapse modules, we continue to remove &quot;magic&quot; code from our configuration handler, and we've landed significant refactors to both the user directory and federated event authentication. These changes pay off significant technical debt, reduce Synapse's maintenance cost, and ease future bug fixes.</p>
<p>But that's not all. This release also includes performance improvements around JSON serialization, new capabilities for extension modules, and better metrics around cache evictions.

<p>Hello one and all! We've got a minor-yet-MAJOR release candidate of the IRC bridge up for grabs. https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.32.0-rc1 is now based upon the 3.X matrix-appservice-bridge library, and so all the innards have been replaced with matrix-bot-sdk.</p>
<p>Please try it out, and the full release should be out next week.</p>

<p>The first maintenance release of Quaternion 0.0.95 is here, plugging more HTML injections (quite limited this time), with tweaks in positioning of the timeline to really return to the message you last read before closing the room, colourful display names in the timeline and not just in the user list, and one particular crash fix for a case when you made a typo in your password but then did it right - only to see Quaternion falling down to pieces. The release notes, together with self-contained binaries, are <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.95.1">in a usual place</a>, the Flathub repo has a new Flatpak too - just go and update!</p>

<p><a href="https://schildi.chat/">SchildiChat</a> is a fork of Element that focuses on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list for both direct messages and groups, which is a more familiar approach to users of other popular instant messengers.</p>
<p>Both the Web/Desktop and the Android variant have received a couple of new features during the last weeks, so it's time again to share some of the highlights with you!</p>
<h4 id="web-desktop">Web/Desktop</h4>
<p>The Web/Desktop variant has received plenty of love for the last few weeks, so best to list some of the bigger changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a setting for the room list style: you can now choose between &quot;roomy&quot; with big avatars and two-line previews, &quot;intermediate&quot; for a smaller avatar and a single line preview, or &quot;compact&quot; to get a tiny avatar and the room preview in the same line of the room name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a setting how to color usernames in the chat: either uniform, based on the MXID, or based on the user's power level (Android has this feature for some time already, too!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a setting to not open automatically the most recent chat when switching spaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved theme settings: you can now choose custom themes independently for both light and dark mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workaround for switching between light and dark mode together with the system on Linux</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>macOS builds are now signed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>... and many more (read the release announcements on <a href="https://github.com/SchildiChat/schildichat-desktop/releases">GitHub</a> or join our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#schildichat-web-announcements:matrix.org">announcement room (#schildichat-web-announcements:matrix.org)</a> to stay informed)</p>

<p>We added support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2654">MSC2654</a> for server-reported unread counts. This means that we can now display the number of unread messages even for muted chats, if your homeserver supports it (synapse does)!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A CLI tool for creating and revoking tokens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hooks for new messages, message edits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hooks for room invites, and leaving rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending messages as text, markdown, and HTML</p>

Those URLs are not quite following the RFC but are accepted widely enough to warrant a fix, and a new release.

Instead of asking you about each part of the standup post individually, it creates threads for each of the parts that you can fill in. Your replies get added to the standup post like before, but it's a bit more interactive of a process. Here's a picture of how it looks (ignore all the display bugs due to Element).</p>

<h4 id="an-unofficial-matrix-server-for-the-newgrounds-community">An (unofficial) Matrix server for the Newgrounds community.</h4>
<p>Since I was pressed for time last week, I didn't go much in depth on how this server works. Here is a brief overview of its components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>https://app.ngmvs.one: A self-hosted Element Web with some theming tweaks, and the easiest way to visit the server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>https://matrix.ngmvs.one: the homeserver itself (Synapse). It has open registration, but only for <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/supporter">Newgrounds Supporters</a> (ie. patrons) via SSO logins with Newgrounds accounts. But Newgrounds doesn't have its own &quot;Log in with Newgrounds&quot; capability, so that leads me to the next component:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs/ng-saml-idp">ng-saml-idp</a>: middleware built on <a href="https://pysaml2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PySAML2</a> for using Newgrounds logins as a SAML2 Identity Provider. The code is tailored for my Synapse installation, but it can easily be tweaked to allow Newgrounds SSO logins to any SAML2-compatible service!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs/wbot">W-Bot</a>: a Matrix appservice/bot built on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python">mautrix-python</a> that serves two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Creates Matrix rooms for Newgrounds movie/game submission pages (ie. maps <code>#portal_view_&lt;ID&gt;:ngmvs.one</code> to <code>https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/&lt;ID&gt;</code>), and adds a widget containing the submission itself to these rooms (but only if it's a movie--widgets for games will only have a link)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restricts membership of any room it moderates to logged-in Newgrounds Supporters. Users without a :ngmvs.one account can authenticate to the bot via the &quot;login&quot; bot command, which lets them log into their Newgrounds account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Point 2 also means that anyone on the Matrix network can make a room that's restricted to Newgrounds Supporters. Just make sure the bot has a high enough power level to kick users!</p>
<p>Public (and federation-accessible) instance is at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@w-bot:ngmvs.one">@w-bot:ngmvs.one</a>.</p>
<p>(PS: The &quot;W&quot; stands for &quot;double&quot;--because of its job of &quot;copying&quot; rooms into Matrix.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/newgrounds-mvsx/">MVSX</a>: a Firefox extension that, when visiting a Newgrounds movie/game submission page, puts a button in the URL bar that sends you to the Matrix room created for that submission by W-Bot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This week's updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>W-Bot now has the <code>inviteme</code> command to invite the issuing user to the invite-only space room for logged-in Newgrounds Supporters. (Users should be invited there automatically, but this command is for people who leave / reject invites to that space &amp; want to re-join it later.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MVSX extension has been updated to allow joining rooms with Matrix clients other than <a href="https://app.ngmvs.one/">app.ngmvs.one</a>. Right-clicking the URL bar icon now shows a drop-down list of alternative clients, and lets you set which one to use by default (on left-clicks of the icon).</p>

<p>Hi everyone! Did you ever feel lost in the Matrix world? The room directory is big, but it's still hard to find something you like. Or are you a room moderator, but there is not much activity in your room because it doesn't have enough users?</p>
<p>This is why I want to share rooms (or spaces) I find interesting.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;I‘m in plenty of retro computing and gaming related Discords and got annoyed that there was no such thing on Matrix. So, I created a Matrix Space for all things retro computing and gaming, hoping there might be enough like-minded people on Matrix to build a community. There should hopefully be rooms for everything now, although a few are still missing room icons - that will come over the next days. Here’s to hoping that the retro computing community can also thrive outside of Discord 😁.&quot;</strong></p>

            <p>Synapse 1.44.0 is out now!</p>
<h2 id="loads-of-bug-fixes">Loads of Bug Fixes</h2>
<p>This release primarily includes fixes for over a dozen long-standing bugs. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages containing null bytes are now properly indexed for search.</li>
<li>The Room Search Admin API now allows searching for rooms with non-ascii titles.</li>
<li>URL preview caches, which are meant to be ephemeral, are no longer mirrored from the local media store into other media providers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="faster-json-responses">Faster JSON Responses</h2>
<p>We now stay within C code while generating large JSON objects for responses, which should be substantially faster than the previous technique, which fell back to Python for encoding.</p>
<h2 id="new-extension-module-apis">New Extension Module APIs</h2>
<p>Spam checker modules can now use a <code>user_may_create_room_with_invites</code> callback to inspect room creation events which include invitations to users via Matrix or other media (email, etc.).</p>
<p>Additionally, the ModuleApi can now inspect IP and User Agent data, as well as checking whether Rooms and MXIDs are local to the current homeserver.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>We've also been busy refactoring. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prometheus stats now distinguish between cache evictions due to entries expiring, and cache evictions due to the cache being full.</li>
<li>The <code>synapse.handlers</code>, <code>synapse.rest</code>, and <code>synapse.storage.databases.state</code> modules are now fully type annotated and checked by mypy, among others.</li>
<li>The user directory search code was cleaned up in preparation for future fixes.</li>
<li>Another half dozen pull requests were merged with an aim toward clarifying federated event authentication code (and associated logging).</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, this release has seen considerable work toward supporting <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms</a>, along with an update to match the current state of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">MSC3231: Token authenticated registration</a>.</p>
<p>These are just the highlights; please see the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.44/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1440">Upgrade Notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.44.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>

<p>This week in Matrix, William tells us about the State Compressor he wrote during his internship to reduce the size of Synapse's database, and so much more. William being a former intern of the backend team, who else than his mentor Brendan could lead the interview?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello! It is not-anoa here with the spec update this week, which unfortunately means no pretty graph of MSCs (sorry). I do however have some curated updates to the spec for you:</p>
<p>This week we saw a couple new MSCs get opened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3417">WIP: MSC3417: Call room room type</a> from SimonBrandner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3414">WIP: MSC3414: Encrypted state events</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Though WIP, both are exciting steps towards much larger goals - looking forward to see how they progress! We also saw FCP finish on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC3231: Token authenticated registration</a>, part of Callum's <a href="https://calcuode.com/matrix-gsoc/">GSOC project</a> this summer - congratulations! <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a> also finished FCP this week, making it a good time for clients to consider that access tokens might expire or appear in a different format in upcoming versions of the spec. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2582">MSC2582: Remove mimetype from EncryptedFile object</a> was also merged to the spec - thanks Sorunome for finding the duplicated field which was duplicated!</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the Spec Core Team (SCT) has been thinking about how we can release the spec as we've been talking about doing so for months. We're declaring a bit of a freeze on new things entering the spec for the time being, but that doesn't stop MSCs from completing FCP or being opened - they just might miss the v1.1 cut (sorry). Most of the work needed to release is deployment stuff rather than Matrix stuff, so the hope is is we can get it all worked out soon.</p>
<p>I don't have the random MSC script on hand, but I do have access to the MSC list and found <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">WIP: MSC3030: Jump to date API endpoint</a>. It's listed as work in progress, but is one of the MSCs I personally look forward to being accepted in time!</p>
<p>That's all for spec this week. I'm not sure about next week, but you might be stuck with me again. Maybe I can find those fancy graph tools in time...</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks, it's been a while since we released changes to the Slack bridge but here we are on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/1.9.0-rc1">our next RC</a>. This one includes a few new things, most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The bridge now automatically invites users to private rooms if there is a message and they are not joined. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/613">#613</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update bridge to matrix-appservice-bridge 3.1.0 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/614">#614</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, a PSA: If you were struggling to bridge your rooms to matrix while using the matrix.org bridge, this should now be fixed. An update made to the Slack APIs silently broke the oauth flow, which has since been fixed. This was a misconfiguration-gone-unnoticed in our Slack app configuration, so self hosters don't need to upgrade. The details are in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/617#issuecomment-932047990</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I am a bit busy at the moment, Nheko is getting a lot of valuable smaller contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Updated the emoji pickers to Unicode 14, so that you can properly troll people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pasting images should now work properly again on Windows and macOS, including pasting SVGs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The help and version command line parameters now work properly, even if an instance of Nheko is already running.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There has also been a lot of progress on the translations! We just cracked 50% translated, but since that includes a lot of languages with only a few percent, this is actually much more than it sounds! We actually have 8 languages with over 90% translations now. If you speak one of the languages at 70% or so, any help translating the remaining bits is very much appreciated. You can easily translate without an account here: https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/#translations If you want to translate without having to rely on the upvote mechanism, feel free to ask for translation permissions directly in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a>. That is also the right room to ask questions about the translation process or translations themselves.</p>
<p>Nheko is also participating at Hacktoberfest this year. Translations done using the webinterface won't get counted for that though, you would need to submit a pull request manually for that. If you always felt like contributing to Nheko would be fun, but you had no reason to, now you can do it to let someone plant a tree for you (or get a T-shirt)!</p>
<p>That's all, I need to get back on my train!</p>

<h3 id="hydrogen">Hydrogen</h3>
<p>A minimal Matrix chat client, focused on performance, offline functionality, and broad browser support. https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hydrogen saw a few bug fixes (<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.14">0.2.14</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.15">0.2.15</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.16">0.2.16</a>) this week again, and also gained the possibility to recover from low-storage scenarios where the browser would clear indexedDB.</p>
<p>One of the bugs fixed might have caused a timeline corruption, so when you get the 0.2.16 update the history cache will be cleared and you'll notice a bit of delay as you do an initial sync again.</p>
<p>Aside from working on Hydrogen as a standalone app, I'm also making it easier to embedded in other projects. More info to come on that!</p>
<p>We've also had a priority planning this week, which spawned an updated backlog. <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/projects/1">Have a look</a> if you're interested what can be expected next (although be aware that the backlog has proven volatile in the past 🙂).</p>

<p>After 4 years, <a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-email-bot">matrix-email-bot</a> finally got an update. Now at v2, the bot has been rewritten using TypeScript and matrix-bot-sdk (farewell, js-sdk from 2017). It still requires manual setup and the behaviour overall should be the same as before, though the amount of testing is somewhat minimal - please complain in #email:t2bot.io if something goes wrong. </p>
<p>The bot also now supports encrypted rooms out of the box, including on the t2bot.io instance. Check out <a href="https://t2bot.io/emailbot/">t2bot.io/emailbot</a> for information on how to get the bot set up in your room.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An (unofficial) Matrix server by and for the <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a> community.</p>
<p>This is a Matrix server with membership restricted to <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/supporter">Newgrounds Supporters</a>. Newgrounds is an independent arts &amp; entertainment site that has been around for over 20 years, and I felt that its spirit of independence is a perfect match with the openness of Matrix!</p>
<p>The most notable feature of the server is <em>comment rooms for Newgrounds submissions</em>. Unlike other content-sharing sites, Newgrounds submissions don't have comment sections, but <em>review</em> sections, which let you post a single comment (and optional rating) for a submission. This encourages reviews to be focused on providing constructive feedback instead of being a place for off-topic discussions. With that said, open comment systems are nice too, so this Matrix server provides it! Simply visit <code>#portal_view_SUBMISSION_ID:ngmvs.one</code> to view!</p>
<p>These comment rooms are world-visible, but (at least for the time being) only Newgrounds Supporters may join these rooms &amp; post comments in them.</p>
<p>To help along with this, I made a Firefox extension to make joining these rooms a breeze: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/newgrounds-mvsx/">NG MVSX</a>. Simply view a Newgrounds submission page, and click on the icon that appears in your URL bar!</p>
<p>Code for all components is open-sourced on <a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs">GitLab</a>.</p>
<p>This is all very new, so things might break! If they do, tell me in <code>#ngmvs-public-discussion:ngmvs.one</code></p>

<h3 id="the-latest-in-appservice-proposals-synthetic-events">The latest in appservice proposals: Synthetic events</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, I've been let loose on more spec things: This time I'm looking at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">synthetic events</a>. The goal with this proposal is to give appservices more visibility over the innards and actions of a homeserver. When a user registers, we want an appservice to know (perhaps to send them a little greeting, or to provision some resources) or perhaps you want to clear up bridge resources when the user deactivates their account.</p>
<p>The hope with this proposal is that it's going to set the foundations for services to be able to hook into and provide richer functionality based upon user actions outside of rooms. It might sound a little dry right now, but eventually I'm hoping this can be extended in lots of ways and potentially do away with per-implementation modules, instead writing services that work with all homeservers.</p>
<p>Please give the proposal some love/feedback :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When asked if that was a specification change he drafted because of limitations faced when trying to implement a bridge, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, so it's something I've been plotting for a while, but internally we wanted the ability to &quot;act&quot; based upon signups to a homeserver i.e. sending a welcome. In the past this has been implemented client-side in Element, but that has obvious caveats.</p>
<p>The traditional response has usually been to write a Synapse module, but I wanted to do something that could be used on other homeserver implementations and also not have to have it co-located with the homeserver, so the natural home for this kind of logic was appservices. </p>
<p>There are other things there too like logouts / deactivations which are good for erasing data on a service too. Generally I'm hoping it can be extended further once it's stable, for other use cases too</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3401">MSC3401</a> (Native Group Voip Signalling) has been receiving positive feedback over the course of the week. The MSC spells out how one would go about implementing native, decentralised group voice and video calls over Matrix without the need for a third-party service. This is the next step forward after the full-mesh group signalling work, as demoed in previous editions of TWIM, lands. Quite exciting stuff!</p>
<p>Otherwise there was another Spec Core Team retro this week. Discussion focused mainly on how to handle event types that not every implementation using Matrix may need (think pinned messages and how that might not be very useful for IoT networks...). Watch this space!</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2666">MSC2666: Get rooms in common with another user</a>!</p>
<p>This is actually already implemented and enabled by default in Synapse, believe it or not. But no clients have support for it yet (there is an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/4897">outstanding matrix-react-sdk PR</a>...).</p>
<p>This is a pretty cool feature in my opinion, any client want to be the first?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/09/21/synapse-1-43-0-released">released Synapse 1.43</a>! This mainly contains internal changes, including those in preparation for Spaces leaving beta, but it's worth calling out that this version of Synapse now uses the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: room version capabilities</a> API to ask clients to prefer <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">room version 9</a> when creating restricted rooms.</p>
<p>Support for room version 9 was introduced in Synapse 1.42, so we'd strongly encourage administrators to upgrade.</p>
<p>Perhaps more notably for Synapse developers, we've spent quite a lot of time over the past few weeks improving the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/">SyTest</a> suite of integration tests. Several of the tests had race conditions which would cause them to occasionally fail when testing a multi-worker deployment of Synapse. These flakey tests have plagued our continuous integration pipelines, and are finally being fixed.</p>
<p>The long term plan is still to transition to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a> (written in Go) and away from SyTest (written in Perl), but we still need to ensure that SyTest is reliable in the meantime.</p>

<p><a href="https://etke.cc/">etke.cc</a> now offers hosting options (and some more stuff)</p>
<p>Hi there,
Didn't post updates about the etke.cc service for a while. If somebody not familiar - we setup and maintain matrix servers (based on awesome <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>)... and setup VPN... and DNS recursive resolver, and... AND!!!! Provide hosting, yes. So, starting today that's available for everyone (we offer it for some time in &quot;well, you know, we don't provide hosting, but if you want it so hard...&quot; way and it works good)</p>
<p>Even with that update (literally the most requested thing, was in every third order we got), provided hosting considered as your own server, the only difference that you don't pay hosting provider directly, but through us. So, you get root access to the server and we treat it as any other customer's infrastructure</p>
<p>Join #announcements:etke.cc room and say hello in #discussion:etke.cc</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What improvements did hifi bring to the formatting you may ask? I asked, and hifi answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the fallbacks are inconsistent and usually are markdown which is a lie 😅
replies and mentions are completely all over the place in the fallback in addition to being markdown 
the unformatted html is now something in between and doesn't do code blocks at all because those ticks are just noise on irc 
it tries to look like more that you pasted long text rather than sending markdown </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's very considerate for IRC user, thanks hifi!</p>

<h2 id="preparing-for-spaces">Preparing for Spaces</h2>
<p>Quite a lot of work has gone into preparing for Spaces to graduate from beta testing. For example, Synapse now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asks clients to prefer <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">room version 9</a> when creating restricted rooms (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10772">#10772</a>), via the API defined in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: room version capabilities</a>.</li>
<li>Allows the Spaces Summary APIs to be handled by worker processes.</li>
<li>Omits rooms with unknown room versions from the Spaces Summary.</li>
<li>Properly handles upgrades of Spaces to different room versions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Includes initial work toward fully supporting oEmbed for embedding URL previews (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10714">#10714</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10759">#10759</a>).</li>
<li>Slightly speeds up room joins over federation (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10754">#10754</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10755">#10755</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10756">#10756</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10780">#10780</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10784">#10784</a>).</li>
<li>Somewhat improves service restart times for large Synapse deployments.</li>
<li>Significantly refactors federation event authentication code for greater clarity (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10744">#10744</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10745">#10745</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10746">#10746</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10771">#10771</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10773">#10773</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10781">#10781</a>).</li>
<li>Adds further static type hints to various modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also spent quite a lot of time on SyTest, our integration test suite. In particular, many of the tests made assumptions about event processing which were not correct when targeting a multi-worker Synapse deployment. These flakey tests have plagued our continuous integration pipelines, and are finally being fixed.</p>
<p>These are just the highlights; please see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.43.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/AndrewFerr">AndrewFerr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BramvdnHeuvel">BramvdnHeuvel</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cuttingedge1109">cuttingedge1109</a>.</p>
