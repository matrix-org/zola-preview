            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>We‚Äôre incredibly excited to officially announce that the national agency for
the digitalisation of the healthcare system in Germany (<a href="http://gematik.de">gematik</a>)
has selected Matrix as the open standard on which to base all its
interoperable instant messaging standard - the TI-Messenger.</p>
<p>gematik has released a <a href="https://fachportal.gematik.de/anwendungen/ti-messenger">concept paper</a>
that explains the initiative in full.</p>
<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>With the TI-Messenger, gematik is creating a nationwide decentralised private
communication network - based on Matrix - to support potentially more than
<strong>150,000</strong> healthcare organisations within Germany‚Äôs national healthcare system.
It will provide end-to-end encrypted VoIP/Video and messaging for the whole
healthcare system, as well as the ability to share healthcare based data,
images and files.</p>
<p>Initially every healthcare provider (HCP) with an HBA (HPC ID card) will be
able to choose their own TI-Messenger provider. The homesever for HCP
accounts will be hosted by the provider‚Äôs datacentre. The homeserver for
institutions can be hosted by TI-Messenger providers, or on-premise.</p>
<p>Each organisation and individual will therefore retain complete ownership and
control of their communication data - while being able to share it securely
within the healthcare system with end-to-end encryption by default. All
servers in the Matrix-based private federation will be hosted within
Germany.</p>
<p>Needless to say, security is key when underpinning the entire nation‚Äôs
healthcare infrastructure and safeguarding sensitive patient data. As such,
the entire implementation will be <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html">accredited by BSI</a>
(Federal Office for Information Security) and <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html">BfDI</a>
(Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information).</p>
<h2 id="the-full-context">The full context...</h2>
<p>Germany‚Äôs digital care modernisation law (‚ÄúDigitale Versorgung und Pflege
Modernisierungs Gesetz‚Äù or DVPMG), which came into force in June 2021, spells
out  the need for an instant messaging solution.</p>
<p>The urgency has increased by a significant rise in the use of instant
messaging and video conferencing within the healthcare system - for instance,
the amount of medical practices using messenger services doubled in 2020
compared to 2018 (much of this using insecure messaging solutions).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gematik.de/">gematik</a>, majority-owned by Germany‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/english-version.html">Federal Ministry of Health</a>,
is responsible for the standardised digital transformation of Germany‚Äôs
healthcare sector. It focuses on improving efficiency and introducing new
ways of working by setting, testing and certifying healthcare technology
including electronic health cards, electronic patient records and
e-prescriptions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gematik.de/anwendungen/ti-messenger/">TI-Messenger</a> is gematik‚Äôs
technical specification for an interoperable secure instant messaging
standard. The healthcare industry will be able to build a wide range of apps
based on TI-Messenger specifications knowing that, being built on Matrix, all
those apps will interoperate.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 organisations - ranging from local doctors to clinics,
hospitals, and insurance companies - can potentially standardise on instant
messaging thanks to gematik‚Äôs TI-Messenger initiative.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-interoperability">The road to interoperability</h2>
<p>By 1 October 2021, TI-Messenger will initially specify how communication
should work in practice between healthcare professionals (HCPs). Physicians
will be able to find and communicate with each other via TI-Messenger
approved apps - specifications include secure authentication mechanisms with
electronic health professional cards (eHBAs), electronic institution cards
(SMC-B) and a central <a href="https://hl7.org/FHIR/">FHIR</a> directory. The first
compliant apps for HCPs are expected to be licensed by Q2 2022.</p>
<p>Eric Grey (product manager for TI-Messenger at gematik), reckons there will
initially be around 10-15 TI-Messenger compliant Matrix-based apps for HCP
communications available from different vendors. </p>
<p>Healthcare professionals will be able to choose a TI-Messenger provider, who
will be hosting their personal accounts and provide the messenger-client. </p>
<p>Healthcare organisations will choose a TI-Messenger provider to build the
dedicated homeserver infrastructure (on prem or in a data center), provide
the client and ongoing support.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-the-matrix-community">What does this mean for the Matrix community?</h2>
<p>Matrix is already integral to huge parts of the public sector; from the French
government‚Äôs Tchap platform, to Bundeswehr‚Äôs use of BwMessenger and adoption
by universities and schools across Europe. </p>
<p>Germany‚Äôs healthcare system standardising on Matrix takes this to entirely the
next level - and we can‚Äôt wait to see the rest of Europe (and the world!)
converge on Matrix for healthcare!</p>
<p>We'll have more info about TI-Messenger on this week's Matrix Live, out on
Friday - stay tuned!</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>Several members of the Spec Core Team reviewed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> (Event relationships) this week in order to help push along the efforts to finally ship aggregations in the spec. Otherwise <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3245">MSC3245</a> (voice messages via extensible events) is moving along with final comment period proposed this week. The implementation in Element Web in reportedly working well, helping to prove the spec in practice. And finally, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3277">MSC3277</a> (scheduled messages) which appeared over the weekend to try and allow for scheduling events to send later in Matrix (and all the fun edge cases that come with it).</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who submitted, read and reviewed MSCs this week. It takes people to move this stuff forward!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, we <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.0">released Dendrite 0.4.0 on Monday</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/12/dendrite-0-4-0-released">wrote a blog post about it</a>! It's taken us a little while to get to this release, but it includes a number of quality-of-life improvements and changes that will significantly reduce the amount of resources needed to run a Dendrite server. The full changelog is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.0">available on GitHub</a> and many juicy details in the aforementioned blog post, but at a high level this release includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All-new state storage, designed to reduce the amount of disk space that the roomserver takes up to store room state by aggressively deduplicating state blocks and snapshots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved appservice support, with a number of bridges now working with Dendrite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared secret registration (using the same API shape as Synapse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimisations in the federation API <code>/send</code> and <code>/get_missing_events</code> endpoints to reduce memory usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved state resolution v2 performance when dealing with power level events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per-room queuing to reduce head-of-line blocking on the roomserver input API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of bug fixes around invites, registration, sync and media, and 5 panics fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the release, we've been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Completing key notary support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing <code>state_default</code> for power levels in gomatrixserverlib</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolving some issues around rejecting invites, particularly when the remote server is not available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the cost of checking if the local server is in a given room</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since our last update, our Sytest compliance numbers have been on the rise again, taking us ever closer to our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 61%, up from 60% last time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 92%, up from 80% last time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appservice APIs: 52%</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The big news of the week is the release of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/13/synapse-1-38-0-released">Synapse 1.38</a>, which converts several integer columns to <code>bigint</code>, allowing Synapse to process more than 2 billion (231) events.

<blockquote>
<p>But that's not the only thing new in Synapse 1.38. We also landed the ability to set an expiry time on cache entries, allowing you to reclaim memory from infrequently accessed caches. Configuring this to &quot;1h&quot; on matrix.org has already yielded a noticeable reduction in overall memory use üìâ:</p>

<p>A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Docker is now supported, via Dockerfiles that actually work now! But for the time being, Docker images must be built manually, as I am yet to deploy a Docker registry for prebuilt images.</p>
<p>Also, sample systemd service unit configuration files are now available, courtesy of @lecris:lecris.me üôÇ</p>
<p>For more info on all of this, see <a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line/src/branch/master/SETUP.md">SETUP.md</a>.</p>
<p>What I'm working on next is a bot command to list all of your LINE contacts &amp; groups (similar to <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a>'s <code>list &lt;contacts|groups&gt;</code>), and the ability to sync a LINE DM by inviting a contact to a Matrix DM. This will allow messaging LINE contacts that the bridge didn't yet create a portal for.</p>
<p>And please, <em>feel free to try out this bridge!</em> It should be serviceable for day-to-day usage now. I still won't be able to host a public instance of it for a while, though (as it is fairly hefty due to having to run Chrome), so you'll have to self-host if you want to try it.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we fixed bugs. Switching room should now be quite a bit faster again and once Qt 6.3 is released with some important bugfixes, scrolling in Nheko should be super smooth. (We can't enable that flag yet, because of 3 bugs in the item pooling code in Qt.)</p>
<p>Other bugfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inline images sometimes wouldn't show, but now inline emotes and images should render once they are loaded! (This took me a year to figure out)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now send edits in encryted rooms again, if they are a reply to an event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No more reply fallback in the room list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At some point timed out verification requests started showing up on startup. That regression is fixed now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix rooms not showing up after login because we were off by one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix some cases where the loading spinner wouldn't stop animating and as such consistently use CPU, when a room is open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cache db transactions to reduce allocations and memory zeroing when loading a room or scrolling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix some edge cases in the blurhash decoding, that could lead to brownish image previews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix accepting an invite not placing you in the joined room.</p>

<p>After a month of hard work, we(I as GSoC student and kitsune  as mentor) have bindings with tests for almost all core classes and also initial version of the demo client, in which you can log in with a password or SSO, the server you enter is resolved automatically and also after successful login data is being synchronized. There is also a possibility to log out. So this part is on the same level as in Quotient.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nik:matrix.teckids.org">Nik</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the first weeks of July, <a href="https://teckids.org">Teckids e.V.</a> held their annual summer camp for kids between 9 and 15 years. This year, after we started introducing Matrix and Element as a chat platform from September 2020 onwards, the camp was heavily relying on the platform for various parts.</p>
<p>Before the camp started, we invited all 90 participants to a chat room to get together, share a bit about what they expect, already did with coding and technical stuff, talk about what food they'd like to have for the barbecue, and stuff like that. Many of them engaged in the discussion, and started exploring Element (before you ask, yes, we hat a lot of snow and party poppers üòõ!). Some got really excited that they could even change or add features to Element, or ask for such changes ‚Äì we had to promise to hold a session where we find out how to add one new animation to Element. Unfortunately, Element is developed on GitHub, so the potential young contributors are locked out by the exclusive Terms of Use there. We are trying to reach out to Element HQ to find a solution.</p>
<p>During the camp, verifying crypto sessions using emojis again made for a good party game to get to know each other (like, find the kid a nickname belongs to on the camp site, start verification, and compare emojis ‚Äì a lot of fun that we, again, did not even have to start, because someone always finds out about it and asks what it is about).</p>
<p>Now that everyone got to know Matrix for chatting, in one of our workshops, the participants discovered that not only people, but also devices can send messages, and react to replies ‚Äì in that workshop, the kids built a chat-ops IoT door beel (for their tent on site, or room at home). They soldered a circuit board to fit an ESP (MicroPython) micro controller on, and coded a small program (using templates with differing complexity levels), defining what the door bell should send when a button is pressed, on what messages to react, and the like. We produced a fun video about the project (German audio, English subtitles): https://eduvid.org/videos/watch/20a50c25-ecb4-48c0-9b13-de2548f290d4?subtitle=en . The (minimal and somewhat buggy) MicroPython client library is published as <a href="https://edugit.org/hacknfun/thema-mechatronik/mytrix">¬µtrix</a>.</p>
<p>Now, sadly, the event is over, and we slowly see (as expected, only a part of the) participants moving over to our long-term project chatrooms; we will start clearing the virtual camp site chatroom during the weekend to make room for a new group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asked about the regularity of these events, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nik:matrix.teckids.org">Nik</a> replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are still experimenting with our new camp formats. As bad as it all is, COVID caused a lot of innovation here because we were forced to leave the known roads we normally travelled, and now we are starting to integrate all that new stuff (like really embracing Matrix) into outdoor and presence events. I think we are on a really good way with it, and surely I will keep posting updates that might be of interest for the greater community.</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.38.0 is out now!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We released Synapse 1.38.1 on Thursday, July 22nd. It <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10456">mitigates</a> a client bug with Synapse 1.38.0's smaller sync responses which prevented new Element Android sessions from successfully participating in encrypted conversations. Server administrators are strongly encouraged to upgrade.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="big-integers">(Big) Integers</h2>
<p>Synapse's database schema used <code>integer</code> columns in a few places where values could potentially overflow a maximum value of 2<sup>31</sup>. One such column is <code>events.stream_ordering</code>, which surpassed 2<sup>31</sup> on matrix.org last week.</p>
<p>To prevent overflows, Synapse 1.38 will automatically convert several <code>integer</code> columns to <code>bigint</code> as a background update. While homeservers will function normally during this task, it could result in increased disk I/O for several hours or days. Note that <strong>homeservers may need several gigabytes of free space</strong> to successfully rebuild associated database indexes and complete the upgrade.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.38/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1380">upgrade notes</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="expiring-caches">Expiring Caches</h2>
<p>Synapse has a new configuration option, <code>caches.expiry_time</code>, which can be set to enable evicting items from caches if they go too long without being accessed. This helps servers reclaim memory used by large yet infrequently used caches.</p>
<h2 id="smaller-sync-responses">Smaller Sync Responses</h2>
<p>The response to <code>/sync</code> now omits optional keys when they would otherwise be empty. This can significantly reduce the size of incremental syncs, as demonstrated in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/6579">#6579</a>. Thanks to deepbluev7 for  initially submitting this in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9919">#9919</a>, which made it into this release via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10214">#10214</a>.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>A few other items worth calling out:</p>
<ul>
<li>This release includes an experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a>, which adds initial support for complementary access / refresh tokens in line with OAuth best practices (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9450">#9450</a>).</li>
<li>Synapse now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10290">ships a script</a> to review recently registered accounts, which can be useful in cleaning up servers in the wake of malicious, automated registrations like we witnessed during last month's <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/30/security-update-synapse-1-37-1-released">spam attack</a>.</li>
<li>We've also fixed a few rough edges (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10263">#10263</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10303">#10303</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10336">#10336</a>) in the spam mitigations from 1.37.1, and would encourage you to update.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.38/admin_api/user_admin_api.html">Admin API for querying user information</a> now includes information about a user's SSO identities in its response.</li>
</ul>

            <p>After quite a significant gap between releases ‚Äî version 0.3.11 was released at the beginning of March ‚Äî we're happy to finally announce the release of Dendrite 0.4.0 today!</p>
<p>The full changelog for the release is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.0">available on GitHub</a>, but we wanted to take the opportunity to talk a little about some of the changes that have gone into this release.</p>
<p>Recently our release cadence for Dendrite has slowed as we have spent more time within the team working on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone">Pinecone</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/lb">Low Bandwidth Matrix</a>. These are major areas of research for us which we hope will unlock a number of new opportunities within the Matrix ecosystem, allowing us to <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/06/introducing-the-pinecone-overlay-network">build on Matrix anywhere</a> and to <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/10/low-bandwidth-matrix-an-implementation-guide">reduce the protocol-level footprint</a>. However, Dendrite has not been forgotten amidst the excitement and we will be spending more time working on Dendrite again in the coming months.</p>
<h3 id="state-storage">State storage</h3>
<p>One of the major features in v0.4.0 is that we've introduced newly-refactored state storage in the roomserver database. The goal here is to make state storage significantly more efficient by ensuring that we deduplicate state  blocks and snapshots wherever we can. By ensuring that all state blocks and snapshots are ordered strictly, and by enforcing uniqueness constraints on the hashes of the blocks/snapshots, we've been able to achieve this.</p>
<p>This was largely spurred on by watching <code>dendrite.matrix.org</code> consuming a rather alarming amount of disk space on a daily basis. In this particular instance, moving to the new state storage resulted in a 15x improvement on disk utilisation for state blocks and a further 2x improvement for state snapshot references immediately after the migration, and the growth rate of the database has slowed substantially since. </p>
<p>Ensuring that we don't waste disk space is one of the most important factors in ensuring that Dendrite operates well at any scale ‚Äî future datacentre deployments supporting many users will find storage overheads decreased and small/embedded single-user deployments (such as P2P, on mobile devices or in the browser) will fit much more effectively onto resource-constrained targets.</p>
<p>After upgrading to v0.4.0, Dendrite will run an automatic migration to update your homeserver to the new state storage format. This might take a while on larger databases so please expect some downtime. </p>
<h3 id="optimisations">Optimisations</h3>
<p>We've continued to squeeze further optimisations into the federation and state resolution code, aiming to reduce the amount of CPU burn and memory utilisation. Some of the feedback that we receive most often from those that have been experimenting with the Dendrite betas is around the sudden spikes in resource usage, especially when joined to large rooms.</p>
<p>The bulk of this resource usage comes either from attempting to reconcile missing events or running state resolution in rooms with lots of members, as potentially large state sets of events need to be brought into memory in order to do so. We've introduced some transaction-level caches for dealing with missing auth/prev events to reduce the memory pressure and we've also tweaked the caching around around <code>/get_missing_events</code> to ensure we don't duplicate any state events in memory.</p>
<p>Resource spikes aren't completely eliminated but this should smooth out CPU and memory utilisation significantly. In the case of <code>dendrite.matrix.org</code>,  which is joined to some 6500 rooms at present, memory utilisation of the Dendrite process typically sits around 1.5GB at present. </p>
<p>State Resolution v2 has also seen further optimisations in the power-level checking, which should reduce CPU usage even more.</p>
<h3 id="bridges">Bridges</h3>
<p>Thanks to Half-Shot's perseverance and contributions, we've merged a couple PRs and worked on some further fixes for getting Application Services working correctly in Dendrite. Whilst not entirely feature-complete and with a number of features still to go, enough support is now present to support basic bridging functionality.</p>
<p>We've done quite a bit of preliminary testing with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">matrix-appservice-irc</a> and have also heard a number of success stories from the community with <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>. Others may work too ‚Äî let us know what you find!</p>
<h3 id="bug-hunting">Bug-hunting</h3>
<p>A number of bugs in various places (including the roomserver, federation API and media API) which could cause Dendrite to crash have also been fixed.  Some of these have been contributed by the community in pull requests, so we extend our thanks to anyone who has submitted a fix to the project.</p>
<p>A special mention also goes to Jakob Varmose Bentzen for reporting a security issue to us around the legacy <code>/v1/register</code> endpoint, where a flaw in the legacy shared secret registration allowed malicious users to create accounts. We've since removed this legacy endpoint and the vulnerability is now fixed. </p>
<h3 id="what-s-next">What's next</h3>
<p>There are still a number of missing user-facing features which we will be working on over the coming months, as well as some architectural issues that we will look to address.</p>
<p>A notable area of work involves attempting to remove the dependency on Kafka for polylith deployments. Kafka is very resource-heavy in operation and somewhat limits us to the types of interactions that we can perform between components. It's also very difficult to manage retention correctly, in the interests of not endlessly consuming disk space here either.</p>
<p>As usual, Dendrite is still considered beta so you may not want to rely on it for production systems, although it should be stable enough to experiment with. If you find any bugs or anything that doesn't look right, please let us know:</p>

<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big(int) news! This week Matrix.org processed its 2^31st event, exceeding the range of a PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-numeric.html">integer column</a> for the first time. This caused a bit of a scramble in the aftermath of last week's spam attack, as we had a few <code>integer</code> columns in our schema which we needed to convert to <code>bigint</code>. Fortunately, we were able to complete the change sufficiently in advance (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8255">#8255</a>), and also took the opportunity to audit other columns and sequences in the database which could conceivably overflow. Synapse 1.38, due out next week, will automatically migrate homeservers when they upgrade. We run the migration as a background task, so homeservers should continue functioning as normal throughout, though they may use a bit more disk and memory, especially when rebuilding indexes for the new <code>bigint</code> column.</p>
<p>We're also starting to hone in on our team's goals for this quarter, and it's looking like our primary focus will be on improving room join speeds. Wish us luck!</p>
<p>Lastly, we're overjoyed to announce that <a href="https://github.com/reivilibre">@reivilibre</a>, a former intern on the backend team, joined Element this week! We can't wait to see where he helps us take Synapse!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>SchildiChat for Android is back in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.spiritcroc.riotx">Google Play Store</a>! Users who have previously installed the release using our own F-Droid repo will be able to update without the need to re-install.

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spaces work is making progress. Some rooms can now be previewed. To improve that situation, I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3266">MSC to preview specific rooms</a>. Alternatively we will try to get the previews for the few rooms you aren't joined to from the space summary API, currently we are just fetching the existing state. You can also now join previewed rooms and the design of joining invites was adapted to match it.</p>
<p>red_sky‚òÑÔ∏è went through the pain of fixing the Windows builds after we changed our http backend last week. So if you want to try it out, you can test it on Windows. We also replaced the old, boring spinner with an animated Nheko logo. If you see that a lot and think it is Nheko's fault, don't hesitate to open an issue! But in most cases it will probably be your server. Sadly no screenshot of how the spinner looks like, my server is too fast and taking a proper screenshot is too much effort because of that. ;p</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue with updating device lists in the develop version of Nheko. If you were using the nightlies, now is a good time to update! In more E2EE news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3270">symmetric megolm backup</a> fixes the issues I had with the online key backup, so looking forward to implementing that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The latest release of opsdroid is out with various fixes which can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/releases/tag/v0.23.0">the changelog</a>. The main point to note for matrix users is that older versions of matrix-nio (the matrix client library used by opsdroid) did not support the synapse change to omit <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10214">optional fields from sync</a>. Therefore if you are using our docker images you will need to update to 0.23 to get a container with the newest matrix-nio included.</p>
<p>The other change which is relevant to matrix users is that Oleg has added support for version 2 of the <a href="https://rasa.com/">Rasa NLU</a> framework, so you can once again do open source, self hosted natural language bots.</p>

<p>We missed it at the time, but wanted to share in TWIM. <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/">Terence Eden</a>, noted UK technologist, shared a <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2021/05/msc-first-assignment-technical-and-digital-leadership/">thorough, compelling argument for the UK Government to use Matrix as a foundation for the digital workplace</a>.</p>

<h3 id="beeper-update">Beeper update</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been a month since our last update. A lot of the work since then has been on making everything more reliable, but we've also added new features to our clients and started making some new bridges.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added thread UI for Slack-bridged rooms. Internally they're just replies like before, but the client will intelligently collapse replies in Slack rooms into threads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merged upstream Element additions like voice messages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also merged some features that aren't in Element yet, like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/5814">Giphy integration</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Released Beeper iOS to Testflight.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added grouping rooms by chat network based on the <code>m.bridge</code> state event. The UI is similar to spaces, but they're not actual Matrix spaces (yet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for Android 11's &quot;conversation&quot; notifications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bridges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Android Messages is turning out difficult to reverse-engineer to a sufficiently reliable level, so we're building a new SMS bridge into our Android app. It'll also be available as a standalone open-source app, which already exists at https://gitlab.com/beeper/android-sms (but doesn't have any setup instructions yet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've funded development of a LinkedIn bridge. sumner will post a more detailed update about that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We're hiring React, iOS, Android and SRE/Devops engineers. If you're interested, check out https://angel.co/company/beeperhq or DM <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@eric:beeper.com">Eric Migicovsky</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm excited to announce that I started working on a new bridge for bringing LinkedIn messages to Matrix! It's currently in the early stages of development and not production-ready. The current feature set includes: backfill from LinkedIn, user name and profile picture sync, message sending from Matrix -&gt; LinkedIn, and real-time message puppetting from LinkedIn -&gt; Matrix. There's much more to come, and you can join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#linkedin-matrix:nevarro.space">#linkedin-matrix:nevarro.space</a>  for updates. Development is being funded by Beeper, and is being designed with integration into Beeper as it's primary goal. However, the bridge is open source (Apache 2.0) and will be available to self-host. The source code is here: https://github.com/sumnerevans/linkedin-matrix.</p>

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line/">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Better LINE-&gt;Matrix read receipt bridging is now supported in the <code>testing</code> branch! The bridge now checks all LINE chats (not just the most recently-used one) to see if messages you sent have been read (in LINE). This works by cycling through all LINE chats where the final message is posted by you and doesn't have a &quot;Read&quot; marker on it yet (or for multi-user chats, if your last message hasn't been read by everyone in the room).</p>
<p>With that, I'll consider the bridge to be in Early Beta! üéâ I'm now testing the bridge for myself to iron out a few kinks, and am preparing a PR to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/">matrix.org</a> webpage to have this listed on https://matrix.org/bridges/.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello World! I am here to bring you Nheko news!</p>
<p>We merged the Spaces branch, which means Nheko master can now show some spaces. Peeking unjoined rooms, nesting spaces and creating them should be coming soon. We are also looking into how to fit knocking into the UI (we already rendered incoming knocks in the timeline for a while).</p>
<p>You can also now edit still pending messages, which should help if your server is slow and you notice a typo. The edit will then get queued and be sent as soon as the server acknowledges they received the original message. Apart from that there have been some improvements to the readability of the room list and some other UI elements.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we switched out our entire http backend from Boost to Curl. For that I wrote a <a href="https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/coeurl">simple wrapper around Curl</a>. This fixes about 10 issues around connection shutdown, brings proxy support, http/2 and http/3 support and in general makes Nheko crash less and reduces latency a LOT! This will obviously cause some pain for packagers, but I hope it isn't too bad. Some of the issues this fixes only had 2 digits in our bugtracker and one was even filed by benpa!</p>
<p>Have a nice weekend everyone! ‚ô•</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Over the last few days we've seen a distributed spam attack across the public Matrix network, where large numbers of spambots have been registered across servers with open registration and then used to flood abusive traffic into rooms such as Matrix HQ.</p>
<p>The spam itself has been handled by <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation#banning-servers">temporarily banning the abused servers</a>. However, on Monday and Tuesday the volume of traffic triggered performance problems for the homeservers participating in targeted rooms (e.g. memory explosions, or very delayed federation).  This was due to a combination of factors, but one of the most important ones was Synapse issue <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9490">#9490</a>: that one busy room could cause head-of-line blocking, starving your server from processing events in other rooms, causing all traffic to fall behind.</p>
<p>We're happy to say that Synapse 1.37.1 <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10272">fixes this</a> and we now process inbound federation traffic asynchronously, ensuring that one busy room won't impact others.  First impressions are that this has significantly improved federation performance and end-to-end encryption stability ‚Äî for instance, new E2EE keys from remote users for a given conversation should arrive immediately rather than being blocked behind other traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Please upgrade to Synapse 1.37.1 as soon as possible, in order to increase resilience to any other traffic spikes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also, we highly recommend that you disable open registration or, if you keep it enabled, use SSO or require email validation to avoid abusive signups. Empirically adding a CAPTCHA is not enough. Otherwise you may find your server blocked all over the place if it is hosting spambots.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finally, if your server has open registration, PLEASE check whether spambots have been registered on your server, and deactivate them.  Once deactivated, you will need to contact abuse@matrix.org to request that blocks on your server are removed</strong>.</p>
<p>Your best bet for spotting and neutralising dormant spambots is to review signups on your homeserver over the past 3-5 days and deactivate suspicious users. We do not recommend relying solely on lists of suspicious IP addresses for this task, as the distributed nature of the attack means any such list is likely to be incomplete or include shared proxies which may also catch legitimate users.</p>
<p>To ease review, we're working on an auditing script in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10290">#10290</a>; feedback on whether this is useful would be appreciated. Problematic accounts can then be dealt with using the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.37/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#deactivate-account">Deactivate Account Admin API</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over to Dan for the Synapse 1.37 release notes.</p>
<h2 id="synapse-1-37-release-announcement">Synapse 1.37 Release Announcement</h2>
<p>Synapse 1.37 is now available!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>**Note: ** The legacy APIs for Spam Checker extension modules are now considered deprecated and targeted for removal in August. Please see <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.37/modules.html#porting-an-existing-module-that-uses-the-old-interface">the module docs</a> for information on updating.</p>
<p>This release also removes Synapse's built-in support for the obsolete ACMEv1 protocol for automatically obtaining TLS certificates. Server administrators should place Synapse behind a <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.37/reverse_proxy.html">reverse proxy</a> for TLS termination, or switch to a standalone ACMEv2 client like <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">certbot</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="knock-knock">Knock, knock?</h3>
<p>After nearly 18 months and 129 commits, Synapse now includes support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</a> and <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/rooms/v7/">Room Version 7</a>! This feature allows users to directly request admittance to private rooms, without having to track down an invitation out-of-band. One caveat: Though the server-side foundation is there, knocking is not <em>yet</em> implemented in clients.</p>
<h3 id="a-unified-interface-for-extension-modules">A Unified Interface for Extension Modules</h3>
<p>Third party modules can customize Synapse's behavior, implementing things like bespoke media storage providers or user event filters. However, Synapse previously lacked a unified means of enumerating and configuring third-party modules. That changes with Synapse 1.37, which introduces a new, <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.37/modules.html">generic interface for extensions</a>.</p>
<p>This new interface consolidates configuration into one place, allowing for more flexibility and granularity by explicitly registering callbacks with specific hooks. You can learn more about the new module API in the docs linked above, or in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl5dnxRMP1hULbP8MYk2noPKFCFyg-SHK">Matrix Live</a> S6E29, due out this Friday, July 2nd.</p>
<h3 id="safer-reauthentication">Safer Reauthentication</h3>
<p>User-interactive authentication (&quot;UIA&quot;) is required for potentially dangerous actions like removing devices or uploading cross-signing keys. However, Synapse can optionally be configured to provide a brief grace period such that users are not prompted to re-authenticate on actions taken shortly after logging in or otherwise authenticating.</p>
<p>This improves user experience, but also creates risks for clients which rely on UIA as a guard against actions like account deactivation. Synapse 1.37 protects users by exempting especially risky actions from the grace period. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10184">#10184</a> for details.</p>
<h3 id="smaller-improvements">Smaller Improvements</h3>
<p>We've landed a number of smaller improvements which, together, make Synapse more responsive and reliable. We now:</p>
<ul>
<li>More efficiently respond to key requests, preventing excessive load (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10221">#10221</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10144">#10144</a>)</li>
<li>Render docs for each <code>vX.Y</code> Synapse release, starting with v1.37 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10198">#10198</a>)</li>
<li>Ensure that log entries from failures during early startup are not lost (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10191">#10191</a>)</li>
<li>Have a notion of database schema &quot;compatibility versions&quot;, allowing for more graceful upgrades and downgrades of Synapse (<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.37/development/database_schema.html#synapse-schema-versions">docs</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also resolved two bugs which could cause sync requests to immediately return with empty payloads (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8518">#8518</a>), producing a tight loop of repeated network requests.</p>
<h3 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h3>
<p>Lastly, we've merged an experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms</a> (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9247">#9247</a>) as part of Element's work to fully <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/30/welcoming-gitter-to-matrix">integrate Gitter into Matrix</a>.</p>
<p>These are just the highlights; please see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.37.1/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1370">Upgrade Information</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.37.1/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>

<p>Hi everyone! Did you ever feel lost in the Matrix world? The room directory is big, but it's still hard to find something you like. Or are you a room moderator, but there is not much activity in your room because it doesn't have enough users?</p>
<p>This is why I want to share rooms (or spaces) I find interesting.</p>

<p>Spaces work continues with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083</a> (Restricted room memberships), which will include a new room version due to the new <code>join_rule</code> of `restricted. On the other side of things, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3245">MSC3245</a> (voice messages) and by extension extensible events, is moving as the implementation work is pushed forward. Lots of activity on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3215">MSC3215</a> (improved moderation tooling) as well which will no doubt prove to be invaluable as the Matrix network continues to grow.</p>

<p>In terms of code, this week we didn't get much activity. The only noteworthy news is that we can now send spoilers, and use two new commands: <code>/tableflip</code> and <code>/unflip</code> thanks to Smitty van Bodegom.</p>
<p>Aside from that, we had 2 productive BoFs during Akademy 2021. The first one was about creating a library with shared chat visual components for KDE's chat apps: NeoChat for Matrix, Tok for Telegram and Kaidan for XMPP, KDE Connect and Spacebar for SMS, ... The second BoF was more about NeoChat and Quotient and we discussed how to move forwards with some problems (e.g. non-hacky text input auto-completion) but also the roadmap around E2EE, Spaces and Widgets support. Speaking about E2EE, we will have some very good news to announce next week, stay tuned!</p>

<p>We also did some housekeeping work that should improve the experience for people joining us on the Fractal Next fun. After being away for a while, Christopher Davis came back with a patch to add a couple more build related directories to our <code>.gitignore</code>. Julian cleaned up the pseudo-milestone description that we had in the README, now that we have a proper <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/milestones/18">Gitlab milestone</a>. And finally, I added <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/777">a warning on the login screen</a> to better reflect on the Work In Progress state of the branch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello dear Synapse Admins, <code>synadm</code> v0.30 is out. lt seems I was in &quot;story telling mode&quot; already when I wrote the release notes yesterday. That should perfectly suit a TWIM article as well üôÇ So there you go, copy/pasted from https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/releases/tag/v0.30 with love:</p>
<h4 id="new">New</h4>
<p><code>synadm</code> finally got some nicely rendered documentation pages hosted at https://synadm.readthedocs.io.</p>
<p>&quot;Login as a user&quot; admin API support:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm user login &lt;user id&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.user.html#synadm-user-login">Have a look at the new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>New subcommand <code>matrix</code>supporting execution of regular Matrix commands. As a first shot a command to issue any Matrix API call has been implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix raw endpoint/url -m post -f data.json</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix raw endpoint/url -m put -d '{&quot;key1&quot;: &quot;value1&quot;}' --prompt</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.matrix.html#synadm-matrix-raw">The new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that this is meant to be a convenience function in case a Synapse homeserver admin wants to quickly help users e.g set specific settings available via regular Matrix calls and not the Synapse admin API directly. Also note that it is not meant to replace the awesome Matrix CLI tools that are already out there. matrix-commander, matrixcli to mention just a few.</em></p>
<p>The second command below <code>matrix</code> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix login &lt;user id&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.matrix.html#synadm-matrix-login">The new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It implements a plain login on a Matrix server using username and password. It can even be used to retrieve a token for an admin user, e.g helpful for setting up fresh <code>synadm</code> installations. <a href="https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#getting-an-admin-token">Read about it here</a></p>
<h4 id="improved">Improved</h4>
<p>The README has been updated to point to the nicely rendered docs recently published at https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html</p>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>Update via PyPI or git as described in the update chapter: https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#update</p>

<p>Proper cleanup when leaving Heisenbridge rooms</p>

<li>
<p>Tiny bugfixes everywhere!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently working towards 1.0 release so mostly bug hunting and improving existing code and features.</p>
<p><strong>Call for mutual help!</strong> The plumb feature needs more testing on busy IRC channels. If you need to plumb public Matrix rooms and IRC channels on <em>any</em> IRC network that does not have a public bridge available or just want to use a relaybot on IRC side for some reason hit me up on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#heisenbridge:vi.fi">#heisenbridge:vi.fi</a> and we can setup a test plumb, free of charge! Only requirements are that I can lurk around to monitor how it works and there's nothing offensive on-topic.</p>
<p>In other news @warthog9 <a href="https://opensource.com/article/21/6/irc-matrix-bridge-znc">submitted an article to opensource.com</a> how to use ZNC and Heisenbridge together to keep using your existing IRC bouncer with Heisenbridge as a client for it. Pretty cool stuff!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hola everyone! Today we're releasing the latest in bridge greatness, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.27.0">matrix-appservice-irc 0.27.0</a>. This release contains the bulk of our work done for libera.chat. As always, thanks to the community for testing, writing up issues and creating PRs so that we can build better bridges to our friends on other networks.</p>
<p>The highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Username/password SASL authentication support. The bridge now lets you set a !username.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridge operators can now choose to block messages in the I-&gt;M direction while Matrix users are not joined to IRC as a privacy preservation technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now configure the bridge to publish rooms to the public room directory (rather than the appservice directory). The bridge can now also use the whole alias namespace (e.g. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#foo:libera.chat">#foo:libera.chat</a> -&gt; #foo).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numerous bug fixes and quality of life fixes!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is now live on libera.chat, and will be live on the other bridges very soon!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Even more read receipt improvements are here! In summary, with the magic of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a>, the bridge shouldn't ever &quot;view&quot; a LINE chat on your behalf in order to sync a message (which would send a read receipt to your chat contacts, even though you didn't read the chat yourself). For LINE messages that require viewing its chat in order to be bridged, like images/stickers (to get the image) and messages in multi-user chats (to know who sent them), the bridge instead sends a &quot;placeholder&quot; message that gets updated with the real LINE message content when you view the placeholder. That way, the bridge will only view a LINE chat when you view its Matrix portal.</p>
<p>A few stability fixes have been pushed as well. Namely, <code>sync</code> should be less likely to accidentally skip chats.</p>
<p>Only one final read receipt improvement remains, for LINE-&gt;Matrix read receipt bridging (which I mentioned last week): to make the bridge check all LINE chats (not just the most recently-used one) to see if messages you sent have been read (in LINE). This will work by cycling through all LINE chats where the final message is posted by you and doesn't have a &quot;Read&quot; marker on it yet.</p>
<p>Once that is taken care of, I'll consider the bridge to be in beta! üéâ</p>

<p>After some fixes the bot is now back in shape. This means that all Rooms should again have the correct names from now on and accept invites again. Be aware the bot currently doesnt support encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>As a side effect also https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/spaces now found 3x the rooms as before.</p>
<p>Also the webpage got a big overhaul which brings a lot more mobile phone friendliness :) So you can finally properly use it on your phone as well.</p>
<p>Another change is that tombstoned rooms now get filtered from the list to keep it clean.</p>
<p>For developers a API reference is now available at https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/api</p>
<p>Also if you use the apis please note that the content is gzip encoded. The server currently doesnt respect the <code>Accept-Encoding</code> Header.</p>
<p>On the side of internal changes is now that the retries are limited to 5 times instead the previously buggy amount. This should reduce join requests from my server drastically.</p>
<p>For people usings the /servers api endpoint there is also now a include_members option. This means https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/servers?include_members=true</p>
<p>now also gives unique servers based on known members.</p>

<p>After having tried to convince several people to join the Matrix, my main conclusion is that it's too difficult for people.

            <p>Synapse 1.36.0 is out, and it's a big one!</p>
<h2 id="room-join-memory-improvements">Room Join Memory Improvements</h2>
<p>We did it! Synapse no longer experiences a memory spike when joining large / complex rooms.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-06-15-synapse-1.36-join-memory.png" alt="Memory usage graph for Synapse 1.33 and 1.36" /></p>
<p>These improvements mainly arise from processing join responses incrementally, rather than trying to load everything into memory at once. However, realizing these gains involved a fair bit of rewriting, as the entire processing pipeline had to work incrementally, and with appropriately sized batches, to avoid downstream bottlenecks. You can hear more about our original plans for this work in last month's Matrix Live: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=694VuhmVmfo">S6E23 ‚Äî Dan and Erik talk about Synapse</a>.</p>
<h2 id="presence-improvements">Presence Improvements</h2>
<p>Running presence on a single worker process is now expected to work correctly. This feature first debuted in <a href="/blog/2021/05/05/synapse-1-33-0-released">Synapse 1.33</a>, but a few bugs cropped up which could lead to presence state becoming outdated. With <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10149">#10149</a> merged, we believe the last of these issues to be resolved.</p>
<p>We had also noticed a recent increase in presence load on federation workers; this was ultimately tracked to two bugs, both fixed in this release: We were processing local presence via federation workers (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10163">#10163</a>) and we were occasionally sending duplicate presence updates (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10165">#10165)</a>.</p>
<p>With both issues fixed, outgoing federation load has returned to normal levels:</p>

<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>Synapse now has two new Admin APIs for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.36.0/docs/admin_api/media_admin_api.md#unprotecting-media-from-being-quarantined">unprotecting</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.36.0/docs/admin_api/media_admin_api.md#remove-media-from-quarantine-by-id">removing</a> media from quarantine, thanks to contributions by dklimpel.</p>
<p>Synapse now implements the stable <code>/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{roomId}/aliases</code> endpoint originally introduced by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2432">MSC2432</a>, and, thanks to contributions by govynnus, makes the <code>reason</code> and <code>score</code> fields of event reports optional per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2414">MSC2414</a>.</p>
<p>These are just the highlights; please see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.36.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/14mRh4X0r">14mRh4X0r</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aaronraimist">aaronraimist</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bradtgmurray">bradtgmurray</a>, <a href="https://github.com/crcastle">crcastle</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/govynnus">govynnus</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/RhnSharma">RhnSharma</a>.</p>
