            <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.48.0">Synapse 1.48.0</a> is out now!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Synapse 1.49, due out on December 14th, will be the <strong>last release of Synapse to support Python 3.6 or PostgreSQL 9.6</strong> per our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.48/deprecation_policy.html">platform dependency deprecation policy</a>. Accordingly, we will remove support for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) at the same date, as it ships with Python 3.6.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="password-resets-and-identity-servers">Password resets and identity servers</h2>
<p>This release removes the long-deprecated <code>trust_identity_server_for_password_resets</code> configuration option. This option was initially deprecated in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.4.0">Synapse 1.4.0</a> back in October 2019.</p>
<p>Admins of servers still using this configuration option will need to update their Synapse configuration to send password resets through an SMTP server directly rather than relying on identity servers to send them on their behalf.</p>
<h2 id="new-admin-apis-and-improved-alignment-with-matrix-1-1">New <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin APIs</a> and improved alignment with Matrix 1.1</h2>
<p>This release also introduces a handful of new admin APIs, allowing administrators to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#controlling-whether-a-user-is-shadow-banned">un-shadow-ban users</a>, <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#block-room-api">block a room</a>, and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/background_updates.html#run">run specific background updates</a> (but we'll talk about this last one a bit later on). The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#delete-room-api">delete room API</a> has also been updated to be able to run in the background or to block a room pre-emptively, even if the server doesn't know about it yet.</p>
<p>This release also brings Synapse into greater alignment with version 1.1 of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">the Matrix specification</a> by adding support for API paths beginning <code>/_matrix/client/v3</code> and <code>/_matrix/media/v3</code>.</p>
<h2 id="background-updates">Background updates</h2>
<p>When Synapse updates from one version to another, it might need to run large scale updates on its database. In order to avoid blocking startup for too long while waiting for these updates to run, Synapse runs them in the background after starting.</p>
<p>Lately the Synapse team has been doing some work to improve the performance of these background updates. More specifically, this release includes a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11421">performance fix</a> for a background update introduced in Synapse 1.47.0, as well as a <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/background_updates.html#run">new admin API</a> to let admins rerun specific updates.</p>
<p>Future Synapse updates will also include <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11306">module capabilities</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11260">more configuration options</a> for controlling background updates.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release also includes some improved support of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> to help threading. It also adds support for the stable identifiers from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2778">MSC2778</a>, bringing Synapse closer to supporting end-to-end (or end-to-bridge) encryption support for application services.</p>
<p>We also now publish a Docker image, <code>matrixdotorg/synapse:develop</code>, which tracks the development head of Synapse.</p>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.48.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/binarymaster">Stanislav Motylkov</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tulir">Tulir Asokan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Neeeflix">Neeeflix</a>.</p>

<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (serverside aggregations) is getting lots of updates from Bruno in order to align the proposal with what is currently implemented in the wild (as it's easier to iterate on incremental improvements from a starting point grounded in reality). This MSC is a bit of a special case though, as it was implemented with stable prefixes before the MSC landed (in the before times...).</p>
<p>Regardless, thank you very much to Bruno for going through and finally untangling and help land aggregations in the spec! This MSC is one of four which describe how aggregations should work in Matrix, and it's great to see them finally being properly spec'd, especially as further features start to be built on top of them (such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440/">threading</a>!).</p>
<p>And finally, a further thank you to community members <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3509">an OpenAPI schema fix</a>!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a>!</p>
<p>This proposal aims to allow appservices to get ever greater visibility into what is happening on the homeserver, while still maintaining full process separation.</p>
<p>A lot of the time solutions to complex problems require knowing when a user has registered or logged in, with what name/3pids etc, when users change their emails, etc. Hooking into these non-room-based actions can help with developing useful features. Maybe you want an appservice that plays a sound effect whenever a user signs up to your homeserver!</p>
<p>These days, that is often achieved by homeserver implementation-specific solutions, such as <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/">modules</a> in Synapse. Being able to notify of these events using a standard API shape would be hugely beneficial to generalisation of projects.</p>
<p>So give the proposal a look over and review if that interests you!

<blockquote>
<p>As predicted last week, we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/23/synapse-1-47-1-released">released Synapse 1.47.1</a> on Tuesday. This is a security release which fixes an issue with Synapse's built-in media repository. Admins are strongly encouraged to upgrade.</p>
<p>Otherwise, relatively slow week: a handful of of the team have been away (Happy Thanksgiving, Americans!), but we <em>did</em> release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.48.0rc1">Synapse 1.48.0rc1</a>. Most importantly, this release candidate includes changes to improve the efficiency of large background updates from past releases, which should significantly reduce database load when upgrading. It also adds support for the <code>/v3</code> APIs defined in version 1.1 of the Matrix specification.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about 1.48 when it's formally released next week, but as always, we appreciate folks trying out the release candidates and letting us know how they behave.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bridging edits, deletions, reactions, formatting and read receipts in both directions (even <code>/rainbow</code> somewhat works from Matrix)</li>
<li>Bridging typing notifications and any types of files from Matrix to Google Chat</li>
<li>Bridging Google Meet links from Google Chat to Matrix</li>
<li>Syncing group members from Google Chat</li>
</ul>
<p>(edits and deletions are only available on Google Workspace accounts, not normal accounts. I have no idea why they did that, but that's just how Google Chat works 🤷)</p>
<p>There's still a bug where it sometimes silently stops receiving messages, which I'm currently trying to solve (or work around). After that I'll make a v0.3.0 release. Backfilling history may also happen in the near future</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver">Matrix Webhook Receiver</a></p>
<p>Do you like to receive notifications in matrix?
Matrix Webhook Receiver (MWR) is an add-on for the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-webhooks">matrix-appservice-webhooks</a> bridge. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">Webhooks</a> are essentially web interfaces for applications to &quot;push&quot; data to.
The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.</p>
<p>This is where MWR comes in:
It can receive any (JSON) content, optionally reformat it nicely (customizable!), and forward it to the webhooks bridge which will post it to a room for you. If you are running any software service, there is a good chance it can notify you via webhooks!</p>
<p>Right now, several example configurations exist, ready for you to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>GitLab (including Community Edition/self hosted)</li>
<li>Ansible Tower/AWX</li>
<li>Grafana Alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here is the GitHub webhook as seen in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org">#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org</a>:
<img src="/blog/img/webhook_receiver.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>More examples of apps currently in development: Prometheus Alertmanager, Jellyfin</p>
<p>It is also easy to use to send messages from the commandline with standard tools (<code>curl</code>), e.g. for your cron jobs! See the README for an example.</p>
<p>Some other webhook matrix things exist, but often require</p>
<ul>
<li>➖ admin access to server (appservices)</li>
<li>➖ installing and running and maintaining a specific bot per service</li>
<li>➖ create and set up accounts and passwords for each bot to use</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, MWR requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>➖ matrix-appservice-webhooks set up on your server by your admin</li>
<li>➖ some knowledge of how to send POST requests for one time setup. I want to improve that, suggestions are welcome!</li>
<li>➕ MWR can be installed and run by anyone who can access the bridge</li>
<li>➕ one single MWR supports any amount of notifying apps!</li>
<li>➕ you don't need admin access to the server to add more apps</li>
<li>➕ no need to develop a bot/plugin to support new apps, just write a quick jinja template</li>
<li>➕ multiple people can use a single MWR instance by sharing HTTP basic auth credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>Other features:</p>
<ul>
<li>can post into encrypted rooms (see readme)</li>
<li>automatically generated API docs</li>
<li>message formatting presets including html markup or m.notice</li>
<li>arbitrarily customizable webhook URLs</li>
<li>list and manage currently installed webhooks in your browser (<a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver/blob/main/examples/GUI_screenshot.png">screenshot</a>)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks! Some exciting new news on the bridge front: I've renamed <code>matrix-github</code> to <code>matrix-hookshot</code> to better reflect it's not-just-GitHub-ness. That's not all though, as there are new features too:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridge now supports <strong>Rust</strong> as a companion language (we're aiming to rewrite critical sections in rust). Some parts of the formatting code have already been rewritten.</li>
<li>The bridge now supports JIRA (full puppeting!)</li>
<li>The bridge now supports generic webhooks too, with the ability to write <strong>custom handling code</strong> inside the state event to process these hooks into pretty messages.</li>
<li>Basic support for GitHub discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the works:</p>
<ul>
<li>A provisioning API to hook into integration managers</li>
<li>More GitLab support</li>
<li>Better GitHub discussions support</li>
</ul>
<p>We're not quite ready for a 0.2.0 release, but please check us out at https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot.</p>

The problems where the flatpak has issues starting on Gnome systems are still under investigation. We thought we had a solution, but that seems to have broken other stuff! 💥</p>
<p>Apart from that we have been doing some after release party cleanup. Apart from some refactorings, you can now filter your rooms on whether they are a direct chat or not in the sidebar. This is in addition to the filters we already had for favourites, spaces and your other personal tags. User colors should also now be much less biased towards blue and jdenticons should have more variance. Expect the next release to be a much more colorful experience!</p>
<p>Speaking of colors, Twily made this awesome ZX Spectrum inspired logo after we changed our Gitlab bot to be more colorful! Check it out:

<blockquote>
<p>maubot <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> was released last weekend. Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling encryption should be much easier: the device ID can be entered in the web UI or you can just do <code>mbc auth --update-client</code> to automatically log in and store the access token and device ID in maubot.</li>
<li><code>mbc auth</code> can now log in with SSO.</li>
<li>The standalone mode for running a single plugin with a static config is now mostly functional and <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/maubot/usage/standalone.html">somewhat documented</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I finally took a day to figure out Sphinx/autodoc and made some decent-looking autogenerated <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/python/latest/">docs for mautrix-python</a>. I'll probably extend that to generate maubot-specific API references too eventually.</p>

<h3 id="server-stats">Server_Stats</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev">MTRNord</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today is a good day for those calling me a spy, someone not wanting to care about privacy and for those who did publicly harass me for server_stats.</p>
<p>People using the API likely already noticed it wasn't reachable for a while. Effective immediately I am currently leaving all rooms  the bot is part of. This will take days or even months considering this are 6397 rooms at the time of writing. I am not going into the motives of why I am shutting it down. It comes down to personal reasons.</p>
<p>There won't be any dump of the data. The source will be kept public. Note though if anyone ever tries to run it that you need about 600GB of space for synapse, a lot of CPU, a lot of RAM and plenty of workers as this can easily crash synapse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Server_Stats was an incredibly useful project. It pains me a lot to see it go, but it pains me even further that its author got harassed. This is not an acceptable behaviour, and we are better than that as a community. Thanks for this incredible project MTRNord, it's been both exciting and useful.</p>

            <p>Today we are releasing Synapse 1.47.1, a security update based on last week's release of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/17/synapse-1-47-0-released">Synapse 1.47.0</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.1">release</a> patches one high severity issue affecting Synapse installations 1.47.0 and earlier using the media repository. An attacker could cause these Synapses to download a remote file and store it in a directory outside the media repository. </p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>This only affects homeservers using Synapse's built-in media repository, as opposed to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse-s3-storage-provider">synapse-s3-storage-provider</a> or <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a>.</li>
<li>Attackers cannot control the exact name or destination of the stored file.</li>
</ul>
<p>To quote from the advisory:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="ghsa-3hfw-x7gx-437c-cve-2021-41281-path-traversal-when-downloading-remote-media"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-3hfw-x7gx-437c">GHSA-3hfw-x7gx-437c</a> / CVE-2021-41281: Path traversal when downloading remote media.</h3>
<h4 id="impact">Impact</h4>
<p>Synapse instances with the media repository enabled can be tricked into downloading a file from a remote server into an arbitrary directory, potentially outside the media store directory.</p>
<p>The last two directories and file name of the path are chosen randomly by Synapse and cannot be controlled by an attacker, which limits the impact.</p>
<p>Homeservers with the media repository disabled are unaffected. Homeservers configured with a federation whitelist are also unaffected.</p>

            <p>Friday already? Did this week already happen? It looked like the spacetime continuum was broken and we didn't know who did it. We needed witnesses to solve the case: did things really happen this week? And the witnesses showed up! A huge thanks to everyone in the Matrix community who reported their progress, and to everyone currently working on making awesome projects around Matrix!</p>
<p>The case is closed: the week has not been stolen from us. Time appears to have wings, and flies faster than we had anticipated.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h3 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h3>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3489">MSC3489: Sharing streams of location data</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3488">MSC3488: Extending events with location data</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs entered proposed FCP state this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674: Event Relationships</a> (merge)</li>

<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3283">MSC3283: Expose capabilities for profile actions</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>This week we finally, finally had one of the aggregation-related MSCs, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> (event relationships) enter final comment period! This MSC, along with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issue-406544216">several others</a>, document the stuff that powers message edit, reactions, the upcoming threading and polls MSCs, and much more! So it's really great to see the MSCs start to actually land.</p>
<p>Speaking of threading <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> has had a good amount of review from the Spec Core Team last week. Threading in Matrix has been a long awaited feature for chat applications - as well as helping extend the flexibility of Matrix as a data structure even further. The MSC relies on both <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (or a modified version of it), so the latter will be an area of focus for review for next week.</p>
<h3 id="spec-prs">Spec PRs</h3>
<p>It seems that the recent <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">Matrix v1.1</a> has drummed up some more community support for spec PRs. Thank you to everyone who's sent in clarifications, changes and even typo fixes. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aankur12-1610">fixes to the OpenAPI fields, and for typo corrections in the spec copy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for helping review them. Thank you both! </p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2867">MSC2867: Marking rooms as unread</a>!</p>
<p>This is definitely a feature that I would love to have for chat. Note that this MSC proposes marking <em>a room</em> as unread, rather than a specific point in the room's timeline. This is intentional as noted in the document, as the latter is more complicated, as it intersects with sending out read receipts to other users.

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> we plan to release a <strong>security release, Synapse 1.47.1</strong> on the coming <strong>Tuesday, 23rd of November</strong>; see the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/18/pre-disclosure-upcoming-security-release-of-synapse-1-47-1">predisclosure</a>.</p>
<p>We released Synapse 1.47.0 after squashing a couple of problems related to database migrations remaining in 1.47.0rc2.  Briefly, this release includes</p>
<ul>
<li>new features for users of the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin</a> and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">module</a> APIs;</li>
<li>a number of long-standing bug fixes, including a thorny bug which prevented joining certain old rooms; and</li>
<li>continuing efforts to prototype new MSCs and improve type coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/17/synapse-1-47-0-released">blog post</a> has a better summary, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0">GitHub</a> has the full gory details.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.1">Sydent 2.5.1</a>, a minor release which improves the way we handle and log various error cases.</p>
<p>Thank you as ever to our community contributors, and everyone out there who's using Synapse to communicate!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> also reminds us</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we release the fix, the changes will be publicly known and bad actors will have the ability to deduce the vulnerability. Most servers don't run release candidates, so releasing the fix in an RC will mean there's a larger window for an attacker to exploit the problem. Internally, there will be an RC deployed to test homeservers and eventually matrix.org. This means we'll be able to confidently recommend the upgrade to server administrators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dkasak:termina.org.uk">dkasak</a> adds</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that's the very reason we have dedicated security releases, instead of just rolling the security fixes into a feature release. The security release doesn't contain anything new apart from the security fix so it minimizes the chance of things going wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep your servers up to date, and your users safe, administrators!</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.7.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement &quot;best effort&quot; basic IRC moderation in plumbed rooms if bot has ops on IRC</li>
<li>Allow configuring topic sync for plumbs (IRC&lt;-&gt;Matrix or one way)</li>
<li>Allow using forward slash (/) as MXID separator for IRC ghosts</li>
<li>Bump max mautrix version to &lt;0.12</li>
<li>Small fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Plumb moderation! If the bridge bot has ops on IRC it will do its best to map kicks and bans (regarding IRC users) from Matrix. This definitely isn't perfect and is meant as a convenience.</p>
<p>Topic synchronization is now configurable for plumbs as well to make it possible to share the same topic between an IRC channel and a plumbed Matrix room. Default is still off and it requires the bridge bot to have enough PL to work.</p>
<p>The separator for IRC ghosts can now be changed to forward slash (/) from the default underscore (_). This happens by modifying the regex in the registration file. Only do this for new installations and it will cause <em>all</em> IRC users to duplicate in rooms who you can't remove and probably other bad side effects as well. The default may be changed in the future.</p>
<p>There were lots of refactoring issues so I hope I fixed all of them 🙈.</p>
<p>Best effort your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>An important note on the interesting projects using Matrix for the login: those are community projects, and there are MSCs in the works to &quot;do it right&quot; at the Spec level!</p>
<p>As Matthew Hodgson <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29242445">reported in a comment on Hacker News</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The direction we're headed in the Matrix spec core team is instead towards replacing Matrix's current auth mechanisms with normal Open ID Connect (rather than wrapping our own OIDC-like thing, as we do today) - as per https://github.com/sandhose/matrix-doc/blob/msc/sandhose/oauth2-profile/proposals/2964-oauth2-profile.md The common login flow would then be for users to be authed by their server using a trusted OIDC identity provider, rather than ever trusting arbitrary clients with their credentials.</p>

<p>I have compiled <a href="https://austinhuang.me/matrix-homeservers.html">a list of public homeservers</a> available for registration, since previous such efforts to make these homeservers more discoverable fell through. This list serves as a sanitized version of the asra.gr list, with only homeservers intended for public consumption included. It is a static list and does not include pings, but rather than focusing on the technical aspect, my list has an emphasis on the written rules of a homeserver, which I believe to play a larger role in the Matrix experience. Hope this can spark other efforts in maintaining a better list!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's one very useful list of hand curated servers! The transparency about the inclusion criteria is very much appreciated. Good job!</p>

            <p>On <strong>Tuesday, 23rd November</strong> we plan to release Synapse 1.47.1 at 12:00 UTC to address a single high severity issue. This vulnerability was discovered internally by our security team. Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org team and the wider Matrix community.</p>
<p>If you're a server administrator running Synapse, <strong>please be prepared to upgrade as soon as the patched version is released</strong>.</p>
<p>We will be reaching out to downstream packagers to ensure they can prepare patched versions of affected packages at the time of the release. The details of the vulnerability will be disclosed in a blog post on the day of the release. There is so far no evidence of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience while we work to resolve this issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We anticipate publishing a <strong>security release</strong>, Synapse 1.47.1, on the coming Tuesday, the 23rd of November.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.47.1 will contain a fix for a high severity issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Synapse 1.47.0 features additions to the admin and module APIs, a plethora of fixes for long-standing bugs, and a raft of internal improvements. Server administrators should note that this release removes a deprecated API for deleting a room and deprecates a module callback. Consult the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1470">upgrade notes</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="new-admin-and-module-apis">New <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin</a> and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">module</a> APIs</h2>
<p>Administrators can now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11099">search for rooms by their ID or alias</a>. We hope this will be particularly useful for projects like <a href="https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/synapse-admin">synapse-admin</a>! We've also exposed an API to allow admins to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11263">control Synapse's background updates</a>.  And while it's not strictly an API change, there's a small <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11211/files">patch</a> which makes it easier for homeservers to redirect matrix traffic to port 443.</p>
<p>Authors of pluggable modules have some new toys to play with. There's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11126">a way to listen for new events</a>; a means to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11204">retrieve room state</a> and the ability to edit a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11147">user's membership of a room</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixes-and-refactors">Bug Fixes and Refactors</h2>
<p>We fixed a variety of different bugs in this release, many of which were long-standing. It's good to see them dealt with! Worth mentioning in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10097">the</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11199">handling</a> of the <code>device_inbox</code> table, which trim redundant data to reduce database bloat.</li>
<li>Fixes related to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11255">restarting</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11262">workers</a>, to ensure a more reliable upgrade process.</li>
<li>Fix being <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11135">unable to join certain v1 rooms</a>, e.g. <code>#NextCloud:matrix.org</code>, whose state contained floating point numbers.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11207">Fix serialisation and duplication errors</a> when sending ephemeral events to application services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, work continues on improving type-checking coverage, both <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11205">in</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11164">Synapse</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/pull/264">in</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/pull/271">Sygnal</a>.</p>
<h2 id="sydent-2-5-1">Sydent 2.5.1</h2>
<p>This week also saw the release of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.1">Sydent 2.5.1</a>, the reference implementation of a Matrix Identity Server. This is a minor release which mainly tidies up error handling to reduce the amount of noise in logs. It should also make it easier for us to diagnose some outstanding bugs which remain to be squashed.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>In the background, we're still working away at implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> to facilitate threading. Early tests are promising. We're also exploring <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775</a> as a means to speed up room joins. Both will be long term projects that should hopefully reap major rewards for the Matrix ecosystem. Lastly, there's support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3288">MSC3228</a> to allow identity servers to provide bespoke invites to spaces. We mentioned this <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/02/synapse-1-46-0-released#sydent-250">last time</a> in Sydent release notes; now we've got support for it on the Synapse side.</p>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.47.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JohannesKleine">JohannesKleine</a>, <a href="https://github.com/l00ptr">l00ptr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Fizzadar">Nick Barrett</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rogersheu">rogersheu</a>,

<p>Extensible events is something that has been a long time coming in Matrix. It unlocks so much potential, and is even currently being built on (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> (polls)). Definitely one of the next big ticket items to tackle in the medium term.

<p>Dan (aka callahad) is away this week, so let me report on his behalf.</p>
<p>We cut a release candidate for Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0rc2">1.47.0rc2</a>, but see the changelog for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0rc1">rc1</a>). It exposes new functionality for <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">pluggable modules</a> and new endpoints to the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">Admin API</a>. We've fixed a bunch of long-standing bugs and continued to drive forward efforts to improve documentation and code quality. Thank you to all of our contributors!</p>
<p>With future releaes in mind, we've been continuing work to support threading and E2EE application services. We've also been prototyping a new Admin API to remove users from all rooms belonging to a certain space.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we've been doubling down on our effort to improve reliability and maintainability of our services as a whole. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent">Sydent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a> have a number of PRs in flight for both, aimed at improving type coverage and driving down error noise in the logs. We've drafted a blog post to summarise the process of type annotating mypy (keep your eyes out for that one). We also worked to make the matrix.org database more resilient, and made changes to improve the experience of rolling out upgrades to Synapse en masse.</p>

<p>Vacuum your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you love bugs as much as I do? ♥🐛♥</p>
<p>I guess not. For that reason bug fixing in Nheko for the next release continues. We fixed a super annoying issue, where loading keys from the online backup could make Nheko stuck in a flickering mode with no way to interact with it anymore. You can now also click anywhere on a read receipt to open someones profile instead of just their avaitar, edited messages now also show as redacted, if only the original message got redacted and don't lose the reply in encrypted rooms, if the edit was sent by a client, that is not Nheko. You also used to get logged out after registration, which should finally be resolved. There were also a bazillion translation updates! Thank you, everyone who contributed to those.</p>
<p>We also finally merged the prettier video player, which also fixes a video playback issue on macOS. Try it out and give us feedback on it!</p>
<p>We are still hunting down some last bugs, but expect the release soon now. In the meantime, I did start summarizing the changes, if you want to see what will be in the next release: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#090----unreleased</p>
<p>That's all and have a great weekend!</p>

        <div>
            <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>Once again it's been <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/05/27/room-version-6-client-server-r-0-6-1-and-federation-r-0-1-4-spec-releases">a little while</a> since we've done a spec release (sorry; we're aiming for quarterly releases from here on out), but this time we have some pretty big news: we've got an <a href="https://spec.matrix.org">all-new spec platform</a> and a new versioning scheme. The new spec platform has been needed for a long time to make better sense of what Matrix is, and as part of getting that out the door we reduced the number of &quot;Matrix versions&quot; to just one.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to Will Bamberg for building it out for us, anoa for working out the deployment details, and everyone for testing it all. They talk at length about what this specification even is and about the platform itself on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsdMgXug7u8">Matrix Live S6E19</a>. It's the single greatest improvement to the spec we've seen to date.</p>
<p>The new versioning scheme presents the whole specification as a single document, making it easier to check compatibility between implementations and the spec itself. Previously, a grid would have to be drawn to show whether Server-Server r0.1.4 is compatible with Client-Server r0.6.1 - while obvious at release time, the historical context gets lost quite easily. Now, with a single version number, the entire specification is compatible across a single version number: servers implementing Matrix 1.1 will be compatible with clients implementing v1.1, and vice versa. For the specification itself, this means we no longer have to carefully point and update links between the APIs, as they'll instead be versioned together.</p>
<p>Changing the versioning of the specification does have an impact on the Client-Server API in particular, however. You may have noticed that Client-Server APIs are currently versioned at &quot;r0&quot;. By removing rX.Y.Z versioning, all of the endpoints suddenly don't have a version to reference. All endpoints across the specification are now versioned individually to allow for breaking changes at the endpoint level. They no longer require the whole specification to be listed as a breaking change: a v1 endpoint can get additions/changes which are backwards compatible, but if we need to change format (for example) then it'll get bumped up to v2, leaving v1 in its last known state.</p>
<p>For the Client-Server API, a slight complication is that v1 and v2 (alpha) are already versions familiar to those that have been around for a while - to avoid confusing those people, existing Client-Server API endpoints will start at v3. New endpoints introduced after v1.1 will start at v1 instead.</p>
<p>It's been well over a year since the last release, which means there's a whole lot of features and changes to cover. Here we'll try to cover the things most clients/servers will have to worry about, but we do still recommend reading through the changelog included below. Overall, 28 MSCs have been merged through this release, but some have had to be excluded in the interest of getting the spec release out there. Many of them are expected to be in the next anticipated release (which should hopefully be next quarter).</p>
<h2 id="clients-there-s-a-lot-of-stuff">Clients: There's a lot of stuff</h2>
<p>In Matrix 1.1, client developers get all sorts of new features to play with. Clients which support end-to-end encryption should explore <strong><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#server-side-key-backups">key backups</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#cross-signing">cross-signing</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#secrets">SSSS</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#key-verification-framework">breaking changes to verification</a></strong>. Quite a lot of this stuff has existed for a while, but has made it into the specification formally now. As an added bonus, the emoji for SAS verification <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/tree/master/data-definitions">have been translated</a> (<a href="https://translate.element.io/projects/matrix-doc/sas-emoji-v1/">contribute here</a>).</p>
<p>Knocking has also landed in the spec (thanks Sorunome for leading the charge on this!), opening up the ability for rooms to optionally allow people to request invites to join. This can be helpful for semi-private rooms where it can be easier to approve/deny requests compared to finding someone's MXID and manually inviting them. This does require a <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/rooms/v7/">v7 room</a> to work, however.</p>
<p>Thanks again to Sorunome, <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#spoiler-messages">Message Spoilers</a> have been officially included in Matrix. People can now safely discuss the ending to the latest movie without being banned for spoilers. Though, as a new feature, there's a chance that the spoiler text still gets included in the message: clients should update as soon as possible to avoid their users accidentally getting banned for spoiling the conclusion to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">Spaces saga</a> ;)</p>
<p>There's a few other smaller improvements/additions, and of course the regular &quot;various clarifications and bug fixes&quot; to take a look at. For a sample checklist, check out <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/16876">element-web's issue</a> on the subject.</p>
<h2 id="servers-knock-knock-it-s-a-new-room-version">Servers: Knock knock, it's a new room version</h2>
<p><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/rooms/v7/">Room version 7</a> has landed, bringing forth the ability for users to knock on rooms (requesting an invite to join). The changes are largely scoped to using the reserved keywords for join rules and membership, and are described through the auth rules. Thankfully, the changes over v6 are minimally invasive so should be quick to implement.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/server-server-api/#end-to-end-encryption">cross-signing bits</a> have been included in the API responses and EDU definitions. <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/05/06/cross-signing-and-end-to-end-encryption-by-default-is-here">Matthew's blog post</a> from last year (it really has been that long...) describes cross-signing and the history of its implementation.</p>
<p>As per usual, there's also various specification errors corrected to aid understanding. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11079">Synapse has an exhaustive issue</a> to detail what servers might need to do.</p>
<p><em>PS: Room versions 8 and 9 are also out there, but will be included in a future spec release.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-full-changelog">The full changelog</h2>
<p>We haven't mentioned identity servers, bridges, etc in this post but they have changes too! Below is the whole changelog, the entire year and a bit of it. Thank you to everyone who has submitted MSCs, and congratulations on getting them released. If we forgot yours, please mention it in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> so we can apologize and correct.</p>
<p>PS: The MSC process is how changes to Matrix are made, and you (yes, you) can propose those changes too. Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkZz60RRfc">Matrix Live episode</a> where Matthew talks about how this process works, and how we avoid blocking clients from implementing their proposals behind the relatively slow spec release cycles.</p>

<p>The spec release mentioned last week is happening on Tuesday - look out for a long blog post explaining all the changes, and check out the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org">new platform</a> (as it stands in its current, unstable state) before it goes live. Exciting stuff!</p>
<h2 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h2>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3217">MSC3217: Soft kicks</a>!</p>
<p>Other than this sounding like something out of a workout routine, soft kicks are proposed as a hint to clients that the user has been kicked from the room, but that it was not out of moderation, but for a technical reason (the example given disconnection from an IRC network). The client can then present a different UX as opposed to a normal, &quot;hard&quot; kick.</p>
<p>Give it a read and provide feedback if the topic interests you!

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.46.0">Synapse 1.46</a>! This release includes a fix for the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> from 1.44 which could cause smaller hosts to lock up when clients reconnected after some time offline.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.46 also includes experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440: Threading via <code>m.thread</code> relation</a>, a big step toward threaded messaging in Matrix. It's otherwise mainly a bugfix release, as we've spent much of our time reviewing infrastructure and making plans to improve our resilience should we experience hardware failures similar to what took out matrix.org two weeks ago.</p>
<p>We continue working toward a prototype implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775: Lazy loading over federation</a>, starting with setting up automated infrastructure to repeatedly measure the join speeds of assorted large, public rooms. Our goal is to have a rough proof of concept for lazy room joins by the end of the year.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.0">Sydent 2.5.0</a>! In addition to fixing bugs, this release passes <code>mypy --strict</code>, uses Jinja2 for templates, and supports the <code>room_type</code> field from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3288">MSC3288</a> to better differentiate between invitations to rooms and invitations to Spaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>mautrix-whatsapp <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/whatsapp/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> was released. The main change is switching to the new WhatsApp multidevice API, which means the phone doesn't need to be connected 24/7 anymore. The release also includes a new backfilling system using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a>, and making the relaybot mode less special-cased and more like what mautrix-signal does.</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.5.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow opening multiple simultaneous connections to the same network</li>
<li>New STOP/STAHP ROOM command to end a long paste flood</li>
<li>Clear channel send queue if the user gets kicked to prevent continuing flood on rejoin</li>
<li>New KB ROOM command to do a proper kick &amp; ban (contributed by GitHub user @blastrock, thanks!)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most useful feature this week is having the ability to open multiple connections to the same network. This can be used to plumb channels with a secondary connection while using the bridge as yourself with the main one. You can also STAHP long pastes from being actually sent out completely to a channel if you weren't careful enough on Matrix side.</p>
<p>Upgrading from previous version to v1.5.0 will cause a small migration for every channel/pm that is open so it might take a little longer for the first startup to complete. If no multiple network connections are opened it is safe to downgrade but if someone uses the feature it will cause shenanigans for the duplicate networks in the older version.</p>
<p>Inject your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are preparing for a release! That means, if you are translator, we could use your help to get our translations <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/">updated</a> and if you want to have a bug fixed before release, now is the time to report it or complain about it! Please come and see us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> for complaints and questions!</p>
<p>We saw a lot of translation updates by Linerly, Priit and Thulinma already. The click ghosting issue in the room list should be fixed as well as the crash when accepting an invite from your browser. You can now register on matrix.org again, after fighting with some... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3471">reality deforming wording in the spec</a>. Notifications on macOS now use the &quot;modern&quot; API for notifications, including grouping notifications by room. (Expect more fancy improvements there in the future!) The warning about mentioning the whole room now vanishes properly, hiding space children from the roomlist now doesn't hide them from the space itself anymore, the loading spinner shouldn't show in a fully loaded room again, the room directory search bar is now focused by default and a few smaller fixes.</p>
<p>We also completed the bootstrapping UI now. This means you get prompted for unverified devices, when your device isn't verified or when cross-signing isn't configured for your account yet and you are given ways to remedy that.</p>
<p>We have a few more bug fixes we want to land before the release, so don't expect it tomorrow, but we have the featureset down now. And if you thought the changes listed in this snippet are long, wait for the full release changelog. It will probably take a few days for me to tidy that up and I think this will be our biggest release yet! Happy testing, everyone!</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.46.0 is out now and includes support for Ubuntu 21.10: Impish Indri.</p>
<p>This release includes a fix for a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> that surfaced in Synapse 1.44.</p>
<h2 id="progress-on-threading">Progress on Threading</h2>
<p>While still disabled by default, we're beginning to land code in Synapse to support threaded discussions in Matrix. In particular, the <code>m.thread</code> event relationship defined in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> is now implemented behind a configuration flag.</p>
<p>There are still many open questions here, and MSC3440 has not yet been approved to merge into the Matrix spec, but it's a start. Threading is essential to Matrix's continued growth and adoption, and we're excited to provide server-side support to this effort.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixes-and-refactors">Bug Fixes and Refactors</h2>
<p>This release is mostly comprised of bug fixes and improvements to static typing. Of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>export-data</code> admin command now works and is tested in CI. This command helps server administrators respond to GDPR Subject Access Requests.</li>
<li>A weeks-long effort to refactor how Synapse validates the <code>auth_events</code> field of incoming PDUs has concluded, resolving a few corner cases which could incorrectly allow events into the room state which should instead be rejected.</li>
<li>Further static type hints have been added to Synapse, improving our precise type coverage to 85% of all lines. Currently, 13% of the Python files in <code>synapse/</code> are skipped during mypy runs. We'd like to cut this in half by the end of the year, as well as increasing overall precise coverage in the codebase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sydent-2-5-0">Sydent 2.5.0</h2>
<p>This week also saw the release of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.0">Sydent 2.5.0</a>, the reference implementation of a Matrix Identity Server. In addition to fixing bugs, Sydent 2.5.0 passes <code>mypy --strict</code>, uses Jinja2 for templates, and supports the <code>room_type</code> field from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3288">MSC3288</a> to better differentiate between invitations to rooms and invitations to Spaces.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Admin API to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.46/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#create-or-modify-account">create or modify accounts</a> now accepts a <code>user_type</code> field, allowing for accounts to be set as belonging to bots or support staff.</li>
<li><a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.46/modules/password_auth_provider_callbacks.html">Password auth providers</a> can now be implemented using the new pluggable extension module APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.46.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/aaronraimist">aaronraimist</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AndrewFerr">AndrewFerr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Legogris">Legogris</a>.</p>
