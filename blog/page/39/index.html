            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve been looking for a way to have you own Matrix homeserver without having to run it yourself, you may be interested to hear that <a href="https://modular.im">Modular</a> (the Matrix hosting provider run by <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a>, the startup which hires many of the Matrix core team) is now offering a personal-sized small homeserver hosting service, supporting a minimum size of 5 user servers.</p>
<p>A lot of recent performance work on Synapse has been driven by the need to make smaller dedicated servers more efficient to run - and so if you run your own homeserver you‚Äôll be benefiting from all this work too :)  Meanwhile, if you choose to outsource your server hosting to Modular, you‚Äôll be indirectly supporting core Matrix and Synapse development, given most of the core Matrix team work for New Vector - it‚Äôs through buying services like this which lets us keep folks able to hack on Matrix as their day job.</p>
<p>See more details <a href="https://modular.im/personal-hosted-homeservers">over at the Modular blog post</a>!</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A bit of everything this week, we‚Äôve made changes to support the upcoming edits and reactions release, worked on soft log out, experimented with improving general perf for small homeservers, landed open tracing support, improved db query load.<br />
Next week we‚Äôll see about landing the small homeserver perf improvements, work on id hashing in sydent, fix some e2ee bugs (made easier to track down with OpenTracing), do some more database performance work and start gradually rolling out the new Sygnal instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p>Jason back on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix, <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">Construct</a> made the crazy-loading mode of client sync the default. Crazy-loading is an approach to initial sync that goes beyond lazy-loading for a better UX. It's even backwards compatible with clients that don't support lazy-loading.</p>
<p>Construct also made significant progress on implementing version 3 and 4 rooms during the week. This is nearly complete, and should be ready for testing by the weekend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good to know there is progress with new room versions as more and more rooms start to be moved over to v4. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#zemos-test:matrix.org">#zemos-test:matrix.org</a> for testing and more info.</p>
<h3 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we‚Äôve implemented profile retrieval over federation, single event retrieval, room tagging as well as host of bug fixes.<br />
Next week we‚Äôll be looking at state resolution and implementing our latest and greatest algorithm needed by modern room versions.</p>

<h3 id="this-week-in-ruma">This Week in Ruma</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jimmycuadra:matrix.org">Jimmy</a> provided <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/this-week-in-ruma-2019-07-07/">This Week in Ruma</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Work continues on the major revamp of ruma-events mentioned in the last update.<br />
...<br />
There are also a few modules that are somewhat blocked on an issue in ring. Some of the types in ruma-events contain types from ruma-signatures which don't implement Clone and PartialEq because they contain types from ring which don't.<br />
...<br />
Rust 1.36 was released, and it includes stabilization of the Future trait, one of the long-awaited building blocks for first-class async support in Rust. [...] the biggest reason for Ruma's development hiatus is waiting for async networking in Rust to mature, and this is one of the final pieces of foundational support we've been waiting for. The remaining pieces are async/await syntax, which is expected in either the next version or the one following it, and finally, waiting for important libraries like Hyper and Tokio, as well as web frameworks, to adopt the new stuff.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a>, <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient">libQuotient</a> gained support of .well-known - a very useful feature to connect to Modular-hosted homeservers!</p>
<p>Also, the first block of E2EE functionality from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aa13q:matrix.org">aa13q</a> has been merged to libQuotient master - so far it's just uploading the keys but receiving messages is already well in the works!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> v0.6.0 was released. Recent changes include bridging strikethrough, underline and nested formatting to telegram and some bug fixes, including one security fix. <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram/releases/tag/v0.6.0">Full changelog on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Debian 10 was also released recently, which means v0.6 is the last version with Python 3.5 support. Starting from v0.7.0, mautrix-telegram will only support Python 3.6 and up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> v0.6.0 also includes Native Matrix edit support, message editing between platforms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack">the slack bridge</a> has had another RC release this week 0.3.0-rc2 which has been deployed onto matrix.org :). In other news, we are nearly done with the port of the bridge to Typescript (slated for the 0.4 release) which has allowed us to clean up the codebase significantly and <strong>splat</strong> a lot of bugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm for any movement toward TypeScript - seems to be a winner in the JS-world. Says Half-Shot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm a bit fanatical about Typescript, it's objectively better to write things in TS than JS if you have the freedom to do so. It's also allowed us to keep the bug count down on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">Discord bridge</a>, so I'm starting to look at the other bridges for typescript support too.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="reliable-bridges-gsoc-project-mortar-board">Reliable Bridges GSoC project üéì</h3>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kai:nasnotfound.de">Kai</a> for this update!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new Spec proposal <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2162">MSC2162: Signaling Errors at Bridges</a> landed! It is about adding permanent errors: The ability of bridges to mark events as not delivered to all participants. While there is already code supporting the feature, the Spec process is important for getting everyone on board and finding potential problems with the current approach.</p>
<p>In spite of being a relatively small proposal, there were already a lot of suggestions and directions in which it can evolve. Shoutout and thanks to everyone who already contributed to it with their comments!</p>
<p>Meanwhile on the more practical front a <a href="https://github.com/V02460/matrix-react-sdk/tree/reliable_riot">fork of Riot Web</a> was extended to now support the actual visual display of bridge error markings on messages.</p>

<ul>
<li>We have released a beta version to the PlayStore on Thursday! You can download (and rate it) here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.riotx . Also feel free to join https://matrix.to/#/#riotx:matrix.org to provide any feedback!</li>
<li>You will find more details about what RiotX can (and cannot yet) do here: https://medium.com/@RiotChat/introducing-the-riotx-beta-for-android-b17952e8f771</li>
<li>Now we are working on fixing bugs, and keep going implementing the missing features</li>

<h3 id="spectral">Spectral</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a> supports .well-known now obviously. <em>see <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient">libQuotient</a> update above</em><br />
Also a lot of changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bubble shapes for pending events are fixed.</li>
<li>You can set device name when logging in. This becomes important as libQuotient begins to upload one-time device key as part of E2EE implementation.</li>
<li>Markdown is parsed automatically by default, and works with replies.</li>
<li>Small UI improvements in timeline and room list.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="continuum">Continuum</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uforia:matrix.org">yuforia</a> has continued work on <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/continuum-desktop">Continuum</a>, a desktop client written in Kotlin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continuum now preserves media content URI (mxc://) internally in order to treat them specially, instead of converting to all URI to http (or https) upon receiving.<br />
This week's version never considers cached mxc resources stale and no network request will be performed for refreshing.<br />
Continuum also loads previews for http image links in text messages automatically. The usual http cache control rules are still followed in those cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#tkmc:matrix.org">#tkmc:matrix.org</a> to chat more about Continuum, or about <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">koma</a>, the underlying library.</p>
<h3 id="riot-web">Riot Web</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Riot v1.3.0-rc.1 is now ready for testing at <a href="https://riot.im/staging">https://riot.im/staging</a>. This includes some last minute polish of reactions and edits, and also adds initial support for soft logout. This release will have reactions and message editing enabled via configuration on riot.im once it stabilises.<br />
Self-hosted installs that wish to do the same would need to alter their config.json in similar fashion. This is because these features currently depend on unstable APIs, and we don't want to move them out of labs and fully on by default until that is resolved.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="riot-ios">Riot iOS</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reactions and edits:
<ul>
<li>Enabled by default (no more LABS setting)</li>
<li>Reactions with non-unicode keys</li>
<li>Original event in the edit history (need homeserver update)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upgraded rooms are now autojoined when tapping on the upgraded banner</li>
<li>File upload from the room screen and from the share extension</li>
<li>Crypto: logs have been improved and a script has been created to help to debug e2e bugs (see the screenshot at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/pull/692">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/pull/692</a>)</li>
<li>This Friday TestFlight can be considered as a release candidate</li>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aaron:raim.ist">Aaron</a>'s frequent mention of <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/synapse_scripts">synapse-janitor</a> and other such cleanup methods, I've finally gotten inspired enough to give it a try.</p>
<p>The playbook now contains a new <strong>Synapse Maintenance</strong> documentation page and an easy/safe way to run <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/synapse_scripts">synapse-janitor</a>.</p>
<p>To give an example, using <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/synapse_scripts">synapse-janitor</a> and a full Postgres <code>VACUUM</code> yielded a 29% reduction in disk space used by Postgres on my personal homeserver (5.3GB -&gt; 3.8GB).</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@murz:ru-matrix.org">Alexey Murz Korepov</a> also reminded us about <a href="https://github.com/djmaze/synapse-purge">synapse-purge</a>, which we've mentioned here before - but is designed for a similar purpose.</p>

<p>the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/avhost/docker-matrix/tags">avhost/docker-matrix</a> image has moved to a debian buster base image, which got us an upgrade from python 3.5 to python 3.7.3 and jemalloc1 to jemalloc2, which should improve the performance of synapse.</p>

<p>I had/stole the idea to create a bot which uses message edits to send frames of an ASCII-art animation. I indeed created the bot, which works to a degree, but is quickly punished by rate-limiting, which limits the effectiveness. Still it's quite fun, you can <a href="https://github.com/benparsons/matrix-ascii-bot">check out the code here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>'s work on <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> is interesting for bot or other client devs, and there is a new guide available: <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-matrix-bot-sdk">http://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-matrix-bot-sdk</a></p>
<p>A few weeks ago I mentioned <a href="https://play.matrix.org/matrix-enact/">matrix-enact</a>, which uses Web Audio API to play back room history. There is a guide to how it was built, looking at the <code>/context</code> endpoint now available: <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/creating-a-simple-read-only-matrix-client">https://matrix.org/docs/guides/creating-a-simple-read-only-matrix-client</a></p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> made a cool-looking thing: &quot;It basically shows all pictures in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">this room</a> in a waterfall, with 'infinite scroll'&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/04/synapse-1-1-0-released">shipped v1.1.0</a>, which provides an overhaul of docker configuration, more authentication options and improved db io. It‚Äôs worth noting that v1.1.0 is the first Synapse release to drop support for Python 2 (and Postgres 9.4), this paves the way for using Python 3 only functionality.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve been working on supporting soft logout, more edits and reactions support, open tracing support not to mention a complete rewrite of the push server Sygnal. We‚Äôll be rolling out new Sygnal gradually over the next week or two.</p>
<p>Finally, aided by dropping Python 2 support, we‚Äôve been putting in a bunch of work to improve Synapse in resource constrained environments. This will be a constant theme over the coming months.</p>

<p>A Python module meant to act as a base class for a Matrix bot.<br />
The MatrixBot class will connect to the Matrix server, start a listener on each joined room, and listen for room invites from other users.

<ul>
<li>Make api calls suspendable functions (which are like Kotlin's flavor of async). This way, the caller don't need to worry about forgetting to call await or a coroutine being left unstarted.</li>
<li>Borrowing from functional programming, model the outcome of a call as a discriminated union, which can be either a success or a failure. The successful case is optimized with inline classes, an experimental feature in Kotlin 1.3, and wrapping is avoided.</li>
<li>Make MatrixError a subclass of HttpError, because the http status code can be handy</li>

            <p>Right folks, this is our first post 1.0 release, which means that we have now
officially <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/04/08/synapse-deprecating-postgres-9-4-and-python-2-x">dropped support for Python 2 and Postgres
9.4</a>.
This means that we can start making use of Python 3 specific features and you
should expect lots of associated performance wins over the coming months. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v110">upgrade notes</a> for more.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.1.0 also contains a reworked approach to the Docker image, as well lots
of performance improvements with special focus on DB IO - expect more to come
in this area.</p>
<p>Special thanks to community member <a href="https://github.com/galexrt">Alexander
Trost</a> for rounding out  our SAML support and also
to <a href="https://github.com/dhoffend">Daniel Hoffend</a> for contributing the ability
to disable local password authentication.</p>

See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v110">upgrade notes</a> for more details.</p>
<p>This release also deprecates the use of environment variables to configure the

<p>As of v1.1.0, Synapse no longer supports Python 2, nor Postgres version 9.4.
See the <a href="https://matrix.turbo.fish/blog/2019/07/04/synapse-1-1-0-released/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v110">upgrade notes</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added possibility to disable local password authentication. Contributed by Daniel Hoffend. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5092">#5092</a>)</li>
<li>Add monthly active users to phonehome stats. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5252">#5252</a>)</li>
<li>Allow expired user to trigger renewal email sending manually. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5363">#5363</a>)</li>
<li>Statistics on forward extremities per room are now exposed via Prometheus. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5384">#5384</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5458">#5458</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5461">#5461</a>)</li>
<li>Add --no-daemonize option to run synapse in the foreground, per issue #4130. Contributed by Soham Gumaste. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5412">#5412</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5587">#5587</a>)</li>
<li>Fully support SAML2 authentication. Contributed by <a href="https://github.com/galexrt">Alexander Trost</a> - thank you! (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5422">#5422</a>)</li>
<li>Allow server admins to define implementations of extra rules for allowing or denying incoming events. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5440">#5440</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5474">#5474</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5477">#5477</a>)</li>
<li>Add support for handling pagination APIs on client reader worker. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5505">#5505</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5513">#5513</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5531">#5531</a>)</li>
<li>Improve help and cmdline option names for --generate-config options. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5512">#5512</a>)</li>
<li>Allow configuration of the path used for ACME account keys. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5516">#5516</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5521">#5521</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5522">#5522</a>)</li>
<li>Add --data-dir and --open-private-ports options. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5524">#5524</a>)</li>
<li>Split public rooms directory auth config in two settings, in order to manage client auth independently from the federation part of it. Obsoletes the &quot;restrict_public_rooms_to_local_users&quot; configuration setting. If &quot;restrict_public_rooms_to_local_users&quot; is set in the config, Synapse will act as if both new options are enabled, i.e. require authentication through the client API and deny federation requests. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5534">#5534</a>)</li>
<li>The minimum TLS version used for outgoing federation requests can now be set with <code>federation_client_minimum_tls_version</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5550">#5550</a>)</li>

            <p><em>Canonical version of this article at <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-matrix-nio">https://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-matrix-nio</a></em></p>
<p>This article concerns <a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">asyncio</a>. We'll build a simple &quot;echo bot&quot;, meaning a bot which replies to messages with the text it has just read. Note that this article does not cover E2EE with matrix-nio.</p>
<h2 id="instantiation-and-login">Instantiation and Login</h2>
<p>First create a new venv, and install matrix-nio via <code>pip</code>. On the command line, run:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span>python3 -m venv env
</span><span>source env/bin/activate
</span><span>pip install matrix-nio
</span></code></pre>
<p>Next, create a new Python file, and open it for editing. We'll import everything we require for this tutorial:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">from </span><span>importlib </span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>util
</span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>asyncio
</span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">from </span><span>nio </span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>(AsyncClient, SyncResponse, RoomMessageText)
</span></code></pre>
<p>We're importing asyncio so we can use the <code>AsyncClient</code> class from matrix-nio.</p>
<p>Create a new instance of <code>AsyncClient</code> by passing the homeserver and username as arguments:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>async_client = AsyncClient(
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;https://matrix.org&quot;</span><span>, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">YOUR-USERNAME-HERE</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;
</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Then login, and await the response:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.login(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span>)
</span><span>print(response)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Of course, we are using an async client, and awaiting the response. Because of this, we must call the <code>async_client.login()</code> from an async method, like so:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">async def </span><span>main():
</span><span>    response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.login(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span>)
</span><span>    print(response)
</span><span>
</span><span>asyncio.run(main())
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that for versions of Python before 3.7 the asyncio syntax must be:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">async def </span><span>main():
</span><span>    response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.login(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span>)
</span><span>    print(response)
</span><span>
</span><span>loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
</span><span>loop.run_until_complete(main())
</span></code></pre>
<p>The remainder of this tutorial assumes you are running everything from an <code>async</code> method.</p>
<p>The response string should look like:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span>Logged in as @pyconweb-bot:matrix.org, device id: ZBLAJHLKVP.
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="get-into-a-sync-loop">Get into a <code>/sync</code> loop</h2>
<p>To get updates from a Matrix homeserver to the client, the client makes a request to the <code>/sync</code> endpoint. In the matrix-nio AsyncClient, this is wrapped by the <code>sync()</code> method. We can get the latest updates:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>sync_response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.sync(</span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">30000</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>30000 means we will wait up to 30 seconds before returning. <code>sync_response</code> will now contain a Python object containing a mapping of the (JSON) <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#get-matrix-client-r0-sync">response from the Matrix homeserver</a>. We'll inspect this response in the next section.</p>
<p>In fact, we expect there to be updates regularly, so let's create a very simple loop:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">while </span><span>(</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">True</span><span>):
</span><span>    sync_response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.sync(</span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">30000</span><span>)
</span><span>    print(sync_response) </span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># note that this could be LARGE!
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># do some reading from sync_response
</span></code></pre>
<p>In this way, every time there is a response (i.e. new events) from the homeserver, they are made available in <code>sync_response</code> for processing, and we loop again.</p>
<h2 id="explore-the-sync-response-object">Explore the sync response object</h2>
<p><code>sync_response</code> <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#get-matrix-client-r0-sync">can contain multitudes</a>, depending on the rooms this user is part of, or has been part of. <code>sync_response.rooms.join</code> contains updates for the rooms which the current user is &quot;joined to&quot; (meaning, is a member of.)</p>
<p>Of these joined rooms, we are (perhaps!) most interested in the events on the timeline. These are stored in <code>timeline.events</code>, see below:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">if </span><span>len(sync_response.rooms.join) &gt; </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">0</span><span>:
</span><span>
</span><span>    joins = sync_response.rooms.join
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">for </span><span>room_id </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">in </span><span>joins:
</span><span>        </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">for </span><span>event </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">in </span><span>joins[room_id].timeline.events:
</span><span>            print(event)
</span></code></pre>
<p><em>Message events</em> are a specific type of event which contain an Instant Messenger message. We can check the type before proceeding:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">for </span><span>event </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">in </span><span>joins[room_id].timeline.events:
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">if </span><span>isinstance(event, RoomMessageText):
</span><span>        print (event.body)
</span></code></pre>
<p>In these cases, where the event is a message to a room, the <code>body</code> field will contain the message text.</p>
<h2 id="isolate-specific-message-event-objects">Isolate specific message event objects</h2>
<p>Knowing that we can get the message text from an event, we can read it to determine a response. Let's make a new variable and have it store some string we'll check for:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>response_string = </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;!replybot&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now let's suppose we're in our <code>/sync</code> loop, and just received an event. We can filter messages that are meant for our bot as follows:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">if </span><span>len(sync_response.rooms.join) &gt; </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">0</span><span>:
</span><span>    joins = sync_response.rooms.join
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">for </span><span>room_id </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">in </span><span>joins:
</span><span>        </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">for </span><span>event </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">in </span><span>joins[room_id].timeline.events:
</span><span>            </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">if </span><span>hasattr(event, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&#39;body&#39;</span><span>) </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">and </span><span>event.body.startswith(response_string):
</span><span>                print(event)
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="use-room-send">Use <code>room_send</code></h2>
<p>To send messages, matrix-nio provides a <code>room_send()</code> method. There are three arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>the room_id</li>
<li>the message type, we will use &quot;m.room.message&quot;</li>
<li>a JSON object representing the content of the message</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's improve the example above, by sending back a message to echo the ones we isolated above:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>joins = sync_response.rooms.join
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">for </span><span>room_id </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">in </span><span>joins:
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">for </span><span>event </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">in </span><span>joins[room_id].timeline.events:
</span><span>        </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">if </span><span>hasattr(event, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&#39;body&#39;</span><span>) </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">and </span><span>event.body.startswith(response_string):
</span><span>            response_body = event.body.replace(response_string, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;&quot;</span><span>).strip()
</span><span>            content = {
</span><span>               </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;body&quot;</span><span>: response_body,
</span><span>               </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;msgtype&quot;</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;m.text&quot;
</span><span>            }
</span><span>            </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.room_send(room_id, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&#39;m.room.message&#39;</span><span>, content)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now whenever the bot receives a message &quot;!replybot <em>some message</em>&quot; it will send back &quot;some message&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-sync-next-batch-tokens">Use of /sync next_batch tokens</h2>
<p>Finally, let's consider the importance of <code>next_batch</code> tokens. Whenever you receive a response from the <code>/sync</code> endpoint, the response will contain a &quot;next_batch&quot; field, which you then pass on the next request to ensure you have the latest messages. matrix-nio keeps track of this automatically, so it doesn't get repeated messages. However, when you stop the program and call the <code>.sync()</code> method again, how can you tell it where to start from? First let's get the latest <code>next_batch</code> token:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">async def </span><span>main():
</span><span>    response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.login(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">YOUR-USERNAME-HERE</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span>, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;&quot;</span><span>)
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">while </span><span>(</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">True</span><span>):
</span><span>        sync_response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.sync(</span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">30000</span><span>)
</span><span>        print(sync_response.next_batch) </span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># this is the token
</span></code></pre>
<p>Then we'll write the token to a file:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">async def </span><span>main():
</span><span>    response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.login(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">YOUR-USERNAME-HERE</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span>, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;&quot;</span><span>)
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">while </span><span>(</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">True</span><span>):
</span><span>        sync_response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.sync(</span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">30000</span><span>)
</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># we write the token to a file here
</span><span>        </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">with </span><span>open(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;next_batch&quot;</span><span>,</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;w&quot;</span><span>) </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">as </span><span>next_batch_token:
</span><span>            next_batch_token.write(sync_response.next_batch)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Once that token is written, we know we can re-use it for the first <code>/sync/</code> request next time:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">async def </span><span>main():

</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># we read the previously-written token...

</span><span>        async_client.next_batch = next_batch_token.read()
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">while </span><span>(</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">True</span><span>):

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With this, you can see that in very few lines, it's possible to write a working Matrix bot in Python, using <a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a>.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>A few weeks ago there was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20178267">some
discussion</a> around the privacy
of typical Matrix configurations, particularly how Riot's default config uses
vector.im as an Identity Server (for discovering users on Matrix by their email
address or phone number) and scalar.vector.im as an Integration Manager (i.e.
the mechanism for adding hosted bots/bridges/widgets into rooms). This means
that Riot, even if using a custom homeserver and running from a custom Riot
deployment, will try to talk to *.vector.im (run  by New Vector; the company formed by the core
Matrix team in 2017) for some operations unless an alternative IS or IM has
been specified in the config.</p>
<p>We haven't done as good a job at explaining this as we could have, and this
blog post is a progress update on how we're fixing that and improving other
privacy considerations in general.</p>
<p>Firstly, the reason Riot is configured like this is for the user's convenience:
in general, we believe most users just want to discover other people on Matrix
as easily as possible, and a logically-centralised server for looking up user
matrix IDs by email/phone number (called third party IDs, or 3PIDs) is the only
comprehensive way of doing so.  Decentralising this data while protecting the
privacy of the 3PIDs and their matrix IDs is a Hard Problem which we're unaware
of anyone having solved yet.  Alternatively, you could run a local identity
server, but it will end up having to delegate to a centralised identity server
anyway for IDs it has no other way to know about. Similarly, providing a
default integration server that just works out of the box (rather than
mandating the user configures their own) is a matter of trying to keep Riot's
UX simple, especially when onboarding users, and especially given Riot's
reputation for complexity at the best of times.</p>
<p>That said, the discussion highlighted some areas for improvement.
Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>When doing work on making Matrix <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix">GDPR
compliant</a>
back in May 2018, we set up a single <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/policies/blob/master/docs/matrix-org/privacy_notice.md">privacy
policy</a>
for the services we run, and got users to agree to it by locking them out of
the matrix.org homeserver until they did.  However, we missed that users not
on the matrix.org homeserver might still be using our Identity Service (IS)
&amp; Integration Manager (IM) without accepting the privacy policy.  Over the
last few weeks we've been working on addressing this - it turns out that
it's a pain to fix, given the Identity Service doesn't have the concept of
users, so tracking which users have agreed to the policy policy or not means
some fairly major changes. The current proposal is to change the Identity
Service to use a form of OpenID to authenticate users against their
homeserver in order to check they've accepted the IS's terms of use - see
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2140">MSC2140</a> for the gory
details.</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, Riot is being updated to prompt the user to accept the IS &amp; IM terms
of use (if different to the HS's), and thus make it crystal clear to the user
that they are using an IS &amp; IM and that they have the option not to if desired - see https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/10167 and associated
<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+label%3Ap1+label%3Aprivacy+label%3Aphase%3A1+identity">issues</a>.
This includes also explicitly prompting the user as to whether they want
3PIDs they provide at registration to be discoverable, as per
https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/10091.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Riot on iOS &amp; Android gives the option of scanning your local addressbook to
discover which of your contacts are on Matrix.  The wording explaining this
wasn't clear enough on Android - which we <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20181515">promptly
fixed</a>.  Separately, the
contact details sent to the server are currently not obfuscated.  This is
partially because we hadn't got to it, and partially because obfuscating
them doesn't actually help much with privacy, given an attacker can just
scan through possible obfuscated phone numbers and email addresses to
deobfuscate them.  However, we've been working through obfuscating the
contact details anyway by hashing as per
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2134">MSC2134</a>, which has all
the details.  We're also adding an explicit lookup warning in Riot/Web, as
per https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/10093.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a bug where Riot/Web was querying the Integration Manager every
time you opened a room, even if that room had no integrations (actually, it
did it 3 times in a row).  This got <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3115">fixed and
released</a> in
Riot/Web 1.2.2 back on June 19th.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matrix needs to authenticate whether events were actually sent by the server
that claimed to send them.  We do this by having servers sign their events
when they create them, and publishing the public half of their signing keys
for anyone to query.  However, this poses problems if you receive an event
which is signed by a server which isn't currently online.  To solve this, we
have the concept of <code>trusted_key_servers</code> (aka notary servers), which your
server can query to see if they know about the missing server's keys.  By
default, matrix.org is configured as Synapse's trusted notary, but you can
of course change this. If you choose an unreliable server as the notary
(e.g. by not setting one at all) then there's a risk that you won't be able
to look up signing keys, and a splitbrain will result where your server
can't receive certain events, but other servers in the room can.  This can
then result in your server being unable to participate in the room entirely,
if it's missing key events in the room's lifetime.</p>
<p>Our plan here is to get rid of notaries entirely by changing how event
signing works as per
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1228">MSC1228</a>, but this is
going to take a while.  Meanwhile we're going to check Synapse's code to
ensure it doesn't talk to the notary server unnecessarily.  (E.g. it should
be caching the signing keys locally, and it should only use the notary
server if the remote server is down.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When doing VoIP in Matrix, clients need to use a TURN server to discover
their network conditions and perform firewall traversal.  The TURN server
should be specified by your homeserver (and each homeserver deployment
should ideally include a TURN server).  However, for users who have not
configured a TURN server, Riot (on all 3 platforms) defaulted to use
Google's public STUN service (<code>stun.l.google.com</code>).  STUN is a subset of
TURN which provides firewall discovery, but not traffic relaying.  This
slightly increased the chances of calls working for users without a proper
TURN server, but not by much - and rather than fall back to Google, we've
decided to simply remove it from Riot (e.g.
https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/commit/24832a2b14fb72ae6f051d5aba40262d11eef65d).
This means that VoIP might get less reliable for users who were relying on
this fallback, but you really should be running your own TURN server anyway
if you want VoIP to work reliably on your homeserver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We should make it clearer in Riot that device names are world-readable, and
not just for the user's own personal reference. This is
https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/10216</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, much of the work on improving these issues is still in full
swing, although some has already shipped.  As should also be obvious, these
issues are categorically not malicious: Matrix (and Riot) literally exists to give users full control and autonomy over their communication, and privacy is a key part of that. These are avoidable issues which can and will be solved.  It's worth noting that we have to prioritise privacy issues alongside all the other development in Matrix however: there's no point in having excellent privacy if there are other bugs stopping the platform from being usable.</p>
<p>We'll do another blog post to confirm once most of the fixes here have landed -
meanwhile, hopefully this post provides some useful visibility on how we're
going about improving things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With 1.0 shipped we are now starting to take a closer look at Synapse performance more generally and this will be a theme for us over the coming months. We want to improve not only large scale deployments such as Matrix.org but also optimise for smaller instances.</p>
<p>You may have seen a few trial servers run by core team members in matrix.org community rooms popping up and this is a precursor for a broader effort to make synapse more manageable on less powerful infrastructure. My own instance has been sat at a pretty steady 256MB of RAM.</p>
<p>Other than that, based on 1.0 feedback, we have been working on improving the Synapse upgrade path and expect to put out a new release next week containing the tweaks. Specifically this means improving configuration for Docker installs, and configuration management for sending emails.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre also implementing open tracing into Synapse, initially to help with e2ee debugging, but it will make tracking down strange behaviour easier more generally.</p>
<p>Finally we‚Äôre bringing our push server Sygnal kicking and screaming into 2019 and will upgrade to Python 3, drop gevent for twisted and update our vendor specific libraries, not mention improving the monitoring and alerting. We‚Äôll also add in open tracing which will help hunt down push failures.</p>
<p>Finally finally, look out for a DAG visualisation tool written by GSOCer Eisha referenced elsewhere in TWIM  - we consider this to be seriously cool, and can‚Äôt wait to start using it in anger.</p>
<p>Note: 1.0 is the last release to support python 2 and postgres 9.4, the next Synapse release will drop support for both, see <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/04/08/synapse-deprecating-postgres-9-4-and-python-2-x">https://matrix.org/blog/2019/04/08/synapse-deprecating-postgres-9-4-and-python-2-x</a> for more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week was spent working on a big revamp of <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events">ruma-events</a>, the library that defines Rust types for the &quot;events&quot; used in Matrix.
After some discussion in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a>, I decided to make a move towards treating ruma-events as a higher-level library. Previously, ruma-events has more or less offered Rust types that are exact representations of the JSON structures used by Matrix. However, by representing events this way, it would be possible for users to easily create values that, while valid JSON, would be invalid events according to the specification.
The way we're approaching this problem is by separating serialization/deserialization of JSON from validation of events.</p>

<h3 id="gsoc-project-matrix-visualisations-mortar-board">GSOC project: Matrix Visualisations üéì</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@eisha:matrix.org">Eisha</a> appeared with this terrific GSOC update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The GSoC project ‚ÄúMatrix Visualisations‚Äù has made good progress during this first period:</p>
<ul>
<li>The implementation of the CS API backend has been completed to properly retrieve events from a room in real time.</li>
<li>Many features have been added to the UI, here are some of them:
<ul>
<li>The DAG is displayed vertically, every node of the same ‚Äúdepth‚Äù are on the same level in the graph and each node has outgoing arcs for each of its previous events (if they have already been retrieved).</li>
<li>The node at the top of the DAG allows to fetch earlier events by selecting it.</li>
<li>Each node can have two different colors whether its ‚Äúorigin‚Äù is the HS the application is currently talking to or not.</li>
<li>The full JSON body of an event can be displayed by double clicking on its node.</li>
<li>It is possible to select which fields of the events will be directly included in the labels of the nodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A (server-side) backend has been implemented so that the application can directly talk to the PostgreSQL database of Synapse. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend">this repo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the support of the Federation API has been postponed so I could work on this Synapse database backend.
The UI of the application isn‚Äôt very beautiful or well-organised yet, as the effort is focused on the backends and core functionalities for now, but improvements will be made once these functionalities will be completed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/koma-im/continuum-desktop">continuum</a> tweaked the appearance of placeholder avatars. To make most users appear visually distinct, continuum has always used colors based on checksums and usernames to generate placeholders if any user doesn't have an image as avatar. In previous versions, it always used two characters of the name. In the new version, if the username contains ideographic (usually east-asian) characters, a single character would be used. The reason is that the number of ideographic characters is vast and duplicates are less common, and most of them are close to a square or circle in shape so a single one would fit the GUI component better.</p>

<h3 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h3>
<p>We have a whole lot of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a> news this week! First, from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>, on the Matrix team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Progress has been picking up this week with some of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cnly:matrix.org">Cnly</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pulls/Cnly">many</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib/pulls/Cnly">PRs</a> finally getting merged! <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cnly:matrix.org">Cnly</a> is our resident <a href="https://www.matrix.org/blog/2019/05/07/welcome-to-the-2019-g-so-c-participants">Google Summer of Code</a> student this Summer and has been making strides ever since. We also finally fully migrated to BuildKite for Continuous Integration (which is much quicker than TravisCI) and have implemented golangci-lint as the project‚Äôs opinionated linter (catching some bugs in the process).</p>
<p>As part of CI, we‚Äôve set up <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/">Sytest</a> for Dendrite, which grants us a loose method of keeping track of progress as we go along. Currently the only way to do so is to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/testfile">testfile</a> which holds all the tests we know Dendrite to be passing, and cross-referencing that with the list of all sytests (which isn‚Äôt actually available anywhere). We‚Äôre hoping to make some nice way of visualizing progress over time with this data (and possibly break it down into Federation/Client/Application Service categories), but this will take some time.</p>
<p>We‚Äôd also like to thank some new contributors that have shown up since Matrix 1.0‚Äôs release. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jump_spider:matrix.spider.ink">serra-allgood</a> contributed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/702">a fix</a> for querying aliases when using at least one application service, while <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@drglitch:matrix.org">DrGlitchMX</a> sent a PR in for some database fixes. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@peekay_46:matrix.org">SUMUKHA-PK</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/694">PR</a> to add room tags is still around and should see some love very shortly.</p>
<p>As far as the current goals of the project, we‚Äôre looking to primarily make Dendrite federate with Synapse, which will allow it to actually be usable for testing/basic day-to-day usage. We intend to have it done so in the next few months, so stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cnly:matrix.org">Cnly</a>, who is doing GSOCüéì on Dendrite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Dendrite, the first phase of GSoC has primarily seen improvements for the existing code including bug fixes, refinements for testing, and some refactoring that prepares Dendrite for later feature implementation. Among the changes, two important ones will be the initial support for EDUs in /sync responses as well as a federation destination cache that allows for more effective federation.</p>
<p>In the next phase, more focus will be put into feature completion, mainly for the Client/Server API component. Since this part of work covers various still-under-construction areas in Dendrite, it is foreseeable that more progress will actually be made than proposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ruma">Ruma</h3>
<p>This Week in Ruma: <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/this-week-in-ruma-2019-06-16/">https://www.ruma.io/news/this-week-in-ruma-2019-06-16/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Work is underway to bring Ruma up to date with version r0.5.0 of the Matrix specification. Starting with the most foundational libraries and working up towards the higher-level ruma-client, this work should be done in the next week or two. The bulk of the work since the last update has been on ruma-events, adding all of the events that were previously missing, and doing a full pass through existing events to make sure our definitions match the specification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can't wait to see more updates out of Ruma!</p>

<h3 id="matrix-appservice-discord-0-5-1">matrix-appservice-discord 0.5.1</h3>
<p>This announcement is nearly a week old from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>, coming in right after the previous TWIM was published:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've released v0.5.1 of the discord bridge today. It's mostly comprised of small bugfixes and features, but contains metrics support for tracking performance on the bridge. <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/releases/tag/0.5.1">https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/releases/tag/0.5.1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mautrix-telegram got some bugs fixed and minor features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated to <a href="https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/compare/v1.8.0...master">Telethon 1.8</a></li>
<li>Option to limit maximum document size when bridging so it wouldn't download 1.5gb files and run out of ram</li>
<li>Made the state cache get updated when sending state events. Not doing this was causing some problems on t2bot.io, which has disabled echoing state events (probably for performance reasons)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="reliable-bridges-gsoc-mortar-board"><em>Reliable Bridges</em> GSOC üéì</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kai:nasnotfound.de">Kai</a> is working on bridging in Matrix, mentored by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first phase of GSoC is nearing its end and progress has been made on the <em>Reliable Bridges</em> project.<br />
The main focus of the work was on delivering a running implementation for the signaling of permanent errors. Work has been done on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> together with <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</a>. An internal version of the Discord bridge with the new feature is already running and the related <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/pull/111">PR for the bridge SDK</a> is in the state of being completed.<br />
The next phase of GSOC comes with new goals. First, the preparation of a MSC for the signaling of bridge errors, so that the feature can be discussed in the community and can become a part of The Spec. The second goal will be the modification of Riot Web, so that the user is notified when an error condition occurred.<br />
There also has been a slight change of plan: The work on notifying clients when parts of the system are temporarily unavailable needs reconsideration as not even the core Matrix network itself has this capability. The way forward here should probably be a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2094">unified solution</a>.</p>

<h3 id="new-typescript-puppeting-lib-mx-puppet-bridge">New TypeScript puppeting lib: mx-puppet-bridge</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Soru</a>, who you probably know from her work on <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/">matrix-appservice-discord</a>, has started a new library:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soru started working on a new puppeting library, for a lack of a better name it is currently called <a href="https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-bridge">mx-puppet-bridge</a>.<br />
Unlike the existing puppet bridge, the focus of this one is to handle multiple users at once, all dynamically without needing to edit the configuration file over and over. Additionally the new codebase results in quite a few things smoothened out for easier protocol implementations.<br />
Furthermore mx-puppet-bridge is written in typescript and based on travis' <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a>.<br />
As protocol implementation for testing, soru also wrote <a href="https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-slack">mx-puppet-slack</a> (again, for the lack of a better name). Basic message sending in both directions is already fully functional.</p>

<p>Exciting stuff! And all the more so for the third-person announcement style!</p>

<h3 id="gomuks">gomuks</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gomuks had a bunch of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for rendering redactions and edits (rendering reactions coming up next)</li>
<li>Added commands to create rooms, start private chats and edit room tags</li>
<li>Rendered images now don't take up the whole width</li>
<li>Improved memory usage slightly</li>
<li>Broke everyones existing caches (<code>rm -rf ~/.cache/gomuks</code> should help if it panics at startup)</li>
</ul>
<p>The command for creating rooms and the image resolution limit were added by a new contributor, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jrswab:matrix.org">J. R.</a>, who is currently working on adding .well-known discovery support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been having a good play with this and like it at lot!</p>

<h3 id="continuum-javafx-client">continuum, JavaFX client</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uforia:matrix.org">yuforia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Improved support for more types of events in
<a href="https://github.com/koma-im/continuum-desktop">continuum</a> this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>invitation events are supported</li>
<li>support for events that typically appear when a room is being set up is in progress</li>
<li>events that are not yet supported are displayed with a fallback view. Blank rows in previous versions are now fixed. You could always right-click on any event to view the source, of course</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pattle-dart-client">Pattle, Dart client</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:pattle.im">Wilko</a> came in with this thorough update, <a href="https://pattle.im/">Pattle</a> development is MOTORING:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version of Pattle has been pushed to F-droid!</p>
<p>This release is mostly focused on bug fixing and bug reporting! This is why I urge <strong>all users who have been having problems before to try Pattle again!</strong> Chances are that your problem has been fixed, and if not, it will be reported with more information so I can fix it!</p>
<p>When an error is reported, this data is sent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating system version</li>
<li>Device model, brand, manufacturer and whether it's a simulator</li>
<li>A unique ID based on your device</li>
</ul>
<p>In some errors the homeserver domain is logged, I will try to prevent this in the future.</p>
<p>This release also includes preparation for an iOS release next week!</p>
<p>Fixes and other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle rooms that the user has left (a notice is shown that you can't send any messages)</li>
<li>Show a date header above the chat creation event (not the first known event in the list as before)</li>
<li>When an error occurs during sync, show a message, including the Exception name</li>
<li>Fix replies causing an error if the <code>formattedBody</code> does not adhere to the spec (thanks to Mathieu!)</li>
<li>Fix errors not showing when logging in</li>
<li>Fix loading spinner showing when checking username or logging in even if loading took less than 3 seconds</li>
<li>Fix direct chats not detected when adder after the initial sync</li>
<li>Some general syncing issues have been fixed (causing the dreaded infinite loading spinner).</li>
</ul>
<p>To install this release, add the following repo in F-droid:</p>
<p><a href="https://fdroid.pattle.im/?fingerprint=E91F63CA6AE04F8E7EA53E52242EAF8779559209B8A342F152F9E7265E3EA729">https://fdroid.pattle.im/?fingerprint=E91F63CA6AE04F8E7EA53E52242EAF8779559209B8A342F152F9E7265E3EA729</a></p>
<p>And install 'Pattle'.</p>
<p>Or <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app/releases">download the APK</a>.</p>
<p>If you stumble upon any issues, <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app/issues">please report them</a>!<br />
You can <a href="https://git.pattle.im/users/sign_in">login via GitHub and Gitlab.com</a>, so it's really easy to do! (Logging in via GitHub did not seem to work previously, but it will now!)</p>
<p>Follow development here: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#app:pattle.im">#app:pattle.im</a>!</p>
<p>If you would like to support me, you can now do so via <a href="https://liberapay.com/wilko/">Liberapay</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/pattle_app">Patreon</a>. I actually need money for the Apple Developer program, which costs 100 euros per year to release Pattle on the App Store and Testflight.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-1-0">Matrix 1.0</h2>
<p>The big news this week is that we declared ourselves to be out of beta. You'll want the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation">full post</a> for all details, but here's a taste:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are very excited to announce the first fully stable release of the Matrix protocol and specification across all APIs - as well as the Synapse 1.0 reference implementation which implements the full Matrix 1.0 API surface.</p>
<p>This means that after just over 5 years since the initial work on Matrix began, we are proud to have finally exited beta!! This is the conclusion of the work which we announced at <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019">FOSDEM 2019</a> when we cut the first stable release of the Server-Server API and began the Synapse 0.99 release series in anticipation of releasing a 1.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of the 1.0 we also announced the Matrix.org Foundation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the full update on the Foundation, please check out the new website content at <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">https://matrix.org/foundation</a> which should tell you everything you could possibly want to know about the Foundation, the Guardians, the Foundation‚Äôs legal Articles of Association, and the day-to-day Rules which define the Open Governance process.</p>

<p>We released Synapse 1.0.0 this week to coincide with Matrix 1.0. As a release Synapse 1.0.0 focuses on security and stability which in turn builds a firm foundation for the performance improvements that you can expect to see over the Summer. Read all about it <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/synapse-1-0-0-released">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="crypto">Crypto</h2>
<p>We have not one but two working end to end demos of device cross signing! This is going to be huge and is key step towards being able to make Matrix e2ee by default.</p>
<p>Cross Signing Demo</p>

            <h2 id="matrix-1-0">Matrix 1.0</h2>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We are very excited to announce the first fully stable release of the Matrix protocol and specification across **all **APIs - as well as the Synapse 1.0 reference implementation which implements the full Matrix 1.0 API surface.</p>
<p>This means that after just over 5 years since the initial work on Matrix began, we are proud to have finally <strong>exited beta</strong>!!  This is the conclusion of the work which we announced at <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019">FOSDEM 2019</a> when we cut the first stable release of the Server-Server API and began the Synapse 0.99 release series in anticipation of releasing a 1.0.</p>
<p>Now, before you get too excited, it‚Äôs critical to understand that Matrix 1.0 is all about providing a <strong>stable, self-consistent, self-contained and secure version of the standard</strong> which anyone should be able to use to independently implement production-grade Matrix clients, servers, bots and bridges etc.  It does <strong>not</strong> mean that all planned or possible features in Matrix are now specified and implemented, but that the most important core of the protocol is a well-defined stable platform for everyone to build on.</p>
<p>On the Synapse side, our focus has been exclusively on ensuring that Synapse correctly implements Matrix 1.0, to provide a stable and secure basis for participating in Matrix without risk of room corruption or other nastinesses.  However, we have deliberately <strong>not</strong> focused on performance or features in the 1.0 release - so I‚Äôm afraid that synapse‚Äôs RAM footprint will not have got significantly better, and your favourite long-awaited features (automatically defragmenting rooms with lots of forward extremities, configurable message retention, admin management web-interface etc) have not yet landed.  In other words, this is the opposite of the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/the-big-1-0-68fa7c6050be">Riot 1.0 release</a> (where the entire app was redesigned and radically improved its performance and UX) - instead, we have adopted the mantra to <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast">make it work, make it work right, and then (finally) make it fast</a>.  You can read the <a href="/blog/2019/06/11/synapse-1-0-0-released">full release notes</a> here.  It‚Äôs also worth looking at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.0.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> through the Synapse 0.99 release series to see the massive amount of polishing that‚Äôs been going on here.</p>
<p>All this means that the main headline features which land in Matrix 1.0 are vitally important but relatively dry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using X.509 certificates to trust servers rather than perspective notaries, to simplify and improve server-side trust.  This is a <strong>breaking change</strong> across Matrix, and we‚Äôve given the community several months now to ensure their homeservers run a valid TLS certificate.  See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">MSC1711</a> for full details, and the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/05/24/final-countdown-to-1-0">2 week warning</a> we gave.  As of ~9am UTC today, the matrix.org homeserver is running Synapse 1.0 and enforcing valid TLS certificates - the transition has begun (and so far we haven‚Äôt spotted any major breakage :).  Thank you to everyone who <a href="https://arewereadyyet.com">got ready</a> in advance!</li>
<li>Using .well-known URIs to discover servers, in case you can‚Äôt get a valid TLS certificate for your server‚Äôs domain.</li>
<li>Switching to <strong><a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v4.html">room version 4</a> by default</strong> for creating new rooms.  This fixes the most important defects that the core room algorithm has historically encountered, particularly:
<ul>
<li>The new State Resolution algorithm to fix the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2432">Hotel California bug</a> and many others: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">State Resolution Reloaded</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1659">Collision resistant event IDs</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Specifying the ability to upgrade between room versions</li>
<li>Full specification of lazy loading room members</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1267">Short Authentication String</a> (Emoji!) interactive verification of E2EE devices</li>
<li>...and lots and lots and lots of bugfixes and spec omission fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, there is a <em>lot</em> of really exciting stuff in flight right now which sadly didn‚Äôt stabilise in time for Matrix 1.0, but will be landing as fast as we can finalise it now that 1.0 is at last out the door.  This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editable messages!  (These are in Synapse 1.0 and Riot already, but still stabilising so not enabled by default)</li>
<li>Reactions! (Similarly these are in develop)</li>
<li>Threading!! (We‚Äôve planted the seeds for this in the new ‚Äòaggregations‚Äô support which powers edits &amp; reactions - but full thread support is still a bit further out).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/uhoreg/matrix-doc/blob/cross-signing2/proposals/1756-cross-signing.md">Cross-signed verification for end-to-end encryption</a> (This is on a branch, but due to land any day now).  We‚Äôve also held off merging E2E backups into the Matrix 1.0 spec until cross-signing lands, given it may change the backup behaviour a bit.  Once this is done, we can seriously talk about turning on E2E by default everywhere.</li>
<li>Live-tracking of room statistics and state in Synapse!  (This is in Synapse 1.0 already if you check out the new room_stats and room_state tables, but we need to provide a nice admin interface for it).</li>
<li>Support for smaller footprint homeservers by reducing memory usage and stopping them from joining overly complex rooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then stuff which we haven‚Äôt yet started, but is now unlocked by the 1.0 release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixing extremities build-up (and so massively improving performance)</li>
<li>Rewriting Communities.  Groups/Communities deliberately didn‚Äôt land in Matrix 1.0 as the current implementation has issues we want to fix first.  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a> has the details.</li>
<li>Rewritten room directory using the new room stats/state tables to be super-speedy.</li>
<li>Super-speedy <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3122">incremental state resolution</a></li>
<li>Removing MXIDs from events (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1228">MSC1228</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to give a quick taster of the shape of things to come, here‚Äôs RiotX/Android, the all-new Riot client for Android, showing off Edits &amp; Reactions in the wild‚Ä¶</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/blog/img/edits.jpg" style="height: 640px;"/>
</div>
<p>...and here‚Äôs a screenshot of the final test jig for cross-signing devices in end-to-end encryption, so you will never have to manually verify new devices for a trusted user ever again!  We demoed a <em>very</em> early version of this at FOSDEM, but this here is the testing harness for real deal, after several iterations of the spec and implementation to nail down the model. + means the device/user's cross-signing key is trusted, T means it's TOFU:</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/blog/img/cross-signing.png" style="height: 480px; margin: auto"/>
</div>
<p>So, there you have it - welcome to Matrix 1.0, and we look forward to our backlog of feature work now landing!</p>
<p>Massive massive thanks to everyone who has stuck with the project over the years and helped support and grow Matrix - little did we think back in May 2014 that it‚Äôd take us this long to exit beta, but hopefully you‚Äôll agree that it‚Äôs been worth it :)</p>
<p>Talking of which, we were looking through the photos we took from the first ever session hacking on Matrix back in May 2014‚Ä¶</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/nightmare.jpg" alt="Whiteboard 1" /></p>
<p>...suffice it to say that of the architectural options, we went with #3 in the end...</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/pl.jpg" alt="Whiteboard 2" /></p>
<p>...and that nowadays we actually know how power levels work, in excruciating and (hopefully) well-specified detail :)</p>
<p>There has been an absolutely enormous amount of work to pull Matrix 1.0 together - both on the spec side (thanks to the Spec Core Team for corralling proposals, and everyone who's contributed proposals, and particularly to Travis for editing it all) and the implementation side (thanks to the whole Synapse team for the tedious task of cleaning up everything that was needed for 1.0).  And of course, huge thanks go to everyone who has been helping test and debug the Synapse 1.0 release candidates, or just supporting the project to get to this point :)</p>
<h2 id="the-matrix-org-foundation">The Matrix.org Foundation</h2>
<p>Finally, as promised, alongside Matrix 1.0, we are very happy to announce the official launch of the finalised Matrix.org Foundation!</p>
<p>This has been a long-running project to ensure that Matrix‚Äôs future is governed by a neutral non-profit custodian for the benefit of everyone in the Matrix ecosystem.  We started the process nearly a year ago back with the initial proposal <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org">Towards Open Governance of Matrix.org</a>, and then legally <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2">incorporated the Foundation</a> in October, and published the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1779/proposals/1779-open-governance.md">final governance proposal</a> in January.</p>
<p>As of today the Foundation is finalised and operational, and all the assets for Matrix.org have been transferred from <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a> (the startup we formed in 2017 to hire the core Matrix team).  In fact you may already have seen Matrix.org Foundation notices popping up all over the Matrix codebase (as all of New Vector‚Äôs work on the public Matrix codebase for the foreseeable is being assigned to the Matrix.org Foundation).</p>
<p>Most importantly, we‚Äôre excited to introduce the <strong>Guardians of the Matrix.org Foundation</strong>.  The Guardians are the legal directors of the non-profit Foundation, and are responsible for ensuring that the Foundation (and by extension the Spec Core Team) keeps on mission and neutrally protects the development of Matrix. Guardians are typically independent of the commercial Matrix ecosystem and may even not be members of today‚Äôs Matrix community, but are deeply aligned with the mission of the project. Guardians are selected to be respected and trusted by the wider community to uphold the guiding principles of the Foundation and keep the other Guardians honest.</p>
<p>We have started the Foundation with five Guardians - two being the original founders of the Matrix project (Matthew and Amandine) and three being entirely independent, thus ensuring the original Matrix team forms a minority which can be kept in check by the rest of the Guardians. The new Guardians are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prof. Jon Crowcroft - Marconi Professor of Communications Systems in the Computer Lab at the University of Cambridge and the Turing Institute. Jon is a pioneer in the field of decentralised communication, and a fellow of the Royal Society, the ACM, the British Computer Society, the Institution of Engineering and Technology, the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</p>
<p>Jon is a global expert in decentralisation and data privacy, and is excellently placed to help ensure Matrix stays true to its ideals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ross Schulman - Ross is a senior counsel and senior policy technologist at New America‚Äôs Open Technology Institute, where he focuses on internet measurement, emerging technologies, surveillance, and decentralization. Prior to joining OTI, Ross worked for Google.</p>
<p>Ross brings a unique perspective as a tech- and decentralisation-savvy lawyer to the Foundation, as well as being one of the first non-developers in the Matrix community to run his own homeserver. Ross has been known to walk around Mozfest clutching a battery-powered Synapse in a box, promoting decentralised communication for all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr. Jutta Steiner - As co-founder and CEO of Parity Technologies, Jutta is dedicated to building a better internet - Web 3.0 - where users‚Äô privacy &amp; control come first. Parity Technologies is a leader in the blockchain space ‚Äì known to many as the creator of one of the most popular Ethereum clients, it is also the creator of two ambitious new blockchain technlogies, Polkadot and Substrate, that make it easier to experiment and innovate on scalability, encryption and governance.</p>
<p>Parity has been pioneering Matrix enterprise use since the moment they decided to rely on Matrix for their internal and external communication back in 2016, and now run their own high-volume deployment, with end-to-end encryption enabled by default. Jutta represents organisations who are professionally dependent on Matrix day-to-day, as well as bringing her unique experiences around decentralisation and ensuring that Web 3.0 will be a fair web for all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We‚Äôd like to offer a very warm welcome to the new Guardians, and thank them profusely for giving up their time to join the Foundation and help ensure Matrix stays on course for the years to come.</p>
<p>For the full update on the Foundation, please check out the new website content at <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">https://matrix.org/foundation</a> which should tell you everything you could possibly want to know about the Foundation, the Guardians, the Foundation‚Äôs legal Articles of Association, and the day-to-day Rules which define the Open Governance process.</p>
<h2 id="and-finally">And finally‚Ä¶</h2>
<p>Matrix 1.0 has been a bit of an epic to release, but puts us on a much stronger footing for the future.</p>
<p>However, it‚Äôs very unlikely that we‚Äôd have made it this far if most of the core dev team wasn‚Äôt able to work on Matrix as their day job.  Right now we are actively looking for large-scale donations to the Matrix.org Foundation (and/or investment in <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a>) to ensure that the team can maintain as tight a focus on core Matrix work as possible, and to ensure the project realises its full potential.  While Matrix is growing faster than ever, this perversely means we have more and more distractions - whether that‚Äôs keeping the Matrix.org server safe and operational, or handling support requests from the community, or helping new members of the ecosystem get up and running.  If you would like Matrix to succeed, please <a href="mailto:funding@matrix.org">get in touch</a> if you‚Äôd like to sponsor work, prioritise features, get support contracts, or otherwise support the project.  We‚Äôre particularly interested in sponsorship around decentralised reputation work (e.g. publishing a global room directory which users can filter based on their preferences).</p>
<p>Finally, huge thanks to everyone who has continued to support us through thick and thin on <a href="https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a>, <a href="https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg">Liberapay</a> or other platforms.  Every little helps here, both in terms of practically keeping the lights on, and also inspiring larger donations &amp; financial support.</p>
<p>So: thank you once again for flying Matrix.  We hope you enjoy 1.0, and we look forward to everything else landing on the horizon!</p>
<p>- Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix.org Team.</p>
