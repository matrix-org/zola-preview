<p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696/#5910277670830080">View project: E2E encryption for go-neb</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Hello! I am <a href="https://github.com/nikofil">Nikos</a>, an MSc student in Computer Security. My original goal for this GSoC was to implement the basics of end-to-end encryption for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb">Go-NEB</a>, which is a popular and easily extendable bot for the Matrix protocol. I chose this project because it ticked off a lot of the boxes that I look for in a project: The Matrix protocol is very interesting and the e2e specification is fascinating, Go-NEB is written in Go which I wanted to learn better, plus I believe personally that crypto should be easy for everyone to use and adopted more.</p>
<p>My initial plan was to first create bindings in gomatrix for libolm, the C library that implements most of the necessary algorithms for Olm/Megolm, the protocols used in Matrix' end-to-end encryption. Then, I was going to write some nice APIs around those bindings so that most of the work done is hidden from the client that uses the library, and finally I would call these APIs from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb">Go-NEB</a> when needed to set up the encrypted sessions between devices in a room and use them to encrypt/decrypt messages as necessary. What we found out soon after GSoC started was that another library called <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-go">mautrix-go</a> that was based on gomatrix already did most of these things. My task then became to change the uses of gomatrix in Go-NEB for mautrix-go and make some slight changes to the latter if there were some incompatibilities. A month later, that task was done.</p>
<p>With two months to go in GSoC, my mentors came up with a new task: to implement a service for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb">Go-NEB</a> that allows other client developers to test their e2ee implementations easily. That resulted in a service called &quot;cryptotest&quot; which allows other clients in a specified room to execute some Neb commands which would trigger functions like the forwarding of keys between clients, another feature that had to be implemented in mautrix. Something else that I wanted to add and grabbed my interest was SAS device verification, a multi-step process that involves users comparing a string of numbers or emojis out-of-band to configure they are indeed talking to each other and not to a MITM. These were my main tasks during the second month and I was happy to have achieved them and made a decent verification API for clients to use. They were soon merged into mautrix and Go-NEB.</p>
<p>For my third month I proposed to implement a new Matrix feature called cross-signing, which was similar to SAS verification but dealt with verifying other users instead of their devices who would in turn verify their own devices, creating a graph of trust between users and devices. This functionality was strongly coupled with SSSS, another new feature that allows clients to store their encrypted secrets (in this case the multiple necessary signing keys) on the server, as well as in-room verification which allows verification between users. This task was more challenging as it uses multiple algorithms (some of which not in libolm) for deriving the keys, using them to encrypt other keys which in turn sign other keys. It was also more satisfying when I finally managed to generate the keys, store and retrieve them and then use them to sign another user and when I was done I felt like my understanding of cryptography levelled up.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm very satisfied with the overall experience. The spec was very clear in most cases and when it wasn't the community was always helpful and responsive. They were also happy to discuss the spec with me and explain the more intricate details. For that reason I wasn't asking questions directly to my mentors (besides for defining my tasks) but to the overall community. I'm also very grateful to my mentors, <a href="https://github.com/uhoreg">@uhoreg</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Kegsay">@Kegan</a> for picking me for this project and helping me with the planning aspect and reviewing my PRs. I'd lastly like to thank the maintainer of mautrix, <a href="https://github.com/tulir/">@tulir</a>, for reviewing and merging a lot of my work into his library.</p>

<p>Erik has made an initial, naive implementation of a sharded Event Persister worker - the non-sharded version currently being one of the biggest bottlenecks on matrix.org right now. It still needs a bit of polish to be production ready, and Sytest will need some updating to support testing it, but otherwise progress is looking good!</p>
<p>Brendan is polishing his unread counts implementations, while Rich is writing up the push rules replacement tech in an MSC. Rich has also been optimizing the device code in Synapse to both simplify the code, as well as cut down on unnecessary device data being sent over federation.</p>
<p>Patrick has finished converting Synapse's database code to be fully async! This has the benefit of making profiling the matrix.org Synapse process much more sane, and we're already starting to find a few little places where Synapse is burning CPU unnecessarily! Now, Synapse won't be fully async'd until Twisted itself is, and we drop support for older Twisted versions that aren't, which is not <em>soon</em>. However the majority of the code that developers touch and that is executed being async has massive benefits either way üôÇ</p>
<p>Andrew has been working on having a confirmation pop up after users click the link in their email, to help prevent phishing scams. He's also trying to finally make Synapse spec-compliant in accepting identifier dictionaries during user-interactive authentication.</p>
<p>Olivier has been continuing to help Synapse recover missed messages better after it has been offline for an extended period of time, as well as various fixes to push. </p>
<p>Expect a fresh release with all these changes soon!</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The federation sender is now used for backfilling and getting missing events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some more SQLite writer bugs have been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room information in the roomserver is now handled in a common structure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public rooms API now correctly searches remote servers (thanks <a href="https://github.com/rohitmohan96">rohitmohan96</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initial support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2753">Peeking (MSC2753)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2444">Peeking over Federation (MSC2444)</a> is in progress</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is improving:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, up from 55% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 71%, same as last week</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Last week, we updated some of our documentation and created a whole new set of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">easy first issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted">medium to hard issues</a> for contributors.</p>

<p>Introducing a new bridge to the family, tomsg-matrix!</p>
<p>A friend of mine preferred using <a href="https://git.tomsmeding.com/tomsg/">his own chat protocol</a>, but having a chat protocol is useless without having people to talk to. Since I prefer using Matrix I thought it would be a fun exercise to try and create a bridge using Rust.</p>
<p>The bridge uses the newly created (still very WIP) <a href="https://github.com/lieuwex/matrix-appservice-rs">matrix-appservice-rs</a>. A Rust library that builds on top of the Ruma suite, the goal is for it to be comparable to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-node">matrix-appservice-node</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>.</p>
<p>The code for tomsg-matrix is <a href="https://github.com/lieuwex/tomsg-matrix">open source</a>, but be prepared, I hastily pushed it to GitHub without cleaning it up.</p>
<p>Come chat to us over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#tomsg:lieuwe.xyz">#tomsg:lieuwe.xyz</a>, hoping that it doesn't break. :P</p>

<p>I'm currently in the process of rebuilding Ditto - partly to incorporate rn-matrix, and partly to support a WEB VERSION </p>
<p>The new repo can be found <a href="https://gitlab.com/ditto-chat/ditto">here (https://gitlab.com/ditto-chat/ditto)</a> (there's a new repo mostly because getting react-native-web to play nicely with the rest of the app was a challenge, to say the least)</p>
<p>As a sneak peek, enjoy <a href="https://ditto-test.netlify.app">this rough version (https://ditto-test.netlify.app)</a> of Ditto for web :) </p>
<p>Expect to see what I'm calling Ditto's 2.0.0 drop on TestFlight and Google Play in a few weeks.</p>

<p>Lurkki added an emoji completer to the message area! This was a super requested feature and it is pretty awesome, that someone picked this up and implemented it! This means you can finally write <code>:fire:</code> and have it expand to üî•! Seems like this will also lead to a few more improvements to our other completers down the line (user, room, etc completions), so thank you very much Lurkki!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've been mostly reviewing PRs this week (and trying to get some other work in line, like MSCs, synapse stuff, etc). With this hopefully Chethans work on cross-signing will be merged soon, which will give us most of the building blocks to have cross-signing in Nheko (his work is basically only missing Secure Secret Storage and Sharing). We hope to fix the few remaining build issues in the next week or so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the side I have been cleaning some UI stuff to simplify our room settings dialog and allow advanced users to hide/show certain event types in the timeline. This will probably take a bit more time to be finished though.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has mostly been focused on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/milestone/8">beta milestone tasks</a> and bug fixes. Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Joining rooms which the server already belongs to when invited by a user from another homeserver is now significantly faster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client API no longer refers to the device DB directly, instead using the new user API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of locking issues have been fixed in the federation sender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/join</code> endpoint now accepts <code>?server_name=...</code> query parameters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device list updater now obeys the backoff period and blacklisted status from the federation sender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uploaded media will no longer be truncated to 0 bytes when <code>max_file_size_bytes</code> option is set to 0 (for unlimited)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media API now correctly cleans up temporary directories when errors occur</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media API now returns unique media IDs and metadata when multiple users upload the same file, whilst maintaining deduplication on disk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rejecting invites over federation multiple times should now work properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redactions are now permanent and are committed to the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some caches have been added to the roomserver for room IDs, state key IDs and event type IDs to reduce pressure on the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The redaction endpoint is now spec-compliant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some places where global errors were overwritten have been fixed (thanks oliverpool!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some state key checks in the roomserver membership updaters have now been tidied up (thanks oliverpool!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 55%, up from 54% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 70%, down from 71% last week due to a single flakey test</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also updated some of our documentation and created a whole new set of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">easy first issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted">medium to hard issues</a> for contributors.</p>

<p>This week Erik has been working on sharding the Event Persister worker as we aim further for horizontal scalability for Synapse. Some of the complication comes from ensuring that sysadmin's don't misconfigure things where multiple event persisters persist events in the same room.</p>

<p>Patrick has been continuing on the async/await train and has just submitted the final PR which async's our <code>runInteraction</code> method - the one that most database calls go through. Synapse is nearly 100% async! He's also been submitting a flurry of shadow ban PRs, which will be another powerful tool for moderation.</p>
<p>Brendan and Rich are continuing to work on the Notifications rewrite, with Brendan finishing up unread counts, and Rich polishing up designs for the new replacement for push rules.</p>
<p>Andrew (<em>who dat? - ed.</em>) is continuing to work on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">knocking MSC</a> and has fleshed out the CS and SS details. There are still some open questions though, so please give feedback if you notice anything off!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A multi-account Matrix client that allows you to authorize webapps to access parts of your account, designed with collaboration in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the webapp I've been talking about for a while that allows webpages limited access to your account. Currently, apps can view the name, avatar, alias, and type of a room that's been opened with the app, and that's just about it.</p>
<p>The big interesting thing about mxapps right now is the architecture. Just about all of the logic is running in a shared worker. This means that you can duplicate as many tabs as you want and it will all act as the same client. It also has multi-account support.</p>
<p>Features coming ~soon~ at some point will be full state event support and easy-to-follow docs on how to make an app, plus Vue plugins to make development really easy.</p>
<p>You can checkout the live version on <a href="https://mxapps.kb1rd.net/">mxapps.kb1rd.net</a>, but it is a bit useless...</p>
<p>There are some work-in-progress docs on the structure on <a href="https://docs.mxapps.kb1rd.net/">docs.mxapps.kb1rd.net</a></p>

<p>Small 0.6.2 release this week, mostly bug fixes:</p>
<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When replying to a message, you can now press enter without entering any</p>
<p>text to send it directly (useful to &quot;forward&quot; a message).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending a file while replying to a message will create a pseudo-reply,</p>
<p>consisting of an &quot;In reply to&quot; text message with no body, followed by the
actual file event.</p>
<p>This is a workaround to the reply restrictions imposed by the Matrix spec.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Composer aliases cannot contain whitespace anymore.</strong></p>
<p>This includes spaces, hard tabs or newline characters.
If an alias from your config still has whitespace, only the first word</p>
<p>will be taken into account (ignoring any leading or trailing space).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faster server browser loading, now gathers all needed data with a</p>
<p>single request instead of one for each server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-focus the &quot;Join&quot; button on invited room pages</p>
<p>((Shift+)Tab can be used to navigate between buttons)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-focus the &quot;Forget&quot; button on left room pages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: modify <code>chat.message.styleSheet</code> to add some spacing between HTML </p>
<p>list items, see

</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fixed">Fixed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix @username autocompletion closing if there's more than one character</p>
<p>after the @</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the partial text from IME (input method editors) and touch screen </p>
<p>autocompleting keyboards and for username autocompletion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reset IME state upon autocompleting a username</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix clicking on autocompletion list user not making the username a mention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix UI freezing when mentioning user lacking a display name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix mentioning users with blank display name (e.g. only spaces), mention</p>
<p>them by their user ID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix text fields/areas unable to be focused on touch screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix random chance of profile retrieval requests failing if one of the logged</p>
<p>in account doesn't federate with other servers (e.g. localhost synapse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix composer text saved to disk for the wrong account if that text begins</p>
<p>by an account alias</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Servers can potentially return an outdated member list for rooms on initial </p>
<p>sync, which is one of the possible cause of &quot;Members not synced&quot; error for 
encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>When loading the full room list, discard members from the initial sync list
that are absent from the full list.</p>
<p>For those not using the AppImage or Flatpak, this fix requires <strong>matrix-nio 0.15.1</strong> or later to take effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When erasing an account alias inside the composer, send a </p>
<p>&quot;x isn't typing anymore&quot; notification corresponding to that account </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix potential 403 error on chat pages for invited rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start loading room history immediately when the room join state changes,</p>
<p>e.g. when clicked &quot;Join&quot; for an invited room page.</p>

<p>Released 0.0.34 this week with some fixes to the room list sorting and fixing several crashes. If you clear your session, it will also sort low priority rooms at the bottom of the room list, even if unread, making it a bit more usable until we add more UX refinements to the room list. </p>
<p>Most of the effort this week however has gone into working on end-to-end encryption, having investigated using the rust-sdk for a couple of days, and now looking into a custom implementation based on libolm. This is well on its way with key upload working and device tracking nearing completion.</p>

<p>Those two bugs were related to the new rate-limiter on room joins, which was introduced in 1.19.0.</p>
<p>The first bug caused Synapse to ignore exceptions to rate-limiting for application services.</p>
<p>The second one prevented profile updates from being correctly propagated across rooms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we have largely been working on bug fixes and performance issues.</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The room server now handles input events for multiple rooms in parallel when running with PostgreSQL, which helps a lot with perceived latency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Device key queries now obey federation backoffs, so that we don't spend a lot of time making unnecessary requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key server now only emits changes for <code>/users/devices</code> which reduces database hits significantly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client API now tries to guarantee message ordering on a per-user basis (thanks Anand!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federated invites are now more reliable and are performed synchronously</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite room metadata is now sent correctly in all cases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting and rejecting invites is also now much more reliable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed that caused excessive memory usage in the sync API (bringing the memory usage of my own instance down to less than 100mb)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A massive amount of work has been done to reduce database locks in SQLite mode across the entire codebase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some unnecessary code has been removed from the roomserver updaters</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 54%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 71%, up from 70% last week</p>

<p>On the sharding side the last big milestone is to get the event persister to shard. I know this comes up every week, but we now have a rough working implementation for non-backfilled events. Next steps are to get backfill working, get the tests passing, go through review and then ship. I asked Erik if it would be live on matrix.org within 2 weeks. He didn‚Äôt say, at least I didn‚Äôt hear him say no‚Ä¶&gt;
Aside from that Rich is working on the push rules redesign, the next steps are to design the APIs in more detail and then make a formal spec proposal. Brendan is also in notifications land and his work on room unread counts is going through final review. </p>
<p>Finally, Andrew has been working with Sorunome to dust off the knock feature, both on the spec and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6739">the Synapse side</a>.</p>

<p>Hello! Just recently I made public an SELinux policy module I developed for Synapse. This policy is one I developed early on during my trip down the SELinux rabbit hole, and I have been using it in production for some time. At the moment, this policy module is built for the Gentoo SELinux policy (not RHEL/CentOS/Fedora) and does not currently have systemd support, nor has it been tested in all environments, i.e. with workers. I am publishing this policy in the hopes that it will be useful and I am open to any contributions, even those to help tighten the policy if possible. Finally, I have also made public a policy module for coturn, which I am also using in my own personal environment under the same conditions. Both the <a href="https://github.com/0xC0ncord/synapse-selinux">Synapse</a> policy and the <a href="https://github.com/0xC0ncord/turnserver-selinux">coturn</a> policy can be found on Github.

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>SSO authentication</strong> support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Homeserver browser</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To add a new account, you will be asked first to pick one of the 
listed public server (list data from <a href="https://publiclist.anchel.nl/">anchel.nl</a>) or to manually enter a server address </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Typing in the server address field will also filter the public server list, 
Up/Down or (Shift+)Tab and Enter can be used to navigate it by keyboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the address doesn't have a <code>scheme://</code>, auto-detect whether the server
supports HTTPS or only HTTP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the .well-known API if possible to resolve domains to the actual 
homeserver's URL, e.g. <code>matrix.org</code> resolves to 
<code>https://matrix-client.matrix.org</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server address field will remember the last homeserver that was
connected to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Room members autocompletion</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Type <code>@</code> followed by one or more characters in the composer, 
or one or more characters and hit (Shift+)Tab to trigger username/user ID
autocompletion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only autocompleted names will be turned into mentions, unlike before
where any word in a sent message that happened to be someone's name would 
mention them</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full image viewer</strong> for matrix image messages and URL previews:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click on a thumbnail in the timeline to open the image viewer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middle click on a thumbnail (or use the option in the context menu)
to open the image externally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Left click on the image (mouse only): expand to window size if the 
image's origin size is smaller than the window, 
else expand to original size</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap on the image (touch screen/pen only): reveal the info and button bars
when auto-hidden (bars will auto-hide only when they overlap with a big 
enough displayed image)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any mouse movement: reveal auto-hidden bars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double click on the image: toggle full screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middle click anywhere: open externally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right click anywhere: close the viewer, back to chat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag when displayed image is bigger than window to pan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wheel to pan up/down, hold shift or alt to pan left/right</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ctrl+wheel to control zoom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buttons to control rotation, scale mode, full screen, GIF play/pause 
and GIF speed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New keyboard shortcuts are available for all these actions, 
see <code>keys.imageViewer</code> in the config file (will be automatically updated 
when you start Mirage 0.6.1)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <code>media.openExternallyOnClick</code> setting to swap the new
click and middle click on thumbnails behavior </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room and member filter fields now support (Shift+)Tab navigation, in addition
to Up/Down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a colored left border to the currently highlighted item in list views 
(e.g. room list, members list, etc) to improve visibility </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>controls.listView.highlightBorder</code> and
<code>controls.listView.highlightBorderThickness</code> properties (can be set to <code>0</code>)</li>
<li>Add the <code>chat.userAutoCompletion</code> section</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Messages context menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use a cleaner icon for the &quot;Copy text&quot; entry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace the confusing broken &quot;Copy media address&quot; entry with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Copy media address: visible for non-encrypted media, always
copies the HTTP URL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy local path: always visible for already downloaded media, even if
they were downloaded before mirage was started</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>openMessagesLinks</code> keybind (default Ctrl+O) is renamed to
<code>openMessagesLinksOrFiles</code> and can now also open media message files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the <code>openMessagesLinksOrFiles</code> keybind on a reply will now ignore the
matrix.to links contained in the &quot;In reply to XYZ&quot; header</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pressing Ctrl+C to copy selected/highlighted non-encrypted media messages 
will copy their HTTP URL instead of the filename</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retry downloading image thumbnails if they fail with a 404 or 500+ server 
error (uploads sometimes take a few seconds to become available on the 
server)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-encrypted media messages are now always downloaded on click and opened
with a desktop application (or the image viewer), instead of
being opened in a browser</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compress thumbnails and clipboard images in a separate process, to avoid
blocking every other backend operation while the compression is running</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the level of optimization applied to clipboard images, 
the previous setting was too slow for large PNG (10MB+)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase applied scrolling velocity when using the 
<code>scrollPageUp</code>/<code>scrollPageDown</code> keybinds, now similar to how it was before
Mirage 0.6.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't catch SIGQUIT (Ctrl+\ in terminal) and SIGTERM signals, exit immediately</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slightly increase the top/bottom padding to the multi-account bar in the 
left pane</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependencies: minimum nio version bumped to 0.15.0</p>
</li>

<blockquote>
<p>We wanted to take a little bit of time to show off a state resolution library for Ruma, courtesy of @DevinR528 and @Timo. Ruma has a new crate to make resolving state easier, <a href="https://github.com/ruma/state-res">state-res</a>! The goal of this crate is to be the base for federation, it provides the necessary utilities to resolve state, sort power events (reverse topological ordering), sort events (based on mainline depth), and a lot of event authentication functions. It is still in the early stages of development, but will be hopefully proved out in <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit">Conduit</a>.</p>
<p>Other things that happened this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added the invite endpoints from the Federation API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Started requiring strong types for event-sending endpoints</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Augmented error types with error-specific fields (see the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/713341462?t=00h35m42s">livestream here</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking of livestreams, @jplatte streams coding sessions from time to time on <a href="https://twitch.tv/jplatte">Twitch</a>.

<p>Very impressed that these features are landing in Ruma first, with the intention of getting them into Conduit.</p>

<ul>
<li>SSSS and cross-signing are slowly making their way to mautrix-go! A <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-go/pull/18">WIP PR</a> exists for both features and is being developed upon. This will allow any clients that use the library to eventually be able to use SSSS and verify the trustworthiness of other devices based on cross-signing.</li>

It would be great to see a project building on Matrix.</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.19.0 is here and ready for action.</p>
<p>1.19.0 contains lots of async/await changes, 27 separate PRs to be precise(thanks Patrick). These changes will provide some level of performance improvement, but the real value to us is that it will improve our ability to profile Synapse more effectively.</p>
<p>It also features improved logging performance, this is in part to reduce IO but also to reduce the total amount logged. We‚Äôd be really interested to get some feedback on if the changes help. You may also want to take a look at our new logging defaults to see if they would help reduce total disk space usage.</p>
<p>Some admins will rejoice that we have added a <code>/health</code> end point to every configured HTTP listener which should make it easier to monitor multi-worker installs.</p>
<p>Finally 1.19.0 contains improvements to the Admin API allowing the admin to optionally purge rooms on deletion.</p>
<p>Get the new releases from any of the usual sources mentioned at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md. 1.19.0 is on github <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.19.0">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.19.0rc1">a new RC out</a>, edited highlights include</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>lots</em> of async/await changes, 27 separate PRs (thanks Patrick)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improved logging performance, this is in part to reduce IO but also to reduce the total amount logged. We‚Äôd be really interested to get some feedback on if the changes help. You may also want to take a look at our new logging defaults to see if they would help reduce total disk space usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further improvements to the Admin API allowing admin to optionally purge rooms on deletion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect 1.19.0 to land early next week.</p>
<p>Aside from that Erik has been continuing with sharding the event persister, this is a big job, so we‚Äôre still a little way off having something to ship, but I‚Äôll keep you updated.</p>
<p>Big news this week, after spending a good chunk of time trying to rework notifications to make the UX more intuitive, we have decided that the best (and only) way forward is to completely rethink how the push rules work. Rich is currently redesigning the whole thing, and once done we‚Äôll resume on the client side.</p>
<p>Having spent much of the past 3 months trying to improve the performance of large scale instances we will soon start looking at improving the out of the box experience for smaller installs and are in the early stages of thinking about what that might look like. I‚Äôll update more over time, but the two obvious use cases to target are</p>
<ul>
<li>Federating instance, with 1-5 users, resource constrained.</li>
<li>Federating instance with a few hundred users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our (relatively small) changes to logging in 1.19.0 are the first signs of this shift. We still need to ship event persistence sharding and also move more functionality from the main process (dependent on async/await), but once done it clears the way for new projects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, we've been silent for a bit, but that doesn't mean we haven't been busy, so I have a little bit of a bigger announcement to make today:</p>
<p>Trilene implemented voice call support in Nheko! We just merged this and you can try it out now!</p>
<p>Some caveats apply at the moment, but will be resolved in the near future:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Currently you will need to have a patched version of GStreamer. The current releases of GStreamer have a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-bad/-/issues/831">bug</a> when your turnserver uses a password, that contains a ':'. Since this is the default for coturn, I'm guessing this affects everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will need to build Nheko yourself. Currently we do not have GStreamer available in our CI pipeline, so we disabled support for voice calls in those builds (apart from the flatpak build, but that also needs some further validation and a new GStreamer release). We will release proper builds with VOIP support once GStreamer is actually released and available with the fixes we need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are still some other issues, when relying on a turnserver to connect a call. We will fix them one at a time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Big shoutout to trilene for implementing all of this! I can finally call people from Nheko, which is super awesome!</p>
<p>This was the first of the bigger features, that have been cooking for a while, in the near future we should also finish the new event store, which reduced memory usage and provides some kind of offline support, and Chethan will probably finish the first iteration of cross-signing soon too. After that we'll focus on the smaller features again. ;-)</p>

<h3 id="hydrogen">Hydrogen</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some regular readers might remember, in the past I've put a few entries here about a side-project called <a href="https://github.com/bwindels/brawl-chat/">Brawl</a>. Two weeks ago, we took Brawl and started building a new client on top of it code-named Hydrogen.</p>
<p>As the name implies, Hydrogen tries to be the lightest Element. It is written entirely in vanilla javascript (no React, no Webpack) for complete control, structured as an MVVM app, leveraging the raw performance of indexeddb. On huge accounts where Element-web uses up to 1GB of heap memory, Hydrogen sips away with a mere 15mb. It is very early days though, and Hydrogen has very little features: you can receive and send unencrypted messages and that's it.</p>
<p>Hydrogen also aims to support a wider range of browsers, from IE11 (particularly for orgs with locked-down machines) all the way to a fully featured PWA that works well on mobile. We should also be able to easily add progressive loading, which <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/2498">proved hard in the past</a>.</p>
<p>Another goal is to make it easy to embed parts of the app (like the room view) into another app or website. It could also be really nice to have a place to play and experiment with new tech for element proper - much as Dendrite has influenced Synapse.</p>
<p>As mentioned, it's early days, and lots of things are missing or broken, so <strong>please don't file any issues yet</strong>. Feel free to play around with it at <a href="https://hydrogen.element.io/">https://hydrogen.element.io/</a> though!</p>

<p>The Element P2P demo on iOS has seen a number of updates in the last week - now at build 31 - which contains a number of fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>QUIC session setup is now far more reliable</p>

<li>
<p>QUIC sessions are now reset when the node's network coordinates change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federation sender now wakes up properly on incoming QUIC sessions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network coordinates are now cached for remote federated nodes, reducing the number of DHT searches and speeding up resuming federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTTP pools are disabled, which reduces head-of-line blocking problems on stalled sessions</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are happy to announce the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/milestone/8">beta milestone</a> for our first versioned release of Dendrite, which we anticipate to land in the next few weeks. Once these issues are cleared, we'll have made the big breaking changes that we want to make and will have a migration mechanism in place for database schema upgrades.</p>
<p>This will make life significantly easier for anyone who wants to start experimenting with and running their own Dendrite homeservers without unexpected breakages. More updates to follow soon - join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for the latest!</p>
<p>This week, Dendrite's end-to-end encryption support has also been mostly rounded off with the exception of a few minor bugs and edge-cases.</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TLS certificate verification is now enabled by default</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new <code>federation_disable_tls_validation</code> config option has been added to override the above</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for processing inbound device lists from federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local device list changes are now sent outbound over federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One-time key counts are now sent in <code>/sync</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct server signing key fetches are now limited to 15 seconds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State events that fail signature checks on federated room joins are now properly ignored</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of SQLite database lock bugs have been fixed using <code>TransactionWriter</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug when finding joined hosts in the federation sender in SQLite mode has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logging levels have been adjusted in a number of areas</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 51%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 54%, up from 53% last week</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Asked whether this progress means that matrix.org would be running on Dendrite next year, Neil said he was <em>certain</em> that it would <em>definitely</em> be ready:</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@clokep:matrix.org">Patrick</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Synapse land we continued with our performance push making further progress on the async/await-athon. We will move into the storage layer this coming week which will leave the caching layer and a few other bits outstanding. Separate work continued to get the event persister into a shardable state. The first step being to replace the event stream token with its own type and then threading that through the code base.</p>
<p>We have also continued to improve on our push capabilities and released a new version of Sygnal (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/releases/tag/v0.8.2">0.8.2</a>) with support for pushing to iOS devices via Firebase.</p>
<p>We are also very close to getting a workable version of the new push rules. The idea is to test it out in the wild before getting it enshrined in the spec.</p>
<p>Next week will see a continued focus on sharding and async/awaiting, more notifications work, logging improvements, and a host of bug fixes!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All my bridges now have options for automatic e2ee key sharing in portal rooms. Currently they don't have verification support (other than manually marking as verified in the database), so enabling key sharing isn't entirely secure yet. I'll probably invent some sort of web verification interface after nikofil adds cross-signing to mautrix-go.</p>
<p>This also means mautrix-python now supports sending and responding to key requests. I'll port the interactive verification and future cross-signing code from mautrix-go to mautrix-python at some point too.</p>

<p>We also shipped a security and feature release of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/releases">Sygnal</a> (actually two each‚Ä¶). The main new feature being the ability to run behind an HTTP proxy which is useful in environments that mandate that all traffic go through a proxy.</p>
<p>Aside from that week we continued our async/await-athon and Patrick provided a visual update</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôve been documenting worker support and diving into sharding the event persisters. This is not a small job since it means every other part of the code base that assumes an integer stream id will need to be updated to be aware of multiple stream ids from multiple persisters.</p>
<p>Over in feature land we‚Äôve been working on the notifications project and most of the backend support is done. The project will mean more intuitive defaults as well as a much better client UX in configuring notification settings.</p>

<p>Just pushed the 1.18.0 K8s-optimized Synapse images, now only doing the debian-based version as like upstream - though still including jemalloc. So <code>latest</code>/<code>v1.18.0</code> and <code>*-debian</code> will be the same in this version and going forwards. Additionally, the <code>*-debian</code> tags will only remain for a release or two more before disappearing, as they're now superfluous.</p>

<p>I finally added automatic backfilling options to mautrix-telegram. Like my other bridges, it can backfill old messages when creating portals and missed messages when restarting, and it can disable notifications in the room while backfilling.</p>
<p>I also added bridging for your own read receipts, so if you read a message with another Telegram client, the bridge will mark it as read on your Matrix account with double puppeting.</p>

<p>gomuks can now do interactive verification for e2ee. Most of it is thanks to nikofil's <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-go/pull/16">SAS verification PR</a> to mautrix-go, I just made a UI for using it. Currently gomuks can only send verification requests, but I'll add some interface for accepting incoming requests soon.</p>
<p>Related to verification, there are some new commands for verifying/unverifying/blacklisting devices and viewing device lists. There's also a toggle to disable sending messages to unverified devices.</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.18.0 has landed.</p>
<p>The most important thing to know about 1.18.0 is that it contains support for sharding multiple workers. Specifically this means being able to run multiple federation senders, multiple client readers to handle registration and multiple push workers. This will be important for anyone running a large scale install of Synapse. You can read more about how to benefit from these changes in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/workers.md">docs/workers.md</a>. In the same spirit we also moved typing notifications from the main process.</p>
<p>Aside from that, we have new admin API support to list the users in a room, support for oEmbed for media previews (you can unfurl tweets again!) and a general slew of federation bug fixes.</p>
<p>Get the new releases from any of the usual sources mentioned at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md. 1.18.0 is on github <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.18.0">here</a>.</p>
