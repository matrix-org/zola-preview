<h3 id="t2bot-io-passes-3-million-bridged-users">t2bot.io passes 3 Million bridged users</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over 3 million people from Telegram and Discord have now been brought into the Matrix universe through t2bot.io. Of those people, around 230 thousand are active each month and 15 thousand are dedicated users of the bridges daily.</p>
<p>While this is a huge milestone for t2bot.io,it underlines the importance of self-hosting: having a couple giant bridges is great for accessibility, though where possible it‚Äôs heavily encouraged that people self-host. Hosting the bridges yourself on your own homeserver gives you better control of what passes through your server, reduces your dependence on third parties like t2bot.io, and gives you better performance.</p>
<p>During peak periods, t2bot.io sees about 10 messages per second passing through it. Half of those messages are generated by the Telegram bridge alone. The other half is dealing with federation and the various other bridges and bots on t2bot.io. In terms of media, a new image is uploaded every 2 seconds, leading to 5.8 TB of media being stored. The database is 3 TB and holds 236 Million events - roughly 131 Million of which are sent by t2bot.io.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has used t2bot.io in the past 3 years - it‚Äôs been more successful than ever imagined. Here‚Äôs to another year and a bunch of self-hosting. :)</p>

</li>
<li>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôve spent time this week working with the Riot teams to tweak matrix.org performance for cross signing. We‚Äôve also fixed a few performance regressions ahead of next week's 1.13.0 release (which will be a big one, more details when it lands).</p>
<p>With any luck we‚Äôll have Redis in production on matrix.org next week, we don‚Äôt think this will give us a huge performance win, but there is certainly overhead in having so many workers using the previous replication streaming method.</p>
<p>Our sharding project continues, and Erik has been trying to move the event stream entirely away from the master process which in itself could be significant for overall perf once ready for production.</p>
<p>Aside from that we continue to improve SSO support and we have a really great community PR from <a href="https://github.com/sandhose">sandhose</a> that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7256">implements OpenID Connect support</a>. We are really looking forward to getting that merged. The admin API is also getting plenty of community love with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6881">awesome-manual</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pulls/dklimpel">dklimpel</a> leading the charge.</p>
<p>Next week, look out for 1.13.0 and hopefully some more good news on sharding.</p>

<p>Version 0.0.6 has been released on <a href="https://p2p.riot.im">https://p2p.riot.im</a> which has the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Room version 5 is supported by default.</p>

<li>
<p>Backfill is much more reliable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backfill now does <em>all</em> PDU checks required of it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You might get kicked out a few times whilst the service worker shifts around, you can force things by going to <code>chrome:serviceworker-internals</code> or <code>about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox</code> to unregister the worker manually. Logs will state version 0.0.6 on update.</p>

<p>All the benefits from Dendrite (above) will feed into this.</p>

<p>Hey all, the IRC bridge has reached another milestone, 0.17.0. This is a medium sized release, containing a few nice to have features like predicting nickname conflicts and some work around user deactivation. Importantly, this release <strong>authenticates</strong> the provisioning endpoint so if you run an integration manager or script that makes use of it, ensure that it handles requests appropriately. You can see the changelog in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.17.0">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.17.0</a></p>

<h3 id="gomuks">gomuks</h3>
<p><a href="https://maunium.net/go/gomuks">gomuks</a> is a terminal based Matrix client written in Go. <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">Source on GitHub</a></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gomuks now has experimental support for end-to-end encryption on the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks/tree/e2ee"><code>e2ee</code> branch</a>. It supports both text messages and media downloads. The majority of the work happened in mautrix-go (also on the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-go/tree/e2ee"><code>e2ee</code> branch</a>). This also means that mautrix-whatsapp will get support for end-to-bridge encryption in the near future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://nio.chat/">Nio</a> received some cool new features this week.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New Dutch and Chinese (simplified) translations (besides English &amp; German)!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edited messages are now displayed correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An edit action has been added to the event context menu, long press a sent message to go into edit mode (looks cool as well!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When entering a full MXID into the username field on logging in, Nio will automagically prefill the homeserver URL (if a well-known config is present server-side).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rich text markdown message display including clickable links detection is now in the works!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Best part about <em>all</em> of these changes: They were contributed by others, I did nothing but merge the PRs! Open-Source ‚ù§Ô∏è Shout out to @stefan:stefanhofman.nl, @thomas:mustelo.de, @captain-yukinoshita-hachiaman:matrix.org and @regexident:matrix.org.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org">benoit</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RiotX will finally be an update of Riot-Android on the PlayStore and RiotX beta will then be removed from the PlayStore. We will implement everything to let users upgrade their application without being forced to log in again.</p>
<p>While we are finalizing cross-signing, quadS, bootstrap, etc. on RiotX, we have started studying and implementing the main missing features: identity server and related functionality (terms of service consent, invite by email, search in contact list, bind emails and phone numbers, etc.), integration manager (terms of service consent,widgets, send stickers), WebRTC audio and video calls, Jitsi conference integration, and other important missing features like UI and UX to invite people to a room, etc. We are also fighting an annoying bug related to the navigation inside a timeline.</p>
<p>It's also now possible to deactivate your account using RiotX.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that people can contribute to translate RiotX by using new dedicated <a href="https://translate.riot.im/projects/riot-android/">Weblate projects</a>. Thanks!</p>

<li>
<p>We fixed a major bug in 0.7.1, where you couldn't accept invites</p>

<li>
<p>We fixed a bug, where nheko would pin a core to 100% CPU on highdpi screens, because it tried to resize avatars all the time...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also reduced CPU usage by a lot. Nheko now only uses 0.7% CPU on my system again and that's just the presence updates I get every 100ms or so...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There will probably be a release in the near future to get those fixes to people not running master.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reduced CPU usage is mostly not resorting the whole room list all the time, but keeping the partially sorted room list around and not storing pending read receipts in the database but just applying them all the time without checking, if we are waiting on a receipt :D</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:pattle.im">Wilko</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The whole SDK has been refactored!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All data objects such as <code>MyUser</code>, <code>Room</code>, etc. are now immutable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <code>MoorStore</code>, which uses <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/moor">moor</a>

<p>The <code>SqfliteStore</code> (was in a separate package) is now deprecated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>LocalUser</code> has been renamed to <code>MyUser</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And a <em>lot</em> of other changes!</p>
<h4 id="how-it-works">How it works</h4>
<p>The user has a stream of <code>Update</code>s, <code>user.updates</code>. An <code>Update</code> contains the latest 'snapshot' of data associated with the user. It also contains a <code>delta</code> <code>MyUser</code>, where all properties are <code>null</code>, except those that are changed. For example, if a user started typing in a certain room, and we're syncing, there will be an <code>Update</code> in <code>user.updates</code>, where <code>delta</code> has 1 <code>Room</code> in <code>delta.rooms</code>, with only the room where the user started typing, reflected in <code>room.typingUserIds</code>. All other properties of the <code>Room</code> will be null. This is all assuming that this is the only change in the sync. If more happened, it will be reflected in <code>delta</code>.</p>

<h3 id="new-bot-to-share-jitsi-call-urls">New bot to share Jitsi call URLs</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a bot to share Jitsi call URLs. The main objective is to allow people on the other side of bridges to get the URL for a jitsi call. When a jitsi widget is added to a room (v2 widget from riot-web) it will post a message with the plain jitsi URL. It also provides a !jitsi command which allows people to create a jitsi call with a custom URL, and if the bot has permission it will be added as a widget in the matrix room. It has a bunch of other config options you can tweak it with. The main thing you might find it useful for if you are not in a bridged room is you can use it to quickly add a jitsi widget for any conference URL. The bot can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/skill-jitsi/">https://github.com/Cadair/skill-jitsi/</a> and it uses the opsdroid framework. I have also hosted a version @jitsibot:cadair.com</p>

        <div>
            <p>On April 14th, the Spec Core Team conducted a long-overdue retrospective
about the things that were working in the
<a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">Matrix Spec Proposal process</a>,
and those that were not.</p>
<p>The most glaring item on the list was the sluggish pace that many Matrix
Spec Changes (MSCs) take throughout the proposal process, as well as the
general lack of activity from the Spec Core Team members on proposals that
have not yet started a Final Comment Period.</p>
<p>We deeply apologize for the frustration this has likely caused many MSC
authors, and want to shed some light on the reasoning behind it, and what we
plan to do to prevent leaving authors in the dark about why there may be no
Spec Core Team activity on their proposal.</p>
<h2 id="proposal-triaging">Proposal Triaging</h2>
<p>There are currently 136 open MSCs that have yet to undergo Final Comment
Period (FCP), 75 of which are marked as proposal-in-review, and 20 that have
a FCP proposed. Relative to the 65 MSCs that have ever been closed, this is a
lot of outstanding ideas, features and maintenance changes.</p>
<p>The Spec Core Team itself is made up of 8 members, each of which have
separate full-time jobs. All team members are well-placed to be on the team
given their wide breadth of knowledge across the Matrix ecosystem,
however the majority are some of the most busy pushing forward Matrix's
reference implementations - without which, Matrix will unquestionably fail.
This limits the amount of MSCs that the team can effectively work on at a
given time.</p>
<p>The team understands that there are MSCs that provide incredibly useful
features, such as
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2191">support for LaTeX in messages</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">the ability to &quot;knock&quot; on rooms</a>,
and would undoubtedly like to see them land at some point.</p>
<p>But there is also a large backlog of MSCs that provide even more fundamental
fixes and additions to the protocol that the team needs to prioritise. These
include things like
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2472">cross-signing devices</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">the communities rewrite</a> and
finally merging
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849">reactions and edits</a> into the spec.</p>
<p>While we announce what MSCs we're focusing on during a given week during
<a href="https://matrix.org/twim">TWIM</a>, it's not as clear which items we're looking
to pull from the backlog next. To help tackle this, and to help keep us
honest, we've begun putting each MSC into either &quot;feature&quot;, &quot;maintenance&quot;, or
&quot;core&quot; buckets. This materialises in the form of github tags, which can be
used to filter the list of MSCs like so:
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%3Afeature">feature</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%3Amaintenance">maintenance</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%3Acore">core</a>.
For a given timespan, we‚Äôll pick a track and pull MSCs out of that category
when possible. More information about MSC categories are now detailed on
<a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals#categories">the proposals page</a>.</p>
<p>As for the next 6 to 12 months, we plan to work on items from the ‚Äúcore‚Äù
category. We need to get Matrix to a point where it can compete with other,
proprietary chat protocols and items in &quot;core&quot; are decidedly the proposals
that will take us the furthest in that direction. This doesn't mean we won't
occasionally look at an MSC in a different category, but it will heavily
influence our prioritisation.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>We'll try this approach out over the next few months and see how it goes. The
next Spec Core Team retro will occur in the middle of May, where we will
review the process once again.</p>
<p>For now, if you have any feedback please come and chat with us in
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> :)</p>

<p>Last week</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shipped <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/23/synapse-1-12-4-released">1.12.4</a> a patch release to fix some cross signing related bugs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redis support to replace our existing cross replication system, merged to develop. This is a precursor to the sharding project. We have a PR to support cache invalidation across workers which, once merged should make it relatively easy to pull off event persistence from the master process. Just removing event persistence could give some decent perf wins, but the prize is then splitting persistence to run across across multiple workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A final PR to support SSO for user interactive auth will merge imminently, thereby freeing up full cross signing support for worker installs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aside from that we‚Äôve been working on fixing a weird bug where rooms can end up with zero forward extremities and generally showing Sygnal some love. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upcoming</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Put Redis into production</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ship 1.13.0 which will contain Redis support as well as a host of SSO bug fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge our new caching config logic to give finer granularity on cache settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge cache invalidation and try to get events persistence running in its own worker.</p>
</li>

<p>This week I worked a lot on getting the first bit of federation working. My goal was to query the public room list of another server and forward it to a client.</p>
<p>This involved setting up a keypair to sign the json I send to the server and putting authorization headers into my requests. Most of the work is already done and <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/">https://federationtester.matrix.org/</a> reports it's all good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sadly there seems to be a problem with the signing, because other homeservers reject requests: <code>Unable to verify signature: &lt;class 'nacl.exceptions.BadSignatureError'&gt; Signature was forged or corrupt</code>. I'll continue to work on this in the next week(s).</p>

<p>Dendrite now supports perspective key fetching as a configurable option, and will automatically attempt to use the perspective key servers for keys that couldn't be fetched directly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now uses a newer version of the Sarama library</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some caching has been added to the roomserver API for room versions, which should help quite a bit with performance over federation and handling transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auth checks for <code>/send_join</code> are now quite a bit more robust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed where the default state filter limited the amount of room state that was visible after a join</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gomatrixserverlib has quite a bit of new support for backfilling now, which will be wired into Dendrite soon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gomatrixserverlib has new primitives for v2 invite responses and <code>/get_missing_events</code> requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite support is being worked on currently, which should also enable support for creating DMs in Riot</p>

<p>A Matrix homeserver written in Rust <a href="https://conduit.rs">https://conduit.rs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I spent some time improving Riot support. Now there should be a lot less warnings and some new features: typing events, read receipts, better room directory, invites, user search.</p>
<p>The only bigger bug that exists currently is that the message history is not automatically loaded when you join a room.  Sometimes reloading the page helps, but not always. The reason for that is that Riot calls the deprecated /initialSync endpoint, which I do not support (I hope someone works on Riot to fix that).</p>
<p>In the next few weeks I plan to improve the single-homeserver experience further and add permission management, while also working on federation.</p>
<p>Check out the repository on <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit">https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit</a> and our Matrix room on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:koesters.xyz">#conduit:koesters.xyz</a>. If you want to try out the server yourself, you can try to connect to it using <a href="https://riot.nordgedanken.de/#/register">https://riot.nordgedanken.de/#/register</a> (though it might be offline when you read this).</p>

<p>I tested the performance of Conduit yesterday by running a ruma client that sends a /send request in a for loop 10k times, which took ~46.8 seconds (all locally on my pc). This means the server can handle ~210 /sends per second under these circumstances.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We continue to focus on performance and spent a good chunk of time improving worker replication test coverage to build confidence that our upcoming changes will work as expected. Erik has been working on how to how to factor out cache invalidation which is now starting to take good shape. Once we have that, factoring out things like event persistence are next on the horizon. </p>
<p>Aside from that we‚Äôve been working with the Riot client teams as they near release for cross signing, fixing bugs and improving performance on key actions.</p>
<p>SSO support continues to improve, and more fixes for user inactive auth for worker'd installs will land next week. Poor old Rich has been banging his head against a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7206">sync bug</a> blocking develop, but hopefully he has broken its back now, and we'll get that merged asap.</p>

<p><strong>Update from Jason:</strong></p>
<p>The Construct server made significant progress this week with end-to-end encryption, client compatibility, application services support, and build-related enhancements. I'd like to thank <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@yan:yetanothernerd.xyz">Yan Minari</a> for contributing spec-compliant code paths for application services in the user registration system. Special thanks this week to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@qy:cs.xa0.uk">Tony O.</a> for continued work on the NixOS (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nix:matrix.org">#nix:matrix.org</a>) derivation for reproducible builds, in addition to contributing fixes to Nio for optimal compatibility with Construct. I'd also like to thank <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@weebl:matrix.weebl.me">Wessel</a> for contributing a much needed reorganization of the Dockerfiles in preparation for Construct operating on many more platforms. Many thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> for working with the team this week in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net">#test:zemos.net</a> on various compatibility fixes to mtxclient and Nheko; the responsiveness when using Nheko with Construct is mind-blowing. I'd also like to thank <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@david:vovo.id.au">David Vo (a.k.a. auscompgeek)</a> for also contributing to Nio toward Construct compatibility.</p>
<p>Finally, I owe much appreciation to tulir, jochen, qy and others for setting up brand new installations this week and providing feedback in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net">#test:zemos.net</a>. Construct is the first and only federating alternative to Synapse. It is written in C++ for maximum performance, the lowest possible TCO, and designed for horizontal scaling with Construct Cluster.

<p>Which includes a bunch of small fixes, including a performance improvement to <code>StateLookup</code> hits. Apparently it's bad to hit the homeserver with 1000s of concurrent /state requests on startup. <strong>Most importantly</strong> it also includes a critical fix to the <code>addAppServicePath</code> function, which previously did not authenticate requests, see the CHANGELOG for more information on that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A clickable command-line client Matrix written in Rust. Although, still in the early stages, enough has been implemented to show a working demo. <code>rumatui</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs">tui</a> to power the UI and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk">matrix-rust-sdk</a> for all communication with the server. So far the message formatting has been the most visually satisfying feature, although implementing it was not much fun.

<p>0.7.0 will contain a lot of work, including replies, e2ee attachments and a completely rewritten timeline (the full changelog is too big for TWIM, but you can find it in the github releases). It also fixes a lot of issues. We should probably released it a lot earlier, but we always had one more feature we wanted to finish... For the future we plan to do smaller, more regular releases!</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts-thought-balloon">Final Thoughts üí≠</h2>
<p>While discussing the use of QML in Nheko, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aa13q:matrix.org">aa13q</a> became extremely energised, so I'm including this piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Qt/QML fanboy here, feel free to skip, just a love letter to the framework :D</p>
<p>Qt/QML is super-awesome, it's hard to describe how pretty declarative syntax is and how beautiful MVC approach with native Qt C++ side integration %) It is very hard to contribute to HTML/CSS/JS projects when you have seen QML once.</p>
<p>Talking about resources, there are even projects for very low-level embedded boards with arm cortex m7 core [1,2]</p>
<p>I'm actually thinking Qt is the bright future of very wide development areas. I'm both frightened and intrigued looking at relatively low popularity of the project. Since I want it to live and prosper even more but afraid of the possible mistakes for even harder tasks. The better popularity of the project will be harder to coordinate and the future tasks will be even harder. Similar to other cool projects (like matrix! :) I guess it's very challenging to balance between running as hard as you can and not to &quot;die&quot; from exhaustion %)</p>
<p>I don't even know is there something similar comparing to the Qt project, that's also why I'm worried about the future of the project %) </p>
<p>So-called software crisis (the late 60s ‚Äì mid-80s [3,4]) was successfully overcome by introducing Object-Oriented Programming (it's always funny to see some people who are more into functional programming hates OOP in that context [5]) And notably Alan Kay is not only OOP pioneer (Smalltalk language) but also a first GUI applications developer. While the current OOP languages like Java and C++ are quite imperative, OOP is not only about the objects but also about the messages between them (Smalltalk is probably a nice example here too).</p>
<p>Qt in that context restores interesting balance to quite imperative C++ introducing the so-called meta-object system (for the messaging between objects). After that in ~Qt5, the declarative QML approach was introduced to develop these ideas even more. Not only GUI subject matter could be expressed with QML (like Qt Quick), but the others too (for example, QBS build system).</p>
<p>Sorry for typos and poor style, not a native speaker :) And I could be wrong in my views.</p>

<p>This week we held the first in a series of <em>virtual meetup</em> events, <strong>Open Tech Will Save Us</strong>.</p>
<p>We were really excited to make this event <em>feel</em> like a real meetup - with a live chat, and interactivity from the chance to ask questions of the speakers. There was a great response, with participants in a 100+ user room chatting about the talks and generally adding to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Lineup included:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/saghul">Sa√∫l Ibarra Corretg√©</a> from Jitsi on the rapid growth they've experienced since the start of the 2020 crisis

<blockquote>
<p>This week was really successful for the homeserver project. Not only does event sending and syncing work properly, but creating/joining rooms, state events and the public room directory works as well.  But the biggest archievement I made this week is Riot support.</p>
<p>Big thanks to MTRNord for fixing bugs in Riot web and deploying an instance of Riot with all patches applied and to jplatte and @iinuwa for improving the ruma libraries.</p>
<p>Today we did the first actual test of the new homeserver. We had ~5 people sending and syncing messages in a room and all of them were able to send messages almost instantly. We'll see how well that scales when we implement federation in the future.</p>
<p>Check out the repository on <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit">https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit</a> and our Matrix room on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:koesters.xyz">#conduit:koesters.xyz</a>.

<p>The main focus continues to be performance and we are starting to make good progress in figuring out how to split out and shard the event streams. This is a project where most of the bang will come all at once, rather than there being multiple small incremental improvements. </p>
<p>Aside from that we continue to improve the SSO experience, landing UIA support for CAS providers. We also made a small change to the default behaviour so that only room admins can enable e2ee (applies to new rooms only).</p>
<p>Next week, is more of the same. Expect a few short term performance improvements (specifically to help with cross signing UX) and more SSO support.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks there's been huge increase in interest from folks
wanting the security and autonomy of running their remote collaboration
services, rather than being at the mercy of traditional proprietary
centralised apps.  Meanwhile, the Matrix.org homeserver has been very
overloaded (although we're at last making excellent progress in radically
improving Synapse's performance) - so it's particularly important right now to
help folks run their own servers.</p>
<p>Therefore we're very happy to announce that it's easier than ever before now to
self-host your own video conferencing alongside Riot &amp; Synapse: as of Riot/Web
1.5.15 (released last week), it's now a single config option to point Riot at
a specific Jitsi rather than needing to hook up to an integration manager!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over the last 18 months, it's got easier and easier to run your
own Matrix deployments: the Debian packages are unrecognisably better now, and
with <code>.well-known</code> URL support it's trivial to set up federation without
needing to worry about complicated DNS, TLS or load balancer configurations.</p>
<p>So, to try to show off just how smooth this has become, we thought we'd do a
run-through video showing installing Synapse, Riot &amp; Jitsi on a completely
fresh Debian install.  It's (almost) filmed in a single shot, and takes about
20 minutes from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Please note that this does assume you're pretty familiar with Linux system
administration.  If you're not, then we'd recommend using a Matrix hosting
provider such as <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a> (which directly supports development of the core team),
<a href="https://ungleich.ch/u/products/hosted-matrix-chat/">Ungleich.ch</a>, or <a href="https://startupstack.tech/">StartupStack</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, while the video shows how to install on Debian via Debian packages,
there are many many other environments and architectures (e.g. installing
under Docker) - this is just one relatively easy way to skin the cat.  Perhaps
there will be other 'speed-run' videos in future :)</p>

<p>If you want to follow along at home without listening to the video (and I can't blame you if you do ;) the high level steps are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="debian-dns">Debian &amp; DNS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Take one fresh Debian 10 install.</li>
<li>Point the DNS for your domain to it.  You should use separate subdomains for the various services as a hygiene measure to make cross-site scripting attacks less effective.  In this example, we set up DNS for:
<ul>
<li><code>dangerousdemos.net</code> (general website, and for hosting a .well-known path to advertise the Matrix service)</li>
<li><code>matrix.dangerousdemos.net</code> (Synapse)</li>
<li><code>riot.dangerousdemos.net</code> (Riot/Web)</li>
<li><code>jitsi.dangerousdemos.net</code> (Jitsi video conferencing)</li>
<li>In practice, we used a <code>*.dangerousdemos.net</code> wildcard DNS record for the three subdomains in this instance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nginx-and-letsencrypt">Nginx and LetsEncrypt</h3>
<ul>
<li>Install nginx as a webserver: <code>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt -y install nginx</code></li>
<li>Go to <code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled</code> and copy the vhost configuration block from the bottom of <code>default</code> to new files called <code>dangerousdemos.net</code>, <code>matrix.dangerousdemos.net</code>, and <code>riot.dangerousdemos.net</code>.  We don't set up <code>jitsi.dangerousdemos.net</code> at this point as the jitsi installer handles it for us.
<ul>
<li>Rename the <code>server_name</code> field in the new files to match the hostname of each host, and point <code>root</code> to an appropriate location per domain (e.g. <code>/var/www/dangerousdemos.net</code> for the main domain, or <code>/var/www/riot.dangerousdemos.net/riot</code> for riot)</li>
<li>For the Synapse domain (<code>matrix.dangerousdemos.net</code> here), you should replace the contents of the <code>location</code> block with <code>proxy_pass http://localhost:8008;</code> - telling nginx to pass the traffic through to synapse, which listens by default for plaintext HTTP traffic on port 8008.  (N.B. do <strong>not</strong> put a trailing slash on the URL here, otherwise nginx will mangle the forwarded URLs.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enable TLS via LetsEncrypt on nginx, by: <code>apt install -y python3-certbot-nginx &amp;&amp; certbot --nginx -d dangerousdemos.net -d riot.dangerousdemos.net -d matrix.dangerousdemos.net</code> (or whatever your domains are).</li>
<li>You should be able to go to https://dangerousdemos.net at this point and see a page with valid HTTPS.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<ul>
<li>Then, install Synapse via Debian packages using the instructions at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md#debianubuntu (see below).  If you're not on Debian, keep an eye out for all the other OSes we support too!
<ul>
<li>You should specify the server name to be the domain you want in your matrix IDs - i.e. <code>dangerousdemos.net</code> in this example.</li>
<li>Please report anonymous aggregate stats to us so we can gauge uptake and help justify funding for Matrix!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>sudo apt install -y lsb-release wget apt-transport-https
</span><span>sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/matrix-org-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.matrix.org/debian/matrix-org-archive-keyring.gpg
</span><span>echo &quot;deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/matrix-org-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.matrix.org/debian/ $(lsb_release -cs) main&quot; |
</span><span>    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list
</span><span>sudo apt update
</span><span>sudo apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You should now be able to go to https://matrix.dangerousdemos.net and see a valid &quot;It works! Synapse is running&quot; page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, you should enable registration on your synapse by switching <code>enable_registration: true</code> in <code>/etc/matrix-synapse/homeserver.yaml</code> and restarting synapse via <code>systemctl restart matrix-synapse</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you need to tell the rest of Matrix how to find your server.  The easiest way to do this is to publish a file at https://dangerousdemos.net/.well-known/matrix/server which tells everyone the hostname and port where they can find the synapse for dangerousdemos.net - in this instance, it's <code>matrix.dangerousdemos.net:443</code>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>mkdir -p /var/www/dangerousdemos.net/.well-known/matrix
</span><span>cd /var/www/dangerousdemos.net/.well-known/matrix
</span><span>echo &#39;{ &quot;m.server&quot;: &quot;matrix.dangerousdemos.net:443&quot; }&#39; &gt; server
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternatively</strong>, you could advertise the server via DNS, if you don't have write access to <code>/.well-known</code> on your main domain.  However, to prove you are allowed to host the Matrix traffic for dangerousdemos.net, you would have to configure nginx to use the dangerousdemos.net TLS certificate for the matrix.dangerousdemos.net vhost (i.e. the &quot;wrong&quot; one), and in general we think that <code>/.well-known</code> is much easier to reason about.  In this case you would advertise the server with an SRV record like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>_matrix._tcp.dangerousdemos.net. 300    IN  SRV 10 5 443 matrix.dangerousdemos.net.
</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="riot-web">Riot/Web</h3>
<ul>
<li>Then, install Riot/Web.  Grab the latest .tgz release from https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases.  You should check its GnuPG signature too:</li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>mkdir /var/www/riot.dangerousdemos.net
</span><span>cd /var/www/riot.dangerousdemos.net
</span><span>wget https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases/download/v1.5.15/riot-v1.5.15.tar.gz
</span><span>
</span><span># check its GnuPG signature (particularly advisable, given Riot is what stores
</span><span># your end-to-end encryption keys)
</span><span>apt install -y gnupg
</span><span>wget https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases/download/v1.5.15/riot-v1.5.15.tar.gz.asc
</span><span>
</span><span># grab the signing key for the riot releases repository, ideally from a keyserver...
</span><span>gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --search-keys releases@riot.im
</span><span>
</span><span># ...and/or you can grab or cross-check the signing key from packages.riot.im
</span><span>wget https://packages.riot.im/riot-release-key.asc
</span><span>gpg --import riot-release-key.asc
</span><span>
</span><span>gpg --verify riot-v1.5.15.tar.gz.asc
</span><span># hopefully this will report &quot;Good signature&quot;, even though it won&#39;t know to trust the riot release key.
</span><span>
</span><span># you could also choose to explicitly trust the key by editing it, entering &#39;trust&#39; and then &#39;5&#39; for ultimate trust.
</span><span>gpg --edit-key 74692659bda3d940
</span><span>
</span><span>tar -xzvf riot-v1.5.15.tar.gz
</span><span>ln -s riot-v1.5.15 riot
</span><span>chown www-data:www-data -R riot
</span><span>cd riot
</span><span>cp config.sample.json config.json
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>You then tweak the <code>config.json</code> to change the <code>base_url</code> of the homeserver to be <code>https://matrix.dangerousdemos.net</code> (i.e. where to find the Client Server API for your server), and change the <code>server_name</code> to be <code>dangerousdemos.net</code> (i.e. the name of your server).</li>
<li>You should then be able to go to https://riot.dangerousdemos.net, register for an account, sign in, and talk to the rest of Matrix!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jitsi">Jitsi</h3>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we install Jitsi so you can run your own video conferencing.  We take the instructions from <a href="https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/quick-install.md">Jitsi's quick install guide</a>:</li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>echo &#39;deb https://download.jitsi.org stable/&#39; &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list
</span><span>wget -qO -  https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
</span><span>apt-get update
</span><span>apt-get -y install jitsi-meet
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We give the installer the hostname <code>jitsi.dangerousdemos.net</code>.  <strong>Make sure this DNS is already set up, otherwise the installer will fail!</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The installer magically detects you have nginx installed and adds in an appropriate vhost!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We select a self-signed certificate for now, and then upgrade it to LetsEncrypt after the fact with <code>/usr/share/jitsi-meet/scripts/install-letsencrypt-cert.sh</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, you could have specified manual certificates, and then used <code>certbot</code> alongside the rest of nginx to create a certificate for <code>jitsi.dangerousdemos.net</code> - both work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should now be able to go to https://jitsi.dangerousdemos.net and use the Jitsi directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, and this is the cool new bit: you can now point Riot to use the new Jitsi by going to its config.json at <code>/var/www/riot.dangerousdemos.net/riot/config.json</code> and changing the <code>preferredDomain</code> of the <code>jitsi</code> block from <code>https://jitsi.riot.im</code> to your own self-hosted <code>https://jitsi.dangerousdemos.net</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You then refresh your Riot/Web, and you should be all set to use Jitsi from within your new Riot - as Riot/Web 1.5.15 and later has the ability to natively embed Jitsi straight into the app without needing to use an integration manager.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Matrix nowadays provides an excellent alternative to the centralised solutions.  It gives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full autonomy over how to host and store your own conversations</li>
<li>Full freedom to talk to anyone else on the wider global Matrix network (or indeed anyone else bridged into Matrix)</li>
<li>Full privacy via full end-to-end-encryption for chats, file transfer and 1:1 voice/video calls (when enabled)</li>
<li>Full transparency by being 100% open source (as well as benefiting from the overall open source community)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this gives some confidence that it's pretty easy to run your own fully functional Matrix instance these days.
If not, then hopefully someone will do a similar one to show off Docker!
And if that's still too scary, please take a look at a hosting services like <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a>.</p>

<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p>Update from Jason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>End-to-end encryption support has landed in Construct. The server now supports cross-signing, secret storage, and key backups for clients. I'm pleased with how this all came together on schedule for the upcoming transition to e2ee by default for Matrix. If you haven't been paying attention in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> last week full support for push-rules including efficient highlight-counting also landed. Next week Application Service support is scheduled.</p>
<p>Construct is quickly nearing complete coverage over the full breadth of the Matrix protocol, and the transition into release packaging is fast approaching. Construct is the C++ homeserver built for maximum performance with the lowest possible cost of ownership. If you're in need of a faster homeserver please show your support in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> and tell all your friends to lend a hand today!</p>

<h3 id="new-rust-homeserver">New Rust Homeserver</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! This week I worked on a Matrix homeserver written in Rust. Registering and logging in works already and I am currently adding support for sending events and inserting them into the event graph. I spent most of my time reading the Matrix specification to understand how this process works, because with federation (which I plan to add to my homeserver in the future) servers might disagree on which event was created first and there are strictly defined rules to resolve this. The Matrix homeserver uses the Ruma libraries as it's base and handles requests and responses using the Rocket crate. I use sled to store information as (key, value) pairs in a database. Most of these libraries are still experimental and I take this attitude myself by straying off from the reference implementations and changing algorithms in hopes of better performance.

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-asmux">mautrix-asmux</a> wasn't made this week, but I haven't mentioned it on TWIM before. Basically, it acts as a proxy between appservices and the homeserver. The primary point is to make it possible to dynamically provision appservices.</p>
<p>The dynamically provisioned appservices connect to mautrix-asmux with individual access tokens, which asmux checks and then proxies the requests to Synapse with its own global access token. Synapse is only aware of one appservice, which will have a large user ID and alias namespace (e.g. everything starting with <code>_</code>). In the other direction, mautrix-asmux maintains a room ID -&gt; appservice mapping, which it uses to send incoming events to the correct appservice. As a side effect, mautrix-asmux implements <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2190">MSC2190</a>, which is needed for end-to-bridge encryption.</p>

<p>Hey folks! I've not posted a proper bridge update in a while, so let's go into another project that isn't a bridge. I've started working on a new project called <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/node-jitsi">node-jitsi</a>, which will allow people to connect their services to Jitsi Meet conferences. It's designed to allow bridges to start bridging across actual calls into Matrix via Jitsi, but could really be used by any project which is Node.JS based and wants Jitsi call functionality. The goal is to keep the interface clean and simple, and do all of the heavy lifting (WebRTC negotiations, XMPP handling) itself.</p>
<p>Currently the project has just started, although progress should hopefully be swift! Come check us out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#node-jitsi:half-shot.uk">#node-jitsi:half-shot.uk</a> and get chatting</p>

<p>The Quotient project has made two &quot;sustaining&quot; releases this week, and then three^Wfour more to fix foolish mistakes - right on the Fools' Day! Long story short - if you're on Quaternion 0.0.9.4* (with any trailing letter) and, respectively, libQMatrixClient 0.5.x, make sure to upgrade to <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.9.4e">Quaternion 0.0.9.4e</a> and <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.5.3.2">libQMatrixClient 0.5.3.2</a> because, as of this writing, these are the latest and fixedest in the breed. Aside from many backend bugfixes (mostly described in <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.5.3">release notes from 0.5.3</a>), this refreshed pair can handle SSO and no more interferes with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a> in encrypted rooms. Further plans include scrapping the whole Quotient thing and switch to Python because it's so much easier. Just kidding :) the plans didn't change, Quotient 0.6 is the next milestone, and the backend for the next Quaternion release. And you won't need to wait another year for them, I promise.</p>

<p>We released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/03/23/synapse-1-12-0-released">1.12.0</a> this week which contains some decent performance wins. Our theme for the moment is to continue working on performance, and the sharding project is starting to make some real progress. Hopefully we get onto breaking out event persistence next week.</p>
<p>Aside from that you'll see a lot of work to improve SSO support, in particular the ability for SSO and User Interactive Auth to work together is just around the corner. </p>
<p>Sorry for all the matrix.org slowness, we're doing everything we can!</p>

<ul>
<li>The image overlay you get, when you click on an image, should now stay out of your way, when downloading an image (adasauce)</li>
<li>Nheko now shouldn't show a console on launch on Windows anymore (abma)</li>
<li>Typing notifications now won't sanitize users twice. This shouldn't increase Corona infections, just make special characters like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&amp;</code> show up correctly, so you can put more <code>&lt;3</code> into your names. (Emi)</li>
<li>A lot of edge cases, where avatars didn't show up correctly were fixed. One issue with dynamic thumbnailing and synapse is still waiting for a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7124">synapse pr</a> to be merged.</li>
<li>If you restart your server, Nheko should now use less CPU in the time the server is down. It may take a bit longer to reconnect though.</li>

<p>It also has a locale system. You can set locales with <code>!reminder locale &lt;list of locales&gt;</code>. The system is fairly simple: it just tries to parse the input with each locale in the order specified and uses the first match. It doesn't have many locales so far, so contributions are welcome if you're not afraid of regexes (contributions for reducing the number of regexes are also welcome :D)</p>
