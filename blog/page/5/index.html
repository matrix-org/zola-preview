</div>
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>We just wanted to take a moment to welcome <a href="https://rocket.chat">Rocket.Chat</a> to Matrix, given the <a href="https://rocket.chat/press-releases/rocket-chat-leverages-matrix-protocol-for-decentralized-and-interoperable-communications">recent announcement</a> that they are switching to using Matrix for standards-based interoperable federation!  This is incredible news: Rocket.Chat is one of the leading open source collaboration platforms with <a href="https://rocket.chat/company/about-us">over 12 million users</a>, and they will all shortly have the option to natively interoperate with the wider Matrix network: the feature has already landed (in alpha) in <a href="https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases/tag/4.7.0">Rocket.Chat 4.7.0</a>!</p>
<p>We‚Äôd like to thank the whole Rocket.Chat team for putting their faith in Matrix and joining the network: the whole idea of Matrix is that by banding together, different independent organisations can build an open decentralised network which is far stronger and more vibrant than any closed communication platform.  The more organisations that join Matrix, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">more useful and valuable</a> the network becomes for everyone, and the more momentum there is to further refine and improve the protocol.  Our intention is that Matrix will grow into a massive open ecosystem and industry, akin to the open Web itself‚Ä¶ and that every organisation participating, be that Rocket.Chat, Element, Gitter, Beeper, Famedly or anyone else will benefit from being part of it. We are stronger together!</p>
<p>Rocket.Chat‚Äôs implementation follows the ‚Äú<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix#how-do-you-make-an-existing-chat-system-talk-matrix">How do you make an existing chat system talk Matrix?</a>‚Äù approach we published based on our experiences of linking Gitter into Matrix. Looking at the initial <a href="https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23688">pull request</a>, the implementation lets Rocket.Chat act as a Matrix Application Service, effectively acting as a bridge to talk to an appropriate Matrix homeserver.  From chatting with the team, it sounds like next steps will involve adding in encryption via our upcoming <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/699">matrix-sdk-crypto node bindings</a> - and then looking at ways to transparently embed a homeserver like Dendrite, sharing data as much as possible between RC and Matrix, so Rocket.Chat deployments can transparently sprout Matrix interoperability without having to run a separate homeserver.  Super exciting!</p>
<p>You can see a quick preview of a Rocket.Chat user chatting away with an Element user on matrix.org via Matrix here:</p>
<p><video style="width: 100%" src="/blog/img/164530391-e8b17ecd-a4d0-4ef8-a8b7-81230c1773d3.mp4" controls></video></p>
<p>So, exciting times ahead - needless to say we‚Äôll be doing everything we can to support Rocket.Chat and ensure their Matrix integration is a success.  And at this rate, they might be distinctly ahead of the curve if they start shipping Dendrite!  Meanwhile, we have to wonder who will be next? Nextcloud? Mattermost? Place your bets‚Ä¶ ;)</p>

<p>The 16th edition of our virtual meetup Open Tech Will Save Us happened this week! This edition featured a few very interesting projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quentin and Maximilien from Deuxfleurs are creating Garage, a robust and distributed storage backend that can run on old computers. Who can use it? Why? And when should I not use it? Let's find out!</li>
<li>Nathan from the Guardian Project is working with wind, butter, and rasperries to provide applications and messaging to people in low-connectivity areas. A fascinating dive off the grid.</li>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2872">MSC2872: Move the widget title to the top level of the definition</a>!</p>
<p>A bite-size MSC which aims to clean up the definition of a widget state event... by moving the &quot;title&quot; field to the root of the state event, alongside the existing &quot;name&quot; field.</p>
<p>This MSC needs someone to write an implementation in at least one homeserver and client to move forwards. Perhaps that someone could be you?</p>

<li>Dendrite can now assist remote users to join restricted rooms via <code>/make_join</code> and <code>/send_join</code></li>
<li>The sync API no longer returns immediately on <code>/sync</code> requests unnecessarily if it can be avoided</li>
<li>A race condition has been fixed in the sync API when updating presence via <code>/sync</code></li>
<li>A race condition has been fixed sending E2EE keys to remote servers over federation when joining rooms</li>
<li>The <code>trusted_private_chat</code> preset should now grant power level 100 to all participant users, which should improve the user experience of direct messages</li>
<li>Invited users are now authed correctly in restricted rooms</li>
<li>The <code>join_authorised_by_users_server</code> key is now correctly stripped in restricted rooms when updating the membership event</li>
<li>Appservices should now receive invite events correctly</li>
<li>Device list updates should no longer contain optional fields with <code>null</code> values</li>
<li>The <code>/deactivate</code> endpoint has been fixed to no longer confuse Element with incorrect completed flows</li>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We added a way to edit permissions in Nheko now. It is an unconventional drag and drop dialog, where you drag users and permissions between different roles. We are hoping that this will make powerlevels easier to understand. Be careful when trying it, the wrong powerlevels might make your room unusable. Now... the bad part about that is, that powerlevels add around 50-100 new strings to translate... Help is appreciated! &lt;3</p>
<p>Nheko now also supports fallback keys, which should make E2EE more reliable after long periods of being offline and you can send images by pressing enter again. The privacy screen is also now fixed for separate room windows and our flatpak supports more image formats.

The latter is used for fragmented timelines: If you want to show a timeline starting from any <code>EventId</code> and <code>RoomId</code> (e. g. from unread marker), Trixnity will try to fetch missing <code>TimelineEvent</code>s from server. If you reach <code>TimelineEvent</code>s, that are already saved in the local database, the timeline fragments are merged magically üßô</p>

<p>A set of Rust library crates for working with the Matrix protocol. Ruma‚Äôs approach to Matrix emphasizes correctness, security, stability and performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net">K√©vin Commaille</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since our last update from about a month ago, we had two bugfix releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruma 0.6.2 added methods to get the current room powerlevels from a <code>StrippedPowerLevelsEvent</code> and to get a user's membership whether the state event is redacted or not, and added a missing export to track member changes.</li>
<li>Ruma 0.6.3 fixed the serialization and deserialization of events with a dynamic <code>event_type</code> and added convenience constructors for logging in with a <code>UserIdentifier</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also landed a bunch of internal work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvement in our macros, notably to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1109">support unstable prefixes for event types</a>.</li>
<li>Some cleanup like removing some dead code, removing unnecessary <code>PartialEq</code> implementations, and fixing missing feature flags.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1109/commits/1cae9d253bb43c9ad8699cd3b59b89da23bd0e73">minimum supported rust version is now 1.59</a> and we use the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1137">Rust 2021 Edition</a>.</li>
<li>We started to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1132">refactor our tests</a> to have more helpful failure messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are of course new fixes and features for our next release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1114">push rules don't apply to the user's own events</a></li>
<li>Add support for <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1112">MSC3700: Ignore <code>content.sender_key</code></a></li>
<li>Implement <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1131">MSC3381: Polls</a></li>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Some new MSCs popping up this week around widgets, room types, fixing notifications with threads and room version 11! Though note that the last one currently serves as a means for the Spec Core Team to publicly track what should be included in room version 11, and is by no means is its content considered final.</p>
<p>The Spec Core Team are currently focused on room version 10 and getting Matrix v1.3 out the door soon. There's also been some discussion on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676: Message editing</a> this week, with the intention of finally landing that in the spec. Thanks to richvdh for driving the charge there.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1902">MSC1902: Split the media repo into s2s and c2s parts</a>!</p>
<p>Homeservers currently make use of Client Server Media APIs to pull media from other homeservers over federation. This has worked for a long time, but is a bit of a confusing blur of the lines between client&lt;-&gt;server and server&lt;-&gt;server traffic. It also makes it difficult to require different authentication rules for clients versus servers.</p>
<p>This MSC aims to help clean that up. Take a look if you're interested!

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week's <code>testing</code> updates are now in <code>master</code>!</p>
<p>Also included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better error handling:</strong> if the backend hits an error that causes your connection to KT chats to be dropped, the bridge should notify you about it (not that it should ever happen in the first place, but you never know!)</li>
<li><strong>Better logging:</strong> the Node module can be configured to print the arguments of RPC commands received from / sent to the Python module.  The example Node config includes a default set that should be helpful for general debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Room metadata bridging:</strong> setting an Open Chat title &amp; topic from Matrix should work now!
<ul>
<li>Setting the title of a Direct Chat should work too, but topics remain unbridged (since KT Direct Chats don't have topics/descriptions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Defensive error handling:</strong> Attempts to add a non-friend user to a DM will be refused by the bridge, since KT only allows Direct Chats between friends
<ul>
<li>KT does allow &quot;1:1 Open Chats&quot; between non-friends, but those aren't bridged yet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, <code>testing</code> adds support for joining KakaoTalk rooms from Matrix, either by joining an existing portal or providing an Open Chat URL to the bot with a <code>join</code> command. ...However, I've been unable to test this, since KT is stingy about whom it allows to join Open Chats!  So please give this a try if you can.</p>
<p>In other news, this bridge is now listed on <a href="https://matrix.org/bridges/#kakaotalk">Matrix.org</a>! ü•≥  Thanks Thib !</p>
<p>Also, for the time being, I will be taking a hiatus from this bridge &amp; the LINE bridge, as I'll be quite occupied for the foreseeable future on account of having joined Element ü§©!!

<p>Release v1.13.0 ü•≥</p>

<li>Improvements to pillifying IRC nicks, again</li>

<li>Fixed compose docker Synapse configuration for registration</li>
<li>Improved Python 3.10 compatibliy (@BtbN)</li>
<li>Hidden room to hide joins using restricted rooms join rule (@BtbN)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some cool stuff this time around! Aside from many bug fixes this release has two great new features: IRC message colors and hiding invites from channels.</p>
<p>IRC colors are enabled by default and are rendered how your Matrix client sees fit. They can be disabled per network if needed.</p>
<p>Hiding joins works with room v9 restricted join rules feture to allow IRC ghosts to join rooms without an invite from the bridge bot first. This clears some clutter and may even make joining a bit faster in the long run - we will see. This feature is disabled by default and needs to be enabled by the bridge administrator as it is consiered a &quot;labs&quot; feature for now.</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.59.0">Synapse 1.59</a> is
out! Let's see what's new in this version.</p>
<h2 id="generic-worker-types">Generic worker types</h2>
<p>When Synapse instances are subject to high load, it can be useful to use workers
to balance the load more effectively. Workers are separate processes that can
take some of the load off the main Synapse process, and allow the homeserver to
scale more effectively.</p>
<p>In the past, Synapse only provided a specific set of types of workers, each
capable of handling a specific set of operations. For some time now we have been
working on allowing more flexibility around worker configuration, which started
all the way back in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/03/23/synapse-1-12-0-released">Synapse
1.12.0</a> with the
introduction of a generic worker application type.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.59 furthers this work by deprecating the <code>synapse.app.appservice</code> and
<code>synapse.app.user_dir</code> worker application types. Homeserver administrators
should change the configuration of instances using these types to the generic
<code>synapse.app.generic_worker</code> application type, and use the
<code>notify_appservices_from_worker</code> and <code>update_user_directory_from_worker</code> to
delegate application service and user directory work (respectively) to a worker.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.59/upgrade.html#deprecation-of-the-synapseappappservice-and-synapseappuser_dir-worker-application-types">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information on this change.</p>
<h2 id="push-rules">Push rules</h2>
<p>Push rules allow Matrix clients to define notification rules on a homeserver.
One often reported issue with notification in Matrix is the fact that
notifications are sent out when server ACLs, which define which server(s) can
and cannot interact in a room, change. This is especially annoying during big
waves of abuse, as there might be multiple servers that need to be banned from
rooms, thus causing a lot of unneeded notifications.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.59 now supports silencing server ACL updates, by implementing the new
push rule documented in
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3786">MSC3786</a>.
However, since this MSC hasn't been incorporated into the spec yet, this
behaviour is disabled by default in Synapse: see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12601">the implementation pull
request</a> for more information
on turning it on.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.59 also allows third-party modules to validate and change the actions
associated with an existing push rule via the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/d24a1486e5c5d69a8798a9d159fd9e06dfc8c3e3/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L1360-L1420">Module
API</a>.
This is helpful for modules wishing to, for example, configuring specific
notification settings when new users register.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>As of Synapse 1.59, Synapse will not communicate the name of devices over
federation (unless configured otherwise), in order to better preserve user
privacy. See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.59/upgrade.html#device-name-lookup-over-federation-has-been-disabled-by-default">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>Also note that we have issued a patch release for 1.59 (1.59.1) which fixes a
long-standing bug that started to bite a good amount of server administrators.
Server admins that are looking into upgrading their instance to Synapse 1.59 are
recommended to upgrade to 1.59.1 rather than 1.59.0.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.59.0">full
changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the

        <div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>It‚Äôs been <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last">quite a while</a> since our last independent E2EE review, and so we‚Äôre incredibly proud to present an <a href="https://matrix.org/media/Least%20Authority%20-%20Matrix%20vodozemac%20Final%20Audit%20Report.pdf">entirely new independent security audit</a> of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac">vodozemac</a>, our next generation native Rust implementation of Matrix‚Äôs <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/blob/master/docs/olm.md">Olm</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/blob/master/docs/megolm.md">Megolm</a> E2EE protocols.  The audit has been conducted by <a href="https://leastauthority.com/">Least Authority</a>, who specialise in <a href="https://leastauthority.com/security-consulting/published-audits/">comprehensive audits</a> of security-sensitive decentralized technologies - and we are very grateful to <a href="https://www.gematik.de/anwendungen/ti-messenger">gematik</a>, who kindly shared the costs of funding the audit as part of their <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/21/germanys-national-healthcare-system-adopts-matrix">commitment to Matrix for healthcare in Germany</a>.</p>
<p>This audit was a bit of a whirlwind, as while we were clearly overdue an audit of Matrix‚Äôs E2EE implementations, we decided quite late in the day to focus on bringing vodozemac to auditable production quality rather than simply doing a refresh of the original <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last">libolm audit</a>.  However, we got there in time, thanks to a monumental sprint from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/graphs/contributors">Damir and Denis</a> over Christmas.  The reason we went this route is that vodozemac is an enormous step change forwards in quality over <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm">libolm</a>, and vodozemac is now the reference Matrix E2EE implementation going forward.  Just as libolm went live with NCC‚Äôs security review back in 2016, similarly we‚Äôre kicking off the first stable release of vodozemac today with Least Authority‚Äôs audit.  In fact, vodozemac just shipped as the default E2EE library in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0">matrix-rust-sdk 0.5</a>, released at the end of last week!</p>
<p>The main advantages of vodozemac over libolm include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native Rust - type, memory and thread safety is preserved both internally, and within the context of larger Rust programs (such as those building on matrix-rust-sdk).  This is particularly important given the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/14/adventures-in-fuzzing-libolm">memory bugs</a> which libolm sprouted, despite our best efforts to the contrary.</li>
<li>Performance - vodozemac benchmarks roughly 5-6x faster than libolm on typical hardware</li>
<li>Better primitives - vodozemac is built on the best practice cryptographic primitives from the Rust community, rather than the generic Brad Conte primitives used by libolm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, we‚Äôve finally fixed one of the biggest problems with libolm - which was that the hardest bit of implementing E2EE in Matrix wasn‚Äôt necessarily the encryption protocol implementation itself, but how you glue it into your Matrix client‚Äôs SDK.  It turns out ~80% of the code and complexity needed to securely implement encryption ends up being in the SDK rather than the Olm implementation - and each client SDK ended up implementing its own independent state machine and glue for E2EE, leading to a needlessly large attack &amp; bug surface.</p>
<p>To address this problem, vodozemac is designed to plug into <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/tree/main/crates/matrix-sdk-crypto">matrix-sdk-crypto</a> - an SDK-independent Rust library which abstracts away the complexities and risks of implementing E2EE, designed to plug into existing SDKs in any language.  For instance, Element Android already <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/3209">supports</a> delegating its encryption to matrix-sdk-crypto; Element iOS got this working too last week, and we‚Äôre <a href="https://github.com/Hywan/matrix-rust-sdk/commits/feat-crypto-wasm">hard at work</a> adding it to Element Web too.  (This set of projects is codenamed Element R).  Meanwhile, <a href="https://youtu.be/chsyOWKvne4">Element X</a> (the project to switch Element iOS and Element Android to use matrix-rust-sdk entirely) obviously benefits from it too, as matrix-rust-sdk now leans on matrix-sdk-crypto for its encryption.</p>
<p>Therefore we highly recommend that developers using libolm migrate over to vodozemac - ideally by switching to matrix-sdk-crypto as a way of managing the interface between Matrix and the E2EE implementation.  Vodozemac does also provides a similar API to libolm with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac-bindings">bindings for JS and Python</a> (and C++ in progress) if you want to link directly against it - e.g. if you‚Äôre using libolm for something other than Matrix, for example XMPP, ActivityPub or Jitsi.  We‚Äôll continue to support and maintain libolm for now though, at least until the majority of folks have switched to vodozemac.</p>
<p>In terms of the audit itself - we recommend <a href="https://matrix.org/media/Least%20Authority%20-%20Matrix%20vodozemac%20Final%20Audit%20Report.pdf">reading it yourself</a>, but the main takeaway is that Least Authority identified 10 valid concerns, of which we addressed 8 during the audit process. The remaining two are valid but lower priority, and we‚Äôll fix them as part of our maintenance backlog.  All the issues identified are excellent valid points, and we‚Äôre very glad that Least Authority have added huge value here by highlighting some subtle gotchas which we‚Äôd missed.  (If you write Rust, you‚Äôll particularly want to check out their zeroisation comments).</p>
<p>So: exciting times!  Vodozemac should be landing in a Matrix client near you in the near future - we‚Äôll yell about it loudly once Element switches over.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please head over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#e2ee:matrix.org">#e2ee:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks again to gematik for helping fund the audit, and to Least Authority for doing an excellent job - and being patient and accommodating beyond the call of duty when we suddenly switched the scope from libolm to vodozemac at the last minute ;)</p>
<p>Next up: we‚Äôre going to get the Rust matrix-sdk-crypto independently audited (once <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/milestone/1">this burndown</a> is complete) so that everyone using the matrix-sdk-crypto state machine for Matrix E2EE can have some independent reassurance too - a huge step forward from the wild west of E2EE SDK implementations today!</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The Spec Core Team has decided to not include <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> (threading via <code>m.thread</code> relations) specifically in the upcoming Matrix v1.3 release. We previously stated that it would be in v1.3, but there's a few unproven MSCs (namely <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773">MSC3773</a> (notifications for threads)) which make it feel improper to put threads into the spec at this stage. We're aiming for a future (very near) spec release to contain threads, assuming we can get enough of the feature landed. This is a very similar approach to what we did with Spaces: while the core feature existed as FCP-concluded for a while, we wanted to give some other MSCs a chance to land before writing it up formally.</p>
<p>As a follow-on from this, any implementations that are currently assuming &quot;v1.3&quot; spec support translates to threading support should note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients which are pre-emptively checking for v1.3 in <code>/versions</code> should stop doing that. Look for <code>org.matrix.msc3440.stable</code> as an &quot;unstable&quot; feature flag instead.</li>
<li>Servers which offer MSC3440's behaviour should expose it on stable endpoints and expose <code>org.matrix.msc3440.stable</code> for clients to detect.</li>
<li>Optionally, clients and servers can drop support for the <code>org.matrix.msc3440</code> (truly unstable) flag, given clients &amp; servers should have already upgraded.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the spec level, we'll still be writing up MSC3440's dependencies (aggregations and friends), but will notably be missing MSC3440 specifically in v1.3. If folks can update their clients urgently, it would be massively appreciated!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2596">MSC2596: Proposal to always allow rescinding invites</a>!</p>
<p>A simple change to the auth rules to help prevent an edge case where one is able to invite a user, but not disinvite them as the latter requires a separate permission. The MSC attempts to solve this by always allowing the cancellation of invitations you've sent.</p>
<p>A small MSC, but one with some open threads still. Perhaps a good opportunity to go in and clean it up!</p>

<p>Hello everyone. This week the team cut a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.59.0rc1">release candidate for Synapse v1.59</a>, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New module API support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12406">editing push rules</a>.</li>
<li>Experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11507">MSC3266, federated room summary</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12601">MSC3786</a>.</li>

<li>Many bug fixes and internal improvements!</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the core team has looking at caches and memory usage: Erik has been looking at ways to reduce the memory usage of small servers, Shay's been adding some exciting <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12701">new config options to limit the total memory usage of Synapse</a> and David's added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12673">reload the cache factors of a running Synapse instance via SIGHUP</a>.</p>
<p>In parallel, Olivier's been doing groundwork to reduce replication traffic for workerised Synapse deployments, Andrew (anoa) has been looking at media retention policies and work continues on faster room joins.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we've actually made two releases ‚Äî <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.4">Dendrite 0.8.4</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.5">Dendrite 0.8.5</a> ‚Äî which are both primarily targeting performance and bug fixes.</p>
<p>We've also released our new living documentation, which is available at https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/, which features new installation instructions and documents that will be helpful to Dendrite server administrators. We will be writing more documentation and expanding this over time.</p>
<p>Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.8.2</li>
<li>Monolith deployments will no longer panic at startup if given a config file that does not include the <code>internal_api</code> and <code>external_api</code> options</li>
<li>State resolution v2 now correctly identifies other events related to power events, which should fix some event auth issues</li>
<li>The latest events updater will no longer implicitly trust the new forward extremities when calculating the current room state, which may help to avoid some state resets</li>
<li>The one-time key count is now correctly returned in <code>/sync</code> even if the request otherwise timed out, which should reduce the chance that unnecessary one-time keys will be uploaded by clients</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool should now work properly when the database is configured using the global connection pool</li>
<li>Fixes a regression introduced in the previous version where appservices, push and phone-home statistics would not work over plain HTTP</li>
<li>Adds missing indexes to the sync API output events table, which should significantly improve <code>/sync</code> performance and reduce database CPU usage</li>
<li>Building Dendrite with the <code>bimg</code> thumbnailer should now work again (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/database64128">database64128</a>)</li>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rust Matrix team is very excited to announce the next major release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0"><strong>Matrix SDK 0.5 &quot;stores and native crypto&quot;</strong></a>, now available for everyone by adding <code>matrix-sdk  = &quot;0.5.0&quot;</code> to their dependencies in their <code>Cargo.toml</code>. This first major release in about 8 months brings significant changes many have been waiting for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better, safer, native-er crypto</strong>: matrix-sdk 0.5 ditches libolm in favor of Vodozemac, the completely fresh rust-native re-implementation of the crypto crate. It has also been audited, the report of which is scheduled to be released soon.</li>
<li><strong>Store revamp</strong>: the entire cache storage infrastructure for crypto and state has been restructured to allow for full plug-ability, with even the two default supported backends, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-sled">sled</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-indexeddb">indexeddb</a> both being separate crates now. And as a matter of fact, a community-driven <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-sql">sql implementation has already been published as beta</a> (with postgres and sqlite support) by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lotte:chir.rs">charlotte ü¶ù</a>.</li>
<li><strong>WebAssembly</strong>; both of these changes also allow us to finally make WASM a Tier 1 supported target for the SDK. Not only does it build and even use the browser native indexeddb for permanent storage, we also have CI tests ensuring nothing will break this support going forward.</li>
<li><strong>Features, Features and Process</strong>: there's plenty more features and bug fixes in this release, e.g. native thumbnail generation support, as well as changes on our processes going forward.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>If you use Matrix with the Signal bridge (or any bridge) with relay mode
enabled, your guests have probably experienced the confusion where they don't know who else (on Matrix) is in the chat as only Matrix can double-puppet.</p>
<p>When this bot is added to a Matrix room, it will announce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who the room members are when a new Signal user joins;</li>
<li>When a Matrix user joins or leaves, who that Matrix user was.</li>
</ul>
<p>I built it just this afternoon using the excellent <code>matrix-bot-sdk</code>, but it's in Typescript and has plentyful unit tests!</p>
<p>I don't currently have a public bot, but if anyone is interested please join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#whos-in-this-room-bot-discussion:jakecopp.chat">#whos-in-this-room-bot-discussion:jakecopp.chat</a> and say hello!</p>
<p>PRs for adding support for other chat apps (basically identifying which bridge from the puppeted username) are very welcome! https://github.com/jakecoppinger/whos-in-this-room-matrix-bot</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3787">MSC3787: Allowing knocks to restricted rooms</a></li>

<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs are in FCP.</em></li>

<p><strong>MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3787">MSC3787: Allowing knocks to restricted rooms</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Wowza, that's a lot of new MSCs!&quot; I hear you say. This is actually a listing of the last 3 weeks, as it was pointed out to me that the last 3 editions of TWIM have not all features an MSC status update - which means some MSCs may not have necessary made it into the limelight.</p>
<p>As such, here's those from this past week, as well as the ones that were missed!</p>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>It's that time of the year again - a new Spec release is on the horizon! Matrix v1.3 is expected to land <em>sometime this month</em>, and will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> (threads) + related MSCs</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3787">MSC3787</a> (knock+restricted join rules)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3604">MSC3604</a> (room version 10)</li>
<li>Any other MSCs which have so far been accepted, but not yet made it into the spec.</li>
</ul>
<p>MSCs which land between now and v1.3 might get incorporated if easy enough, though chances are they'll slip to v1.4 (expected next quarter).</p>
<p>On top of that, the other bit of news is that the <code>proposal-in-review</code> label has now been removed from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals">matrix-spec-proposals</a> repo and thus all MSCs. This doesn't mean your MSC is no longer in review! We simply found the label redundant along with the other labels in the process (it was attached to all MSCs which hadn't been accepted/merged yet, which means very little) and thus we decided to remove it to reduce noise.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2881">MSC2881: Message Attachments</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC has actually been potentially(?) superseded by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3382">MSC3382</a>. In short, both look to provide a solution to the problem of attaching (multiple!) images to messages, such that clients can display an album of images in a single event in the timeline.</p>
<p>Check it out if you're interested in introducing such a feature!</p>

<p>Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.0">v1.58.0</a> was released this week! Check out <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/05/05/synapse-1-58-released">the v1.58 blog post</a> for the full scoop, but the highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our Docker images and Debian packages are now built from a dependency lockfile courtesy of Poetry. Props to David for leading the charge on this multi-week epic.</li>
<li>An experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3383">MSC3383</a> has been contributed by @Bubu and @jcgruenhage at Famedly, which will help with proxying federation traffic, amongst other uses.</li>
<li>An experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2815">MSC2815</a> has been merged, which allows room moderators to view redact event content for the purposes of moderation. This was contributed by @tulir at Beeper.</li>
<li>Device list updates are now asynchronous thanks to Erik, leading to much faster login times for accounts in big rooms.</li>
<li>plus many other bug fixes and improvements!</li>
</ul>
<p>We also released a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.1">v1.58.1</a> patch shortly afterwards to address an issue with the Debian packages on some configurations. Server admins not using the Matrix.org Debian packages do not need to install this patch release.</p>
<p>Otherwise, ongoing work from the core team continues with Sean and Rich working on faster room join performance, Olivier pushing forwards on testing Synapse with workers in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/">Complement</a>, while Erik has been tackling general performance work.</p>

<p>Hey folks! We're announcing our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.6.0">1.6.0 release</a> for matrix-hookshot today. More features in this release: tadzik has gotten involved and given us support for RSS feeds in this release. You can check out how to get going with those in <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/1.6.0/setup/feeds.html">our hosted documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The highlights this time around are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add RSS/Atom feed support (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/315">#315</a>)</li>
<li>Add support for GitLab in the widgets configuration UI. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/320">#320</a>)</li>
<li>Send a notice when a GitLab merge request gets some review comments. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/314">#314</a>)</li>
<li>Add new <code>!hookshot gitlab project</code> command to configure project bridges in rooms. See <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/usage/room_configuration/gitlab_project.html">the docs</a> for instructions. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/321">#321</a>)</li>
<li>New <code>hookshot_connection_event(_failed)</code> metrics for tracking successful event handling.
Reinstate <code>matrix_*</code> metrics which were previously not being recorded. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/312">#312</a>)

<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week brings another round of big improvements &amp; new features!</p>
<p>Features &amp; fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes to Docker support &amp; the documentation for setting it up</li>
<li>Changes to the login flow
<ul>
<li>The bridge can now be configured to enforce a login flow that more closely matches the official KakaoTalk desktop client's, and to better warn you when a new login will kick out another one of your KT sessions.  This will hopefully prevent the bridge from getting KT accounts banned!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Backfilling for KT-&gt;Matrix read receipts</li>
<li>Commands for adding/removing KakaoTalk friends</li>
<li>Commands to edit your KakaoTalk ID &amp; mark it as shared or hidden</li>
<li>Matrix-&gt;KT DM creation, i.e. the ability to create a new DM with a KakaoTalk user from within Matrix
<ul>
<li>This might fail on the first attempt at creating a DM.  If it does, try re-inviting the KakaoTalk puppet to the room.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many stability &amp; correctness improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>With the combination of friends list curation &amp; DM creation support, it should now be possible to connect with KT contacts entirely from Matrix!  Simply add some friends, list them, and invite a listed friend to a 1:1 room!</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone on Twitter complained that no chat client works like MSN anymore, where you could have separate windows for each chat. So for MSN compatibility we added that. (It is a bit experimental still, expect some stuff to not work or crash)</p>
<p>Bulbu also went through a lot of effort to add a second set of emoji shortcodes to Nheko. Those should be more familiar to people coming from other platforms or clients while the old shortcodes are available still as well. We also saw a lot of progress on the Finnish, Chinese, Indonesian and Russian translations, animated images should work properly in the image viewer again, buttons for opening the member list are now clearly marked with a people icon next to them. The memberlist is also now search- and sortable.</p>
<p>Anyway, have a look at how important multiple windows are:

<li>The new room list shows unread-notification/highlight counts, similar to Element.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basic support for spaces:
<ul>
<li>Rooms (and spaces) can be added to and removed from spaces.</li>
<li>Rooms are listed under their spaces in <code>ement-taxy-room-list</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reactions can now be toggled off (i.e. redacted) by clicking them, like in Element.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-room-send-file</code> allows uploading non-image files to rooms, and file messages are now displayed usefully, so the files can be downloaded or viewed.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-ignore-user</code> ignores and unignores users.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-tag-room</code> adds and removes favourite, low-priority, or custom tags on rooms.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-room-occur</code> allows searching messages in a room buffer, similar to Emacs's <code>occur</code> command (i.e. it locally searches already-received messages).</li>
<li>Membership events are now coalesced by default, similar to Element (especially helpful in large public rooms, like bridged IRC rooms, where join/part spam can be overwhelming).</li>
<li>&quot;In reply to&quot; links in replies, as well as other <code>matrix.to</code> links, can be activated in a room buffer to go to the linked message.</li>
<li>Mentions in outgoing messages are HTML-linkified (aka &quot;pilled&quot;), like Element.</li>
<li>Generated avatars for rooms that have none, similar to Element.  (Only displayed in <code>ement-taxy-room-list</code> for now.)</li>
<li>Option <code>ement-shr-use-fonts</code> (disabled by default, which prevents HTML messages from being displayed in a different font).</li>
<li>Faces for favourite/low-priority rooms.</li>
<li>Redacted messages that are still known locally are now displayed with a strikethrough (after reconnecting, their content will be unknown).</li>
<li>When images are disabled, image messages are presented as clickable URLs, so they can still be viewed.</li>
<li>Some events, like membership events and images, are displayed alongside a vertical bar to help distinguish them from normal messages.</li>
<li>Even &quot;hotter&quot;-looking timestamps for rooms updated in the last hour.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Changes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Refactored notification system.  Now easier to configure (see <code>M-x customize-group RET ement-notify RET</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fixes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved error handling when looking up homeserver hostnames and <code>.well-known</code> URIs.</li>
<li>Improved error handling when processing malformed events.</li>
<li>&quot;Elemental&quot; display style (not used by many users, apparently).</li>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?=n78tHoCx1es">this months demos</a> (also shown off at the top of the TWIM post), Eric showed off a <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9615#issuecomment-1108992901">proof of concept to anonymize your screenshots</a> so you can easily include more context when submitting logs or bug reports without worrying where the bug occurred. The current concept will color block all of the text on the page to still maintain the structure of the app but completely hide the content itself.</p>
<p>This still has a ways to go before it's integrated in Element under the click of a button so if anyone wants to take over or give feedback, go comment on the issue, https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9615. If you want to use the anonymization now, you can manually run the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9615#issuecomment-1108992901">JavaScript snippet from the issue</a> in the browser devtools.</p>
<p>This mode could even be further extended further to include <code>event_id</code> labels in the corner of each message to easily correlate the logs to the screenshot.</p>

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a few release candidates and weeks later, we released <a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity/">Trixnity</a> 2.0.0 today! It contains many breaking changes due to a large refactoring, which allows us to share a lot code between server and client implementations of the Matrix APIs.
This means, that Trixnity can be used to implement matrix servers in addition to application services and clients!</p>
<p>Trixnity finally has support for Kotlin/JS. You can implement a browser client or even better: multiplatform client. Support for Kotlin/Native will follow soon (e. g. for iOS clients). Right now, there is no <code>trixnity-client-store</code> implementation for JavaScript (e. g. IndexedDB), so you need to stick with <code>InMemoryStore</code> at the moment.</p>
<p>Besides notification support (push rules are evaluated), we introduced helpers to get the complete timeline as Kotlin-Flow (no more complicated loops to get the timeline). You can even subscribe to all timeline events, which is really helpful to implement bots with e2e encryption support. Speaking of e2e encryption: libolm is bundled into <code>trixnity-olm</code> jars, so you don't need to build olm by your own anymore.</p>
<p>These are the most important features. For the complete changelog, have a look at the <a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity/-/releases">release candidates</a>.</p>

<p>This week the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.9.0">version 0.9.0</a> which contains new features and some refactoring as many deprecated endpoints were removed so make sure to use the new ones when doing the migration.
Support for the Element recent emoji (<code>io.element.recent_emoji</code>) was added.  A new method to get the last read marker was added.
Lastly, the timeline logic was enhanced, and it's now possible to load the timeline at a specific event. So you can load the room to the last event and then paginate through the new events. When reaching the last event, the timeline will automatically allow new events to be added in the timeline when received.</p>

<p>Hello together. I made a generic bot, named <code>Safed Sundarata</code>, or <code>Sundar</code> in short, that should make it easy to get basic special functionality working. It has a lot of different functionality so you have an example code to work off of. The main motivation for this bot was to provide an <code>!error &lt;code&gt;</code> command for the developers in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#community:reactos.org">ReactOS Matrix Rooms</a>, which translates error codes to human readable text. Then of course i added other useful or fun commands to the bot. You want to read the <a href="https://github.com/BieHDC/sundar/blob/master/README.md">Readme</a> to find out more.
This is the first time i ever wrote a bot, so feedback and corrections to the <a href="https://github.com/BieHDC/sundar">Source Code</a> are highly appreciated. It is written in Go using the mautrix-go framework (thanks tulir and everyone who worked on this making it easy!). Even easier is to run and build it with go, no insane build system with broken dependencies required, which was the reason why i made it from scratch.</p>

out! Let's dive into this new release.</p>
<h2 id="poetry">Poetry</h2>
<p>If you've been reading the past few Synapse release announcements, you might
have already heard about our efforts to integrate
<a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> into Synapse. Poetry is a tool which
manages dependencies of a Python project. Its killer feature is its lockfile,
which explicitly pins all dependencies (direct and transitive) to a fixed
version, even across multiple Python versions and platforms. See more about why
we choose Poetry <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11537">here</a>.</p>
<p>During the past few months, we've been hard at work converting Synapse and its
CI to use Poetry. The goal is to make our Docker images and Debian packages more
reproducible and to provide a fixed, known-good environment for CI. This will
help us to ensure the stability and security of Synapse installations.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.57's Docker image was the first to use Poetry; after a successful
trial, this was extended to Synapse 1.58's Debian packages. Installations from
PyPI using <code>pip</code> will <em>not</em> use the locked environment, though everyone is
welcome to install from source using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/poetry.lock">our
lockfile</a>.</p>
<p>Huge props to <a href="https://github.com/DMRobertson">David</a> from the Synapse team for
leading the work on this front.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse also includes performance improvements around sharing
device list updates, which should greatly improve login times for large Matrix
accounts.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.58 also features the implementation of two MSCs:
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3383">MSC3383</a> to
include a <code>destination</code> parameter in federation authentication headers, and
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2815">MSC2815</a> which
(if enabled) allows room moderators to see the content of a redacted event (as
long as it hasn't already been deleted by the homeserver).</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.0">full
changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.58/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1580">upgrade
notes</a>
for this version.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our
thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular
order) <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk
Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://famedly.com/">Famedly</a> and

            <p>We've released updates to matrix-appservice-irc and our forked node-irc that it depends on to patch a High security vulnerability.
It's advised to update to 0.34.0 as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate a Matrix user into executing IRC commands
by having them reply to a maliciously crafted message.</p>
<p>Incorrect handling of a CR character allowed for making part of the message be sent to the IRC server verbatim
rather than as a message to the channel.</p>
<p>If you are currently a matrix-appservice-irc user, exercise caution when replying to messages from untrusted participants
in IRC bridged rooms until your bridge instance has been upgraded.</p>
<p>The vulnerability has been patched in node-irc version 1.2.1 and matrix-appservice-irc 0.34.0.
You can get the release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.34.0">on Github</a>.</p>
<p>The bridges running on the Libera Chat, OFTC and other networks bridged by the Matrix.org Foundation have been patched.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities are tracked as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-37hr-348p-rmf4">GHSA-37hr-348p-rmf4</a> and

<p>Thank you, <a href="https://valentin-lorentz.fr/">Val Lorentz</a> for reporting this vulnerability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Taking my GNOME Foundation hat on for this news: the GNOME Foundation is adopting Matrix! Is this TWIM worthy? It probably wouldn't have been if it wasn't for all the great work of Gwmngilfen! We published a joint blog post (though in all fairness Greg did all the heavy lifting) to explain how the decision was taken, and transparently share the data we had at hand.</p>
<p>In practice that means after <em>years</em> of Matrix being around in the GNOME community and being the most popular platform, it's finally moving out of the grey zone of &quot;everyone is using it but some older contributors really like their current set up, so it exists but it's not officially our primary platform&quot;. For now we're keeping both our Matrix instance and the bridge to GIMPnet (the IRC network GNOME people have been using for years). The major change is that IRC is now our legacy, so if tradeoffs have to be made Matrix will keep the premium experience.</p>
<p>Again, huge shout out to Gwmngilfen who gave meaning to the data I handed to him.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Hello again everyone! Your regularly-scheduled TWIM Spec update has returned, along with graph-based media!</p>
<p>Quick news to point out this week is that a new maubot plugin has been written to simply note the details of MSCs after their IDs (&quot;msc1234&quot;) have been posted in a room. The bot supports multiple MSC IDs in a message, message edits, threads and end-to-end encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>A copy of the bot is currently running under <code>@mscbot:matrix.org</code>, so feel free to invite it to a room if you'd find that useful!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3216">MSC3216: Synchronized access control for Spaces</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC serves as an alternative to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2962">MSC2962</a>, and essentially allows for user permissions to be simultaneously enforced across a set of rooms in a Space. This would allow functionality to users of platforms like Discord, where a user can be a moderator in a guild, and thus in all of that guild's channels.</p>

<p>A few operational issues have taken up quite a bit of the team's time this week, but we've still found time to cut a couple of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.0rc2">release candidates of v1.58</a>.  Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locked python dependencies for our Docker images and Debian packages, thanks to David's <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/54">poetry work</a>.</li>
<li>Some big performance fixes, including <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12365">an optimisation to login</a> from Erik and one to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12522">message backfill</a> from yours truly.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're also excited to see quite a few contributions from outside the core maintenance team: thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk</a>, Beeper, Famedly and everyone else in the community who has made pull requests!</p>
<p>Meanwhile on the core team, Sean has been continuing to lay groundwork for faster room joins, and Olivier has been doing some exciting work so that we will (finally) be able to test Synapse in worker mode under Complement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we announced <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.2">Dendrite 0.8.2</a> with a bunch of usability fixes. As always, join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for more discussion and updates.</p>
<h4 id="features">Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lazy-loading has been added to the <code>/sync</code> endpoint, which should speed up syncs considerably</li>
<li>Filtering has been added to the <code>/messages</code> endpoint</li>
<li>The room summary now contains &quot;heroes&quot; (up to 5 users in the room) for clients to display when no room name is set</li>
<li>The existing lazy-loading caches will now be used by <code>/messages</code> and <code>/context</code> so that member events will not be sent to clients more times than necessary</li>
<li>The account data stream now uses the provided filters</li>
<li>The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.8.0</li>
<li>The <code>/state</code> and <code>/state_ids</code> endpoints will now return <code>M_NOT_FOUND</code> for rejected events</li>
<li>Repeated calls to the <code>/redact</code> endpoint will now be idempotent when a transaction ID is given</li>
<li>Dendrite should now be able to run as a Windows service under Service Control Manager</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fixes">Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fictitious presence updates will no longer be created for users which have not sent us presence updates, which should speed up complete syncs considerably</li>
<li>Uploading cross-signing device signatures should now be more reliable, fixing a number of bugs with cross-signing</li>
<li>All account data should now be sent properly on a complete sync, which should eliminate problems with client settings or key backups appearing to be missing</li>
<li>Account data will now be limited correctly on incremental syncs, returning the stream position of the most recent update rather than the latest stream position</li>
<li>Account data will not be sent for parted rooms, which should reduce the number of left/forgotten rooms reappearing in clients as empty rooms</li>
<li>The TURN username hash has been fixed which should help to resolve some problems when using TURN for voice calls (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/fcwoknhenuxdfiyv">fcwoknhenuxdfiyv</a>)</li>
<li>Push rules can no longer be modified using the account data endpoints</li>
<li>Querying account availability should now work properly in polylith deployments</li>
<li>A number of bugs with sync filters have been fixed</li>
<li>A default sync filter will now be used if the request contains a filter ID that does not exist</li>
<li>The <code>pushkey_ts</code> field is now using seconds instead of milliseconds</li>
<li>A race condition when gracefully shutting down has been fixed, so JetStream should no longer cause the process to exit before other Dendrite components are finished shutting down</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Our last update included the words &quot;if things go to plan&quot;, and even though that's usually calling for trouble, not so this time!
We released Ruma 0.6.0 yesterday and apart from a tiny missing feature that was fixed and released as 0.6.1 today, everything went smooth üôÇ</p>
<p>The biggest breaking changes are</p>
<ul>
<li>new owned identifier types ‚Äì calling <code>.to_owned()</code> on <code>&amp;UserId</code> now gives you an <code>OwnedUserId</code> instead of <code>Box&lt;UserId&gt;</code></li>
<li>a new event enum hierarchy, where redacted events are better taken into account</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, with this release we can now claim practically 100% coverage of Matrix v1.2, that is you can send and receive requests for all specified endpoints of the various APIs, as well as send and inspect all specified event types, all with a strongly-typed Rust API.</p>

<p>There were no news about miounne for a while because we worked on a new &quot;iteration&quot; that can handle matrix encryption (thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/go">mautrix-go</a>).</p>
<p>So, here is it - Buscarron v1.0.0 with e2e encryption and multiarch (arm32, arm64, amd64) support. It can handle any HTTP POST/HTML form and send it to a (encrypted) matrix room. Of course, Buscarron has small neat features like spam checker and rate limiter.</p>
<p><a href="https://etke.cc/">etke.cc</a> is migrating to Buscarron and deprecating Miounne.</p>
<p>Go check out the <a href="https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/buscarron">source code</a> and say hi in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#buscarron:etke.cc">#buscarron:etke.cc</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a small, extensible bot that replays GPX recordings as a location sharing stream.
This is an implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3489">MSC3489: Sharing streams of location data with history</a> and may help you debug the feature or see it with real world data.
Join my Space to see this in action (with the Element Web Labs feature): <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#geo-trackers:iot-staging.ems">#geo-trackers:iot-staging.ems</a>.host
or run the bot with your own rooms and GPX files. https://gitlab.com/jaller94/matrix-location-sharing</p>

<p>The highly configurable message aggregation and filtering bot for matrix!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sleuth:rexrobotics.org">Sleuth</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrix Community Manager has seen some work in the features department over the past week.</p>
<p>With the new Ansible playbook I think it's possible for someone with a bit of Ansible experience to get this bot up and running in under 10 minutes. I did a fresh install in 4 minutes. That is a fresh VPS and creating a new matrix account. Instructions for the Ansible deploy can be found <a href="https://sleuth56.gitlab.io/Matrix-Community-Manager/Installation-With-Ansible/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The major features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Ansible playbook that should simplify the installation process for new users.</li>
<li>Edits to the message that triggered the bot will now be reflected in the bots message. This bot now has a feature Twitter doesn't have :laughing:.</li>
<li>Hashtags are now called filters. Filters are more customizable allowing for custom delimiters and now show the originating room.</li>
<li>The AutoJoin feature has filters to control who or from where invites will be excepted.</li>
<li>Announcements can have more than one output room. Using a comma separated list of room ids.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few bugs were fixed as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some text characters were causing messages to be classed incorrectly thus causing crashes.</li>
<li>Exotic characters specifically in links were causing crashes.</li>
</ul>
