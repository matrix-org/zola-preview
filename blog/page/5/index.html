            <p>Today we are issuing security releases of matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk to
patch a couple of High severity vulnerabilities (reserved as
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE%2D2022%2D36059">CVE-2022-36059</a>
for the matrix-js-sdk and
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE%2D2022%2D36060">CVE-2022-36060</a>
for the matrix-react-sdk).</p>
<p>Affected clients include those which depend on the affected libraries, such as
Element Web/Desktop and Cinny. Releases of the affected clients will follow
shortly. We advise users of those clients to upgrade at their earliest
convenience.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities give an adversary who you share a room with the ability to
carry out a denial-of-service attack against the affected clients, making it
not show all of a user's rooms or spaces and/or causing minor temporary
corruption.</p>
<p>The full vulnerability details will be disclosed at a later date, to give
people time to upgrade and us to perform a more thorough audit of the codebase.</p>
<p>Note that while the vulnerability was to our knowledge never exploited
maliciously, some unintentional public testing has left some people affected by
the bug. We made a best effort to sanitize this to stop the breakage. If you
are affected, you may still need to clear the cache and reload your Matrix
client for it to take effect.</p>
<p>We thank <a href="https://valentin-lorentz.fr/">Val Lorentz</a> who discovered and
reported the vulnerability over the weekend.</p>

            <p>Happy TWIMday everyone! Thib is away this week again, so I'm covering for him as your host in this edition of This Week In Matrix.</p>

<p>Following up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsw1bbBjAM">last week's tutorial</a> about using Docker Compose to install Synapse, this week Thib explains how to use Ansible to deploy your own Matrix homeserver.</p>
<h2 id="dept-of-status-of-matrix-face-with-th">Dept of <em>Status of Matrix</em> 🌡️</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the year, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/04/this-week-in-matrix-2022-03-04#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F">t2bot.io passed 1 Million known rooms</a> and now it's passed 10 Million bridged users (10,039,915 users to be exact, at time of writing). Most of these users will be people who have participated in a channel/chat on Discord or Telegram that was bridged to Matrix through t2bot.io's free service, with about 500 thousand being active each month.</p>
<p>Approximately 8 Million of the users are from Telegram, covering about 11% of all Telegram users (previously 15% based on information available at the time). The remaining 2 Million are Discord users, roughly 0.5% of Discord's user base. For perspective, t2bot.io has just over 683 Million events in the database and is bridging between 30 and 40 thousand people a day.</p>
<p>Like last time, this is just a milestone update, though it's also a good reminder to host your own server if you can. Element's own <a href="https://element.io/matrix-services">hosting platform</a> is a great option if you'd like to have a server without running it yourself, and <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> offers a richer bridging experience than t2bot.io can feasibly provide. If you'd like to go down the self-hosting route, check out Thib's video guide on hosting synapse or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsw1bbBjAM">last week's Matrix Live</a> for a better understanding of what hosting Synapse actually means.</p>
<p>As for an interesting statistic: despite not having much functionality that deals with Spaces, t2bot.io can see 2687 Spaces from the wider world. The plan in the coming months is to support a way to bridge a whole Discord server to a Matrix Space, making this statistic hopefully more interesting as time goes on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.5">Dendrite 0.9.5</a> which includes a number of fixes, particularly for federation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The roomserver will now correctly unreject previously rejected events if necessary when reprocessing</li>
<li>The handling of event soft-failure has been improved on the roomserver input by no longer applying rejection rules and still calculating state before the event if possible</li>
<li>The federation <code>/state</code> and <code>/state_ids</code> endpoints should now return the correct error code when the state isn't known instead of returning a HTTP 500</li>
<li>The federation <code>/event</code> should now return outlier events correctly instead of returning a HTTP 500</li>
<li>A bug in the federation backoff allowing zero intervals has been corrected</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> utility will no longer error if the homeserver URL ends in a trailing slash</li>
<li>A regression in <code>/sync</code> introduced in 0.9.4 should be fixed</li>

<p>simplematrixbotlib is an easy to use bot library for the Matrix ecosystem written in Python and based on matrix-nio.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de">HarHarLinks</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib">simplematrixbotlib</a> has reached version <a href="https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib/releases/tag/v2.7.0">2.7.0</a>, adding support for end-to-end encryption! 🎉
Come chat over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#simplematrixbotlib:matrix.org">#simplematrixbotlib:matrix.org</a>!</p>
<p>Here is a summary of things that have happened since we last announced v2.6.3 on this channel:</p>
<ul>
<li>🌐 The repo canonically moved to https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib, but the PyPI package remains available in the usual place.</li>
<li>🔒️ E2EE support! To enable it, simply install the optional e2ee dependencies. Find out how in <a href="https://simple-matrix-bot-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#e2e-encryption">the manual</a>.</li>
<li>😄 Emoji verification support! Enable the option and you'll be able to interactively verify between the bot and your devices. (But mind that for now, <a href="https://simple-matrix-bot-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#interactive-sas-verification-using-emoji">in-room verification is not supported, but only to-device</a>).</li>
<li>☝️ Fingerprint verification support! As an additional method, the bot will print it's encryption fingerprint so you can &quot;manually verify&quot;.</li>
<li>🗄️ Extensible config file! It is now easier than ever to add your own configuration options to the built-in TOML config file.</li>
<li>🧹 The usual housekeeping, bumping matrix-nio to 0.19.0.</li>
<li>🗨️ I (<a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks">HarHarLinks</a>) will be presenting the library this weekend at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-summit-berlin-2022:c-base.org">#matrix-summit-berlin-2022:c-base.org</a>! If you are in the Berlin 🇩🇪 area, come visit c-base!</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest to use bot library for Matrix. Get started in just 10 lines of code:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>import simplematrixbotlib as botlib
</span><span>
</span><span>config = botlib.Config()
</span><span>config.emoji_verify = True
</span><span>creds = botlib.Creds(&quot;https://home.server&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;)
</span><span>bot = botlib.Bot(creds, config)
</span><span>
</span><span>@bot.listener.on_message_event
</span><span>async def echo(room, message):
</span><span>    if botlib.MessageMatch(room, message, bot, PREFIX).is_not_from_this_bot():

<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>This week the Spec Core Team focused on improvements to the spec source itself. richvdh <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1211">opened a PR</a> for edit events, and yours truly did <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1210">a small PR</a> to clarify the required state of the response to <code>/_matrix/client/v3/login/</code>.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aspec-bug">a lot more open issues</a> available for people to tackle however, so feel free to get involved and help out if you have some spare time!</p>
<p>Finally other than the usual rounds of review by the team, I've been working on a spec process document that aims to explain the practical portions of the text found at https://spec.matrix.org/proposals/, but in a easily scannable manner. Look out for a PR with that in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2871">MSC2871: Give widgets an indication of which capabilities they were approved for</a>! What a mouthful!</p>
<p>Historically, widgets have laid outside of the spec and have only been implemented in a small subset of clients - mainly Element. As of recent weeks though, there's now a team at Element backing the feature. So exciting times ahead!</p>
<p>Regardless, let's highlight this MSC! It solves a crucial problem with a simple solution. Widgets can ask the client they're embedded in to do certain things (if granted certain capabilities), and the client, potentially after asking the user for permission, can allow or deny those actions. This MSC adds the machinery for a further step: the client will tell the widget what capabilities they requested were allowed, and which were denied.</p>
<p>I believe this spec is non-contentious, but is blocked on widgets entering the spec as a whole. Regardless, if this particular piece of the puzzle interests you, or you'd like to read all about widgets in general, the see either the MSC above or this widget spec tracking PR: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/pull/825.

<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.4">Dendrite 0.9.4</a>, containing primarily bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bug in the roomserver around handling rejected outliers has been fixed</li>
<li>Backfilled events will now use the correct history visibility where possible</li>
<li>The device list updater backoff has been fixed, which should reduce the number of outbound HTTP requests and <code>Failed to query device keys for some users</code> log entries for dead servers</li>
<li>The <code>/sync</code> endpoint will no longer incorrectly return room entries for retired invites which could cause some rooms to show up in the client &quot;Historical&quot; section</li>
<li>The <code>/createRoom</code> endpoint will now correctly populate <code>is_direct</code> in invite membership events, which may help clients to classify direct messages correctly</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool will now log an error if the shared secret is not set in the Dendrite config</li>
<li>A couple of minor bugs have been fixed in the membership lazy-loading</li>

<p>Nheko now has some very dirty hack to render spoilers on desktop platforms. This does not show the reason and not work in mobile mode, doesn't hide it from notifications or from the sidebar. But it is at least something. Similarly we tightened what tags we allow when validating the incoming html again. Also, as a small fix, DMs should now also properly start with encryption enabled when started from a profile and there were a few crash fixes when searching for direct chat partners and closing the window too quickly or when a user uploads a device with invalid keys.</p>

<p>This week in the dart SDK we mostly fixed bugs. Many of those are related to call negotiations where streams were closed in the wrong order, not closed at all or in group calls the call never learned about new members or the call_ids would not match. There were also a few fixes to the background thumbnailing support added in 0.11.1, helper methods were added to easily send the right message corresponding to the mimetype of some media and fetching a timeline for some event id should work properly again.</p>
<p>We have some support to mark a room as either a dm or a group using slashcommands now, you have more flexibility when implementing the SSSS Bootstrap now (using the extra Bootstrap parameter in onUpdate() and to round it all off, we now have nice coverage numbers as well as coverage display on merge request diffs.</p>

The main conference days are Friday and Saturday (26th and 27th August). We have a schedule all about Matrix hosting, clients and development.
With three simultaneous tracks there sure is something for you to listen to. It's also the perfect place to get to know other community members.
Look forward to talks, workshops, a signing party, a Matrix P2P live test, dinner and barbecue!</p>
<p>We're not planing to stream or record the event. Our focus lies on providing a great in-person activities.
If attendees want to blog or toot/tweet about it, please use the hashtag #MatrixCommunitySummit.
Also, German-speaking folks can look forward to more coverage from the event on my podcast.

        <div>
            <p>Hey everyone! We've just released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.65.0">Synapse
1.65</a>! Let's have a
peek at what's inside.</p>
<h2 id="private-read-receipts">Private read receipts</h2>
<p>A feature that the more privacy-focused users of Matrix have been missing was
the ability to hide read receipts from other users. Read receipts in rooms can
tell a user which messages another user has read in a room. However, they can
also be an unwelcome indicator that a user is currently reading a certain room,
thus giving away the user's activity on Matrix at a given time.</p>
<p>Hiding one's read receipts from other Matrix users is unfortunately not as
straightforward as simply preventing a client from sharing read receipts with
the server. This is because read receipts are also used by Matrix homeservers to
calculate how much of a room a user has read, and generate notification counts
for rooms accordingly.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.65 introduces stable support for private read receipts. This feature,
described by
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2285">MSC2285</a>, allows
clients to send a different type of read receipt to the server. This then tells
the homeserver to use this piece of information to update the user's
notification counts, but not to share it with other users.</p>
<h2 id="improved-room-management-apis-for-modules">Improved room management APIs for modules</h2>
<p>This version of Synapse includes two new module API methods to help Synapse
modules interact and manage rooms. The first one,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.65.0/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L1455-L1477"><code>lookup_room_alias</code></a>,
allows modules to retrieve the room ID corresponding to a given room alias. This
works both for local and remote aliases. The second one,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.65.0/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L1479-L1528"><code>create_room</code></a>,
allows modules to create new rooms on behalf of an existing user.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.65.0/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L925-L1017"><code>update_room_membership</code></a>
method has also been updated in this release of Synapse to allow modules to join
a room the server is not already in via federation. This can be done by using
the new <code>remote_room_hosts</code> argument, which takes a list of homeservers to try
to join via.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>Synapse 1.65 stabilises the implementation of
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">MSC3827</a>, which
allows filtering public room searches on room types. This means it is now
possible to search specifically for public spaces. For more information on this
feature, see <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/07/20/synapse-1-63-released">the Synapse 1.63
announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Synapse 1.65 implements the new experimental error codes
documented by
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">MSC3848</a>. Once
stabilised, these error codes will allow clients to show more specific errors to
their users about why an event could not be sent.</p>

changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release.</p>
