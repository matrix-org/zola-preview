<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@florian:dsn.tm.kit.edu">Florian</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fresh off the arXiv presses comes our</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06488">‚ÄúAnalysis of the Matrix Event Graph Replicated Data Type‚Äù</a> preprint!
This time, it is a deep dive into the data structure properties of the event graph:</p>
<p>What type of consistency guarantees does it provide,
how many of the other homeservers you share a room with can be faulty or malicious without violating those guarantees (short answer: all of them!),</p>
<p>and how is it possible that a frayed-out event graph ever laces back to just a few current events,
while there is a probability larger than zero for growth to arbitrarily high limits?</p>
<p>To shed light on those questions, we had a great cooperation between my <a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/">Decentralized Systems and Network Services
Research Group</a> and <a href="https://www.math.kit.edu/stoch/~henze/">Prof. Dr. Norbert Henze from the Institute of Stochastics</a>.</p>
<p>While we are still in search of the right venue for peer-reviewed publication,
we went for a preprint this time to share our results with the scientific and the Matrix community in a timely manner.</p>

<p>In this figure, k is the number of participating servers, U_n is the current width of the event graph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, with a current width of U_n = 1000 events and k = 200 servers,
we can expect that the width goes below E(U_{n+1}) &lt; 600 events in just one step.*</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h4>
<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2744">MSC2744</a> has entered FCP. As such we're switching it out for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2844">MSC2844</a>, which aims to define a global versioning system for all spec documents. Note that MSC2844 does not currently have FCP proposed. Its purpose for being in the focus this time around is for asking the team whether ideas proposed are plausible.</p>
<p>Thus this week's focus is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1544">MSC1544</a> (QR Code verification), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2790">MSC2790</a> (modal widgets) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2844">MSC2844</a> (global versioning).</p>
<p>We've also started making use of a Github board to track the state of an MSC through the currently somewhat ambiguous process of putting up an MSC that is ready for review to starting FCP. You can find the board here: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/31">SCT Backlog</a>.</p>
<p>Some explanation of the columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Awaiting SCT Input - These are MSCs that are deemed reviewable by the MSC author, and require review by a subsection of the Spec Core Team (usually one or two people) that are most familiar with the scope of Matrix that the MSC is relevant to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ready for FCP ticks - At least one individual from the Spec Core Team has signed off on the MSC. It is not time for others to give a cursory review - mainly sanity checking from the perspective of the part of Matrix that they work on. Note that fundamental flaws may still be found in this stage, requiring the MSC to be reworked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In FCP - The MSC is in Final Comment Period, where everyone has a last chance to get their ideas in. This happens after most of the Spec Core Team have given their ticks from the previous column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Done - These MSCs no longer need immediate attention by some portion of the Spec Core Team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These definitions are all flexible as we continue to see what works for the limited resources we have available for review.</p>
<p>Do not be alarmed if a particular MSC is not on this board, we're placing things on here as deemed necessary, and more will certainly be added in time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We are aware of a trivially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in versions of Synapse prior to 1.20.0. Complete details will be disclosed on Monday, November 23rd. If you have not upgraded recently, please do so.</p>
<p>Happy RC day! The first release candidate of Synapse 1.23 is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0rc1">now available</a>. For Synapse admins, we've added numerous new APIs thanks to contributions by <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">@dklimpel</a>, and we now support generating <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.23.0rc1/docs/structured_logging.md">structured logs</a> in a standard manner. The <code>structured</code> and <code>drains</code> logging options are now deprecated in Synapse's configuration.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0rc1">Synapse 1.23.0rc1</a> also includes several significant bugfixes, especially around regressions in the SQLite-to-PostgreSQL database porting script, as well a fix to an issue that would prevent Synapse from recovering after losing its connection to the database. Synapse will also now reject modifications to access control lists which would otherwise result in a server blocking itself from a room. This is a particularly interesting case of unintended consequences in protocol design, and we hope to write more about it soon.</p>
<p>Next week should see the full release of 1.23, followed by a first implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403"><em>MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</em></a> landing in the development branch for 1.24.

<p>Hello TWIM! From this week on we're changing how we're reporting updates on the Element clients. Each week, we'll include a section for cross-platform feature work the Element team is working on, and some sections for platform specific work too.</p>
<p><strong>Spaces (previously known as Communities)</strong></p>
<p>Communities are back! They've been renamed to Spaces, and on the Element team we've been busy exploring user experience and critical thinking for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a>, to allow users to organise rooms into useful groups.</p>
<p><strong>Social Login</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to reduce friction in authentication, we've been R&amp;Ding how to allow homeservers &amp; Matrix clients to support multiple SSO providers.. Most of the work so far is captured in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2858">MSC2858</a> and we're starting initial implementations in Element web next week.</p>
<p><strong>VoIP: Voice &amp; Video Calls</strong></p>
<p>We've started foundational research, design and engineering to improve both the usability and stability of native matrix VoIP in Element. We've also started to look at how we can improve the continuity of the user experience between native Matrix calls and our current implementation of Jitsi.</p>
<p><strong>Usability</strong></p>
<p>We've been focusing on improving post-registration actions all round to make Element provide better prompts for first actions, and empty states for views on all platforms, with a multitude of fixes having landed on Element Web, iOS &amp; Android in the last week. We've also started paid user testing to better understand specific pain points in the first time user experience, which we're looking to improve significantly in the coming weeks. </p>
<p><strong>Web platform</strong></p>
<p>v1.7.13 is now live! Which includes a bunch of fixes &amp; improvements on VoIP.</p>
<p><strong>Android platform</strong></p>
<p>v1.0.10 is now available on the Play Store. We're also doing ongoing work to catch up with feature parity to Element Web, and <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">Dominaezzz</a> is migrating SDK APIs to suspend functions: no more MatrixCallback!</p>
<p><strong>iOS platform</strong></p>
<p>v1.1.0 is soon to be live on TestFlight for beta testers, and we'll soon be turning our attention to fixing end-to-end encryption regressions.</p>

We are using it in production with hundreds of target telephone numbers without problems. I also added an optional feature to use room aliases (e. g. #sms_4901234567:homeserver) to prevent multiple rooms with one target telephone number (which is still possible).</p>
<p>In a few weeks you can use this bridge with an old Android-Smartphone, which acts as an sms gateway with rest api.</p>

<p>Hello Matrix friends. I've been asked to share this here. I'm currently building a platform for building communities. I'm focused on deeper matrix integration with communities, private messaging built on top of matrix, and custom domain support. Feel free to check out <a href="https://gurlic.com">https://gurlic.com</a>. The matrix community is at <a href="https://gurlic.com/matrix">https://gurlic.com/matrix</a>, but I haven't had the time to post much. </p>
<p>We have communities (https://gurlic.com/space -&gt; <a href="https://gurlic.space">https://gurlic.space</a>)</p>
<p>We have galleries (https://gurlic.com/art -&gt; <a href="https://gurlic.art">https://gurlic.art</a>)
We have publications (https://gurlic.com/classics -&gt; <a href="https://classics.wtf">https://classics.wtf</a>)</p>
<p>We have user pages (https://gurlic.com/bob -&gt; https://bob.monster)</p>
<p>The UI is a little confusing now because we have longform articles (https://gurlic.com/homer/the-iliad-book-ii) and short social media posts (https://gurlic.com/privacy/post/324848317844422661).</p>
<p>I pretty much want all resources to have custom domain support, and matrix rooms for all communities, and nested communities. In the near future, I hope to have matrix servers for custom domains too. And of course, the source will also be open if folks want to host.</p>
<p>Right now, users on gurlic get a matrix account, and communities/galleries/publications get a room too, but i'm hoping to take some time to look at much deeper integration. Dendrite and hydrogen are great to build on top off...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy November from the Synapse team! As mentioned last week, we pushed a small <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.1">v1.22.1 release</a> last Friday which fixed two regressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug where an appservice may not be forwarded events for a room it was recently invited to. Broke in v1.22.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8676">#8676</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <code>Object of type frozendict is not JSON serializable</code> exceptions when using third-party event rules. Broke in v1.22.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8678">#8678</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't upgraded your Synapse in a while, <em>please do.</em></p>
<p>A major focus of Synapse is being able to meet the performance and reliability needs of massive homeservers like <code>matrix.org</code>. If you're curious about how Synapse's architecture has evolved over the years to meet these scaling challenges, check our our blog post from Tuesday: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/03/how-we-fixed-synapses-scalability">How we fixed Synapse's scalability!</a></p>
<p>Lastly, we anticipate releasing 1.23.0 in the next fortnight; keep your eyes peeled for release candidates and let us know if you have any feedback. For a preview of what's coming, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/compare/v1.22.1...develop">check out GitHub</a> for the new commits that have landed on the <code>develop</code> branch since our last release.</p>

<p>Synapse now horizontally scales across multiple python processes, as of 1.22: you can configure it so that events are no longer sent through the main proc, eliminating the single biggest bottleneck for large scale Synapse deployments.

<p>Hi all! I <em>think</em> this is the right place to share this ü§û. I've been working on a Matrix SDK for Elixir over the last few months as a side project, it's very early days and it's currently just a bare-bones wrapper for the Client-Server API. I've also written the Elixir/Erlang bindings for Olm (currently missing group sessions) which should be added to the SDK soon. The repo can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/niklaslong/matrix-elixir-sdk">https://github.com/niklaslong/matrix-elixir-sdk</a> and the Elixir bindings for Olm are linked in the readme.</p>

<p>It is the right place! Thanks cognitive_tea :D</p>
<p>Asked if there were big plans for use of the project</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not as yet, though a few people have reached out to me already and are building on top of it. I started it as a way to get going with Matrix dev and as a fun side project. That being said, I think providing the tools to Matrix-enable Elixir apps might lead to some interesting things.
If anyone has any precise ideas on how they would want to integrate their Elixir apps with Matrix, I'd be super happy to have a chat üëçÔ∏è

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We had a major break-through in Synapse 1.22 which we want to talk about in
more detail: <strong>Synapse now scales horizontally across multiple python
processes.</strong></p>
<p>Horizontal scaling means that you can support more users and traffic by adding
in more python processes (spread over more machines, if necessary) without
there being a single bottleneck which all the traffic is passing through - as
opposed to vertical scaling where you make things go faster overall by making
the bottleneck go faster.</p>
<p>After many years of having to vertically scale Synapse (by trying to make the
main process go faster) we‚Äôre now finally at the point where you can configure
Synapse so that <strong>messages no longer flow through the main process</strong> -
eliminating the bottleneck entirely.  What‚Äôs more, the Matrix.org homeserver
has now been successfully running in this config and enjoying the massive
scalability improvements for the last 2 weeks! Huge kudos goes to Erik and the
wider Synapse team for pulling this off.</p>
<p>Some readers might wonder how this ties in with <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">Dendrite entering
beta</a>, given one
of Dendrite‚Äôs design goals is full horizontal scalability.  The answer is that
we‚Äôre very much using Dendrite for experimentation and next-gen stuff at the
moment (currently focused more on scaling downwards for P2P rather than
scaling upwards for megaservers) - while Synapse is the stable and long-term
supported option.</p>
<p>So, that‚Äôs the context - now over to Erik with more than you could possibly
ever want to know about how we actually did it...</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Synapse started life off back in 2014 as a single monolithic python process,
and for quite a while we made it scale by adding more and more in-memory
caches to speed things up by avoiding hitting the database (at the expense of
RAM).  It looked like this:</p>
<div style="margin: auto; max-width: 640px;">
    <img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse1.png"/>
</div>
<p>Eventually the caches stopped helping and we needed more than one thread of
execution in order to spread CPU across multiple cores. Python‚Äôs Global
Interpreter Lock (<a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">GIL</a>)
means that Python can mainly only use one CPU core at a time, so starting more
threads doesn‚Äôt help with scalability - you have to run multiple processes.</p>
<p>Now, the vast majority of the work that Synapse does is related to ‚Äústreams‚Äù.
These are append only sequences of rows, such as the events stream, typing
stream, receipts stream, etc. When a new event arrives (for example) we write
it to the events stream, and then notify anything waiting that there has been
an update. The <code>/sync</code> endpoint, for instance, will wait for updates to streams
and send them down to long-polling Matrix clients. </p>
<p>Streams support being added to concurrently, so have a concept of the
‚Äúpersisted up-to position‚Äù. This is the point where <strong>all</strong> rows before that
point have finished persisting. Readers only read up to the current ‚Äúpersisted
up-to position‚Äù, so that they don‚Äôt skip updates that haven‚Äôt finished
persisting at that point. (E.g. if two events A and B get assigned positions 5
and 6, but B finishes persisting first, then the persisted up to position will
remain at 4 until A finishes persisting and then it jumps to 6).</p>
<p>To split any meaningful amount of work into separate processes, we need to add
a mechanism where processes can be told that updates to streams have happened
(otherwise they‚Äôd have to repeatedly poll the DB, which would be deeply
inefficient). The architecture ended up being one where we had the ‚Äúmain‚Äù
process that streams updates via a custom replication protocol (initially
long-polling HTTP; later custom TCP) to any number of ‚Äúworker‚Äù processes. This
meant that we could move sync stream handling (and other read apis) off the
main process and onto workers, but also that all database writes had to go
through the single main process (as it was a star topology, the main process
could talk to all workers but workers could only talk to the main process and
not each other).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse2.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse2.png" /></p>
<p>As an aside: cache invalidations also had to be streamed down the replication
connections, which has the side effect that we could only cache things that
would only be invalidated on the main process.</p>
<p>We continued to move more and more read APIs out onto separate workers. We
also added workers in front of the main process that would e.g. handle the
creation of the new events, authenticating, etc, and then call out to the main
process with the event for it to persist the event.</p>
<h2 id="moving-writes-off-the-main-process">Moving writes off the main process</h2>
<p>Eventually we ran out of stuff to move out of the main process that didn‚Äôt
involve writing to the DB. To write stuff from other processes we needed a way
for the workers to stream updates to each other. The easiest and most obvious
way was to just use Redis and its pub/sub support. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse3.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse3.png" /></p>
<p>This almost allowed us to move writing of a particular stream to a different
worker, <em>except</em> writing to streams generally also meant invalidating caches
which in itself requires writing to a stream. We needed a way of writing to
the cache invalidation stream from multiple workers at once.</p>
<p>Sharding the cache invalidation thankfully turned out to be easy, as workers
would simply call the cache invalidation function whenever they get an
invalidation notice over replication. In particular, the ordering of
invalidations from different workers doesn‚Äôt matter and so there isn‚Äôt a need
to calculate a single ‚Äúpersisted up-to position‚Äù. Sharding then just becomes a
case of adding the name of the worker that is writing the update to the
replication stream, and then workers reading from it can basically treat the
cache stream the same as if they were multiple streams, one per worker.</p>
<p>This then unlocks the ability to move writing of streams off the main process
and onto different workers - and so we added the ‚Äúevent persister‚Äù worker for
offloading the main event stream off the main process:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse4.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse4.png" /></p>
<h2 id="sharding-the-events-stream">Sharding the events stream</h2>
<p>Eventually the worker responsible for doing nothing but persisting events
started maxing out CPU. This meant that we had to look at sharding the events
stream, i.e. writing to it from multiple workers.</p>
<p>This is more complicated than sharding the cache invalidation stream as the
ordering of the events does matter; we send them down sync streams, in order,
with a token that indicates where the sync stream is up to in the events
stream. This means that workers need to be able to calculate a ‚Äúpersisted
up-to position‚Äù when getting updates from different workers. </p>
<p>The easiest way of doing that is to simply set the persisted up-to position as
the minimum position received over federation from all active writers. This
works, except events would only be processed after all other writers have
subsequently written events (to advance the persisted position past the point
at which the event was written), which can add a lot of latency depending on
how often events are written. </p>
<p>A refinement is to note that if you have a persisted up-to position of 10,
then receive updates at sequential positions 11, 12, 13 and 14, you know that
everything between 10 and 14 has finished persisting (as you received updates
about them), and so can set the persisted up-to position to 14. Annoyingly,
it‚Äôs not required that positions are sequential without gaps (due to various
technical considerations), and so in the worst case this still has the same
problems as the na√Øve solution.</p>
<p>To avoid these problems we change the persisted up-to position to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock">vector
clock</a> of positions; tracking a
vector of positions - one per writer. This still allows answering the query of
‚Äúget all events after token X‚Äù (as events are written with the position and
the name of the writer). The persisted up-to position is then calculated by
just tracking the last position seen to arrive over replication from each
writer. </p>
<p>This allows writing events from multiple workers, while ensuring that other
workers can correctly keep track of a ‚Äúpersisted up-to position‚Äù. Then it's
just a matter of inspecting the code to ensure that it does not assume that it
is the only writer to the stream. In the case of writing to the events stream,
we note that the function persisting events assumes it's the only writer for a
given room, so when sharding we have to ensure that there are no concurrent
writes to the same room. This is most easily done by sharding based on room
ID, and ensuring that the mapping of room ID to worker does not change
(without coordination).</p>
<p>The only thing left is to then encode the vector clock position into the sync
tokens. We want to ensure that these tokens are not too long, as they get
included as query string parameters (e.g. the <code>since=</code> parameter of <code>/sync</code>).
By assigning persistent unique integer IDs to workers the vector clock can be
persisted as a sequence of pairs of integers, which is relatively few bytes so
long as we don‚Äôt have too many workers writing to the events stream. We can
further reduce the size of the tokens by calculating an integer ‚Äúpersisted
up-to position‚Äù as we did before, encoding that and only including positions
for workers that are larger than the integer persisted upto position. (The
idea here is that most of the time only a small number of workers will be
ahead of the calculated persisted up-to position, and so we only need to
encode those).</p>
<p>And this is what we have today:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse5.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse5.png" /></p>
<p>The major limitation of the current situation is that you can‚Äôt dynamically
add/remove workers which persist events, as the sharding by room ID is
calculated at startup, and so changing it requires restarting the whole
system. This could be replaced by any system that allowed coordination over
which persister is allowed to write to a room at any given point. However this
is likely tricky to get right in practice, but would allow dynamic auto
scaling of deployments, or automatically recovering from a worker that gets
wedged/dies.</p>
<p>Finally, it‚Äôs worth noting that sharding event persisters isn‚Äôt the only
performance work that‚Äôs been going on - switching everything over to python 3
and async twisted has helped, along with lots of smaller optimisations on the
hot paths, and further rebalancing workers (e.g. moving background jobs off
the master process to dedicated workers).  We‚Äôve also benefited a lot from the
maintainability of rolling out mypy typing throughout the codebase.  And next
up, we‚Äôll be going back to speeding up the codebase as a whole - starting with
algorithmic state resolution improvements! üéâ</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>So, how does it stack up?</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the send time heatmap on Matrix.org showing the step change on Oct 16th
when we rolled out the second event persister (full disclosure: this also
coincides with moving background processes off the main Synapse process to a
background worker).  As you can see, we go from messages being spread over a
huge range of durations (up to several seconds) to the sweet spot being 50ms
or less - a spectacular improvement!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse-heatmap.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse-heatmap.png" /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, here‚Äôs the actual CPU utilisation as we split the traffic from a
single event persister (yellow) to two persisters (one yellow, one blue),
showing the sharding beautifully horizontally balancing CPU between the two
active/active worker processes:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse-cpu.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse-cpu.png" /></p>
<p>We‚Äôve yet to loadtest to see just how fast we can go now (before we start
hitting bottlenecks on the postgres cluster), but it sure feels good to have
all our CPU headroom back on Matrix.org again, ready for the next wave of
users to arrive.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>So there you have it: folks running massive homeservers (50K+ concurrent
users) like Matrix.org (and <em>cough</em> various high profile public sector
deployments) are no longer held hostage by the bottleneck of the main synapse
process and should feel free to experiment with setting up event persister
workers to handle high traffic loads.  Otherwise, if you can spread your users
over smaller servers, that‚Äôs also a good bet (assuming they don‚Äôt have
massively overlapping room membership, like we see on Matrix.org.)</p>
<p>The current <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/workers.md">worker
documentation</a>
is up-to-date, although does assume you are already very familiar with how to
administer Synapse.  It‚Äôs also very much subject to change, as we keep adding
new workers and improving the architecture.  However, now is a pretty good
time to get involved if you‚Äôre interested in large-scale Matrix deployments.</p>

<p>This was an exciting week again. Trilene did the usual and just opened a PR, that implements the video part of call support. In my testing so far this seems to work amazingly well (ignore, that my webcam is crappy in the video, I only have so many devices...)! It's hard to overstate my satisfaction, if I am allowed to quote songs without getting a DMCA! If you want to try it out, you will need the qmlgl plugin at runtime (I had to patch some ebuilds on Gentoo to do so) and build Nheko from source. Support in our AppImage and Flatpak and for our Windows and MacOS builds will come at a later date. A big shoutout to trilene, who just works on VOIP in Nheko, without saying a word, and then drops a ready PR.</p>
<p>Another exciting new feature by lorendb, you can now specify <code>--profile &lt;profilename&gt;</code>, when you start Nheko, to create a separate profile. This allows you to open multiple instances and use multiple accounts at the same time (but it still uses separate instances of Nheko). This is pretty useful, if you have multiple accounts on different homeservers or are testing stuff for example. He also added a shortcut to delete the current content of the message area (Ctrl-U).</p>
<p>We also fixed a long standing bug, that crashed Nheko when pasting an image on mac OS, prevented copying text in some cases and build times should be about halfed again.</p>
<p>That's all I got today. I guess we should do a new release at some point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked about trilene, who is a reliable Nheko contributor, Nico replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>trilene seems to be a bit camera shy and prefer to work on code than take credit and talk about upcoming features. I'm surprised everytime, when a new PR is opened or trilene asks a weird question, that can only end up in an amazing contribution :3</p>

<p>To enable it you'll need Synapse 1.22.0 (released this week) and v0.5.8 of the bot-sdk. Then, add <code>&quot;de.sorunome.msc2409.ephemeral&quot;: true</code> to your appservice registration file (at the root level) and turn on the <code>de.sorunome.msc2409.ephemeral</code> flag in your <code>IAppserviceRegistration</code> supplied to the bot-sdk. If all goes according to plan, you'll be able to use <code>appservice.on(&quot;ephemeral.event&quot;, (ev) =&gt; {})</code> to start processing EDUs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Starting November 28th and 29th of this year, many bots on t2bot.io will be supporting end-to-end encryption. Though not all bots will be supporting it, this is an important milestone towards getting end-to-bridge encryption enabled on t2bot.io as a proof of being able to scale to the higher demand of encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>The eventual goal is to support encryption on all of t2bot.io‚Äôs bots and bridges, however we need to take small steps to get there üôÇ. Note that in order to function, bots will decrypt <em>all</em> messages they see, but only respond to the ones they care about - this can still be uncomfortable for some rooms though, so feel free to kick them out.</p>

<p>This means we are building:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A list of Servers where Owners can add their servers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We try to do Quality controls (No fully self add. Servers get reviewed.) using a Code of Conduct Ruleset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verified Listings using well-known files on serverside (Also allowing Admins to modify server data themself)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server Details like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ping and Avalibility Stats (thanks to tulir for providing a API)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public Room Lists fetched from the Server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NSFW Ratings (A NSFW tag was too generic for us)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Section to list Rules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Admin addresses for easy ways of reaching the Server admins</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing to select registration state (&quot;Open&quot;, &quot;Invite Only&quot;, &quot;Closed&quot;)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Code is fully written in Rust and using Postgres as a backend. Have a look at: <a href="https://github.com/daydream-mx/keymaker">https://github.com/daydream-mx/keymaker</a></p>

<p>Hello everyone, normally anoa would be doing this update but today you get me (TravisR) instead. Luckily anoa has left me a script to run, so here's hoping I haven't completely messed up this week's update üòÖ</p>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a>.</p>

<h4 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h4>
<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we're still focusing on the same MSCs from previous weeks to get widgets over the line. This includes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2774">MSC2774</a> to have widgets aware of their widget ID, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2765">MSC2765</a> so widgets can be pretty in clients like Element, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2790">MSC2790</a> to support a form of user input with widgets.</p>
<p>Normally there would be a graph here of our MSC progress, however my machine refuses to accept that line graphs are a real thing today.

<p>I made a simple room alias proxy: <a href="https://mau.dev/tulir/mauliasproxy">https://mau.dev/tulir/mauliasproxy</a>. It can be used to create room aliases on custom domains without having to host an actual Matrix homeserver there.

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> on Tuesday, a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/20/dendrite-0-2-0-released">reasonably big update</a> containing various improvements over the initial beta release, and then followed it up with a bug-fix <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.2.1">v0.2.1</a> release on Thursday. </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has been running Dendrite and reporting their findings, and also to contributors who have been submitting pull requests!</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer builds separate binaries for each polylith component, but instead has one multi-personality binary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Docker images have been simplified into two images: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-monolith">dendrite-monolith</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-polylith">dendrite-polylith</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal HTTP API calls are now made using H2C (HTTP/2) in polylith mode, which resolves some head-of-line issues with the connection pool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities have been refactored, which should fix some cases where room state can end up corrupted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A couple of bugs when handling state rewrites have been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sync API no longer sends old state events to clients as if they were new</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQLite locking bugs around the latest events updater have been resolved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notification levels are now parsed correctly in power level events (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pestdoktor">Pestdoktor</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invalid UTF-8 is now correctly rejected when making federation requests (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pestdoktor">Pestdoktor</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance for v0.2.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 57%, up from 56% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 81%, up from 80% last week</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now shows the filename of an image on hover. (Contributed by kamath_manu)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko now shows the fontname in the font selection rendered using that font. This makes it easier to know, how the font will look, once you select it. (Contributed by lorendb)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a crash when closing Nheko. While this didn't really cause issues, since you were closing it anyway, it's just bad form to crash instead of exit properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed the membercache. Nheko used to load all members on startup and store them in memory. This made startup slower. Removing it sped up the start by a nice chunk and freed about 30MB of RAM on my system. One step closer to using reasonable amounts of RAM!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed excessive clipping when rendering the timeline. This prevented all batching of text messages. Now it only clips the replied to message, which makes scrolling much smoother again!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, some controversial change, which is currently in master but may be reverted at some point: Nheko now automatically forwards keys to verified devices, when they request the keys, without prompting you. While that can be toggled off in the settings, it currently defaults to on. This weakens backward secrecy of e2ee a bit, but it makes it possible to recover from e2ee issues much more easily. Currently I'd argue, that it is an acceptable tradeoff. It is very hard to verify room membership of users at any point in time but the current one and room membership is not verified end to end in any way, so you need to trust the server to provide you with the correct memberlist or you just send keys to verified users. While Nheko still sends keys to all members of a room, when creating the session, it only forwards your own keys to trusted users without prompting you. Currently I think this is an acceptable tradeoff, as opening a popup with &quot;user x wants to have session y shared in room z&quot; is unlikely to be understood by anyone properly either. I'd be glad to hear your opinions though!</p>
<p>That's it for this week, but next week will be interesting too. Lorendb has been hacking on profile support, allowing you to run multiple login sessions of Nheko in separate windows and some other UI features.</p>

To make this release Quaternion had to gain its own basic HTML parser and Matrix-to-Qt-to-Matrix converter, which is likely to end up being a separate micro-library, in the hope that it will be useful for other Matrix projects building on Qt (even non-Quotient ones).

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>It's been over a week since our next-generation homeserver <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">Dendrite entered
beta</a>, and it's
been a wild rollercoaster ride as the team has been frantically zapping all
the initial teething issues that came up - mostly around room federation
getting 'stuck' due to needing to fix bugs in how room state is managed.  Huge
huge thanks to everyone who has spun up a Dendrite to experiment and report
bugs!</p>
<p>We're now in an impressively better place, and it's feeling way more stable now
(but please don't trust it with your data yet).  So we've skipped 0.1.x and jumped
straight to 0.2.0.</p>
<p>Now would be a great time for more intrepid explorers to try spinning up a
server from https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite and see how it feels - the
more feedback the better.  And if you got scared off by weird bugs in 0.1.0,
now's the right time to try it again!</p>
<p>Full changelog follows:</p>
<h2 id="dendrite-0-2-0-2020-10-20">Dendrite 0.2.0 (2020-10-20)</h2>

<p>Not only are UK/US/AU/NZ/CA/IN/JP considering mandating
backdoors, but it turns out that the Council of the European Union is working on it too, having created an advanced
<a href="https://files.orf.at/vietnam2/files/fm4/202045/783284_fh_st12143-re01en20_783284.pdf">Draft Council Resolution on Encryption</a>
as of Nov 6th, which could be approved by the Council as early as Nov 25th if it passes approval.  This doesn't directly
translate into EU legislation, but would set the direction for subsequent EU policy.</p>
<p>Even though the Draft Council Resolution does not explicitly call for backdoors, the language used...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Competent authorities must be able to access data in a lawful and targeted manner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...makes it quite clear that they are seeking the ability to break encryption on demand: i.e. a backdoor.</p>
<p>Please help us spread the word that backdoors are fundamentally flawed - read on for the rationale, and an alternative
approach to combatting online abuse.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Last Sunday (Oct 11th 2020), the UK Government published an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-statement-end-to-end-encryption-and-public-safety">international statement on end-to-end encryption and public safety</a>, co-signed by representatives from the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and Japan.  The statement is well written and well worth a read in full, but the central point is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We call on technology companies to [...] enable law enforcement access to content in a readable and usable format where an authorisation is lawfully issued, is necessary and proportionate, and is subject to strong safeguards and oversight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, this is an explicit request from seven of the biggest governments in the world to mandate a backdoor in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) communication services: a backdoor to which the authorities have a secret key, letting them view communication on demand.  This is big news, and is of direct relevance to Matrix as an end-to-end encrypted communication protocol whose core team is currently centred in the UK.</p>
<p>Now, we sympathise with the authorities‚Äô predicament here: we utterly abhor child abuse, terrorism, fascism and similar - and we did not build Matrix to enable it.  However, trying to mitigate abuse with backdoors is, unfortunately, <strong>fundamentally flawed</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Backdoors necessarily introduce a fatal weak point into encryption for <em>everyone</em>, which then becomes the ultimate high value target for attackers.  Anyone who can determine the secret needed to break the encryption will gain full access, and you can be absolutely sure <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/27/security-experts-have-cloned-all-seven-tsa-master-keys/">the backdoor key will leak</a></strong> - whether that‚Äôs via intrusion, social engineering, brute-force attacks, or accident.  And even if you unilaterally trust your current government to be responsible with the keys to the backdoor, is it wise to unilaterally trust their successors?  Computer security is only ever a matter of degree, and the only safe way to keep a secret like this safe is for it not to exist in the first place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End-to-end encryption is nowadays a completely ubiquitous technology; <strong>an attempt to legislate against it is like trying to turn back the tide</strong> or declare a branch of mathematics illegal.  Even if Matrix did compromise its encryption, users could easily use any number of other approaches to additionally secure their conversations - from PGP, to OTR, to using one-time pads, to sharing content in password-protected ZIP files.  Or they could just switch to a E2EE chat system operating from a jurisdiction without backdoors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governments protect their own data using end-to-end encryption, precisely because they do not want other governments being able to snoop on them.  So not only is it hypocritical for governments to argue for backdoors,** it immediately puts their own governmental data at risk of being compromised**.  Moreover, creating infrastructure for backdoors sets an incredibly bad precedent to the rest of the world - where less salubrious governments will inevitably use the same technology to the massive detriment of their citizens‚Äô human rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, in Matrix‚Äôs specific case: Matrix is an encrypted decentralised open network powered by open source software, where anyone can run a server.  Even if the Matrix core team were obligated to add a backdoor, this would be visible to the wider world - and <strong>there would be no way to make the wider network adopt it</strong>.  It would just damage the credibility of the core team, push encryption development to other countries,  and the wider network would move on irrespectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, we need to keep E2EE as it is so that it benefits the 99.9% of people who are good actors. If we enforce backdoors and undermine it, then the bad 0.1% percent simply will switch to non-backdoored systems while the 99.9% are left vulnerable.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre not alone in thinking this either: the GDPR (the world-leading regulation towards data protection and privacy) explicitly calls out robust encryption as a necessary information security measure. In fact, the risk of US governmental backdoors explicitly caused the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=228677&amp;doclang=EN">European Court of Justice to invalidate the Privacy Shield</a> for EU-&gt;US data.  The position of the seven governments here (alongside <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-security/20200724_com-2020-607-commission-communication_en.pdf">recent communications by the EU commissioner</a> on the ‚Äòproblem‚Äô of encryption) is a significant step back on the protection of the fundamental right of privacy.</p>
<p>So, how do we solve this predicament for Matrix?</p>
<p>Thankfully: <strong>there is another way.</strong></p>
<p>This statement from the seven governments aims to protect the general public from bad actors, but it clearly undermines the good ones.  What we <em>really</em> need is something that empowers users and administrators to identify and protect themselves from bad actors, without undermining privacy.</p>
<p>What if we had a standard way to let users themselves build up and share their own views of whether other users, messages, rooms, servers etc. are obnoxious or not?  What if you could visualise and choose which filters to apply to your view of Matrix?</p>
<p>Just like the Web, Email or the Internet as a whole, there is literally no way to unilaterally censor or block content in Matrix.  But what we <em>can</em> do is provide first-class infrastructure to let users (and room/community moderators and server admins) make up their own mind about who to trust, and what content to allow.  This would also provide a means for authorities to publish reputation data about illegal content, providing a privacy-respecting mechanism that admins/mods/users can use to keep illegal content away from their servers/clients.</p>
<p>The model we currently have in mind is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can gather reputation data about Matrix rooms / users / servers / communities / content, and publish it to as wide or narrow an audience as they like - providing their subjective score on whether something in Matrix is positive or negative in a given context.</li>
<li>This reputation data is published in a privacy preserving fashion - i.e. you can look up reputation data if you know the ID being queried, but the data is stored pseudonymised (e.g. indexed by a hashed ID).</li>
<li>Anyone can subscribe to reputation feeds and blend them together in order to inform how they filter their content.  The feeds might be their own data, or from their friends, or from trusted sources (e.g. a fact-checking company).  Their blended feed can be republished as their own.</li>
<li>To prevent users getting trapped in a factional filter bubble of their own devising, we‚Äôll provide UI to visualise and warn about the extent of their filtering - and make it easy and fun to shift their viewpoint as needed.</li>
<li>Admins running servers in particular jurisdictions then have the option to enforce whatever rules they need on their servers (e.g. they might want to subscribe to reputation feeds from a trusted source such as <a href="https://www.iwf.org.uk/">the IWF</a>, identifying child sexual abuse content, and use it to block it from their server).</li>
<li>This isn‚Äôt just about combating abuse - but the same system can also be used to empower users to filter out spam, propaganda, unwanted NSFW content, etc on their own terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>This forms a <em>relative</em> reputation system.  As uncomfortable as it may be, one man‚Äôs terrorist is another man‚Äôs freedom fighter, and different jurisdictions have different laws - and it‚Äôs not up to the Matrix.org Foundation to play God and adjudicate.  Each user/moderator/admin should be free to make up their own mind and decide which reputation feeds to align themselves with.  That is not to say that this system would help users locate extreme content - the privacy-preserving nature of the reputation data means that it‚Äôs only useful to filter <em>out</em> material which would otherwise already be visible to you - not to locate new content.</p>
<p>In terms of how this interacts with end-to-end-encryption and mitigating abuse: the reality is that the vast majority of abuse in public networks like Matrix, the Web or Email is visible from the public unencrypted domain. Abusive communities generally want to attract/recruit/groom users - and that means providing a public front door, which would be flagged by a reputation system such as the one proposed above.  Meanwhile, communities which are entirely private and entirely encrypted typically still have touch-points with the rest of the world - and even then, the chances are extremely high that they will avoid any hypothetical backdoored servers.  In short, investigating such communities requires traditional infiltration and surveillance by the authorities rather than an ineffective backdoor.</p>
<p>Now, this approach may sound completely sci-fi and implausibly overambitious (our speciality!) - but we‚Äôve actually started successfully building this already, having been refining the idea over the last few years.  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/msc2313/proposals/2313-moderation-policy-rooms.md">MSC2313</a> is a first cut at the idea of publishing and subscribing to reputation data - starting off with simple binary ban rules.  It‚Äôs been implemented and in production for over a year now, and is used to maintain shared banlists used by both matrix.org and mozilla.org communities.  The next step is to expand this to support a blendable continuum of reputation data (rather than just binary banlists), make it privacy preserving, and get working on the client UX for configuring and visualising them.</p>
<p>Finally: we are continuing to hire a dedicated Reputation Team to work full time on building this (kindly funded by Element).  This is a major investment in the future of Matrix, and frankly is spending money that we don‚Äôt really have - but it‚Äôs critical to the long-term success of the project, and perhaps the health of the Internet as a whole.  There‚Äôs nothing about a good relative reputation system which is particularly specific to Matrix, after all, and many other folks (decentralised and otherwise) are clearly in desperate need of one too. We are actively looking for funding to support this work, so if you‚Äôre feeling rich and philanthropic (or a government wanting to support a more enlightened approach) we would <em>love</em> to hear from you at <a href="mailto:funding@matrix.org">funding@matrix.org</a>!</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs to a world where users have excellent tools to protect themselves online - and a world where their safety is not compromised by encryption backdoors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In recent weeks the XR Finland community has been moving over from Wire to our own Matrix homeserver for encrypted secure chat. This was something that had been planned for a while but kicked off in recent weeks due to Wire suffering from serious encryption key delivery issues, causing messages for many to be unreadable in large groups. Currently we've migrated almost 300 rebels with more to come. Feedback has mostly been very positive, people generally like the Element clients ü§© One of the interesting changes has been a huge uptick in the amount of discussion, which can be taken as a good sign. The plan is to next start bridging to some of the international XR chapters, for example those on Mattermost, Telegram and Slack. And maybe get them over to Matrix too eventually ;)</p>
<p>To aid in community management, we've started creating <a href="https://github.com/elokapina/bubo">a bot called Bubo</a>. Right now it mostly helps with maintaining rooms and allowing mass invites, but more features to help the community cooperate are coming. We were planning to utilize (actual) communities so it has some functionality for those, but decided then to wait for the communities rewrite. It doesn't yet have any releases, will update in coming weeks as features are added and releases made.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">released our first beta last week</a> and we've been busy taking feedback from the community and fixing problems as they have been reported to us. We will be cutting a v0.2.0 release candidate later today, which contains a significant number of important fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>We didn't publish a full changelog last week due to the beta announcement, therefore the following list includes changes from the last two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Database migrations are now ran automatically at startup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State resolution v2 performance has been improved dramatically on large state sets, seen to be running up to 20x faster in some rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer runs state resolution over single trusted state snapshots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monolith deployments with Kafka now work again (each component sets up connections independently to avoid duplicate consumers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now correctly rejects invalid UTF-8 - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully read markers are now handled - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>completed</code> field is now returned properly for user-interactive auth - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The devices table now tracks last seen timestamps, IPs and user agents - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed in the reverse topological ordering algorithm which resulted in us giving up on inbound references after the first prev/auth event</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug with concurrent map writes in the rate limiting in the client API has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities and their previous events are now checked fully against the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typing events are now ignored if the sender domain doesn't match the origin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duplicate redaction entries no longer result in database errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some bugs in <code>/send</code> have been fixed where the full room state wasn't requested properly before sending a new snapshot to the roomserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The membership updaters now use database writers properly, which fixes some SQLite locking issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sync API no longer burns CPU processing unnecessary device key change notifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>QueryStateAfterEvents</code> now resolves state from multiple snapshots properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cumulative room state is now sent to the roomserver when creating rooms locally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missing auth events will now be retrieved from multiple servers in the room if necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation requests now have variable timeouts, allowing us to wait much longer for a remote server to process certain tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/send</code> endpoint now returns 500 errors far less often, reducing the frequency that other servers back off from sending to Dendrite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backfill no longer uses the request context for persisting events, which was resulting in us failing to store those events sometimes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite stripped state from the sync API now includes the stripped invite itself, so that Element Web can display who sent the invite properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The signing key fetch mechanism no longer gives up if it is unable to fetch specific keys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling of invalid display name or avatar URLs in membership events has been improved</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved a little:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 80%, up from 79% last week</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>I opened two issues on element-ios which currently break register and login support on Conduit, making it completely unusable. Hopefully they can be resolved soon (https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3736, https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3737)</li>
<li>I'm working on an MSC for threading. It's still WIP, but you can take a look here: https://demo.codimd.org/s/SykbuAUwP</li>

<p><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/stonking">Stonking</a> week for Synapse as we landed sharded event persisters and deployed to matrix.org. This is the last significant component other than the main process to go through the sharding process and a major hurdle in horizontal scalability of Synapse.</p>
<p>Initial results look good with event persistence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">apdex</a> improving, however we think there are still some significant performance improvements available through configuration and will continue to experiment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We also moved off background processes from the main process. This is significant because it means that while the main process is not shardable it really doesn‚Äôt do anything anymore other than orchestration.</p>
<p>Again the initial impact looks very promising and we will continue to tune. Having moved the background processes away it also makes profiling the main process that much easier.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Small bit of news I wanted to talk about from Bridge Island. My <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8437">implementation</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> has been merged which means appservices / bridges can now listen in for incoming presence, typing and read receipt events! This means that the Slack bridge can now reliably send your typing status to Slack, and Bifrost can reliably bridge your everything to XMPP. The MSC is still in flux and could change, but for now this could really improve the native feeling of bridges :)</p>
<p>(Oh and I should mention anyone using matrix-appservice-bridge v2.2.0+ can use this behaviour for free)</p>

<p>Hot on his heels, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been adding support for the MSCs Half-Shot implemented in Synapse to my bridges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enabling end-to-bridge encryption now uses appservice login (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2778">MSC2778</a>), which means setting up the shared secret login module is no longer required for e2be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mautrix-python has support for receiving ephemeral events via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> in a branch, which will be merged once Synapse v1.22 is released. After it's merged, <code>/sync</code>ing with double puppets will no longer be necessary to bridge ephemeral events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these will also be implemented in mautrix-go/whatsapp soon.</p>
<p>Now I just need Half-Shot to make synapse send to-device events to appservices, after which bridges won't need any hacky <code>/sync</code>ing at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several releases this week (0.1.11 to 0.1.15) with lots of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>url-based navigation has landed! All navigation in the app is now done through urls, meaning you can also bookmark any UI state (e.g. grid configurations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed 2 memory leaks (exposed now because you can unload your session without refreshing the page)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed an issue with libolm running out of memory if you send a message to more than 44 devices (see issue #150).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some logical additions now we have url navigation: restoring the last url when opening the app with the default route, and a button to close your session and go back to the picker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the app now blocks concurrent access to the same session from different tabs (it just closes the session in the non-active tab). This will prevent multiple syncs tripping over each other writing to indexeddb (e.g. ConstraintErrors and friends).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>updates are announced in the app (for now through a confirm dialog, but will use an in app notification once we have it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixes updates not installing on iOS, by having an update prompt. To get this update on iOS though, you'll need to unpin the app, and pinning it again. You'll need to login again after this. All future updates should be installable through the update prompt once you have 0.1.15 though, you won't have to do this again normally.</p>

<li>
<p>uses the hydrogen icon when pinning on iOS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I published the first preview of my Sailfish client called Konheko. While you can run Android applications on Sailfish, they usually are a subpar experience, since they really don't fit the platforms design and style and also usually don't properly send notifications.</p>
<p>So about a year ago I started working on a Matrix client for SailfishOS, but I never really made much progress. Well, last weekend I did, and so it can now send plain text messages as well as various forms of media messages, I made a basic application icon and I've been using it this week already (for unencrypted rooms).</p>
<p>It is still missing a lot of features, but if you want you can install it from <a href="https://openrepos.net/content/deepbluev7/konheko">OpenRepos</a>. Sources are available <a href="https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/konheko">here</a>. Just be aware, that it currently stores all messages in RAM, so every restart will take forever to load your rooms and it may run out of RAM at some point. Storing messages in some database will come at some point. Also, a lot of menus may lead nowhere, since those are just placeholders for me atm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently, I tweaked Element-web to feature a few changes similar to SchildiChat for Android.</p>
<p>For now, it's probably best seen rather as a proof-of-concept than a finished product, as there are still some layout bugs, and no settings available for the added features (I know some people prefer separate lists for direct and group chats).
I consider it usable though.</p>
<p>Particular changes compared to upstream Element-web include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A common section for groups and direct chats in the overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message bubbles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bigger items in the room overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A different dark theme, similar to SchildiChat for Android</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know how much I will work on this in the future, but I figured it might be interesting to share either way. Maybe even someone with more web-development skills than me might want to help improving it :)</p>

            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Today we have released Synapse 1.21.2, which fixes a couple of minor bugs that crept into the previous release. Full details are below.</p>
<p>Separately, we are advising any administrators who have not yet upgraded to Synapse 1.21.0 or later to do so as soon as possible. Previous versions of Synapse were vulnerable to a cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack; the bug was fixed in Synapse 1.21.0 with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8444">PR #8444</a>.</p>
<p>The changelog for 1.21.2 is as follows:</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-21-2-2020-10-15">Synapse 1.21.2 (2020-10-15)</h1>
<p>Debian packages and Docker images have been rebuilt using the latest versions of dependency libraries, including authlib 0.15.1. Please see bugfixes below.</p>
<h2 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix rare bug where sending an event would fail due to a racey assertion. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8530">#8530</a>)</li>
<li>An updated version of the authlib dependency is included in the Docker and Debian images to fix an issue using OpenID Connect. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8534">#8534</a> for details.</li>
