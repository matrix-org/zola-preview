<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.0">Synapse 1.22.0</a> is out! We announced its first release candidate <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/23/this-week-in-matrix-2020-10-23#synapse">last week</a>, and after a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.0rc2">small rc2</a> the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.0">final release</a> was published last Tuesday. We anticipate a small 1.22.1 release later today with fixes for messages not always being sent to app services (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8673">#8673</a>) and serialization errors with third-party event rules (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8678">#8678</a>).</p>
<p>We continue to see improved client join <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">Apdex</a> scores for matrix.org, indicating that our work in 1.22.0 to split background tasks into separate workers and allow for sharded event persisters successfully improved the user-visible performance of large homeservers.</p>
<p>In other news, we pushed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8675">a temporary hotfix</a> to the matrix.org homeserver earlier this week, instructing it to drop all cross-user <code>m.key_share_request</code> messages. This was necessary to mitigate <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/famedlysdk/-/issues/126">a bug</a> in a third-party library which caused some clients to flood the server with requests. We'll re-enable these messages once we resolve <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8677">issue #8677</a>. In the meantime, we strongly encourage <a href="https://fluffychat.im/">FluffyChat</a> users to upgrade to version 0.21.1.</p>
<p>We're hard at work on the next release of Synapse, and the development branch <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/compare/v1.22.0...develop">already includes</a> many bugfixes, several new admin APIs, and support for structured logging‚Äîstay tuned!</p>

<p>There is no release this week, be sure to have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.2.1">v0.2.1</a> installed for a more stable experience! A few documentation changes have been made this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Docker sample configs are now correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>MaxMessageBytes</code> for Kafka messages is now configurable - thanks <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">@S7evinK</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>

<p>This was an exciting week again. Trilene did the usual and just opened a PR, that implements the video part of call support. In my testing so far this seems to work amazingly well (ignore, that my webcam is crappy in the video, I only have so many devices...)! It's hard to overstate my satisfaction, if I am allowed to quote songs without getting a DMCA! If you want to try it out, you will need the qmlgl plugin at runtime (I had to patch some ebuilds on Gentoo to do so) and build Nheko from source. Support in our AppImage and Flatpak and for our Windows and MacOS builds will come at a later date. A big shoutout to trilene, who just works on VOIP in Nheko, without saying a word, and then drops a ready PR.</p>
<p>Another exciting new feature by lorendb, you can now specify <code>--profile &lt;profilename&gt;</code>, when you start Nheko, to create a separate profile. This allows you to open multiple instances and use multiple accounts at the same time (but it still uses separate instances of Nheko). This is pretty useful, if you have multiple accounts on different homeservers or are testing stuff for example. He also added a shortcut to delete the current content of the message area (Ctrl-U).</p>
<p>We also fixed a long standing bug, that crashed Nheko when pasting an image on mac OS, prevented copying text in some cases and build times should be about halfed again.</p>
<p>That's all I got today. I guess we should do a new release at some point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked about trilene, who is a reliable Nheko contributor, Nico replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>trilene seems to be a bit camera shy and prefer to work on code than take credit and talk about upcoming features. I'm surprised everytime, when a new PR is opened or trilene asks a weird question, that can only end up in an amazing contribution :3</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> v0.5.8 is out now with experimental support for EDUs being sent to appservices (per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a>). </p>
<p>To enable it you'll need Synapse 1.22.0 (released this week) and v0.5.8 of the bot-sdk. Then, add <code>&quot;de.sorunome.msc2409.ephemeral&quot;: true</code> to your appservice registration file (at the root level) and turn on the <code>de.sorunome.msc2409.ephemeral</code> flag in your <code>IAppserviceRegistration</code> supplied to the bot-sdk. If all goes according to plan, you'll be able to use <code>appservice.on(&quot;ephemeral.event&quot;, (ev) =&gt; {})</code> to start processing EDUs.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting November 28th and 29th of this year, many bots on t2bot.io will be supporting end-to-end encryption. Though not all bots will be supporting it, this is an important milestone towards getting end-to-bridge encryption enabled on t2bot.io as a proof of being able to scale to the higher demand of encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>The eventual goal is to support encryption on all of t2bot.io‚Äôs bots and bridges, however we need to take small steps to get there üôÇ. Note that in order to function, bots will decrypt <em>all</em> messages they see, but only respond to the ones they care about - this can still be uncomfortable for some rooms though, so feel free to kick them out.</p>
<p>For more detail on which bots are getting support and what all this entails/means, please see the <a href="https://t2bot.io/blog/2020/10/30/enabling-encryption-for-bots/">dedicated blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Keymaker is a new WIP Project of some people (over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#serverlist:nordgedanken.dev">#serverlist:nordgedanken.dev</a>  ) that aim to provide a <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/communities/">mastodon</a> alike Server List and we would love to get some more input from the Community for this project on whats wanted, whats needed and whats maybe not that good to base on the mastodon counterpart.</p>
<p>This means we are building:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A list of Servers where Owners can add their servers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We try to do Quality controls (No fully self add. Servers get reviewed.) using a Code of Conduct Ruleset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verified Listings using well-known files on serverside (Also allowing Admins to modify server data themself)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server Details like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ping and Avalibility Stats (thanks to tulir for providing a API)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public Room Lists fetched from the Server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NSFW Ratings (A NSFW tag was too generic for us)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Section to list Rules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Admin addresses for easy ways of reaching the Server admins</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing to select registration state (&quot;Open&quot;, &quot;Invite Only&quot;, &quot;Closed&quot;)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Code is fully written in Rust and using Postgres as a backend. Have a look at: <a href="https://github.com/daydream-mx/keymaker">https://github.com/daydream-mx/keymaker</a></p>

<p>In a further post we plan to announce the launch of this Project as a Website. Server owners might get a ping before that to allow for setting up servers for this. This Project is not yet deployed to be used.</p>

<p>This is really cool. I suggested it might start to kickstart people hosting their own small, publicly open servers.</p>

<p>As we also allow non public servers (registration -&gt; closed) it may also be a nice way to find communities that federate and have a look if they have a interesting room to join in the public rooms list. :)</p>

<p>Hello everyone, normally anoa would be doing this update but today you get me (TravisR) instead. Luckily anoa has left me a script to run, so here's hoping I haven't completely messed up this week's update üòÖ</p>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a>.</p>

<h4 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h4>
<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we're still focusing on the same MSCs from previous weeks to get widgets over the line. This includes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2774">MSC2774</a> to have widgets aware of their widget ID, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2765">MSC2765</a> so widgets can be pretty in clients like Element, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2790">MSC2790</a> to support a form of user input with widgets.</p>
<p>Normally there would be a graph here of our MSC progress, however my machine refuses to accept that line graphs are a real thing today. As a replacement, here's a <a href="https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/generate_chart_e.html?hlyRange=1997-12-02%7C2020-10-22&amp;dlyRange=1995-04-01%7C2020-10-22&amp;mlyRange=1995-04-01%7C2007-11-01&amp;StationID=27378&amp;Prov=AB&amp;urlExtension=_e.html&amp;searchType=stnProv&amp;optLimit=specDate&amp;StartYear=1840&amp;EndYear=2020&amp;selRowPerPage=25&amp;Line=46&amp;Month=10&amp;Day=22&amp;lstProvince=&amp;timeframe=2&amp;Year=2020&amp;type=bar&amp;MeasTypeID=snow">snowfall accumulation graph for Banff</a> as reported by Environment Canada.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> on Tuesday, a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/20/dendrite-0-2-0-released">reasonably big update</a> containing various improvements over the initial beta release, and then followed it up with a bug-fix <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.2.1">v0.2.1</a> release on Thursday. </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has been running Dendrite and reporting their findings, and also to contributors who have been submitting pull requests!</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer builds separate binaries for each polylith component, but instead has one multi-personality binary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Docker images have been simplified into two images: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-monolith">dendrite-monolith</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-polylith">dendrite-polylith</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal HTTP API calls are now made using H2C (HTTP/2) in polylith mode, which resolves some head-of-line issues with the connection pool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities have been refactored, which should fix some cases where room state can end up corrupted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A couple of bugs when handling state rewrites have been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sync API no longer sends old state events to clients as if they were new</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQLite locking bugs around the latest events updater have been resolved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notification levels are now parsed correctly in power level events (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pestdoktor">Pestdoktor</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invalid UTF-8 is now correctly rejected when making federation requests (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pestdoktor">Pestdoktor</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance for v0.2.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 57%, up from 56% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 81%, up from 80% last week</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:conduit.rs">Timo</a> stepped in to tell us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was another productive week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved thumbnailing algorithm (higher quality, less stored data, correct)</li>
<li>Allow unjoined users to read state of world readable rooms (this makes shields.io work with conduit)</li>
<li>Docs for cross compiling conduit</li>
<li>Fixed stuck / double-join over federation</li>
<li>Fixed random timeline reload bug</li>
<li>Welcome message in admin room</li>
<li>More frequent flushing</li>
</ul>
<p>Some WIP things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide Conduit binaries for most platforms to make setting up or updating a Conduit instance even easier</li>
<li>More reliable sending over federation</li>
<li>Bring all features of our Ruma fork upstream</li>

<p>Element Android v1.0.9 is now available on the PlayStore. For the next release (1.0.10), we will optimize the performance (again!). We already have made some progress when sending a message to a room. We are now working on the crypto module and also we will probably upgrade the Realm database library, which seems more stable now. Besides that, we are still implementing the remaining features with the objective of getting a good feature parity with the other Element Matrix clients.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now shows the filename of an image on hover. (Contributed by kamath_manu)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko now shows the fontname in the font selection rendered using that font. This makes it easier to know, how the font will look, once you select it. (Contributed by lorendb)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a crash when closing Nheko. While this didn't really cause issues, since you were closing it anyway, it's just bad form to crash instead of exit properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed the membercache. Nheko used to load all members on startup and store them in memory. This made startup slower. Removing it sped up the start by a nice chunk and freed about 30MB of RAM on my system. One step closer to using reasonable amounts of RAM!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed excessive clipping when rendering the timeline. This prevented all batching of text messages. Now it only clips the replied to message, which makes scrolling much smoother again!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, some controversial change, which is currently in master but may be reverted at some point: Nheko now automatically forwards keys to verified devices, when they request the keys, without prompting you. While that can be toggled off in the settings, it currently defaults to on. This weakens backward secrecy of e2ee a bit, but it makes it possible to recover from e2ee issues much more easily. Currently I'd argue, that it is an acceptable tradeoff. It is very hard to verify room membership of users at any point in time but the current one and room membership is not verified end to end in any way, so you need to trust the server to provide you with the correct memberlist or you just send keys to verified users. While Nheko still sends keys to all members of a room, when creating the session, it only forwards your own keys to trusted users without prompting you. Currently I think this is an acceptable tradeoff, as opening a popup with &quot;user x wants to have session y shared in room z&quot; is unlikely to be understood by anyone properly either. I'd be glad to hear your opinions though!</p>
<p>That's it for this week, but next week will be interesting too. Lorendb has been hacking on profile support, allowing you to run multiple login sessions of Nheko in separate windows and some other UI features.</p>

To make this release Quaternion had to gain its own basic HTML parser and Matrix-to-Qt-to-Matrix converter, which is likely to end up being a separate micro-library, in the hope that it will be useful for other Matrix projects building on Qt (even non-Quotient ones).

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>It's been over a week since our next-generation homeserver <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">Dendrite entered
beta</a>, and it's
been a wild rollercoaster ride as the team has been frantically zapping all
the initial teething issues that came up - mostly around room federation
getting 'stuck' due to needing to fix bugs in how room state is managed.  Huge
huge thanks to everyone who has spun up a Dendrite to experiment and report
bugs!</p>
<p>We're now in an impressively better place, and it's feeling way more stable now
(but please don't trust it with your data yet).  So we've skipped 0.1.x and jumped
straight to 0.2.0.</p>
<p>Now would be a great time for more intrepid explorers to try spinning up a
server from https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite and see how it feels - the
more feedback the better.  And if you got scared off by weird bugs in 0.1.0,
now's the right time to try it again!</p>
<p>Full changelog follows:</p>

<p>Not only are UK/US/AU/NZ/CA/IN/JP considering mandating
backdoors, but it turns out that the Council of the European Union is working on it too, having created an advanced
<a href="https://files.orf.at/vietnam2/files/fm4/202045/783284_fh_st12143-re01en20_783284.pdf">Draft Council Resolution on Encryption</a>
as of Nov 6th, which could be approved by the Council as early as Nov 25th if it passes approval.  This doesn't directly
translate into EU legislation, but would set the direction for subsequent EU policy.</p>
<p>Even though the Draft Council Resolution does not explicitly call for backdoors, the language used...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Competent authorities must be able to access data in a lawful and targeted manner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...makes it quite clear that they are seeking the ability to break encryption on demand: i.e. a backdoor.</p>
<p>Please help us spread the word that backdoors are fundamentally flawed - read on for the rationale, and an alternative
approach to combatting online abuse.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Last Sunday (Oct 11th 2020), the UK Government published an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-statement-end-to-end-encryption-and-public-safety">international statement on end-to-end encryption and public safety</a>, co-signed by representatives from the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and Japan.  The statement is well written and well worth a read in full, but the central point is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We call on technology companies to [...] enable law enforcement access to content in a readable and usable format where an authorisation is lawfully issued, is necessary and proportionate, and is subject to strong safeguards and oversight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, this is an explicit request from seven of the biggest governments in the world to mandate a backdoor in end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) communication services: a backdoor to which the authorities have a secret key, letting them view communication on demand.  This is big news, and is of direct relevance to Matrix as an end-to-end encrypted communication protocol whose core team is currently centred in the UK.</p>
<p>Now, we sympathise with the authorities‚Äô predicament here: we utterly abhor child abuse, terrorism, fascism and similar - and we did not build Matrix to enable it.  However, trying to mitigate abuse with backdoors is, unfortunately, <strong>fundamentally flawed</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Backdoors necessarily introduce a fatal weak point into encryption for <em>everyone</em>, which then becomes the ultimate high value target for attackers.  Anyone who can determine the secret needed to break the encryption will gain full access, and you can be absolutely sure <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/27/security-experts-have-cloned-all-seven-tsa-master-keys/">the backdoor key will leak</a></strong> - whether that‚Äôs via intrusion, social engineering, brute-force attacks, or accident.  And even if you unilaterally trust your current government to be responsible with the keys to the backdoor, is it wise to unilaterally trust their successors?  Computer security is only ever a matter of degree, and the only safe way to keep a secret like this safe is for it not to exist in the first place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End-to-end encryption is nowadays a completely ubiquitous technology; <strong>an attempt to legislate against it is like trying to turn back the tide</strong> or declare a branch of mathematics illegal.  Even if Matrix did compromise its encryption, users could easily use any number of other approaches to additionally secure their conversations - from PGP, to OTR, to using one-time pads, to sharing content in password-protected ZIP files.  Or they could just switch to a E2EE chat system operating from a jurisdiction without backdoors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governments protect their own data using end-to-end encryption, precisely because they do not want other governments being able to snoop on them.  So not only is it hypocritical for governments to argue for backdoors,** it immediately puts their own governmental data at risk of being compromised**.  Moreover, creating infrastructure for backdoors sets an incredibly bad precedent to the rest of the world - where less salubrious governments will inevitably use the same technology to the massive detriment of their citizens‚Äô human rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, in Matrix‚Äôs specific case: Matrix is an encrypted decentralised open network powered by open source software, where anyone can run a server.  Even if the Matrix core team were obligated to add a backdoor, this would be visible to the wider world - and <strong>there would be no way to make the wider network adopt it</strong>.  It would just damage the credibility of the core team, push encryption development to other countries,  and the wider network would move on irrespectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, we need to keep E2EE as it is so that it benefits the 99.9% of people who are good actors. If we enforce backdoors and undermine it, then the bad 0.1% percent simply will switch to non-backdoored systems while the 99.9% are left vulnerable.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre not alone in thinking this either: the GDPR (the world-leading regulation towards data protection and privacy) explicitly calls out robust encryption as a necessary information security measure. In fact, the risk of US governmental backdoors explicitly caused the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=228677&amp;doclang=EN">European Court of Justice to invalidate the Privacy Shield</a> for EU-&gt;US data.  The position of the seven governments here (alongside <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-security/20200724_com-2020-607-commission-communication_en.pdf">recent communications by the EU commissioner</a> on the ‚Äòproblem‚Äô of encryption) is a significant step back on the protection of the fundamental right of privacy.</p>
<p>So, how do we solve this predicament for Matrix?</p>
<p>Thankfully: <strong>there is another way.</strong></p>
<p>This statement from the seven governments aims to protect the general public from bad actors, but it clearly undermines the good ones.  What we <em>really</em> need is something that empowers users and administrators to identify and protect themselves from bad actors, without undermining privacy.</p>
<p>What if we had a standard way to let users themselves build up and share their own views of whether other users, messages, rooms, servers etc. are obnoxious or not?  What if you could visualise and choose which filters to apply to your view of Matrix?</p>
<p>Just like the Web, Email or the Internet as a whole, there is literally no way to unilaterally censor or block content in Matrix.  But what we <em>can</em> do is provide first-class infrastructure to let users (and room/community moderators and server admins) make up their own mind about who to trust, and what content to allow.  This would also provide a means for authorities to publish reputation data about illegal content, providing a privacy-respecting mechanism that admins/mods/users can use to keep illegal content away from their servers/clients.</p>
<p>The model we currently have in mind is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can gather reputation data about Matrix rooms / users / servers / communities / content, and publish it to as wide or narrow an audience as they like - providing their subjective score on whether something in Matrix is positive or negative in a given context.</li>
<li>This reputation data is published in a privacy preserving fashion - i.e. you can look up reputation data if you know the ID being queried, but the data is stored pseudonymised (e.g. indexed by a hashed ID).</li>
<li>Anyone can subscribe to reputation feeds and blend them together in order to inform how they filter their content.  The feeds might be their own data, or from their friends, or from trusted sources (e.g. a fact-checking company).  Their blended feed can be republished as their own.</li>
<li>To prevent users getting trapped in a factional filter bubble of their own devising, we‚Äôll provide UI to visualise and warn about the extent of their filtering - and make it easy and fun to shift their viewpoint as needed.</li>
<li>Admins running servers in particular jurisdictions then have the option to enforce whatever rules they need on their servers (e.g. they might want to subscribe to reputation feeds from a trusted source such as <a href="https://www.iwf.org.uk/">the IWF</a>, identifying child sexual abuse content, and use it to block it from their server).</li>
<li>This isn‚Äôt just about combating abuse - but the same system can also be used to empower users to filter out spam, propaganda, unwanted NSFW content, etc on their own terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>This forms a <em>relative</em> reputation system.  As uncomfortable as it may be, one man‚Äôs terrorist is another man‚Äôs freedom fighter, and different jurisdictions have different laws - and it‚Äôs not up to the Matrix.org Foundation to play God and adjudicate.  Each user/moderator/admin should be free to make up their own mind and decide which reputation feeds to align themselves with.  That is not to say that this system would help users locate extreme content - the privacy-preserving nature of the reputation data means that it‚Äôs only useful to filter <em>out</em> material which would otherwise already be visible to you - not to locate new content.</p>
<p>In terms of how this interacts with end-to-end-encryption and mitigating abuse: the reality is that the vast majority of abuse in public networks like Matrix, the Web or Email is visible from the public unencrypted domain. Abusive communities generally want to attract/recruit/groom users - and that means providing a public front door, which would be flagged by a reputation system such as the one proposed above.  Meanwhile, communities which are entirely private and entirely encrypted typically still have touch-points with the rest of the world - and even then, the chances are extremely high that they will avoid any hypothetical backdoored servers.  In short, investigating such communities requires traditional infiltration and surveillance by the authorities rather than an ineffective backdoor.</p>
<p>Now, this approach may sound completely sci-fi and implausibly overambitious (our speciality!) - but we‚Äôve actually started successfully building this already, having been refining the idea over the last few years.  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/msc2313/proposals/2313-moderation-policy-rooms.md">MSC2313</a> is a first cut at the idea of publishing and subscribing to reputation data - starting off with simple binary ban rules.  It‚Äôs been implemented and in production for over a year now, and is used to maintain shared banlists used by both matrix.org and mozilla.org communities.  The next step is to expand this to support a blendable continuum of reputation data (rather than just binary banlists), make it privacy preserving, and get working on the client UX for configuring and visualising them.</p>
<p>Finally: we are continuing to hire a dedicated Reputation Team to work full time on building this (kindly funded by Element).  This is a major investment in the future of Matrix, and frankly is spending money that we don‚Äôt really have - but it‚Äôs critical to the long-term success of the project, and perhaps the health of the Internet as a whole.  There‚Äôs nothing about a good relative reputation system which is particularly specific to Matrix, after all, and many other folks (decentralised and otherwise) are clearly in desperate need of one too. We are actively looking for funding to support this work, so if you‚Äôre feeling rich and philanthropic (or a government wanting to support a more enlightened approach) we would <em>love</em> to hear from you at <a href="mailto:funding@matrix.org">funding@matrix.org</a>!</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs to a world where users have excellent tools to protect themselves online - and a world where their safety is not compromised by encryption backdoors.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:elokapina.fi">kapina-jaywink</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent weeks the XR Finland community has been moving over from Wire to our own Matrix homeserver for encrypted secure chat. This was something that had been planned for a while but kicked off in recent weeks due to Wire suffering from serious encryption key delivery issues, causing messages for many to be unreadable in large groups. Currently we've migrated almost 300 rebels with more to come. Feedback has mostly been very positive, people generally like the Element clients ü§© One of the interesting changes has been a huge uptick in the amount of discussion, which can be taken as a good sign. The plan is to next start bridging to some of the international XR chapters, for example those on Mattermost, Telegram and Slack. And maybe get them over to Matrix too eventually ;)</p>
<p>To aid in community management, we've started creating <a href="https://github.com/elokapina/bubo">a bot called Bubo</a>. Right now it mostly helps with maintaining rooms and allowing mass invites, but more features to help the community cooperate are coming. We were planning to utilize (actual) communities so it has some functionality for those, but decided then to wait for the communities rewrite. It doesn't yet have any releases, will update in coming weeks as features are added and releases made.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">released our first beta last week</a> and we've been busy taking feedback from the community and fixing problems as they have been reported to us. We will be cutting a v0.2.0 release candidate later today, which contains a significant number of important fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>We didn't publish a full changelog last week due to the beta announcement, therefore the following list includes changes from the last two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Database migrations are now ran automatically at startup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State resolution v2 performance has been improved dramatically on large state sets, seen to be running up to 20x faster in some rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer runs state resolution over single trusted state snapshots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monolith deployments with Kafka now work again (each component sets up connections independently to avoid duplicate consumers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now correctly rejects invalid UTF-8 - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully read markers are now handled - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>completed</code> field is now returned properly for user-interactive auth - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The devices table now tracks last seen timestamps, IPs and user agents - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed in the reverse topological ordering algorithm which resulted in us giving up on inbound references after the first prev/auth event</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug with concurrent map writes in the rate limiting in the client API has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities and their previous events are now checked fully against the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typing events are now ignored if the sender domain doesn't match the origin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duplicate redaction entries no longer result in database errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some bugs in <code>/send</code> have been fixed where the full room state wasn't requested properly before sending a new snapshot to the roomserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The membership updaters now use database writers properly, which fixes some SQLite locking issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sync API no longer burns CPU processing unnecessary device key change notifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>QueryStateAfterEvents</code> now resolves state from multiple snapshots properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cumulative room state is now sent to the roomserver when creating rooms locally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missing auth events will now be retrieved from multiple servers in the room if necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation requests now have variable timeouts, allowing us to wait much longer for a remote server to process certain tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/send</code> endpoint now returns 500 errors far less often, reducing the frequency that other servers back off from sending to Dendrite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backfill no longer uses the request context for persisting events, which was resulting in us failing to store those events sometimes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite stripped state from the sync API now includes the stripped invite itself, so that Element Web can display who sent the invite properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The signing key fetch mechanism no longer gives up if it is unable to fetch specific keys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling of invalid display name or avatar URLs in membership events has been improved</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved a little:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 80%, up from 79% last week</p>

<p>Hello everyone, this week we merged the federation branch into master. It's not ready to be used properly yet, but we're merging it as it seems stable enough for now. We also improved performance of the federation branch a lot by turning off debug logs.</p>
<p>Other news:</p>
<ul>
<li>I opened two issues on element-ios which currently break register and login support on Conduit, making it completely unusable. Hopefully they can be resolved soon (https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3736, https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3737)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>We also moved off background processes from the main process. This is significant because it means that while the main process is not shardable it really doesn‚Äôt do anything anymore other than orchestration.</p>
<p>Again the initial impact looks very promising and we will continue to tune. Having moved the background processes away it also makes profiling the main process that much easier.</p>

This means that the Slack bridge can now reliably send your typing status to Slack, and Bifrost can reliably bridge your everything to XMPP. The MSC is still in flux and could change, but for now this could really improve the native feeling of bridges :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've been adding support for the MSCs Half-Shot implemented in Synapse to my bridges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enabling end-to-bridge encryption now uses appservice login (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2778">MSC2778</a>), which means setting up the shared secret login module is no longer required for e2be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mautrix-python has support for receiving ephemeral events via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> in a branch, which will be merged once Synapse v1.22 is released. After it's merged, <code>/sync</code>ing with double puppets will no longer be necessary to bridge ephemeral events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these will also be implemented in mautrix-go/whatsapp soon.</p>
<p>Now I just need Half-Shot to make synapse send to-device events to appservices, after which bridges won't need any hacky <code>/sync</code>ing at all.</p>

<p>Several releases this week (0.1.11 to 0.1.15) with lots of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>url-based navigation has landed! All navigation in the app is now done through urls, meaning you can also bookmark any UI state (e.g. grid configurations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed 2 memory leaks (exposed now because you can unload your session without refreshing the page)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed an issue with libolm running out of memory if you send a message to more than 44 devices (see issue #150).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some logical additions now we have url navigation: restoring the last url when opening the app with the default route, and a button to close your session and go back to the picker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the app now blocks concurrent access to the same session from different tabs (it just closes the session in the non-active tab). This will prevent multiple syncs tripping over each other writing to indexeddb (e.g. ConstraintErrors and friends).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>updates are announced in the app (for now through a confirm dialog, but will use an in app notification once we have it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixes updates not installing on iOS, by having an update prompt. To get this update on iOS though, you'll need to unpin the app, and pinning it again. You'll need to login again after this. All future updates should be installable through the update prompt once you have 0.1.15 though, you won't have to do this again normally.</p>

Well, last weekend I did, and so it can now send plain text messages as well as various forms of media messages, I made a basic application icon and I've been using it this week already (for unencrypted rooms).</p>
<p>It is still missing a lot of features, but if you want you can install it from <a href="https://openrepos.net/content/deepbluev7/konheko">OpenRepos</a>. Sources are available <a href="https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/konheko">here</a>. Just be aware, that it currently stores all messages in RAM, so every restart will take forever to load your rooms and it may run out of RAM at some point. Storing messages in some database will come at some point. Also, a lot of menus may lead nowhere, since those are just placeholders for me atm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently, I tweaked Element-web to feature a few changes similar to SchildiChat for Android.</p>
<p>For now, it's probably best seen rather as a proof-of-concept than a finished product, as there are still some layout bugs, and no settings available for the added features (I know some people prefer separate lists for direct and group chats).
I consider it usable though.</p>
<p>Particular changes compared to upstream Element-web include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A common section for groups and direct chats in the overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message bubbles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bigger items in the room overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A different dark theme, similar to SchildiChat for Android</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know how much I will work on this in the future, but I figured it might be interesting to share either way. Maybe even someone with more web-development skills than me might want to help improving it :)</p>
<p>For further discussion, I have created <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#schildichat-web:matrix.org">#schildichat-web:matrix.org</a> .</p>
<p>The current version of SchildiChat-Desktop is available for Desktop <a href="https://github.com/SpiritCroc/schildichat-desktop/releases">here</a>, and I host the web variant <a href="https://schildiweb.spiritcroc.de/">here</a>.

            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Today we have released Synapse 1.21.2, which fixes a couple of minor bugs that crept into the previous release. Full details are below.</p>
<p>Separately, we are advising any administrators who have not yet upgraded to Synapse 1.21.0 or later to do so as soon as possible. Previous versions of Synapse were vulnerable to a cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack; the bug was fixed in Synapse 1.21.0 with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8444">PR #8444</a>.</p>
<p>The changelog for 1.21.2 is as follows:</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-21-2-2020-10-15">Synapse 1.21.2 (2020-10-15)</h1>
<p>Debian packages and Docker images have been rebuilt using the latest versions of dependency libraries, including authlib 0.15.1. Please see bugfixes below.</p>
<h2 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix rare bug where sending an event would fail due to a racey assertion. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8530">#8530</a>)</li>
<li>An updated version of the authlib dependency is included in the Docker and Debian images to fix an issue using OpenID Connect. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8534">#8534</a> for details.</li>

<h3 id="dendrite-goes-beta">Dendrite goes beta</h3>
<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">has officially entered beta</a>!</p>
<p>It aims to be an efficient, reliable and scalable alternative to Synapse.</p>
<p>We encourage early adopters to try it out starting with v0.1.0 in Monolith/Postgres mode.</p>
<p>Dendrite supports a large amount of the Matrix spec including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All room versions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E2E encryption (but not cross-signing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and many others!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll be hard at work in the coming weeks ironing out any issues that crop up as Dendrite enters the global</p>
<p>federation of Matrix servers. At present, Dendrite has not been optimised for memory/CPU usage, nor does it
fully support sharding, so there is still much scope to improve the already impressive resource usage whilst</p>
<p>heading towards 100% spec compliance.</p>
<p>Spec compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 77%, same as last week</p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I worked on a new feature: the Admin Room. This is a room that is automatically created for the first user of a new homeserver. This room will be used to send warnings to server admins in the future and can be used to control Conduit (like querying information, running cleanup, banning servers, hiding public rooms or restarting Conduit). Power levels can be used to control who in the room has access to which commands. The admin room will work over federation, so it's easy to help someone fix his server.</p>
<p>Other news:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Federation is now disabled by default and can be enabled in the config</p>

<li>

<p>After a long and sometimes painful journey we plan to run sharded event persisters on matrix.org from Monday. All being well we will start running background processes on their own worker to free up the main process.
These two projects combined should noticeably improve performance of matrix.org and any large scale deployments.</p>
<p>Aside from that we are continuing to work on room knocking as a feature and have been considering ways to reduce load attributable to state resolution.</p>
<p>We will also dust off the notifications project.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we finally cleaned up the remaining parts of Chethans GSoC work and merged it. This means Nheko now has partial support for cross-signing. You can either start the verification from another client or when viewing the profile of a user. There are a few things still missing though:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko does not use the verification status at all at the moment. So while you can verify your master key and let others verify your master key, from Nhekos perspective there is not much benefit yet. You will however show up with a green checkmark in other clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While nheko supports verifying your own master key and after that will also let others verify your master key, it does not yet download the self and user signing keys. This means you won't be able to upload cross-signing signatures for your own devices and other users master keys yet. I'll see if I can implement in the next weeks or so (since literally only the private key download or sharing is missing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko can't bootstrap cross-signing yet. This means you need to bootstrap it from Element or another client once. That will probably take a bit until this is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UX is still WIP. Currently it shows a lot of unnecessary buttons, that are a bit confusing as well as not enough green checkmarks, so that needs some work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things that happened in the mean time or are work in progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decryption errors should be reduced by a bit now. This is still work in progress though. With device trust landed now, we should be able to do automatic key requests, sharing and key backup soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lurkki is currently cleaning up the design of the built in video player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manu_kamath is improving the design when showing images at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LorenDB has been updating our screenshots and working on an Esperanto translation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trilene has been ever busy improving edge cases around the Voip support in Nheko.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So far Hacktoberfest seems to be going well with quite a few people trying to clean up some of the rougher edges in Nheko. If you are using Nheko and think some things could be better, why not try to fix it yourself? October is the perfect time for that!</p>
<p>Featurework of this cycle is also slowly nearing its end. Once cross-signing, voip and the new event store are stable, we plan to improve the UX a bit more as well as some other annoyances and maybe we can do a new release then! A nice and spooky Hacktober everyone!</p>

<p><a href="https://fossil.nil.im/objmatrix">ObjMatrix</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ObjFW/ObjMatrix">GitHub</a>) is a new Matrix client library written in modern Objective-C for <a href="https://objfw.nil.im/">ObjFW</a>. Because it uses ObjFW, it is not limited to Apple platforms, and instead is <a href="https://objfw.nil.im/doc/trunk/PLATFORMS.md">extremely portable</a> and should run on basically everything.</p>
<p>This is currently in its very early stages and is intended to be suitable to develop bots and clients with very soon. Being suitable to develop bridges with it is another goal for later.</p>
<p>Since ObjFW also works on platforms that are usually hard to support or port software to (e.g. <a href="https://www.morphos-team.net/">MorphOS</a>), this will hopefully also bring clients for these less mainstream operating systems. I'm especially hopeful about MorphOS here, since ObjFW already runs quite well there (parts of it are included with the OS even!), and hardware on which MorphOS runs on is usually not powerful enough to run Element Web. And eventually, I will want to have a Matrix client on my Amiga, too üòâ (which this should enable).</p>
<p>This currently does not have a decicated Matrix room yet, so all discussions about it currently happen in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#objfw:nil.im">#objfw:nil.im</a>. So please feel free to join there and follow along development. And contributions are of course <em>very</em> welcome!</p>

        <div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We‚Äôre very excited to announce that Dendrite, the next-generation Matrix homeserver from the core Matrix team, is at last exiting alpha development and entering beta testing!</p>
<p>The path we‚Äôve taken to get here has been quite a curious one, and it‚Äôs worth recapping to give context on why it‚Äôs taken reality a little while to catch up with the dream. :)</p>
<p>The Dendrite project has its roots in 2016 as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendron">Dendron</a>: an attempt to write a next-generation homeserver in Golang rather than Python, in order to benefit from Go‚Äôs stronger typing, ease of profiling (no twisted stack-shredding via deferredInlineCallbacks), multithreading and faster GC performance.  The idea for Dendron was to do a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html">strangler pattern</a> rewrite of Synapse - where we‚Äôd insert Dendron in front of Synapse as a load balancer, and incrementally replace Synapse‚Äôs API endpoints with ones implemented by Dendron.</p>
<p>However, as the project started to progress, it became clear that this was going to end up with many of Synapse‚Äôs architectural choices being baked into the project - particularly the DB schema and data flow architecture, such that the new endpoints could interoperate with the existing Python ones.  We got as far as putting Dendron live on matrix.org and moving some of the login/registration APIs over to it‚Ä¶ but then work fizzled out due to Synapse demanding more urgent attention as traffic grew on Matrix.org, combined with concerns about whether Dendron was the right approach in general.</p>
<p>So, towards the end of 2016 (after the rush to launch <del>Vector</del> <del>Riot</del> Element that summer), we went back to the drawing board to devise Dendrite‚Äî‚ÄúDendron done right!‚Äù‚Äîas opposed to Dendron, which in retrospect was Dendrite done wrong. ;) The new vision was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a massively horizontally scalable architecture, such that large Matrix deployments like matrix.org and big government deployments could run smoothly without the constant scalability headaches we were seeing at the time with Synapse</li>
<li>Do so by splitting the server into well-defined microservice components, each of which could independently horizontally scale, each with its own DB (if desired)</li>
<li>Connect the components together with a set of append-only logs via <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> or similar, easily letting components shard and maintain their databases from the logs, allowing rolling upgrades, possibly schema upgrades, and all sorts of other niceties.  The logs effectively become a primary source of truth rather than putting all the onus on a massive monolithic ever-growing database</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than Dendron‚Äôs top-down approach, instead Dendrite started bottom-up with the very hardest bit: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib">gomatrixserverlib</a>, a standalone Go library implementing the state resolution algorithms and performing federation requests (such that it might also someday be used as a general purpose way to add Matrix federation support to an existing Go codebase).</p>
<p>Then we started building out the various components to implement the various services, starting with the roomserver (the service which models the history and state of one or more rooms in the server), then the syncserver (the service which implements the /sync API to let clients receive messages), etc. We even implemented a simplified in-memory version of Kafka named <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/naffka">naffka</a>‚Äîuseful for glueing together the microservice components when running them all within a single binary.</p>
<p>Things were looking pretty positive by the summer of 2017: we had the server sending/receiving messages, federating with Synapse, and looking tantalisingly close:</p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We just sent the first ever synapse-&gt;dendrite federated traffic, including full dendrite media API (thumbnailing, fed, etc)!!! :D :D :D <a href="https://t.co/sBcM2jMAr6">pic.twitter.com/sBcM2jMAr6</a></p>&mdash; Matrix (@matrixdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/872861579141947392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2017</a>
</blockquote>
<p>However, we then hit three fairly major obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2017/07/07/a-call-to-arms-supporting-matrix">Matrix lost its funding</a></li>
<li>In the ensuing uncertainty, the two lead developers (Mjark &amp; Kegan) went to work elsewhere</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Matrix uptake was starting to explode and Synapse was failing to scale to handle the traffic on matrix.org (and elsewhere)</li>
</ul>
<p>At first, having formed what would become New Vector (now Element) to keep the rest of the core team hired, we pushed to see if we could get Dendrite finished fast enough to replace Synapse, with Erik &amp; richvdh jumping over from Synapse to pick up the remaining work.  However, it became clear that we urgently needed a quicker solution to address all the overloaded Synapses out there, and so they swung back to focus on improving Synapse (taking inspiration from some of the design of Dendrite - e.g. offloading endpoints onto worker processes connected via replication streams, and using <a href="https://opentracing.io/">OpenTracing</a> to debug traffic as it flows over the various services).</p>
<p>At this point, Dendrite maintenance was in effect valiantly taken over by the community, with Brendan and later Anoa keeping the ball going in 2017, joined by APWhitehat in GSoC 2018 and cnly in GSoC 2019.  The fact that Dendrite is now here today is thanks in no small part to their work to keep the project alive in its ‚Äúwilderness years‚Äù between Sept 2017 and Dec 2019.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it became clear that we were overdue getting Matrix itself out of beta - and the last thing we wanted to do was to split and dilute the implementation work of Matrix 1.0 over both Synapse and Dendrite - so we consciously made the decision to focus all our effort on Synapse for solving the remaining bugs and challenges.</p>
<p>Then, in July 2019, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation">Matrix and Synapse exited beta</a>, and we finally started to see light at the end of the tunnel.  In October we started dusting off Dendrite again - looking to use it as a relatively simple and flexible codebase for <a href="https://youtu.be/eA0KnTt4O7E?t=1423">experimenting with Peer-to-Peer Matrix</a>, not least because being Go it can compile to WebAssembly and run clientside, and because even though Dendrite was originally built with massive deployments in mind, it turns out the elastic scaling means it can also scale down pretty small too‚Äîas a part of the <a href="http://testflight.apple.com/join/Tgh2MEk6">iOS P2P demo</a>, we‚Äôve even ran full Dendrite homeservers on iPhones embedded into Element iOS! :)</p>
<p>In Dec 2019, we finally got to the point where Element could fund full-time dedicated development on Dendrite once again, with Neil Alexander joining the project and focusing fulltime on getting Dendrite out of alpha and getting it working for P2P and embedded usage (adding libp2p as a federation transport, and adding SQLite support) - and in Jan 2020 we got Dendrite <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/dip_p2p_matrix/">successfully running clientside in a WASM service worker</a> (just in time for FOSDEM!). Then, in Feb 2020, Kegan returned to the project to work fulltime on Dendrite - and the race began in earnest to get Dendrite ready for beta!</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a pretty picture courtesy of GitHub to visualise the progress:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-10-08-dendrite-contributors.png" alt="020-10-08-dendrite-contributors.png" /></p>
<p>Throughout 2020 there‚Äôs been a huge amount of stabilisation work and polish:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refactoring much of Dendrite‚Äôs foundation to make the codebase more maintainable</li>
<li>Created all-new user server, key server, signing key server microservices</li>
<li>Moving some work from existing microservices (ultimately superseding the former currentstateserver, publicroomsapi and typingserver microservices altogether)</li>
<li>Developing new testing infrastructure:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a> - our brand new Golang Matrix integration test harness</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/are-we-synapse-yet.py">Are We Synapse Yet</a> - an aggregator which parses sytest/complement output to compare how close Dendrite is to passing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All the Matrix 1.0 work - particularly state res v2 &amp; room version support</li>
<li>Making it work with more P2P transports for <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix/">all the exciting P2P experiments</a></li>
<li>Supporting backfill and fetching missing events</li>
<li>Fixing up SQLite support to make it work as a first class citizen (with shared storage code where we can!)</li>
<li>Supporting both sending and rejecting invites (even over federation)</li>
<li>E2E encryption support (one-time keys, device lists, send-to-device support)</li>
<li>Improved federation sender logic (resend retries, backoffs, blacklisting, metrics, resetting backoffs when receiving transactions)</li>
<li>Handling both inbound and outbound redactions</li>
<li>User interactive authentication (and implemented on various ‚Äòsudo‚Äô endpoints e.g. deleting devices and changing passwords)</li>
<li>Respecting server ACLs</li>
<li>Rejecting / soft-failing events properly</li>
<li>Support for database schema upgrades</li>
</ul>
<p>... which brings us at last to the present day (Oct 2020), as we declare Dendrite sufficiently stable that we consider it ready for beta testing!</p>
<p>In practice, this means **Dendrite is now ready for experimentation by adventurous Matrix sysadmins. It is <em>NOT</em> ready for production usage yet, but we need folks to test it and help us iron out the remaining bugs!  **Please do not trust it with sensitive data yet, and we don‚Äôt recommend trying to run it at scale yet as we haven‚Äôt done any serious optimisation work yet.</p>
<p>That said, we do provide the following guarantees:</p>
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre providing versioned releases from here on in, beginning with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.1.0">0.1.0</a></li>
<li>We don‚Äôt expect any major breaking changes to the config or architecture before 1.0</li>
<li>Ready for early adopters to try running Dendrite without experiencing ~daily breaking churn</li>
<li>The database schema is now stable and will upgrade itself going forwards - your database should now be here to stay! (assuming we don‚Äôt hit any nasty data loss bugs during beta)</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of comparison with Synapse, the main things you should get excited about are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite aims to provide an <strong>efficient</strong>, <strong>reliable</strong> and <strong>scalable</strong> alternative to Synapse:
<ul>
<li>Efficient: A small memory footprint with better baseline performance than an out-of-the-box Synapse</li>
<li>Reliable: Implements the Matrix specification as written, using the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">same test suite</a> as Synapse as well as a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">brand new Go test suite</a></li>
<li>Scalable: can run on multiple machines and eventually scale to massive homeserver deployments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This means significantly less memory usage than Synapse (depends on joined rooms, often between 50MB - 400MB resident memory) - although we haven‚Äôt tuned this at all yet!</li>
<li>All-new database model, where every microservice instance has its own database tables, letting them scale arbitrarily wide</li>
<li>The ability to efficiently use all your available CPU cores without needing to split into separate processes, thanks to Go and our extensive use of goroutines.  No more Python global interpreter lock! :)</li>
<li>Future experimental MSCs are likely to land in Dendrite before Synapse (e.g <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2753/proposals/2753-peeking-via-sync-v2.md">MSC2753 Peeking via /sync</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2444/proposals/2444-peeking-over-federation-peek-api.md">MSC2444 Peeking over Federation</a> are already being prototyped (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/1370">#1370</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/1391">#1391</a>) in Dendrite rather than Synapse!)</li>
</ul>
<p>The provisos you should know about however are:</p>
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre not feature complete yet: sytest reports 56% CS API coverage and 77% Federation coverage. <strong>NB: these are always going to be underestimates of how much Dendrite actually performs due to how the tests are spread out, in actuality it‚Äôs likely more 70% CS, 95% Fed.</strong></li>
<li>No read receipts, membership lazy-loading, presence, push notifications, search, event context, key backups, cross-signing. See changelog for full limitations.</li>
<li>Not battle-tested in the wild by many people (there are probably only ~10 dendrites on the open network today!) - so there‚Äôs likely to be a broad spectrum of bugs at first.</li>
<li>Clients that require more exotic features, like lazy loading, may not behave properly yet</li>
<li>Please <strong>use Postgres rather than SQLite wherever possible</strong>‚Äîit‚Äôs faster and has fewer issues regarding concurrency (some requests on SQLite Dendrites may 500 with ‚Äòdatabase is locked‚Äô - though we‚Äôve worked hard to eliminate most of these)</li>
<li>Dendrite can run in either ‚Äúmonolith‚Äù or ‚Äúpolylith‚Äù mode. In monolith, all the microservices are linked into a single binary - and <strong>we recommend running in this configuration wherever possible</strong> for now. Monolith mode is <em>extremely</em> capable as it is and has fewer moving parts for things to go wrong and will be the right choice for the majority of beta deployments!</li>
<li>Whilst Dendrite is nearly 100% federation compatible, there may still be situations where it will split-brain and disagree with the current room state that Synapse has calculated. We expect these issues to resolve as we get more user feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>Architecture-wise, this is what Dendrite looks like under the hood today:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-10-08-dendrite-arch.svg" alt="2020-10-08-dendrite-arch.svg" /></p>
<p>To get up and running, please install Go and head on over to the Get Started guide at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite#get-started">https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite#get-started</a> to join the fun :)</p>
<p>In terms of where we‚Äôre going next:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read receipts. It‚Äôs a major missing feature and impacts UX significantly.</li>
<li>100% Federation coverage (according to sytest). It‚Äôs crucial that Dendrite instances play nicely with other servers. This will be the best metric we have for asserting that we are just as capable as Synapse at the fed level.</li>
<li>Optimisation‚Äî<strong>Dendrite has not been optimised yet for speed or resource utilisation!</strong>
<ul>
<li>We plan to add benchmarks which will stress test different microservices in the presence of many different scaling factors (number of users, number of rooms, size of room, number of devices per user, number of sync requests, etc). This will hopefully allow us to identify early on bottlenecks and slow algorithms</li>
<li>Good old fashioned pprof with known slow scenarios to see what‚Äôs consuming CPU/memory and fixing issues ad-hoc (which we‚Äôve already done a bit of pre-beta). This may involve adding additional in-memory caches, with a healthy respect for the complexities it may introduce (which Synapse has been bitten by)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We plan to add first class feature flag support for experimental MSCs‚Äîexperimentation is one thing which makes Dendrite notably different from Synapse, and supporting it more thoroughly going forwards will be important. This may mean adding additional hooks; potentially a dedicated microservice to cleanly separate experiments, we don‚Äôt know yet</li>
<li>P2P work will continue with vigour now we have a working, featureful, and relatively stable HS to embed and play with</li>
</ul>
<p>Longer term, it‚Äôs pretty hard to say right now when we expect to exit beta (it took Synapse 5 years to exit beta, after all ;) - but obviously we‚Äôll need Dendrite to have parity with Synapse and have no known serious bugs.</p>
<p>Finally: you‚Äôre probably wondering what this means for Synapse.  Synapse is here to stay - with tens of thousands of deployments around the world serving tens of millions of users.  The majority of the core team is still focused on improving and optimising Synapse, and we‚Äôll be keeping improving it for the foreseeable.</p>
<p>However, we‚Äôll certainly be experimenting with new stuff on Dendrite first - whether that‚Äôs P2P, portable accounts, new-style communities, peeking etc.  We expect Synapse to be the stable long-term-supported solution, while Dendrite (particularly while in beta) will be the more unstable and experimental platform. In the longer term we‚Äôll provide ways of migrating from Synapse to Dendrite however (probably via portable accounts), and perhaps in future new deployments may choose to use Dendrite - a bit like you might choose to use nginx rather than Apache for a new web server these days. But this will be a long transition‚Äîmeanwhile we expect to see more and more next-generation homeservers like <a href="http://conduit.rs/">Conduit</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/mascarene/mascarene">Mascarene</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">Construct</a> coming of age too.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. If you‚Äôre an intrepid sysadmin please spin up a Dendrite and start filing bugs! :)</p>
<p>‚Äî Matthew, Neil Alexander, Kegan and the whole Matrix team.</p>
