<blockquote>
<p>On behalf of the Americans on the Synapse team: Happy Thanksgiving! This past week saw us land some improvements to the OpenID Connect SSO provider, bringing it closer to parity with the SAML provider. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8801">#8801</a> made it possible to gracefully handle username collisions when creating a new account over SSO.</p>
<p>We've also merged a pull request (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8785/">#8785</a>) from @dklimpel which removes deprecated paths for the Synapse Admin APIs. As of the next Synapse release, all Admin APIs will be accessibly only under the <code>/_synapse/admin/v1</code> path prefix.</p>
<p>Otherwise, much of our time has been spent on getting pull requests like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6739">#6739</a>, implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</a>, ready to merge. It's coming to a Synapse release soon!</p>
<p>Speaking of releases, we're looking forward to cutting a first release candidate of 1.24.0 early next week; keep your eyes peeled for that!</p>
<p>I'd be remiss in not mentioning that we started the week by <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/23/synapse-disclosing-cve-2020-26890">disclosing CVE-2020-26890</a>, which is a denial of service affecting Synapse versions prior to 1.20.0. If you've not upgraded, <em>please</em> do.</p>

The new bridge version is used in combination with the app in production (medical care centre) for a week now. We have a throughput of 50-100 SMS message a day.

<blockquote>
<p>The new completer is now on master. Please try it out and report any issues you may find. It now actually inserts a user link, keeps a per room message history and should look quite a bit nicer and be faster,  when completing emojis or user names.</p>
<p>There were also quite a few cleanups, most of them done by Kirillpt! Some spacing here and there, saturation changes, the login page should now be less confusing, when you don't enter a valid mxid and toggles should now not get stuck in confusing intermediate states. There is also a russian translation now and some VOIP fixes. Pretty busy week, but I like it!</p>

<p>We started out this week by releasing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.0">Dendrite 0.3.0</a> and then ended the week with a bug-fix <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.1">Dendrite 0.3.1</a> release.</p>
<p>I'd like to say thank you especially to our community contributors who have been adding new features and filling gaps!</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Memory optimisation by reference passing, significantly reducing the number of allocations and duplications in memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A concurrency bug has been fixed in the federation API that could cause Dendrite to crash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hook API has been added for experimental MSCs, with an early implementation of MSC2836</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forgetting rooms is now supported (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last seen timestamp and IP address are now updated automatically when calling <code>/sync</code></p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>An optional configuration option <code>sync_api.real_ip_header</code> has been added for specifying which HTTP header contains the real client IP address (for if Dendrite is running behind a reverse HTTP proxy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partial implementation of <code>/_matrix/client/r0/admin/whois</code> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/DavidSpenler">DavidSpenler</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The error when registering a username with invalid characters has been corrected (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/bodqhrohro">bodqhrohro</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>-version</code> command line flag has been added (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backfilling should now work properly on rooms with world-readable history visibility (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MayeulC">MayeulC</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some more client event fields have been marked as omit-when-empty (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>build.sh</code> script has been updated to work properly on all POSIX platforms (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/felix">felix</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged, although some Synapse-specific tests have been removed and some new tests have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>

<p>We released Synapse 1.23.0 on Wednesday! Read all about it on the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/18/synapse-1-23-0-released">Matrix Blog</a>. Otherwise, we'd like to highlight a few developments over the past week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We're discussing a policy for ending support for old versions of Python and PostgreSQL. If you have opinions, please <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8782">let us know on GitHub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our initial implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</a> is undergoing review, and will likely land soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've been looking at ways to improve the efficiency of state resolution, and Erik has managed to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622#issuecomment-729620021">devise some algorithmic improvements</a> that yield an order of magnitude speedup for a handful of pathologic cases. We hope to have a better idea of how this might work for real world workloads soon.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, we'd like to take this opportunity to remind you to <strong>please regularly upgrade your Synapse.</strong> Especially if you're not yet on 1.20.0, as we'll be disclosing a denial of service issue which affects older versions on Monday.</p>

<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> On Monday, we will be announcing a denial of service vulnerability which affects Synapse versions prior to 1.20.0. If you have not upgraded recently, please do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0">Synapse 1.23.0</a> now available!</p>
<p>For Synapse admins, this release support generating structured logs via the standard logging configuration (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8607">#8607</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8685">#8685</a>). This may require changing your synapse configuration; see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.23.0rc1/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1230">upgrade notes</a> for more information.</p>
<p>We've also added many new Admin APIs, contributed by <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">@dklimpel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add API to get information about uploaded media (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8647">#8647</a>)</li>
<li>Add API for local user media statistics (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8700">#8700</a>)</li>
<li>Make it possible to delete files that were not used for a defined time (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8519">#8519</a>)</li>
<li>Split API for reported events into detail and list endpoints. This is a breaking change to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8217">#8217</a> which was introduced in Synapse v1.21.0. Those who already use this API should check their scripts (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8539">#8539</a>) </li>
<li>Allow server admins to list users' notification pushers (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8610">#8610</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8689">#8689</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, Synapse 1.23.0 addresses some significant bugs, including regressions in the SQLite-to-PostgreSQL database porting script (<a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8729">#8729</a>, <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8730">#8730</a>, <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8755">#8755</a>) and an issue which could prevent Synapse from recovering after losing its connection to its database (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8726">#8726</a>). Synapse will also reject ACL modifications from clients which would otherwise cause a server to ban itself from a room (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8708">#8708</a>).</p>
<p>Installation instructions are available <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md">on GitHub</a>, as is the <code>v1.23.0</code> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0">release tag</a>.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/chagai95">@chagai95</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">@dklimpel</a>.</p>
<p>The full changelog for 1.23.0 is as follows:</p>
<h1 id="synapse-1-23-0-2020-11-18">Synapse 1.23.0 (2020-11-18)</h1>
<p>This release changes the way structured logging is configured. See the <a href="UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1230">upgrade notes</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We are aware of a trivially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in versions of Synapse prior to 1.20.0. Complete details will be disclosed on Monday, November 23rd. If you have not upgraded recently, please do so.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@florian:dsn.tm.kit.edu">Florian</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fresh off the arXiv presses comes our</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06488">‚ÄúAnalysis of the Matrix Event Graph Replicated Data Type‚Äù</a> preprint!
This time, it is a deep dive into the data structure properties of the event graph:</p>
<p>What type of consistency guarantees does it provide,
how many of the other homeservers you share a room with can be faulty or malicious without violating those guarantees (short answer: all of them!),</p>
<p>and how is it possible that a frayed-out event graph ever laces back to just a few current events,
while there is a probability larger than zero for growth to arbitrarily high limits?</p>
<p>To shed light on those questions, we had a great cooperation between my <a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/">Decentralized Systems and Network Services
Research Group</a> and <a href="https://www.math.kit.edu/stoch/~henze/">Prof. Dr. Norbert Henze from the Institute of Stochastics</a>.</p>
<p>While we are still in search of the right venue for peer-reviewed publication,
we went for a preprint this time to share our results with the scientific and the Matrix community in a timely manner.</p>

<p>In this figure, k is the number of participating servers, U_n is the current width of the event graph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, with a current width of U_n = 1000 events and k = 200 servers,
we can expect that the width goes below E(U_{n+1}) &lt; 600 events in just one step.*</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h4>
<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2744">MSC2744</a> has entered FCP. As such we're switching it out for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2844">MSC2844</a>, which aims to define a global versioning system for all spec documents. Note that MSC2844 does not currently have FCP proposed. Its purpose for being in the focus this time around is for asking the team whether ideas proposed are plausible.</p>
<p>Thus this week's focus is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1544">MSC1544</a> (QR Code verification), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2790">MSC2790</a> (modal widgets) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2844">MSC2844</a> (global versioning).</p>
<p>We've also started making use of a Github board to track the state of an MSC through the currently somewhat ambiguous process of putting up an MSC that is ready for review to starting FCP. You can find the board here: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/31">SCT Backlog</a>.</p>
<p>Some explanation of the columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Awaiting SCT Input - These are MSCs that are deemed reviewable by the MSC author, and require review by a subsection of the Spec Core Team (usually one or two people) that are most familiar with the scope of Matrix that the MSC is relevant to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ready for FCP ticks - At least one individual from the Spec Core Team has signed off on the MSC. It is not time for others to give a cursory review - mainly sanity checking from the perspective of the part of Matrix that they work on. Note that fundamental flaws may still be found in this stage, requiring the MSC to be reworked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In FCP - The MSC is in Final Comment Period, where everyone has a last chance to get their ideas in. This happens after most of the Spec Core Team have given their ticks from the previous column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Done - These MSCs no longer need immediate attention by some portion of the Spec Core Team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These definitions are all flexible as we continue to see what works for the limited resources we have available for review.</p>
<p>Do not be alarmed if a particular MSC is not on this board, we're placing things on here as deemed necessary, and more will certainly be added in time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We are aware of a trivially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in versions of Synapse prior to 1.20.0. Complete details will be disclosed on Monday, November 23rd. If you have not upgraded recently, please do so.</p>
<p>Happy RC day! The first release candidate of Synapse 1.23 is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0rc1">now available</a>. For Synapse admins, we've added numerous new APIs thanks to contributions by <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">@dklimpel</a>, and we now support generating <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.23.0rc1/docs/structured_logging.md">structured logs</a> in a standard manner. The <code>structured</code> and <code>drains</code> logging options are now deprecated in Synapse's configuration.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0rc1">Synapse 1.23.0rc1</a> also includes several significant bugfixes, especially around regressions in the SQLite-to-PostgreSQL database porting script, as well a fix to an issue that would prevent Synapse from recovering after losing its connection to the database. Synapse will also now reject modifications to access control lists which would otherwise result in a server blocking itself from a room. This is a particularly interesting case of unintended consequences in protocol design, and we hope to write more about it soon.</p>
<p>Next week should see the full release of 1.23, followed by a first implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403"><em>MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</em></a> landing in the development branch for 1.24.

<p>Hello TWIM! From this week on we're changing how we're reporting updates on the Element clients. Each week, we'll include a section for cross-platform feature work the Element team is working on, and some sections for platform specific work too.</p>
<p><strong>Spaces (previously known as Communities)</strong></p>
<p>Communities are back! They've been renamed to Spaces, and on the Element team we've been busy exploring user experience and critical thinking for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a>, to allow users to organise rooms into useful groups.</p>
<p><strong>Social Login</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to reduce friction in authentication, we've been R&amp;Ding how to allow homeservers &amp; Matrix clients to support multiple SSO providers.. Most of the work so far is captured in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2858">MSC2858</a> and we're starting initial implementations in Element web next week.</p>
<p><strong>VoIP: Voice &amp; Video Calls</strong></p>
<p>We've started foundational research, design and engineering to improve both the usability and stability of native matrix VoIP in Element. We've also started to look at how we can improve the continuity of the user experience between native Matrix calls and our current implementation of Jitsi.</p>
<p><strong>Usability</strong></p>
<p>We've been focusing on improving post-registration actions all round to make Element provide better prompts for first actions, and empty states for views on all platforms, with a multitude of fixes having landed on Element Web, iOS &amp; Android in the last week. We've also started paid user testing to better understand specific pain points in the first time user experience, which we're looking to improve significantly in the coming weeks. </p>
<p><strong>Web platform</strong></p>
<p>v1.7.13 is now live! Which includes a bunch of fixes &amp; improvements on VoIP.</p>
<p><strong>Android platform</strong></p>

<p>I don't want to &quot;sell&quot; it before there's some kind of poc, but with a few friends we're trying to build a bridge for ActivityPub. we're using the library of the same name by the people behind CommonsPub, of which a lot of code comes from Pleroma, so the application service appears as an ActivityPub server. it's still the beginning, and I'm just starting to think about which information a bridge needs to keep (I guess sometime I'll ask Half-Shot a big list of questions üòÅ)</p>

<p>A new release integrates an embedded h2 database into <a href="https://github.com/benkuly/matrix-spring-boot-sdk">matrix-spring-boot-bot</a>, which makes it a lot easier to write bots with persistency. You only need a few lines of code to write simple bots (<a href="https://github.com/benkuly/matrix-spring-boot-sdk/blob/master/matrix-spring-boot-bot-examples/ping-bot/src/main/kotlin/net/folivo/matrix/bot/examples/pingappservice/PingHandler.kt">e. g. a ping bot</a>). I also changed a lot under the hood (e. g. using type-safe Matrix-Id-classes instead of Strings).</p>
<h4 id="matrix-sms-bridge">matrix-sms-bridge</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/benkuly/matrix-sms-bridge">matrix-sms-bridge</a> now uses the h2 database from <a href="https://github.com/benkuly/matrix-spring-boot-sdk">matrix-spring-boot-bot</a> instead of neo4j, which makes it a lot more stable and fixes some bugs. We are using it in production with hundreds of target telephone numbers without problems. I also added an optional feature to use room aliases (e. g. #sms_4901234567:homeserver) to prevent multiple rooms with one target telephone number (which is still possible).</p>
<p>In a few weeks you can use this bridge with an old Android-Smartphone, which acts as an sms gateway with rest api.</p>

<p>Hello Matrix friends. I've been asked to share this here. I'm currently building a platform for building communities. I'm focused on deeper matrix integration with communities, private messaging built on top of matrix, and custom domain support. Feel free to check out <a href="https://gurlic.com">https://gurlic.com</a>. The matrix community is at <a href="https://gurlic.com/matrix">https://gurlic.com/matrix</a>, but I haven't had the time to post much. </p>
<p>We have communities (https://gurlic.com/space -&gt; <a href="https://gurlic.space">https://gurlic.space</a>)</p>
<p>We have galleries (https://gurlic.com/art -&gt; <a href="https://gurlic.art">https://gurlic.art</a>)
We have publications (https://gurlic.com/classics -&gt; <a href="https://classics.wtf">https://classics.wtf</a>)</p>
<p>We have user pages (https://gurlic.com/bob -&gt; https://bob.monster)</p>
<p>The UI is a little confusing now because we have longform articles (https://gurlic.com/homer/the-iliad-book-ii) and short social media posts (https://gurlic.com/privacy/post/324848317844422661).</p>
<p>I pretty much want all resources to have custom domain support, and matrix rooms for all communities, and nested communities. In the near future, I hope to have matrix servers for custom domains too. And of course, the source will also be open if folks want to host.</p>
<p>Right now, users on gurlic get a matrix account, and communities/galleries/publications get a room too, but i'm hoping to take some time to look at much deeper integration. Dendrite and hydrogen are great to build on top off...</p>

<p>Happy November from the Synapse team! As mentioned last week, we pushed a small <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.1">v1.22.1 release</a> last Friday which fixed two regressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug where an appservice may not be forwarded events for a room it was recently invited to. Broke in v1.22.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8676">#8676</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <code>Object of type frozendict is not JSON serializable</code> exceptions when using third-party event rules. Broke in v1.22.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8678">#8678</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't upgraded your Synapse in a while, <em>please do.</em></p>
<p>A major focus of Synapse is being able to meet the performance and reliability needs of massive homeservers like <code>matrix.org</code>. If you're curious about how Synapse's architecture has evolved over the years to meet these scaling challenges, check our our blog post from Tuesday: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/03/how-we-fixed-synapses-scalability">How we fixed Synapse's scalability!</a></p>
<p>Lastly, we anticipate releasing 1.23.0 in the next fortnight; keep your eyes peeled for release candidates and let us know if you have any feedback. For a preview of what's coming, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/compare/v1.22.1...develop">check out GitHub</a> for the new commits that have landed on the <code>develop</code> branch since our last release.</p>

<p>Hi all! I <em>think</em> this is the right place to share this ü§û. I've been working on a Matrix SDK for Elixir over the last few months as a side project, it's very early days and it's currently just a bare-bones wrapper for the Client-Server API. I've also written the Elixir/Erlang bindings for Olm (currently missing group sessions) which should be added to the SDK soon. The repo can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/niklaslong/matrix-elixir-sdk">https://github.com/niklaslong/matrix-elixir-sdk</a> and the Elixir bindings for Olm are linked in the readme.</p>

<p>Asked if there were big plans for use of the project</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not as yet, though a few people have reached out to me already and are building on top of it. I started it as a way to get going with Matrix dev and as a fun side project. That being said, I think providing the tools to Matrix-enable Elixir apps might lead to some interesting things.
If anyone has any precise ideas on how they would want to integrate their Elixir apps with Matrix, I'd be super happy to have a chat üëçÔ∏è

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We had a major break-through in Synapse 1.22 which we want to talk about in
more detail: <strong>Synapse now scales horizontally across multiple python
processes.</strong></p>
<p>Horizontal scaling means that you can support more users and traffic by adding
in more python processes (spread over more machines, if necessary) without
there being a single bottleneck which all the traffic is passing through - as
opposed to vertical scaling where you make things go faster overall by making
the bottleneck go faster.</p>
<p>After many years of having to vertically scale Synapse (by trying to make the
main process go faster) we‚Äôre now finally at the point where you can configure
Synapse so that <strong>messages no longer flow through the main process</strong> -
eliminating the bottleneck entirely.  What‚Äôs more, the Matrix.org homeserver
has now been successfully running in this config and enjoying the massive
scalability improvements for the last 2 weeks! Huge kudos goes to Erik and the
wider Synapse team for pulling this off.</p>
<p>Some readers might wonder how this ties in with <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">Dendrite entering
beta</a>, given one
of Dendrite‚Äôs design goals is full horizontal scalability.  The answer is that
we‚Äôre very much using Dendrite for experimentation and next-gen stuff at the
moment (currently focused more on scaling downwards for P2P rather than
scaling upwards for megaservers) - while Synapse is the stable and long-term
supported option.</p>
<p>So, that‚Äôs the context - now over to Erik with more than you could possibly
ever want to know about how we actually did it...</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Synapse started life off back in 2014 as a single monolithic python process,
and for quite a while we made it scale by adding more and more in-memory
caches to speed things up by avoiding hitting the database (at the expense of
RAM).  It looked like this:</p>
<div style="margin: auto; max-width: 640px;">
    <img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse1.png"/>
</div>
<p>Eventually the caches stopped helping and we needed more than one thread of
execution in order to spread CPU across multiple cores. Python‚Äôs Global
Interpreter Lock (<a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">GIL</a>)
means that Python can mainly only use one CPU core at a time, so starting more
threads doesn‚Äôt help with scalability - you have to run multiple processes.</p>
<p>Now, the vast majority of the work that Synapse does is related to ‚Äústreams‚Äù.
These are append only sequences of rows, such as the events stream, typing
stream, receipts stream, etc. When a new event arrives (for example) we write
it to the events stream, and then notify anything waiting that there has been
an update. The <code>/sync</code> endpoint, for instance, will wait for updates to streams
and send them down to long-polling Matrix clients. </p>
<p>Streams support being added to concurrently, so have a concept of the
‚Äúpersisted up-to position‚Äù. This is the point where <strong>all</strong> rows before that
point have finished persisting. Readers only read up to the current ‚Äúpersisted
up-to position‚Äù, so that they don‚Äôt skip updates that haven‚Äôt finished
persisting at that point. (E.g. if two events A and B get assigned positions 5
and 6, but B finishes persisting first, then the persisted up to position will
remain at 4 until A finishes persisting and then it jumps to 6).</p>
<p>To split any meaningful amount of work into separate processes, we need to add
a mechanism where processes can be told that updates to streams have happened
(otherwise they‚Äôd have to repeatedly poll the DB, which would be deeply
inefficient). The architecture ended up being one where we had the ‚Äúmain‚Äù
process that streams updates via a custom replication protocol (initially
long-polling HTTP; later custom TCP) to any number of ‚Äúworker‚Äù processes. This
meant that we could move sync stream handling (and other read apis) off the
main process and onto workers, but also that all database writes had to go
through the single main process (as it was a star topology, the main process
could talk to all workers but workers could only talk to the main process and
not each other).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse2.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse2.png" /></p>
<p>As an aside: cache invalidations also had to be streamed down the replication
connections, which has the side effect that we could only cache things that
would only be invalidated on the main process.</p>
<p>We continued to move more and more read APIs out onto separate workers. We
also added workers in front of the main process that would e.g. handle the
creation of the new events, authenticating, etc, and then call out to the main
process with the event for it to persist the event.</p>
<h2 id="moving-writes-off-the-main-process">Moving writes off the main process</h2>
<p>Eventually we ran out of stuff to move out of the main process that didn‚Äôt
involve writing to the DB. To write stuff from other processes we needed a way
for the workers to stream updates to each other. The easiest and most obvious
way was to just use Redis and its pub/sub support. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse3.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse3.png" /></p>
<p>This almost allowed us to move writing of a particular stream to a different
worker, <em>except</em> writing to streams generally also meant invalidating caches
which in itself requires writing to a stream. We needed a way of writing to
the cache invalidation stream from multiple workers at once.</p>
<p>Sharding the cache invalidation thankfully turned out to be easy, as workers
would simply call the cache invalidation function whenever they get an
invalidation notice over replication. In particular, the ordering of
invalidations from different workers doesn‚Äôt matter and so there isn‚Äôt a need
to calculate a single ‚Äúpersisted up-to position‚Äù. Sharding then just becomes a
case of adding the name of the worker that is writing the update to the
replication stream, and then workers reading from it can basically treat the
cache stream the same as if they were multiple streams, one per worker.</p>
<p>This then unlocks the ability to move writing of streams off the main process
and onto different workers - and so we added the ‚Äúevent persister‚Äù worker for
offloading the main event stream off the main process:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse4.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse4.png" /></p>
<h2 id="sharding-the-events-stream">Sharding the events stream</h2>
<p>Eventually the worker responsible for doing nothing but persisting events
started maxing out CPU. This meant that we had to look at sharding the events
stream, i.e. writing to it from multiple workers.</p>
<p>This is more complicated than sharding the cache invalidation stream as the
ordering of the events does matter; we send them down sync streams, in order,
with a token that indicates where the sync stream is up to in the events
stream. This means that workers need to be able to calculate a ‚Äúpersisted
up-to position‚Äù when getting updates from different workers. </p>
<p>The easiest way of doing that is to simply set the persisted up-to position as
the minimum position received over federation from all active writers. This
works, except events would only be processed after all other writers have
subsequently written events (to advance the persisted position past the point
at which the event was written), which can add a lot of latency depending on
how often events are written. </p>
<p>A refinement is to note that if you have a persisted up-to position of 10,
then receive updates at sequential positions 11, 12, 13 and 14, you know that
everything between 10 and 14 has finished persisting (as you received updates
about them), and so can set the persisted up-to position to 14. Annoyingly,
it‚Äôs not required that positions are sequential without gaps (due to various
technical considerations), and so in the worst case this still has the same
problems as the na√Øve solution.</p>
<p>To avoid these problems we change the persisted up-to position to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock">vector
clock</a> of positions; tracking a
vector of positions - one per writer. This still allows answering the query of
‚Äúget all events after token X‚Äù (as events are written with the position and
the name of the writer). The persisted up-to position is then calculated by
just tracking the last position seen to arrive over replication from each
writer. </p>
<p>This allows writing events from multiple workers, while ensuring that other
workers can correctly keep track of a ‚Äúpersisted up-to position‚Äù. Then it's
just a matter of inspecting the code to ensure that it does not assume that it
is the only writer to the stream. In the case of writing to the events stream,
we note that the function persisting events assumes it's the only writer for a
given room, so when sharding we have to ensure that there are no concurrent
writes to the same room. This is most easily done by sharding based on room
ID, and ensuring that the mapping of room ID to worker does not change
(without coordination).</p>
<p>The only thing left is to then encode the vector clock position into the sync
tokens. We want to ensure that these tokens are not too long, as they get
included as query string parameters (e.g. the <code>since=</code> parameter of <code>/sync</code>).
By assigning persistent unique integer IDs to workers the vector clock can be
persisted as a sequence of pairs of integers, which is relatively few bytes so
long as we don‚Äôt have too many workers writing to the events stream. We can
further reduce the size of the tokens by calculating an integer ‚Äúpersisted
up-to position‚Äù as we did before, encoding that and only including positions
for workers that are larger than the integer persisted upto position. (The
idea here is that most of the time only a small number of workers will be
ahead of the calculated persisted up-to position, and so we only need to
encode those).</p>
<p>And this is what we have today:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse5.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse5.png" /></p>
<p>The major limitation of the current situation is that you can‚Äôt dynamically
add/remove workers which persist events, as the sharding by room ID is
calculated at startup, and so changing it requires restarting the whole
system. This could be replaced by any system that allowed coordination over
which persister is allowed to write to a room at any given point. However this
is likely tricky to get right in practice, but would allow dynamic auto
scaling of deployments, or automatically recovering from a worker that gets
wedged/dies.</p>
<p>Finally, it‚Äôs worth noting that sharding event persisters isn‚Äôt the only
performance work that‚Äôs been going on - switching everything over to python 3
and async twisted has helped, along with lots of smaller optimisations on the
hot paths, and further rebalancing workers (e.g. moving background jobs off
the master process to dedicated workers).  We‚Äôve also benefited a lot from the
maintainability of rolling out mypy typing throughout the codebase.  And next
up, we‚Äôll be going back to speeding up the codebase as a whole - starting with
algorithmic state resolution improvements! üéâ</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>So, how does it stack up?</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the send time heatmap on Matrix.org showing the step change on Oct 16th
when we rolled out the second event persister (full disclosure: this also
coincides with moving background processes off the main Synapse process to a
background worker).  As you can see, we go from messages being spread over a
huge range of durations (up to several seconds) to the sweet spot being 50ms
or less - a spectacular improvement!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse-heatmap.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse-heatmap.png" /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, here‚Äôs the actual CPU utilisation as we split the traffic from a
single event persister (yellow) to two persisters (one yellow, one blue),
showing the sharding beautifully horizontally balancing CPU between the two
active/active worker processes:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse-cpu.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse-cpu.png" /></p>
<p>We‚Äôve yet to loadtest to see just how fast we can go now (before we start
hitting bottlenecks on the postgres cluster), but it sure feels good to have
all our CPU headroom back on Matrix.org again, ready for the next wave of
users to arrive.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>So there you have it: folks running massive homeservers (50K+ concurrent
users) like Matrix.org (and <em>cough</em> various high profile public sector
deployments) are no longer held hostage by the bottleneck of the main synapse
process and should feel free to experiment with setting up event persister
workers to handle high traffic loads.  Otherwise, if you can spread your users
over smaller servers, that‚Äôs also a good bet (assuming they don‚Äôt have
massively overlapping room membership, like we see on Matrix.org.)</p>
<p>The current <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/workers.md">worker
documentation</a>
is up-to-date, although does assume you are already very familiar with how to
administer Synapse.  It‚Äôs also very much subject to change, as we keep adding
new workers and improving the architecture.  However, now is a pretty good
time to get involved if you‚Äôre interested in large-scale Matrix deployments.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.0">Synapse 1.22.0</a> is out! We announced its first release candidate <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/23/this-week-in-matrix-2020-10-23#synapse">last week</a>, and after a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.0rc2">small rc2</a> the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.0">final release</a> was published last Tuesday. We anticipate a small 1.22.1 release later today with fixes for messages not always being sent to app services (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8673">#8673</a>) and serialization errors with third-party event rules (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8678">#8678</a>).</p>
<p>We continue to see improved client join <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">Apdex</a> scores for matrix.org, indicating that our work in 1.22.0 to split background tasks into separate workers and allow for sharded event persisters successfully improved the user-visible performance of large homeservers.</p>
<p>In other news, we pushed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8675">a temporary hotfix</a> to the matrix.org homeserver earlier this week, instructing it to drop all cross-user <code>m.key_share_request</code> messages. This was necessary to mitigate <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/famedlysdk/-/issues/126">a bug</a> in a third-party library which caused some clients to flood the server with requests. We'll re-enable these messages once we resolve <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8677">issue #8677</a>. In the meantime, we strongly encourage <a href="https://fluffychat.im/">FluffyChat</a> users to upgrade to version 0.21.1.</p>
<p>We're hard at work on the next release of Synapse, and the development branch <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/compare/v1.22.0...develop">already includes</a> many bugfixes, several new admin APIs, and support for structured logging‚Äîstay tuned!</p>

<p>This was an exciting week again. Trilene did the usual and just opened a PR, that implements the video part of call support. In my testing so far this seems to work amazingly well (ignore, that my webcam is crappy in the video, I only have so many devices...)! It's hard to overstate my satisfaction, if I am allowed to quote songs without getting a DMCA! If you want to try it out, you will need the qmlgl plugin at runtime (I had to patch some ebuilds on Gentoo to do so) and build Nheko from source. Support in our AppImage and Flatpak and for our Windows and MacOS builds will come at a later date. A big shoutout to trilene, who just works on VOIP in Nheko, without saying a word, and then drops a ready PR.</p>
<p>Another exciting new feature by lorendb, you can now specify <code>--profile &lt;profilename&gt;</code>, when you start Nheko, to create a separate profile. This allows you to open multiple instances and use multiple accounts at the same time (but it still uses separate instances of Nheko). This is pretty useful, if you have multiple accounts on different homeservers or are testing stuff for example. He also added a shortcut to delete the current content of the message area (Ctrl-U).</p>
<p>We also fixed a long standing bug, that crashed Nheko when pasting an image on mac OS, prevented copying text in some cases and build times should be about halfed again.</p>
<p>That's all I got today. I guess we should do a new release at some point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked about trilene, who is a reliable Nheko contributor, Nico replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>trilene seems to be a bit camera shy and prefer to work on code than take credit and talk about upcoming features. I'm surprised everytime, when a new PR is opened or trilene asks a weird question, that can only end up in an amazing contribution :3</p>

<p>To enable it you'll need Synapse 1.22.0 (released this week) and v0.5.8 of the bot-sdk. Then, add <code>&quot;de.sorunome.msc2409.ephemeral&quot;: true</code> to your appservice registration file (at the root level) and turn on the <code>de.sorunome.msc2409.ephemeral</code> flag in your <code>IAppserviceRegistration</code> supplied to the bot-sdk.

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting November 28th and 29th of this year, many bots on t2bot.io will be supporting end-to-end encryption. Though not all bots will be supporting it, this is an important milestone towards getting end-to-bridge encryption enabled on t2bot.io as a proof of being able to scale to the higher demand of encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>The eventual goal is to support encryption on all of t2bot.io‚Äôs bots and bridges, however we need to take small steps to get there üôÇ. Note that in order to function, bots will decrypt <em>all</em> messages they see, but only respond to the ones they care about - this can still be uncomfortable for some rooms though, so feel free to kick them out.</p>
<p>For more detail on which bots are getting support and what all this entails/means, please see the <a href="https://t2bot.io/blog/2020/10/30/enabling-encryption-for-bots/">dedicated blog post</a>.</p>
