            <p>Well here it is: Synapse 1.0.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.0 is the reference implementation of the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec">Matrix 1.0 spec</a>. The goal of the release overall has been to focus on security and stability, such that we can officially declare Synapse (and Matrix) out of beta and recommended for production use. This means changing the default room protocol version used for new rooms to be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/37871106c6fc6013c17b5711fb93853fff140267/proposals/2002-rooms-v4.md">v4</a>, which includes the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/f714aaadd011ac736d779f8460202a8d95799123/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">state resolution algorithm</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/event_id_hashes/proposals/1659-event-id-as-hashes.md">collision-resistant event IDs</a>, which are now formatted to be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/proposal/no_slash_in_event_id/proposals/1884-replace-slashes-in-event_ids.md">URL safe</a>.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.0 also ships with support for the upcoming <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v5.html">v5 room protocol</a> (which enforces honouring server key validity periods), but this will not be used as the default for new rooms until a sufficient number of servers support it.</p>
<p>Please note that Synapse 1.0 does <strong>not</strong> include significant performance work or new features - our focus has been almost exclusively on providing a reference implementation of the Matrix 1.0 protocol. But having cleared our backlog on security/stability issues we will finally be now unblocked to pursue work around reducing RAM footprint, eliminating forward-extremity build up, and shipping new features like Edits, Reactions &amp; E2E cross-signing support.</p>
<p>As part of the security work, Synapse 1.0 contains a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md#it-used-to-work-just-fine-why-are-you-breaking-everything">breaking change</a> that requires a valid TLS certificate on the federation API endpoint. <strong>Servers that do not configure their certificate will no longer be able to federate post 1.0.</strong></p>
<p>It is also worth noting that Synapse 1.0.0 is the last release that will support Python 2.x and Postgres 9.4. For more information see <a href="/blog/2019/04/08/synapse-deprecating-postgres-9-4-and-python-2-x">here</a> but the TL;DR is that you should upgrade asap.</p>
<p>This release has been a long time coming. Many thanks indeed to everyone who helped test the release candidates and provided feedback along the way.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.0 is just one component of a larger Matrix 1.0 release, which you can <a href="/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation">read all about here</a>.</p>
<p>As ever, you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.0.0">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>. Note, Synapse is now available from PyPI, pick it up <a href="https://pypi.org/project/matrix-synapse/">here</a>. Also, check out our <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/installing-synapse">Synapse installation guide page</a></p>

<p>Quiet week, not much happening, the only real progress has been shipping a Synapse 1.0 release candidate :) Joking aside we’d really appreciate your help in testing it ahead of the full release next week. Get the RC here <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.0.0rc1">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.0.0rc1</a></p>
<p>Also friends don’t let friends operate a Synapse install without a valid certificate on the federation API. Post 1.0, servers that are not compliant will be locked out of the federation. While the copy needs updating to reflect 1.0’s imminent release, our handy FAQ (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md</a>) has all the details.</p>

<p>Are you in the know about Matrix? If not, prepare to learn about <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/">RiotX</a>, a <em>completely re-written</em> Matrix client for Android. This new version has a Kotlin SDK.</p>
<p>Benoit, from the team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many things to announce this week on RiotX:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto is starting to work! We can now decrypt message and send encrypted messages. The whole feature is not implemented yet, but we will merge the PR at the beginning next week before going further. Thanks François for the great work!</li>
<li>On the timeline, message composed by only emoji are now displayed bigger (as in other Riot clients)</li>
<li>We can now see details and actions of each message, including state event.</li>
<li>We can also see the detailed list of reactions for a particular message, and reaction display rendering has been improved. More details of what has been improved by Valere can be found in this PR description: <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/pull/168">https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/pull/168</a>.</li>
<li>Local echo on message edition has been improved</li>
<li>The 3 main themes has been implemented (Light, Dark Black). Status theme is still there but has not been tested yet. There are still some little issues which will be fixed in the next coming days.</li>
<li>The new Home is on develop, composed by a catchup tab, a direct message tab and a group room tab. The drawer is now used to display the groups hierarchy.</li>
<li>A debug signature has been added to the git repository, so the APK built by buildkite can now be installed and replace a previously installed APK.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is still lots of work to do, but we are quite confident to deliver a first alpha version of RiotX to a larger audience at the end of June.</p>

<p>Main news in synapse-land this week is that we released Synapse v0.99.5.2, which fixes a big performance regression which was introduced v0.99.5. Folks who are currently on v0.99.5/v0.99.5.1 are advised to upgrade asap.</p>
<p>Otherwise, work has been continuing apace towards a v1.0 release on 10th June.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/">Construct</a> is a homeserver implementation in C++:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Construct has added support for Server Access Control Lists (m.room.server_acl). The exact behavior of the implementation is configurable by the server administrator, and is even more comprehensive than Synapse. In Construct, ACLs can be configured to cover incoming EDUs, outgoing events, and indirectly fetched events.</li>
<li>The GraphicsMagick library has been utilized to implement the media thumbnailing feature called for by the specification. This is an optional dependency written in C and offers a rich API which as been extremely fun to work with. In the future, expect your Construct to be capable of things like annotating images with the Server Command Line which can be used to generate memes in your chatroom or write custom text on top of stickers!</li>
<li>On the backend we have devoted significant effort to getting the most out of dynamic-linking to simplify the architecture of a large and modular free-software project. This effort makes adding features and contributions to Construct extremely straightforward. I will enumerate the basics for those familiar with developing C software: We are now loading all modules at runtime with the flags <code>RTLD_GLOBAL|RTLD_DEEPBIND|RTLD_LAZY</code> and we build with the flag <code>--weak-unresolved-symbols</code>; during execution we hook the error handling in <code>ld.so</code> to throw our own C++ exception directly from the PLT slot of a missing symbol. In summary this allows features to be added to Construct by simply creating an interface in a header and definitions in a loadable module, while still enjoying optional loading and unloading of the module at runtime. This is a significant feat that remains unrealized in most existing projects around the free software ecosystem!</li>

<p>Can you believe it, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> had a busy week working on his various bridges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> now has native Matrix edit support in both directions and basic Prometheus metrics. I'll probably start making 0.6.0 RCs after improving the metrics a bit.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts">mautrix-hangouts</a> got some bugfixes and options to configure the displaynames of the ghost users on Matrix (like adding <code>(FB)</code> or <code>(Hangouts)</code> suffixes).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a>'s Matrix puppeting was finished (meaning typing notifs, read receipts and presence updates can now be bridged to WhatsApp) and unexpected disconnection handling was fixed (automatic reconnections should now usually work again).
Backfilling needed some hacks to work with Matrix puppeting. The problem is that the real Matrix users have rate limits and can't send timestamp-massaged messages. I decided to just invite the default ghost user to the room while backfilling and make it leave afterwards so that private chat room names and such would stay intact. Some clients like Riot Android/iOS sometimes do weird things, such as moving the room out of &quot;People&quot;, but that shouldn't be too bad.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> has seen some work in becoming more flexible.</p>
<p>Synapse is not a requirement anymore. People can now use the playbook to install any of the other services, wiring them to a Synapse instance installed in another way.
This is mostly useful for installing bridges or other auxiliary services without going &quot;all in&quot; on the playbook.
Not having Synapse as a fixed requirement also opens the door for installing alternative homeservers, when such become available in the future.</p>
<p>On a similar note, to ease maintanability, all bridges have been moved to separate Ansible roles (outside of the <code>matrix-synapse</code> role).
There have been lots of improvements related to bridge configuration with even more likely to come soon.</p>

            <p>0.99.5.2 contains a critical performance fix following a regression that was introduced in 0.99.5. Affected servers will have experienced increased CPU and RAM usage with a knock on effect of generally sluggish performance.</p>
<p>Separately, we are also looking into reports relating to further performance degradations that may have been introduced as part of 0.99.5, though consider the 0.99.5.2 fix to be a significant improvement on previous 0.99.5.x releases.</p>
<p>Please upgrade asap.</p>
<p>You can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.5.2">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>After lots of refinements, polishing and a few distractions we’re finally at the point of announcing the final timeline for both Matrix 1.0 and Synapse 1.0! We are targeting <strong>Monday 10th June</strong> as our release date - please consider this your two week warning!</p>
<p>This is the end game of the process we began back in February when we released the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019">first stable release of the Server-Server API</a> at FOSDEM, and started the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/05/synapse-0-99-0">Synapse 0.99</a> release series to prepare for 1.0.</p>
<p>Matrix 1.0 refers to the upcoming set of API releases which provides a matched set of stable and secure APIs across all of Matrix - at which point the project (at last) exits beta! In practice, this will be Client-Server API 0.5 (including final membership lazy loading, E2E backups and interactive verification and lots more), SS API 0.2 (including server key validity period fixes and associated v5 room protocol) and any other spec updates. The next 2 weeks will see a flurry of spec activity as we get everything together - you can see the full list and track the progress for the CS 0.5 spec release at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/2.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Synapse 1.0 will be the reference implementation of Matrix 1.0, and so makes the changes required to implement Matrix 1.0 and close all currently known security and stability issues and thus exit beta. This means changing the default room protocol version used for new rooms to be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/37871106c6fc6013c17b5711fb93853fff140267/proposals/2002-rooms-v4.md">v4</a>, which includes the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/f714aaadd011ac736d779f8460202a8d95799123/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">state resolution algorithm</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/event_id_hashes/proposals/1659-event-id-as-hashes.md">collision-resistant event IDs</a>, which are now formatted to be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/proposal/no_slash_in_event_id/proposals/1884-replace-slashes-in-event_ids.md">URL safe</a>. <strong>Support for v4 rooms shipped in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/05/21/synapse-0-99-5-1-released">Synapse 0.99.5.1</a>, so please upgrade asap to 0.99.5.1 before 1.0 is released to ease the transition.</strong>. Synapse 1.0 will also ship with support for the upcoming v5 room protocol (which enforces honouring server key validity periods), but this will not used as the default for new rooms until sufficient servers are speaking Matrix 1.0.</p>
<p>As part of the security work, Matrix 1.0 and Synapse 1.0 also contains a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md#it-used-to-work-just-fine-why-are-you-breaking-everything">breaking change</a> that requires a valid TLS certificate on the federation API endpoint. <strong>Servers that do not configure their certificate will no longer be able to federate post 1.0</strong></p>
<p>You can check that your server has been correctly configured <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/">here</a> and see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">here</a> for more info on what you need to do. If in doubt head to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>We've been tracking readiness for the certificate change at https://arewereadyyet.com, at the time of writing 68% of active <em>servers</em> on the federation have valid certificates. We obviously would want that number to be higher, however since the largest installations <em>have</em> upgraded the total number of <em>users</em> who are ready for 1.0 stands at 96%, which we consider to be high enough to release 1.0.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/awry.2019-05-24.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>This is not a drill</strong>, from here until 10th June we need everyone to not only ensure that their own server is ready, but also to encourage their fellow admins to update as well. With your help we can get everyone over the line!</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for your help to date, especially those providing support in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>Onwards!</p>

<p>Folks, big news this week as we announce that Synapse v1.0 is scheduled for release on 10th June - <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/05/24/final-countdown-to-1-0">read all about it here</a></p>
<p>Aside from that we shipped <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/05/21/synapse-0-99-5-1-released">v0.99.5.1</a> which (hopefully) is the penultimate release ahead of v1.0. Please, everyone upgrade to v0.99.5.1 because it implements rooms v4 which will be the default room version in Synapse v1.0.</p>
<p>0.99.5.1 also contains experimental support for edits and reactions which are currently hidden behind a Riot labs flag.</p>

<p>The process of renaming QMatrixClient to Quotient has commenced - expect some turbulence while we're transitioning. The place for the repos is at <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im">https://github.com/quotient-im</a>. Note that although the library repo name has changed, the old version of the library will continue releases under the old name (libQMatrixClient), and only in the master branch the library will be renamed. In most cases redirects should bring you home even if you request the old URL (thanks to GitHub); however, people with git repos are strongly advised to update their remotes to new URLs!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For platforms that don't have a separate libQMatrixClient package (that is, Windows, macOS, Flatpak and AppImage), Quaternion 0.0.9.4 has been rebuilt with libQMatrixClient 0.5.2 - in the form of Quaternion 0.0.9.4c release.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:lain.haus">Fox</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neo now supports sending multiple images, videos and files at once. You'll get a bar with previews, and the option to remove them from the queue/add more.<br />
There's also been a bunch of changes to how events are handled. Images and videos should be much more robust against missing keys (no thumbnail, no information, etc), and there's basic displaying of the most common state events.<br />
I also added an experimental media repository fallback option, which is disabled by default, and only implemented for room avatars. This allows you to provide a list of alternative homeservers Neo is allowed to try when your own homeserver can't load a piece of media.<br />
Due to the loss of lain.haus, I lost admin access in the Neo room, so keep your eyes out for a new one when my infra is back.<br />
I'm currently not really versioning anything, but I do push significant commits to <a href="https://neo.lain.haus/neo">https://neo.lain.haus/neo</a> for people to try. Once it gets to a more useable state, I'll start adopting semantic versioning.</p>

<h3 id="major-whatsapp-bridging-update">Major WhatsApp bridging update</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> made great strides on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on mautrix-whatsapp to add history bridging and Matrix puppeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>New portals are populated with some history when creating them (exact count is configurable)</li>
<li>All messages missed during bridge downtime are backfilled</li>
<li>Creating portals is smarter now:</li>
<li>When logging in initially, it'll create portals for a few recent chats (count configurable).</li>
<li>It'll create portals when there are incoming messages as before, but it should no longer create portals for chats that only have old messages.</li>
<li>The missed message backfilling creates portals when necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Matrix puppeting isn't quite finished yet. It can already use your Matrix account to bridge messages sent from whatsapp mobile, but it doesn't use the account to bridge EDUs (typing notifs, presence, read receipts) yet.</p>
<p>To make the history bridging a bit nicer, I made a PR to fix timestamp massaging in synapse: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/5233. Timestamp massaging was removed from the spec in 1.0, but it wasn't intentionally removed from synapse, it just broke due to other changes. It was probably supposed to stay there as an easter egg until there's a proper solution for bridging history.</p>

<h3 id="gsoc-2019-reliable-bridges">GSoC 2019 – Reliable Bridges</h3>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kai:nasnotfound.de">Kai</a> for this introduction to his project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>Reliable Bridges</em> GSoC project is about implementing a feedback mechanism for the Matrix network in cases where bridges are not able to properly handle messages. Currently clients are unable to know if a message was successfully sent over a bridge. With the new mechanism in place they get the information about errors happening at bridges and can behave accordingly by e.g. notify the user of the failed delivery.</p>
<p>The implementation is foremost focused on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-dicord</a> bridge which uses the underlying <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>. A JS bridge was chosen so that as much code as possible is brought into the SDK and other bridges can profit sooner from the work done.</p>
<p>The first step for implementing the new feature will be the signaling of permanent errors occurring at the bridge (in contrast to temporary failures). They might occur e.g. when the sending account was banned on the bridged foreign network. These permanent errors will be implemented as a new type of PDU originating from the bridge.</p>
<p>After permanent errors are done, the subsequent weeks will see work on temporary failures which might include work on Synapse as well as work on Riot Web to have a client which actually uses the new events. As these events are new features being introduced there will also be a MSC draft. There everyone can check out the proposed solution and tear it apart with their criticism (if applicable 😉).</p>
<p>For discussions related to the GSoC project or when you have some opinions on how the MSC should look like, you are invited to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#reliablebridges:nasnotfound.de">Reliable Bridges Matrix room</a>.</p>

            <p>Okay folks, this is an important one. v0.99.5.1 will be the last release before we ship Synapse v1.0. <strong>It is really important that you upgrade to v0.99.5.1 because it implements rooms <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/room_v4/proposals/2002-rooms-v4.md">version 4</a> - which is the room version that Synapse 1.0 will default to.</strong></p>
<p>This means that Synapse 1.0 servers will create new rooms as version 4 by default and servers that have not upgraded to at least v0.99.5.1 will not be able to join those rooms.</p>
<p>Over the coming days we will announce a release day for Synapse v1.0, the idea is to give admins 2 weeks notice so that anyone yet to configure their federation SSL certificate has time to do so. <strong>This is important, failure to configure your certs will mean not being able to federate with v1.0 servers.</strong> If you are not sure if you certs are valid, you can test <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/">here</a> and read <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">here</a> for more info on what to do.</p>
<p>Aside from room v4, this release also includes the ability to blacklist specific IPs from federating as well as experimental support for edits and reactions. We are not quite ready to mark the feature 'done done', but it is very close. Watch out for news as the feature lands properly.</p>
<p>We're really close to v1.0 now, give us a few more days and we'll announce an official release date.</p>
<p>As ever, you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.5.1">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>. Note, Synapse is now available from PyPI, pick it up <a href="https://pypi.org/project/matrix-synapse/">here</a>.

<p>Neil said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we shipped <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/05/15/synapse-0-99-4-released">0.99.4</a>  - no stand out ‘oh my gosh’ headlines, just lot lot of bug fixes and perf improvements - get involved. We’ve also been working hard to getting things like reactions and edits going, as well more prep for improving perf for small server instances.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p>First <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/">Construct</a> update for a few weeks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/">Construct</a> has added a server command line available in any room when starting a line with a special character (by default it's '\'). The commands are private so the room doesn't actually see it. More on this next week, or check out <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net">#test:zemos.net</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-sdk-now-1-0">Ruby SDK now 1.0!</h3>
<p>Big news from <a href="https://github.com/ananace/">Ananace</a> this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finished getting the test coverage to a reasonable enough percentage to feel comfortable releasing the <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby Matrix SDK</a> as a nice and stable 1.0 (.0)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is great! All Rubyists should check it out. Ananace notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I still need to set up fixtures for all the API endpoints I'm exposing so I can verify every single API call as well, but I see that as a later thing as that relates mostly to how the other side (the HS) handles my input, not to how the SDK itself handles said input</p>

<p>This week Neil and Matthew are talking about recent security issues - this is a really long and detailed chat, but you can skip to around the 32 minute mark to hear about other news - including progress on reactions. Reminder that for a good &quot;big picture&quot; overview of the progress of Matrix, you can look at the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/9">Homeserver High Level Roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>Neil, Synapse-dev wrangler:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reactions continues at full speed, we have a draft PR and will be implementing over the coming week. The ability to blacklist IPs over federation will land imminently, as well as a nasty device management bug that led to a spate of E2E errors. Next week is all about Reactions, resuming work on the small homeserver project and finally getting back to Synapse 1.0 blockers following all the remediation drama of the past few weeks. With any luck we’ll have a new Synapse release for you next week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the development pace has been reduced lately, the Fractal team managed to make significant progress towards the 4.2 release. More specifically since our previous news, Chris has landed much of his adaptive view work to get Fractal in a mobile friendly state so it’s ready to run on the Librem 5 once Purism starts shipping them. But he didn’t stop there: eager to see his awesome work in the hands of many people (figuratively, the literal application will have to wait for the phone to be out 😛) as soon as possible, he tackled a few bugs that we really wanted to get sorted out before we got a new version out.</p>
<p>Alexandre also <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/commit/152255031400049a30667c581c0dc31a4ef03146">prepared the changelog</a> with a bird’s-eye view of all changes that happened since 4.0.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we had a few external contributions for features such as network proxy support and typing notifications.</p>

<h3 id="new-hangouts-bridge-from-tulir-mautrix">New Hangouts bridge from tulir / mautrix</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been using his <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python">mautrix-python</a> lib, which was recently used to enable his <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> bridge, to bring a new method for Matrix-Hangouts bridging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New bridge again, this time it's Hangouts: https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#hangouts:maunium.net">#hangouts:maunium.net</a>. As with the Messenger bridge, currently the main difference to matrix-puppet-hangouts is multi-user support (also no hacky JS/Python mixing).</p>
<p>Before making mautrix-hangouts, I put a bunch of the generic bridging parts of mautrix-facebook into mautrix-python's bridge module and used that in both bridges. After Debian 10 is released, I'll drop Python 3.5 compatibility in mautrix-telegram and move it to use mautrix-python and the bridge module too.</p>
<p>Next week I'm planning on adding a bunch of features to both my new bridges, such as bridging formatting and remaining media types (so no new bridges planned for now :D).</p>

<h3 id="qmatrixclient-is-now-quotient">QMatrixClient is now &quot;Quotient&quot;</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vote on a new name for the QMatrixClient project has been going on over the past week.<br />
<strong>We have a winner now, and the new name is &quot;Quotient&quot;!</strong> In the nearest weeks, expect changes in the library code (it's going to be libQuotient from the next release), room aliases (already ongoing), links to the repos etc. etc. Where possible, we're going to smoothen the migration path by providing legacy fallbacks (e.g., the new C++ namespace, Quotient, will be introduced but the old one, QMatrixClient, will stay its synonym, although deprecated).<br />
Just in case you missed all the previous mentions of the topic - it's only related to the overall project and the library, but not the client - its name remains Quaternion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why rename?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the previous name has been a bit clumsy and, most importantly, the project is no more focusing just on client-side but on a wider set of applications of Matrix (no homeserver in plans though). See also the recent backlog of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#qmatrixclient:matrix.org">#qmatrixclient:matrix.org</a> (now also <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#quotient:matrix.org">#quotient:matrix.org</a>) earlier this week for the whole discussion</p>

<p>It's been a few weeks since we heard from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> about <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>, but he's been working away on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We haven't shared any <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> updates lately, but we've had lots of community contributions.</p>

Here's what's most interesting lately:</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:feneas.org">jaywink</a>, maintainer of <a href="https://the-federation.info">https://the-federation.info</a>, told us what we all know to be true: Matrix is great and is getting more popular:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrix (Synapse) jumps to second place in <a href="https://the-federation.info">https://the-federation.info</a> site, which lists servers of the federated social web. Help us map the true size of the Matrixverse by adding your server by going a <code>https://the-federation.info/register/yourdomain.tld</code>. Note, SRV and well-known lookups not yet working, so registration needs to happen with the Matrix server real domain (and port if any).</p>
