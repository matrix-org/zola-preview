            <p>Matrix.org is a team of around 10 developers working together on the Matrix project, defining the Matrix open standard and developing the opensource reference client and server implementations.  Most of the team has day jobs at <a href="http://amdocs.com">Amdocs</a> or <a href="http://www.openmarket.com">OpenMarket</a> (who kindly sponsor us to work on Matrix), and we gladly welcome contributors from the wider open source community.</p>
<p>Matrix was started by Matthew Hodgson and Amandine Le Pape whilst building Amdocs Unified Communications, on realising that traditional VoIP and IM standards were insufficient to power featureful apps which can openly federate with one another.  Matrix is designed to support open federation for the current and future state-of-the-art in communication apps using a simple web-friendly HTTP API standard.  Our dream is to break down the walls between today's communication silos, and make VoIP and IM as ubiquitous and open as email.</p>

<p>Matthew Hodgson is technical co-founder of matrix.org, responsible for defining Matrix's vision with Amandine and moving obstacles out of the way of the team in order to build it.  Matthew has spent the last 15 years mainly designing and building various communication solutions on top of an alarming array of different technologies (IRC, IM, NNTP, IMAP, IAX, SIP/RTP, RTMP, XMPP... and now Matrix).</p>
<p>Matthew's day job is running the Unified Communications team at Amdocs, creating communication apps for large mobile network operators (e.g. <a href="http://blah.com">Blah</a> for TIM Brasil).  Previously he ran &quot;The Next Generation&quot; telephony/media team at MX Telecom (acquired by Amdocs in 2010), building a highly distributed SIP softswitch and mobile-optimised WebRTC-compatible graph-based media framework and VoIP stack to power MX's voice and video services.  Matthew has also been known to dabble in sysadmin (running MX Telecom's sysadmin team), dubious graphic design and CGI, and wishes he had more time to play piano.  He has a degree in Computer Science and Physics from the University of Cambridge, and has previously worked at Accenture, the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, <a href="http://www.theonering.net">TheOneRing.net</a> as well as misguidedly co-founding a digital marketing startup in Bahrain.

<p>Amandine Le Pape is business co-founder of matrix.org, responsible for defining the Matrix vision with Matthew and then organising the non-technical activities required to support and promote it and make it successful.</p>
<p>Amandine has spent the last 2 years setting up and leading the Unified Communications line of business within Amdocs as a Product Manager, and has more than 10 years of experience in mobile services and telecommunications.  She has a degree in telecommunications engineering from Ecole Supérieure de Chimie, Physique et Electronique de Lyon and an EMBA from ESC Rennes.

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Synapse 0.3.4 is out! The main changes here are a huge fleet of bugfixes to the webclient, and the addition of TURN support for VoIP relaying. This makes VoIP/Video call setup much more reliable (although the UI still needs some love).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we set an IRC bridge (<a href="https://github.com/tm604/Matrix-IRCBridge">https://github.com/tm604/Matrix-IRCBridge</a>) running linking #matrix:matrix.org and #matrix-dev:matrix.org to their Freenode counterparts (#matrix &amp; #matrix-dev respectively) - much fun to see innocent IRC users assimilated up into Matrix, and for us to now be using Matrix for /all/ our development chat and interaction (whether it's through a Matrix client or an IRC client).</p>
<p>To upgrade to the latest homeserver, just <code>git pull &amp;&amp; ./synctl restart</code>.  If you want to start playing with VoIP in earnest on your own homeserver, you'll need to install a TURN server - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/turn-howto.rst">docs/turn-howto.rst</a> for details on how to set one up.</p>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/alpha">http://matrix.org/alpha</a> has already been upgraded to 0.3.4, so feel free to play with all the new stuff there.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Matthew</p>
<h1 id="changes-in-synapse-0-3-4-2014-09-25">Changes in synapse 0.3.4 (2014-09-25)</h1>

            <p>Hello world,</p>
<p>Synapse 0.3.3 was released today, concentrating on both feature &amp; stability improvements on the webclient.  The big news is that 1:1 video calling via WebRTC is implemented (although we're still working on some stability issues, and Synapse doesn't support TURN yet.  This will be coming in the next few days however!).</p>
<p>Play with the demo server at http://matrix.org/alpha, or update your own homeserver with a <code>git pull &amp;&amp; ./synctl restart</code> or by cloning a new checkout with <code>git clone https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse.git</code></p>
<p>--Matthew</p>
<h1 id="changes-in-synapse-0-3-3-2014-09-22">Changes in synapse 0.3.3 (2014-09-22)</h1>
<p>Homeserver:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix bug where you continued to get events for rooms you had left.</li>
</ul>
<p>Webclient:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add support for video calls with basic UI.</li>
<li>Fix bug where one to one chats were named after your display name rather
than the other person's.</li>
<li>Fix bug which caused lag when typing in the textarea.</li>
<li>Refuse to run on browsers we know won't work.</li>
<li>Trigger pagination when joining new rooms.</li>
<li>Fix bug where we sometimes didn't display invitations in recents.</li>
<li>Automatically join room when accepting a VoIP call.</li>
<li>Disable outgoing and reject incoming calls on browsers we don't support

            <p>We just pushed out a major new release (0.3.0) of Synapse: the current reference Matrix homeserver, swiftly followed by some hotfixes (0.3.1, 0.3.2).</p>
<p>The big changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the VoIP setup API to be more efficient (bundling together media stream candidates into a single setup object). <strong>API breaking change!</strong></li>
<li>Change the Registration API to be more consistent. <strong>API breaking change!</strong></li>
<li>Lots of nice usability refinements to webclient - e.g. per-message notifications; cursor-key history navigation; faster room loading</li>
<li>More bugfixes and stability fixes on the homeserver</li>
</ul>
<p>Please reload the page if you're lurking on http://matrix.org/alpha to pull in the new webclient.</p>
<p>If you're running a homeserver - please upgrade with a quick <code>git pull &amp;&amp; ./synctl restart</code>.</p>
<p>If you're not running a homeserver... why not? ;D</p>

<h1 id="changes-in-synapse-0-3-2-2014-09-18">Changes in synapse 0.3.2 (2014-09-18)</h1>
<p>Webclient:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix regression where an empty &quot;bing words&quot; list in old accounts didn't send
notifications when it should have done.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="changes-in-synapse-0-3-1-2014-09-18">Changes in synapse 0.3.1 (2014-09-18)</h1>
<p>This is a release to hotfix v0.3.0 to fix two regressions.</p>
<p>Webclient:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a regression where we sometimes displayed duplicate events.</li>
<li>Fix a regression where we didn't immediately remove rooms you were
banned in from the recents list.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="changes-in-synapse-0-3-0-2014-09-18">Changes in synapse 0.3.0 (2014-09-18)</h1>
<p>See UPGRADE for information about changes to the client server API, including
breaking backwards compatibility with VoIP calls and registration API.</p>
<p>Homeserver:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a user changes their displayname or avatar the server will now update
all their join states to reflect this.</li>
<li>The server now adds &quot;age&quot; key to events to indicate how old they are. This
is clock independent, so at no point does any server or webclient have to
assume their clock is in sync with everyone else.</li>
<li>Fix bug where we didn't correctly pull in missing PDUs.</li>
<li>Fix bug where prev_content key wasn't always returned.</li>
<li>Add support for password resets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Webclient:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve page content loading.</li>
<li>Join/parts now trigger desktop notifications.</li>
<li>Always show room aliases in the UI if one is present.</li>
<li>No longer show user-count in the recents side panel.</li>
<li>Add up &amp; down arrow support to the text box for message sending to step
through your sent history.</li>
<li>Don't display notifications for our own messages.</li>
<li>Emotes are now formatted correctly in desktop notifications.</li>
<li>The recents list now differentiates between public &amp; private rooms.</li>
<li>Fix bug where when switching between rooms the pagination flickered before
the view jumped to the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Add support for password resets.</li>
<li>Add bing word support.</li>
<li>Update VoIP implementation to use new API</li>
</ul>
<p>Registration API:</p>
<ul>
<li>The registration API has been overhauled to function like the login API. In
practice, this means registration requests must now include the following:
'type':'m.login.password'. See UPGRADE for more information on this.</li>
<li>The 'user_id' key has been renamed to 'user' to better match the login API.</li>
<li>There is an additional login type: 'm.login.email.identity'.</li>
<li>The command client and web client have been updated to reflect these changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, Synapse v0.2.3 was released yesterday: the emphasis this week has been on improving stability issues on the server, and lots of cosmetic and functionality fixes on the webclient.</p>
<p>If you're running a homeserver, please upgrade asap - upgrading has never been easier - assuming you've checked out the master branch, simply:</p>
<pre>
git pull
./synctl restart
</pre>
<p>...and you will be up and running on 0.2.3.  We keep the master branch tracking the latest release.  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://matrix.org/alpha">http://matrix.org/alpha</a> is already on the latest release should you wish to experiment first!</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you're installing from scratch, try:</p>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse.git
python setup.py develop --user
./synctl start # to generate a default config
./synctl start # to actually set it running
</pre>
<p>and then head over to http://localhost:8008 to play with your very own Matrix homeserver!</p>
<h1 id="changes-in-synapse-0-2-3-2014-09-12">Changes in synapse 0.2.3 (2014-09-12)</h1>
<p>Homeserver:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix bug where we stopped sending events to remote home servers if a
user from that home server left, even if there were some still in the
room.</li>
<li>Fix bugs in the state conflict resolution where it was incorrectly
rejecting events.</li>
<li>Many stability fixes</li>

            <p>The Matrix team is at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2014/">TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2014</a> this week - we had a great time at the hackathon on Saturday/Sunday where we were really excited to see several teams building their hacks on Matrix APIs - we stayed the night to support whilst building out our own hack (experimenting with sending collaborative 3D animations over Matrix as JSON)!  Huge thanks to everyone who built on top of Matrix - hope you had as much fun as we did :)</p>
<p>Please come talk to us in person in Startup Alley (next to the Brazilian Pavilion) if you're attending Disrupt and find out all about Matrix first hand!</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>We realized we're missing a high level overview highlighting the key points of the specifications and architecture of Matrix, which could be useful for those who don't feel like going straight into the specs. So here is a <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Introducing-matrix.pdf">quick presentation</a> to fill in some of the gaps!</p>
<p>Please fire away with any questions :)</p>

            <p>I'm Matthew, and I'm responsible for the techie side of what we're up to with Matrix.</p>
<p>Matrix is the result of a lot of work my team's done over the last 10 years or so (first at <a href="http://www.mxtelecom.com">MX Telecom</a>, then <a href="http://www.openmarket.com">OpenMarket</a>, and then <a href="http://www.amdocs.com/UnifiedCommunications">Amdocs</a>) in developing next-generation IP communication solutions.  First we started with an <a href="http://www.asterisk.org">Asterisk</a>-based platform running basic PSTN IVR services, and then shifted to an in-house IAX-based IVR platform built in Java, and then added circuit-switched (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G-324M">3G-324M</a>) video calling, then switched to SIP/RTP, C++ and a massively-distributed softswitch architecture affectionately called 'The Next Generation'.  Then the iPhone and Android came along, and we realised we didn't have to be constrained by built-in phone capabilities and ported our whole C++ SIP/RTP VoIP stack over to iOS/Android and got writing Video/VoIP calling apps.  This evolved to developing full-blown unified communication apps (e.g. <a href="http://www.blah.com">Blah</a>), using XMPP at first for messaging before switching to our own HTTP-based messaging APIs.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way it became painfully obvious that VoIP and IM hasn't really evolved as well as the rest of the internet.  Back when SIP/RTP first emerged, it simply wasn't mature enough to work on the open internet as well as HTTP or SMTP or even FTP - it needed STUN, ICE, TURN, Opus and many other refinements to be really usable in the wild.  And similarly XMPP hasn't taken over the world quite as much as we once hoped.  Meanwhile, many folks went and built their own proprietary walled-garden solutions (be it Skype, FaceTime, Viber, WhatsApp, or even our own efforts) and we've ended up in the current horrible situation where our online communication is fragmented across hundreds of isolated apps and websites.  It's like a world where email was never unified, and half the world is still stuck on Compuserve.  And it's counter to the whole ethos of the internet as an open platform for collaboration and communication.</p>
<p>We decided that we want to fix this and so we have built and published a new open standard, together with open source (ASLv2) reference server (Python/Twisted) and client (JS/Angular, Python, Perl) codebases, and so provide new building blocks that can be used to build truly interoperable federated IM and VoIP functionality.  We consider this effectively an investment in the industry: by creating a strictly non-profit initiative like Matrix, we both make the world a better place for end users - as well as creating new business opportunities (both opensource and commercial) for the telecoms industry as a whole.</p>
<p>The standard and code are all brand new and very much still in creation at this point, but we're releasing it early to get as much feedback and input from the community as early on as we possibly can. Right now our focus is on fully decentralised federated group messaging, but VoIP and identity management is coming together well too.  You can think of it as &quot;making VoIP/IM as interoperable and flexible as email&quot;, or perhaps &quot;the missing signalling layer for WebRTC&quot;, &quot;XMPP for an HTTP world&quot;, or “what would happen if IRC, XMPP, SIP, SMTP, IMAP and NNTP had kids?” Here are some reasons we think that you should use Matrix:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Simple pragmatic RESTful HTTP/JSON APIs.  No more XMPP or SIP stacks and wrestling XML streams or torture-testing SIP parsers.</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">No single points of control for channels of communication (unless you really want it for moderation or similar). Room state for a room is synchronised with eventual consistency over all participating Matrix servers - no single server controls the room.</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">No more netsplits - history re-heals itself if the matrix fractures</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">All communication is group by default: 1:1 chat is just a subset of group chat.</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Multi-device aware: all state is stored and synchronised in realtime across all devices, and away-state and notifications are aware of multiple devices.</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Uses arbitrary 3rd party identifiers - doesn't rely on JIDs or SIP URIs for identity.</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Share the same simple HTTP signalling channel for messaging and VoIP</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Support more efficient transports if you want (e.g. low-bandwidth/low-roundtrip sync on mobile)</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Built for mobile - e.g. support push notification and low-bandwidth/low-latency client-server transports if needed (in progress)</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">TLS (HTTPS) by default, either with self-signed certs with published public keys or proper SSL CA signed certs (in progress)</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">End-to-end PKI encryption (in progress)</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Trusted federation of public identity servers available for publishing your PKI public keys and tracking your validated 3rd party IDs</span>
</li>
</ul>

            <p>Today is a big day for us as we are launching Matrix.org, an open initiative which has the goal of making real-time communication over IP as seamless and interoperable as email.</p>
<p>How do we want to achieve this? Very simply by creating a new federated, open-source ecosystem for VoIP and instant messaging on the internet! Ambitious right? :)</p>
<p>Actually not that much! In practice it's fairly simple: we are publishing the specification of a pragmatic and lightweight open standard, some opensource reference implementations of the servers and clients, and pragmatic RESTful HTTP JSON APIs, all of which are available right now on <a title="Github" href="http://github.com/matrix-org" target="_blank">Github</a>!</p>
<p>What does this mean for the world?</p>
<p>For techies, it gives developers a new way of building and running their own communications functionality, or integrating existing services into the Matrix ecosystem.</p>
<p>For consumers, it means that eventually they may be able to choose to use their favourite app from their trusted app provider, whilst reaching anyone they like given the entire Matrix ecosystem is interoperable.</p>
<p>So this is the very high level description of Matrix, but it misses the reasons why we've started this. We thought that rather than summarizing the main reasons for launching this project in a faceless post it would be interesting to present it from different perspectives, so we've asked some of the core team to give their take on it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- Read <strong><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/?p=62">Matthew's</a></strong> post and get an insight of Matrix' technical history and rationale.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- Check out <strong><a title="Why Matrix?" href="http://matrix.org/blog/?p=12">Amandine's </a></strong>view on why the users need Matrix.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">The Matrix Team</p>
PS: Matrix is hoping to talk about the future of communication in general at <b>SXSW Interactive</b>  - if you like the idea of Matrix, please <strong>vote for us</strong> by clicking <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/37949">here</a> before September 5th!
