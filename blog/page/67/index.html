            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>There's been loads of work going on in various branches on Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/federation_authorization">federation_authorization</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/event_signing">event_signing</a>) as we land the final features needed for Synapse to be used in production as a Matrix reference server.  Meanwhile the iOS demo client and SDK has been coming on leaps and bounds too over at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk</a>.</p>
<p>However, stuff has also been happening on the main Synapse development branch too, and we've just released 0.4.2 onto master for lots of various goodies - see release notes below.</p>
<p>Please upgrade your homeservers and play with the new client - the new JSON viewing/editing features are particularly useful and interesting for powerusers and developers!</p>
<p>Matthew</p>
<pre>

        <div>
            <p>It's been an incredibly busy few weeks in Matrixland - we've had our heads down rushing to get new stuff ready for today's <a href="http://disrupteuhackathon.challengepost.com">TechCrunch Disrupt London hackathon</a>.</p>
<p>The big news is that we have our first alpha releases of native Mobile SDKs available today for Matrix for iOS &amp; Android! These are entirely new projects - you can check out the SDKs and demo apps (which implement a basic Matrix chatroom client similar to the <a href="http://matrix.org/alpha">webclient demo</a> at:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk</a></li>
</ul>
We still have a lot of polishing and lipstick to apply to these, but it should be a good starting point for folks who'd like to hack on mobile apps for Matrix! We haven't had a chance to generate appledoc/javadoc for these yet, but we'll post them on matrix.org shortly.
<p>There's also been some work going into restructuring our documentation and finalising the spec - all Matrix generic documentation now lives in a new git project at <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc">http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc</a>. We're still working on wrapping all the details of the spec into a single canonical document, but it's getting there and should be locked down shortly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we're also pleased to announce the new Synapse 0.4 release series of the reference Matrix homeserver. Our focus on Synapse over the last few weeks has been on implementing the remaining pieces of the Matrix security model and getting the server to the point where folks can deploy it properly in production environments.</p>
<p><b>Synapse 0.4 deliberately breaks backwards compatibility on the server-server federation protocol</b>, as we now cryptographically sign all federation traffic at the HTTP layer (using Authorization headers) in order to have a strong assertion to the identity of the servers which exchange traffic. We can't really use SSL client/server certificates for this as it's incompatible with Synapse deployments which are hosted behind generic SSL loadbalancers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we have two other major development branches on Synapse which will land shortly - one of which <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/event_signing">cryptographically signs all events</a>, thus preventing tampering with room history, and the other of which performs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/federation_authorization">strict authorization</a> on all traffic received through federation to avoid malicious events being injected and breaking the consistency of the distributed room. These should be landing shortly - at which point the full security model of Matrix will be implemented in Synapse and we can finally remove the &quot;don't use this in production!&quot; warnings!</p>
<p>API developers: be aware that this release also fixes the confusion over timestamps in the client-server (and server-server) API. Events now have only one well-defined timestamp - event.origin_server_ts; the localtime on the homeserver which first receives a message. This replaces the previous confusing event.ts and event.content.hsob_ts timestamps. This should be a trivial change to implement.</p>
<p>Finally, we've also had a detour into <a href="http://trossenrobotics.com/phantomx-ax-hexapod.aspx">robotics</a> to build our new mascot (Sentinel)... pictures forthcoming shortly!</p>
<p>Thanks for supporting Matrix - please let us know how you get on with the new releases at <a href="http://matrix.org/alpha">#matrix:matrix.org!</a></p>

            <p>Matrix.org is a team of around 10 developers working together on the Matrix project, defining the Matrix open standard and developing the opensource reference client and server implementations.  Most of the team has day jobs at <a href="http://amdocs.com">Amdocs</a> or <a href="http://www.openmarket.com">OpenMarket</a> (who kindly sponsor us to work on Matrix), and we gladly welcome contributors from the wider open source community.</p>
<p>Matrix was started by Matthew Hodgson and Amandine Le Pape whilst building Amdocs Unified Communications, on realising that traditional VoIP and IM standards were insufficient to power featureful apps which can openly federate with one another.  Matrix is designed to support open federation for the current and future state-of-the-art in communication apps using a simple web-friendly HTTP API standard.  Our dream is to break down the walls between today's communication silos, and make VoIP and IM as ubiquitous and open as email.</p>

<p>Matthew Hodgson is technical co-founder of matrix.org, responsible for defining Matrix's vision with Amandine and moving obstacles out of the way of the team in order to build it.  Matthew has spent the last 15 years mainly designing and building various communication solutions on top of an alarming array of different technologies (IRC, IM, NNTP, IMAP, IAX, SIP/RTP, RTMP, XMPP... and now Matrix).</p>
<p>Matthew's day job is running the Unified Communications team at Amdocs, creating communication apps for large mobile network operators (e.g. <a href="http://blah.com">Blah</a> for TIM Brasil).  Previously he ran &quot;The Next Generation&quot; telephony/media team at MX Telecom (acquired by Amdocs in 2010), building a highly distributed SIP softswitch and mobile-optimised WebRTC-compatible graph-based media framework and VoIP stack to power MX's voice and video services.  Matthew has also been known to dabble in sysadmin (running MX Telecom's sysadmin team), dubious graphic design and CGI, and wishes he had more time to play piano.  He has a degree in Computer Science and Physics from the University of Cambridge, and has previously worked at Accenture, the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, <a href="http://www.theonering.net">TheOneRing.net</a> as well as misguidedly co-founding a digital marketing startup in Bahrain.

<p>Amandine Le Pape is business co-founder of matrix.org, responsible for defining the Matrix vision with Matthew and then organising the non-technical activities required to support and promote it and make it successful.</p>
<p>Amandine has spent the last 2 years setting up and leading the Unified Communications line of business within Amdocs as a Product Manager, and has more than 10 years of experience in mobile services and telecommunications.  She has a degree in telecommunications engineering from Ecole Supérieure de Chimie, Physique et Electronique de Lyon and an EMBA from ESC Rennes.

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Synapse 0.3.4 is out! The main changes here are a huge fleet of bugfixes to the webclient, and the addition of TURN support for VoIP relaying. This makes VoIP/Video call setup much more reliable (although the UI still needs some love).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we set an IRC bridge (<a href="https://github.com/tm604/Matrix-IRCBridge">https://github.com/tm604/Matrix-IRCBridge</a>) running linking #matrix:matrix.org and #matrix-dev:matrix.org to their Freenode counterparts (#matrix &amp; #matrix-dev respectively) - much fun to see innocent IRC users assimilated up into Matrix, and for us to now be using Matrix for /all/ our development chat and interaction (whether it's through a Matrix client or an IRC client).</p>
<p>To upgrade to the latest homeserver, just <code>git pull &amp;&amp; ./synctl restart</code>.  If you want to start playing with VoIP in earnest on your own homeserver, you'll need to install a TURN server - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/turn-howto.rst">docs/turn-howto.rst</a> for details on how to set one up.</p>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/alpha">http://matrix.org/alpha</a> has already been upgraded to 0.3.4, so feel free to play with all the new stuff there.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Matthew</p>
<h1 id="changes-in-synapse-0-3-4-2014-09-25">Changes in synapse 0.3.4 (2014-09-25)</h1>

            <p>Hello world,</p>
<p>Synapse 0.3.3 was released today, concentrating on both feature &amp; stability improvements on the webclient.  The big news is that 1:1 video calling via WebRTC is implemented (although we're still working on some stability issues, and Synapse doesn't support TURN yet.  This will be coming in the next few days however!).</p>
<p>Play with the demo server at http://matrix.org/alpha, or update your own homeserver with a <code>git pull &amp;&amp; ./synctl restart</code> or by cloning a new checkout with <code>git clone https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse.git</code></p>

            <p>We just pushed out a major new release (0.3.0) of Synapse: the current reference Matrix homeserver, swiftly followed by some hotfixes (0.3.1, 0.3.2).</p>
<p>The big changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the VoIP setup API to be more efficient (bundling together media stream candidates into a single setup object). <strong>API breaking change!</strong></li>
<li>Change the Registration API to be more consistent. <strong>API breaking change!</strong></li>
<li>Lots of nice usability refinements to webclient - e.g. per-message notifications; cursor-key history navigation; faster room loading</li>
<li>More bugfixes and stability fixes on the homeserver</li>
</ul>
<p>Please reload the page if you're lurking on http://matrix.org/alpha to pull in the new webclient.</p>
<p>If you're running a homeserver - please upgrade with a quick <code>git pull &amp;&amp; ./synctl restart</code>.</p>
<p>If you're not running a homeserver... why not? ;D</p>

<h1 id="changes-in-synapse-0-3-2-2014-09-18">Changes in synapse 0.3.2 (2014-09-18)</h1>
<p>Webclient:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix regression where an empty &quot;bing words&quot; list in old accounts didn't send
notifications when it should have done.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="changes-in-synapse-0-3-1-2014-09-18">Changes in synapse 0.3.1 (2014-09-18)</h1>
<p>This is a release to hotfix v0.3.0 to fix two regressions.</p>
<p>Webclient:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a regression where we sometimes displayed duplicate events.</li>
<li>Fix a regression where we didn't immediately remove rooms you were
banned in from the recents list.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="changes-in-synapse-0-3-0-2014-09-18">Changes in synapse 0.3.0 (2014-09-18)</h1>
<p>See UPGRADE for information about changes to the client server API, including
breaking backwards compatibility with VoIP calls and registration API.</p>
<p>Homeserver:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a user changes their displayname or avatar the server will now update
all their join states to reflect this.</li>
<li>The server now adds &quot;age&quot; key to events to indicate how old they are. This
is clock independent, so at no point does any server or webclient have to
assume their clock is in sync with everyone else.</li>
<li>Fix bug where we didn't correctly pull in missing PDUs.</li>
<li>Fix bug where prev_content key wasn't always returned.</li>
<li>Add support for password resets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Webclient:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve page content loading.</li>
<li>Join/parts now trigger desktop notifications.</li>
<li>Always show room aliases in the UI if one is present.</li>
<li>No longer show user-count in the recents side panel.</li>
<li>Add up &amp; down arrow support to the text box for message sending to step
through your sent history.</li>
<li>Don't display notifications for our own messages.</li>
<li>Emotes are now formatted correctly in desktop notifications.</li>
<li>The recents list now differentiates between public &amp; private rooms.</li>
<li>Fix bug where when switching between rooms the pagination flickered before
the view jumped to the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Add support for password resets.</li>
<li>Add bing word support.</li>
<li>Update VoIP implementation to use new API</li>
</ul>
<p>Registration API:</p>
<ul>
<li>The registration API has been overhauled to function like the login API. In
practice, this means registration requests must now include the following:
'type':'m.login.password'. See UPGRADE for more information on this.</li>
<li>The 'user_id' key has been renamed to 'user' to better match the login API.</li>
<li>There is an additional login type: 'm.login.email.identity'.</li>
<li>The command client and web client have been updated to reflect these changes.</li>
</ul>

            <p>We're back home from TechCrunch where we had a great time arguing the pros and cons of Matrix versus XMPP with anyone and everyone - thanks to all who came to talk to us!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Synapse v0.2.3 was released yesterday: the emphasis this week has been on improving stability issues on the server, and lots of cosmetic and functionality fixes on the webclient.</p>
<p>If you're running a homeserver, please upgrade asap - upgrading has never been easier - assuming you've checked out the master branch, simply:</p>
<pre>
git pull
./synctl restart
</pre>
<p>...and you will be up and running on 0.2.3.  We keep the master branch tracking the latest release.  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://matrix.org/alpha">http://matrix.org/alpha</a> is already on the latest release should you wish to experiment first!</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you're installing from scratch, try:</p>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse.git
python setup.py develop --user
./synctl start # to generate a default config
./synctl start # to actually set it running
</pre>
<p>and then head over to http://localhost:8008 to play with your very own Matrix homeserver!</p>
<h1 id="changes-in-synapse-0-2-3-2014-09-12">Changes in synapse 0.2.3 (2014-09-12)</h1>
<p>Homeserver:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix bug where we stopped sending events to remote home servers if a
user from that home server left, even if there were some still in the
room.</li>
<li>Fix bugs in the state conflict resolution where it was incorrectly
rejecting events.</li>
<li>Many stability fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Webclient:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display room names and topics.</li>
<li>Allow setting/editing of room names and topics.</li>
<li>Display information about rooms on the main page.</li>
<li>Handle ban and kick events in real time.</li>
<li>VoIP UI and reliability improvements.</li>
<li>Add glare support for VoIP.</li>
<li>Improvements to initial startup speed.</li>
<li>Don't display duplicate join events.</li>
<li>Show message sent/sending state via opacity</li>
<li>Multiline message sending support</li>
<li>Many other bug &amp; stability fixes</li>
</ul>

            <p>The Matrix team is at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2014/">TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2014</a> this week - we had a great time at the hackathon on Saturday/Sunday where we were really excited to see several teams building their hacks on Matrix APIs - we stayed the night to support whilst building out our own hack (experimenting with sending collaborative 3D animations over Matrix as JSON)!  Huge thanks to everyone who built on top of Matrix - hope you had as much fun as we did :)</p>
<p>Please come talk to us in person in Startup Alley (next to the Brazilian Pavilion) if you're attending Disrupt and find out all about Matrix first hand!</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>We realized we're missing a high level overview highlighting the key points of the specifications and architecture of Matrix, which could be useful for those who don't feel like going straight into the specs. So here is a <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Introducing-matrix.pdf">quick presentation</a> to fill in some of the gaps!</p>
<p>Please fire away with any questions :)</p>
