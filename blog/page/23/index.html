            <p>This is part of a series of reports on the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696"><em>six</em> projects</a> assigned to Matrix for Google Summer of Code 2020.</p>
<p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696/#5751467312414720">View project: HTML Embeddable Matrix Chat Rooms</a></p>
<hr />
<p>My name is <a href="https://github.com/arnav-t/">Arnav Tiwari</a> and I am a prefinal year undergraduate student from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/">IIT Kharagpur</a> and I wanted to share my amazing journey with Matrix. I am a budding open-source enthusiast and this was my first experience with Google Summer of Code. For the past few months, I had been working on a project to develop an <a href="https://github.com/arnav-t/riot-embedded">HTML embeddable chat client</a> under the GSoC program for Matrix. Matrix provides a highly versatile SDK for making custom clients that can be leveraged for a variety of applications, one of which is using Matrix to power an embeddable chat client. A chat client itself can have numerous forms, whether it being a live chat to a simple comments section. This project was intended to provide an easy-to-use and yet highly customizable client that can be deployed on a website with minimal effort.</p>
<p>My goal for the project was to have a useable project by the end of the coding period, however, as it turned out, the project was going to be tested in the real world far sooner than that. The need for an embeddable client and the feasibility of the project to fulfill this role was demonstrated during the second month of the coding period itself. The client was <a href="https://2020.commcon.xyz/live/">deployed on the website of CommCon 2020</a>, a virtual conference on communication technologies (an apt place to be tested, coincidentally). On the days leading up to the conference and during the conference itself, I helped the organizers to set up, integrate, and troubleshoot the client when required. While the process went mostly without any hiccups, there was one small incident when the client broke during production. Since the project was still pretty early in development, I didn’t expect it to be bug-free and had anticipated the possibility of this happening. I was keeping an eye on things, which proved to be a prudent decision as I was able to fix this problem quickly and with minimal downtime. The rest of the conference went smoothly and the client performed quite well even when the number of users was quite large (A testament to Matrix’s scalability). Getting to experience this was a pleasant surprise since I never expected to have real users so soon, much less so many at once. Seeing the client being used out in the wild was a very fulfilling thing to witness. I also gained some very valuable feedback, courtesy of Dan, CommCon’s master of ceremonies. </p>
<p>Over the next month or so, I kept on steadily adding features and building up the client. The next big break for the project came in the form of another conference. <a href="https://akademy.kde.org/2020">KDE Akademy 2020</a>. This was a big surprise as I genuinely didn’t expect to see another large conference using the project so soon. The conference was scheduled to be held after a week or so after the end of the coding period. This time, however, the integration was almost completely handled by the conference organizers themselves since it had to be integrated with their version of BigBlueButton, a web conferencing system. As the conference drew nearer, things seemed to be working out well and there was no sign of trouble. When the day of the conference finally came, however, many things seem to break simultaneously due to an apparent incompatibility with BBB. In the end, despite the numerous attempts by the conference organizers and myself to remedy the issues, they had to roll back to an older version of the chat since the risk would be too great. The organizers were understandably disappointed since they had spent a while working on the integration and had seen the great potential of using this client in place of their old chat system.. Even though It was a sad conclusion to the journey, there were still many lessons to be learned. Most importantly, even though the client might work well in standalone circumstances, ease of integration might have some room for improvement. Open-source development never truly stops and I don’t intend to give up on this project. I look forward to constantly improving it and seeing more people adopt it.</p>
<p>These past few months were a spectacular experience. Even before starting this journey, I knew I would learn a lot but this still managed to exceed all my expectations. I got to learn things I never would have thought I would be able to experience under GSoC. I met some awesome people along the way, I’m extremely grateful to my mentors Ben Parsons and Travis Ralston for being the best mentors anyone could ever ask for. They were always approachable and friendly throughout the entire program and I never hesitated before asking for their help. Without their guidance, all of this would’ve certainly not been possible. Lastly, I want to express my gratitude to Matrix for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to undertake this project. The Matrix community is full of talented people who will go the extra mile if you ask them for help. It has truly been a pleasure working with them and I hope to continue working with them in the future. Cheers and hope to see continue seeing you all!</p>

<p>We had another long overdue Spec Core Team retro this week. On the whole it felt very productive, and we've hopefully helped identify some key issues and actions going forward to help internally organise the way the team spends time on MSCs (read: unblocking review progress from the team).</p>
<p>We're still working out our exact strategy asynchronously at the moment, so expect more details to follow soon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we put out a new release candidate for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.0rc3">Synapse 1.20.0</a>, highlights include shadow ban support, more async/awaiting and unread message counts being added to sync responses to support upcoming notifications work. </p>
<p>Aside from that Erik has been continuing to get event persistence sharding ready for shipping. He already has a working version, but currently all workers will run at the speed for the slowest instance. Once that is fixed we will put it on matrix.org to see how it performs.</p>
<p>Patrick has finished up on asyncing all the things, and is now studying flame graphs to figure out where all the cycles on the main process are going.</p>
<p>Andrew has been taking a look at the knocking <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC</a>, expecting concrete progress in the next few weeks. </p>
<p>Brendan has been working notifications support and is currently in VoIP land helping Dave on trying to level up our VoIP support.</p>
<p>Finally Oliver has dusted off his TURN tester from last Summer to get it working before he returns to university. The idea is that it will act a bit like the federation tester for but for TURN configuration.</p>

<p>Released 0.0.36 with end-to-end encryption enabled! 🎉<br />
Most of this week was spent on performance improvements for IE11, where asm.js runs quite slow. Decryption is run in parallel on 4 workers in that browser, giving a massive speed-up and added responsiveness (the UI would freeze for 7 seconds when opening a room prior to this). There is still some polishing to do on sharing room keys, which I will get to next week, but all in all, it should work well. Next week I also want to get started on supporting key backup, so you can also read your encrypted history from before you logged in.</p>

<p>This isn't strictly a client, but it's in the clients section.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting stuff into the spec or even implemented in Elements is very slow, so while we wait for proper native sticker packs and pickers (i.e. not in an iframe/webview), I decided to make a better sticker picker widget: <a href="https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker">https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker</a></p>
<p>The goal is to be as fast and simple as possible. The picker and sticker packs are just some static files that can be served anywhere (no compilation required). It doesn't require self-hosting anything except said static files, and it has been confirmed to work on all three Elements.</p>
<p>There's a Telegram import script that's used to reupload stickers to Matrix and generate the static sticker pack files that the picker widget uses. It's technically also possible to make the sticker pack files yourself, but there's no easy way to do that yet.</p>
<p>Due to the simplicity of the picker there's no authentication, which also means everyone sees the same sticker packs. One way to get around that limitation is to have a unique URL for each user. I'll probably write a bot to manage copies of the picker for multiple users in the future.</p>
<p>Other future improvements include remembering frequently used stickers (surprisingly, all three Elements keep localStorage for widgets), importing Telegram animated stickers and searching for stickers by emoji/name</p>
</blockquote>
<p>later more words appeared from Tulir:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the initial announcement, my sticker picker has received some more features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a slider to configure the number of stickers shown per row</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequently used stickers now show up at the top</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imported all the packs from Scalar (the default integration manager)</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <p>This is part of a series of reports on the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696"><em>six</em> projects</a> assigned to Matrix for Google Summer of Code 2020.</p>
<p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696/#6107552447725568">View project: Enabling E2EE in Opsdroid Matrix Connector</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I'm <a href="https://github.com/Tyagdit">Tyagraj Desigar</a> and I worked on <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid">Opsdroid</a> with <a href="https://github.com/Cadair">Stuart Mumford</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew">Drew Leonard</a>. Opsdroid is a python framework for creating platform agnostic bots usable with multiple chat services including matrix.</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>
<p>The project's focus was on the interaction layer (called a connector) between opsdroid and matrix. As it stood, the connector used the deprecated <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a> and had no support for encryption. The aim was to change this by moving over to <a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a>.</p>
<p>I had planned to work on some other features as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>A database module for opsdroid using matrix state events</li>
<li>Support for unused matrix events</li>
<li>Homeserver lookup using <code>.well-known</code> API requests</li>
<li>Device verification process for the bot</li>
</ul>
<p>Porting to nio and adding encryption support was the bulk of the project, and the <strong>minimum</strong> I wanted to accomplish by the end of the project. I wanted to have a connector that worked as it did already with support for encrypted rooms which needed minimal extra configuration.</p>
<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>The process began with <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/pull/1418">This PR</a> which gave us a head start with the migration to matrix-nio. Through helping to review the PR I got to understand how matrix-nio and opsdroid work. </p>
<p>The implementation of encryption support was a little tricky in that it was tough to figure out the process required to do that in the context of the connector. One problem we faced was the installation of dependencies. Installing <code>libolm</code>, a C library which nio uses for encryption was a less than smooth process. This spawned a couple side projects that dealt with the CI, testing and installation of opsdroid. In the end we found a solution and had a working connector on our hands.</p>
<p>Next we shifted focus to the database module. It was based on <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/database-matrix">this project</a>. I rewrote it with nio and added a few features. The idea was straightforward but the implementation had many catches since we were working under some constraints for the interfacing with opsdroid. It went through several iterations before we settled on the final product.</p>
<p>The encryption and database took longer than I had initially expected which meant we didn't get to work on adding support for more events and homeserver lookups. I had a go at adding device verification steps while working on the encryption support but that turned out to be quite complicated and would introduce some breaking changes, besides cross-signing had just been introduced so we decided to drop that till nio implemented some way to leverage cross-signing.</p>
<p>Along the way some issues cropped up with the testing frameworks and CI that were hard to pinpoint and caused further delays but were solved eventually.</p>
<h2 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am extremely happy with what I've accomplished and hope that I have been able to achieve the standards set by the matrix community. It was a challenging and exhilarating experience. I have learned more in this project than I could've imagined and gained a ton of invaluable experience with software development thanks to my mentors who pushed me forward and guided me throughout. This journey was beyond amazing and I will be sure to contribute to matrix moving forward.</p>

<p>This is a re-publishing of Chetan's <a href="https://chethan2k1.github.io/blog/working-with-matrix.html">original blog post</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="whoami">whoami?</h2>
<p>I'm <a href="https://github.com/Chethan2k1">CH Chethan Reddy</a>. I'm currently pursuing Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering at the <a href="https://www.nitt.edu/">National Institute of Technology, Trichy in India</a>. In my free time I like to swim, work on projects I find interesting, watch movies and do a lot of other &quot;interesting&quot; stuff. This summer I have interned in Matrix.org for around 3-4 months under GSoC and in this blog I'll be sharing my experience.</p>
<h2 id="why-matrix-org">Why Matrix.org?</h2>
<p>Being passionate about privacy, I wanted to select an organization that actively works on that, and clearly, Matrix.org topped my list. For anyone who doesn't know what Matrix is, in simple words, It is a decentralized communication protocol that supports many awesome features like messaging, end-to-end encryption, voip/video calls support, etc. It uses simple RESTful http APIs which keeps things very simple. The best part of the protocol is, it is decentralized, so if you have a custom domain name, you can setup a synapse server in a jiffy. Knowing all these who wouldn't choose Matrix?</p>
<h2 id="my-work">My Work</h2>
<p>I worked on Desktop Client called <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a>. It is a light-weight Desktop Client that uses Qt Framework in the frontend and also uses a mtxclient library that implements Matrix-client server API written in C++. The scope of my project involved implementing Device-Verification and Cross-Signing in Nheko.</p>
<p>For people who have not used Matrix before, it is important to note that every device of a particular user is considered as a separate unit rather than user itself. For end-to-end encrypted chat to be viewable from a device, that particular device should be trusted by the sender's device. Device-verification and Cross-Signing are methods used for verifying.</p>
<p>Coming to <a href="https://chethan2k1.github.io/blog/final-report.html">the work I have implemented</a>, Device-verification is completely implemented in Nheko. As of now, SAS verification with to-device and room message verification is supported in Nheko. As far as Cross-Signing is concerned, verifying signatures of Cross-Signing keys and showing the verified status of devices have been implemented. The only remaining unfinished parts are SSSS and signing the keys after verification. After that Cross-signing should be feature-complete.</p>
<p>I wished to implement SSSS during my GSoC period, but I couldn't because I did not anticipate the additional things which came with verification while making my proposal. The additional works included : implementing the UI, changes to the userprofile dialog, working on the caching of verified users, and user keys. Moreover, due to the current pandemic, there were a few sudden changes in my academic schedule, which interrupted my work to some extent. While contributing at times I was stuck on some bugs like verifying the signatures, some random crashes in UserProfile and setting up relations in Room-Verification. However, with the help of my mentors, I was able to fix these bugs.</p>
<p>I'm really happy about the work I have done. I am hoping to further work on Nheko in the future, complete Cross-Signing and work on additional features for Nheko.</p>
<h2 id="community-and-mentors">Community and Mentors</h2>
<p>The best part of my experience this summer was the the Matrix community and the learning I had. I am really lucky to be part of the Matrix community which has many passionate people collectively working on really cool projects with clients, bridges, servers, bots and the spec. A special thanks to Uhoreg and Sorunome who have helped me in navigating through the spec.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, a big shout-out to both my mentors, Nico and red_sky, who were always there to help me with any issue in the project in spite of their personal commitments and dealt with my stupid questions with utmost patience and kindness. Without their active help and guidance this experience definitely would not have been so fun and great, they have clearly surpassed the expectations I had from mentors.</p>

<hr />
<p>Hello! I am <a href="https://github.com/nikofil">Nikos</a>, an MSc student in Computer Security. My original goal for this GSoC was to implement the basics of end-to-end encryption for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb">Go-NEB</a>, which is a popular and easily extendable bot for the Matrix protocol. I chose this project because it ticked off a lot of the boxes that I look for in a project: The Matrix protocol is very interesting and the e2e specification is fascinating, Go-NEB is written in Go which I wanted to learn better, plus I believe personally that crypto should be easy for everyone to use and adopted more.</p>
<p>My initial plan was to first create bindings in gomatrix for libolm, the C library that implements most of the necessary algorithms for Olm/Megolm, the protocols used in Matrix' end-to-end encryption. Then, I was going to write some nice APIs around those bindings so that most of the work done is hidden from the client that uses the library, and finally I would call these APIs from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb">Go-NEB</a> when needed to set up the encrypted sessions between devices in a room and use them to encrypt/decrypt messages as necessary. What we found out soon after GSoC started was that another library called <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-go">mautrix-go</a> that was based on gomatrix already did most of these things. My task then became to change the uses of gomatrix in Go-NEB for mautrix-go and make some slight changes to the latter if there were some incompatibilities. A month later, that task was done.</p>
<p>With two months to go in GSoC, my mentors came up with a new task: to implement a service for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb">Go-NEB</a> that allows other client developers to test their e2ee implementations easily. That resulted in a service called &quot;cryptotest&quot; which allows other clients in a specified room to execute some Neb commands which would trigger functions like the forwarding of keys between clients, another feature that had to be implemented in mautrix. Something else that I wanted to add and grabbed my interest was SAS device verification, a multi-step process that involves users comparing a string of numbers or emojis out-of-band to configure they are indeed talking to each other and not to a MITM. These were my main tasks during the second month and I was happy to have achieved them and made a decent verification API for clients to use. They were soon merged into mautrix and Go-NEB.</p>
<p>For my third month I proposed to implement a new Matrix feature called cross-signing, which was similar to SAS verification but dealt with verifying other users instead of their devices who would in turn verify their own devices, creating a graph of trust between users and devices. This functionality was strongly coupled with SSSS, another new feature that allows clients to store their encrypted secrets (in this case the multiple necessary signing keys) on the server, as well as in-room verification which allows verification between users. This task was more challenging as it uses multiple algorithms (some of which not in libolm) for deriving the keys, using them to encrypt other keys which in turn sign other keys. It was also more satisfying when I finally managed to generate the keys, store and retrieve them and then use them to sign another user and when I was done I felt like my understanding of cryptography levelled up.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm very satisfied with the overall experience. The spec was very clear in most cases and when it wasn't the community was always helpful and responsive. They were also happy to discuss the spec with me and explain the more intricate details. For that reason I wasn't asking questions directly to my mentors (besides for defining my tasks) but to the overall community. I'm also very grateful to my mentors, <a href="https://github.com/uhoreg">@uhoreg</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Kegsay">@Kegan</a> for picking me for this project and helping me with the planning aspect and reviewing my PRs. I'd lastly like to thank the maintainer of mautrix, <a href="https://github.com/tulir/">@tulir</a>, for reviewing and merging a lot of my work into his library.</p>

<p>Erik has made an initial, naive implementation of a sharded Event Persister worker - the non-sharded version currently being one of the biggest bottlenecks on matrix.org right now. It still needs a bit of polish to be production ready, and Sytest will need some updating to support testing it, but otherwise progress is looking good!</p>
<p>Brendan is polishing his unread counts implementations, while Rich is writing up the push rules replacement tech in an MSC. Rich has also been optimizing the device code in Synapse to both simplify the code, as well as cut down on unnecessary device data being sent over federation.</p>
<p>Patrick has finished converting Synapse's database code to be fully async! This has the benefit of making profiling the matrix.org Synapse process much more sane, and we're already starting to find a few little places where Synapse is burning CPU unnecessarily! Now, Synapse won't be fully async'd until Twisted itself is, and we drop support for older Twisted versions that aren't, which is not <em>soon</em>. However the majority of the code that developers touch and that is executed being async has massive benefits either way 🙂</p>
<p>Andrew has been working on having a confirmation pop up after users click the link in their email, to help prevent phishing scams. He's also trying to finally make Synapse spec-compliant in accepting identifier dictionaries during user-interactive authentication.</p>
<p>Olivier has been continuing to help Synapse recover missed messages better after it has been offline for an extended period of time, as well as various fixes to push. </p>
<p>Expect a fresh release with all these changes soon!</p>

<p>Introducing a new bridge to the family, tomsg-matrix!</p>
<p>A friend of mine preferred using <a href="https://git.tomsmeding.com/tomsg/">his own chat protocol</a>, but having a chat protocol is useless without having people to talk to. Since I prefer using Matrix I thought it would be a fun exercise to try and create a bridge using Rust.</p>
<p>The bridge uses the newly created (still very WIP) <a href="https://github.com/lieuwex/matrix-appservice-rs">matrix-appservice-rs</a>. A Rust library that builds on top of the Ruma suite, the goal is for it to be comparable to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-node">matrix-appservice-node</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has mostly been focused on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/milestone/8">beta milestone tasks</a> and bug fixes. Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Joining rooms which the server already belongs to when invited by a user from another homeserver is now significantly faster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client API no longer refers to the device DB directly, instead using the new user API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of locking issues have been fixed in the federation sender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/join</code> endpoint now accepts <code>?server_name=...</code> query parameters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device list updater now obeys the backoff period and blacklisted status from the federation sender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uploaded media will no longer be truncated to 0 bytes when <code>max_file_size_bytes</code> option is set to 0 (for unlimited)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media API now correctly cleans up temporary directories when errors occur</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media API now returns unique media IDs and metadata when multiple users upload the same file, whilst maintaining deduplication on disk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rejecting invites over federation multiple times should now work properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redactions are now permanent and are committed to the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some caches have been added to the roomserver for room IDs, state key IDs and event type IDs to reduce pressure on the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The redaction endpoint is now spec-compliant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some places where global errors were overwritten have been fixed (thanks oliverpool!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some state key checks in the roomserver membership updaters have now been tidied up (thanks oliverpool!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 55%, up from 54% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 70%, down from 71% last week due to a single flakey test</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also updated some of our documentation and created a whole new set of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">easy first issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted">medium to hard issues</a> for contributors.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A multi-account Matrix client that allows you to authorize webapps to access parts of your account, designed with collaboration in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the webapp I've been talking about for a while that allows webpages limited access to your account. Currently, apps can view the name, avatar, alias, and type of a room that's been opened with the app, and that's just about it.</p>
<p>The big interesting thing about mxapps right now is the architecture. Just about all of the logic is running in a shared worker. This means that you can duplicate as many tabs as you want and it will all act as the same client. It also has multi-account support.</p>
<p>Features coming ~soon~ at some point will be full state event support and easy-to-follow docs on how to make an app, plus Vue plugins to make development really easy.</p>
<p>You can checkout the live version on <a href="https://mxapps.kb1rd.net/">mxapps.kb1rd.net</a>, but it is a bit useless...</p>
<p>There are some work-in-progress docs on the structure on <a href="https://docs.mxapps.kb1rd.net/">docs.mxapps.kb1rd.net</a></p>

<p>Small 0.6.2 release this week, mostly bug fixes:</p>
<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When replying to a message, you can now press enter without entering any</p>
<p>text to send it directly (useful to &quot;forward&quot; a message).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending a file while replying to a message will create a pseudo-reply,</p>
<p>consisting of an &quot;In reply to&quot; text message with no body, followed by the
actual file event.</p>
<p>This is a workaround to the reply restrictions imposed by the Matrix spec.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Composer aliases cannot contain whitespace anymore.</strong></p>
<p>This includes spaces, hard tabs or newline characters.
If an alias from your config still has whitespace, only the first word</p>
<p>will be taken into account (ignoring any leading or trailing space).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faster server browser loading, now gathers all needed data with a</p>
<p>single request instead of one for each server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-focus the &quot;Join&quot; button on invited room pages</p>
<p>((Shift+)Tab can be used to navigate between buttons)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-focus the &quot;Forget&quot; button on left room pages</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Released 0.0.34 this week with some fixes to the room list sorting and fixing several crashes. If you clear your session, it will also sort low priority rooms at the bottom of the room list, even if unread, making it a bit more usable until we add more UX refinements to the room list. </p>
<p>Most of the effort this week however has gone into working on end-to-end encryption, having investigated using the rust-sdk for a couple of days, and now looking into a custom implementation based on libolm. This is well on its way with key upload working and device tracking nearing completion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just merged the new event store a few days ago. This means Nheko now doesn't keep messages in RAM! Everything is stored on disk and mapped into memory from disk. This may reduce memory usage a tiny bit, but may increase latency while scrolling a bit. Try it out and give your feedback!</p>
<p>For the developers reading this, I collected some ramblings on my blog here: <a href="https://blog.neko.dev/posts/nhekos-event-store-v2.html">https://blog.neko.dev/posts/nhekos-event-store-v2.html</a> . Yes, I designed that site when I was like 15, I know the dark theme is a bit too much... Just use Firefox and the alternate stylesheet for light mode! Anyway, I'm very interested to hear how other clients implement their event stores!</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.19.1 is a bug fix release to fix two bugs introduced in 1.19.0.</p>
<p>Those two bugs were related to the new rate-limiter on room joins, which was introduced in 1.19.0.</p>
<p>The first bug caused Synapse to ignore exceptions to rate-limiting for application services.</p>
<p>The second one prevented profile updates from being correctly propagated across rooms.</p>
<p>Sorry if you have been bitten!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we have largely been working on bug fixes and performance issues.</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The room server now handles input events for multiple rooms in parallel when running with PostgreSQL, which helps a lot with perceived latency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Device key queries now obey federation backoffs, so that we don't spend a lot of time making unnecessary requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key server now only emits changes for <code>/users/devices</code> which reduces database hits significantly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client API now tries to guarantee message ordering on a per-user basis (thanks Anand!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federated invites are now more reliable and are performed synchronously</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite room metadata is now sent correctly in all cases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting and rejecting invites is also now much more reliable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed that caused excessive memory usage in the sync API (bringing the memory usage of my own instance down to less than 100mb)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A massive amount of work has been done to reduce database locks in SQLite mode across the entire codebase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some unnecessary code has been removed from the roomserver updaters</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 54%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 71%, up from 70% last week</p>

<p>On the sharding side the last big milestone is to get the event persister to shard. I know this comes up every week, but we now have a rough working implementation for non-backfilled events. Next steps are to get backfill working, get the tests passing, go through review and then ship. I asked Erik if it would be live on matrix.org within 2 weeks. He didn’t say, at least I didn’t hear him say no…&gt;
Aside from that Rich is working on the push rules redesign, the next steps are to design the APIs in more detail and then make a formal spec proposal. Brendan is also in notifications land and his work on room unread counts is going through final review. </p>
<p>Finally, Andrew has been working with Sorunome to dust off the knock feature, both on the spec and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6739">the Synapse side</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@concord:fuwafuwatime.moe">0xC0ncord</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! Just recently I made public an SELinux policy module I developed for Synapse. This policy is one I developed early on during my trip down the SELinux rabbit hole, and I have been using it in production for some time. At the moment, this policy module is built for the Gentoo SELinux policy (not RHEL/CentOS/Fedora) and does not currently have systemd support, nor has it been tested in all environments, i.e. with workers. I am publishing this policy in the hopes that it will be useful and I am open to any contributions, even those to help tighten the policy if possible. Finally, I have also made public a policy module for coturn, which I am also using in my own personal environment under the same conditions. Both the <a href="https://github.com/0xC0ncord/synapse-selinux">Synapse</a> policy and the <a href="https://github.com/0xC0ncord/turnserver-selinux">coturn</a> policy can be found on Github. Thank you!</p>

<p>As channels are really popular in Telegram, I wrote a quick and dirty program/bot which can mirror (text and image) public Telegram channels to Matrix rooms. This should make it easier for Telegram users to consider a switch.</p>
<p>Making the rooms read-only via permissions prevents messages from users.
It provides a good basis for someone trying to make a real 1to1 mirror. Please fork this project and host some channels publicly ;)</p>

<p>I've been working on trying to finish the event store (when I wasn't distracted by video calls with some people). This should allow limited offline use and reduce memory use as well as allow some other features in the future. If you want to try it out, you can build <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/pull/251">this PR</a> or try out the nightlies with <code>new-event-store</code> in their name.</p>
<p>If you decide to try it out, backup your cache or at least BACKUP YOUR ENCRYPTION KEYS! I won't be responding to feedback immediately, since I am currently hiking, but I should get to it this weekend or next week.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Added several features this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>avatars and display names in the timeline and for rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implemented the logic for the member list, but no UI for this yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>room list sorting by last message timestamp, unread state and badge count</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clear unread state when reading a room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some visual tweaks in the timeline and room list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bug fixes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have checked out hydrogen before, <strong>you'll need to clear your session</strong> (the little clear button in the session picker) to get correct avatars and display names everywhere.</p>
<p>Next week I'll get started on E2EE, which should make the project a lot more useful. I'll look into leveraging the nice rust matrix-crypto-sdk for this.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@miruka:privacytools.io">miruka</a> hit us with a late breaking update about Mirage!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mirage 0.6.1 was released today:</p>
<h4 id="added">Added</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>SSO authentication</strong> support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Homeserver browser</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To add a new account, you will be asked first to pick one of the 
listed public server (list data from <a href="https://publiclist.anchel.nl/">anchel.nl</a>) or to manually enter a server address </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Typing in the server address field will also filter the public server list, 
Up/Down or (Shift+)Tab and Enter can be used to navigate it by keyboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the address doesn't have a <code>scheme://</code>, auto-detect whether the server
supports HTTPS or only HTTP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the .well-known API if possible to resolve domains to the actual 
homeserver's URL, e.g. <code>matrix.org</code> resolves to 
<code>https://matrix-client.matrix.org</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server address field will remember the last homeserver that was
connected to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Room members autocompletion</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Type <code>@</code> followed by one or more characters in the composer, 
or one or more characters and hit (Shift+)Tab to trigger username/user ID
autocompletion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only autocompleted names will be turned into mentions, unlike before
where any word in a sent message that happened to be someone's name would 
mention them</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full image viewer</strong> for matrix image messages and URL previews:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click on a thumbnail in the timeline to open the image viewer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middle click on a thumbnail (or use the option in the context menu)
to open the image externally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Left click on the image (mouse only): expand to window size if the 
image's origin size is smaller than the window, 
else expand to original size</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap on the image (touch screen/pen only): reveal the info and button bars
when auto-hidden (bars will auto-hide only when they overlap with a big 
enough displayed image)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any mouse movement: reveal auto-hidden bars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double click on the image: toggle full screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middle click anywhere: open externally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right click anywhere: close the viewer, back to chat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag when displayed image is bigger than window to pan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wheel to pan up/down, hold shift or alt to pan left/right</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ctrl+wheel to control zoom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buttons to control rotation, scale mode, full screen, GIF play/pause 
and GIF speed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New keyboard shortcuts are available for all these actions, 
see <code>keys.imageViewer</code> in the config file (will be automatically updated 
when you start Mirage 0.6.1)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <code>media.openExternallyOnClick</code> setting to swap the new
click and middle click on thumbnails behavior </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room and member filter fields now support (Shift+)Tab navigation, in addition
to Up/Down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a colored left border to the currently highlighted item in list views 
(e.g. room list, members list, etc) to improve visibility </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>controls.listView.highlightBorder</code> and
<code>controls.listView.highlightBorderThickness</code> properties (can be set to <code>0</code>)</li>
<li>Add the <code>chat.userAutoCompletion</code> section</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Messages context menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use a cleaner icon for the &quot;Copy text&quot; entry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace the confusing broken &quot;Copy media address&quot; entry with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Copy media address: visible for non-encrypted media, always
copies the HTTP URL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy local path: always visible for already downloaded media, even if
they were downloaded before mirage was started</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>openMessagesLinks</code> keybind (default Ctrl+O) is renamed to
<code>openMessagesLinksOrFiles</code> and can now also open media message files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the <code>openMessagesLinksOrFiles</code> keybind on a reply will now ignore the
matrix.to links contained in the &quot;In reply to XYZ&quot; header</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pressing Ctrl+C to copy selected/highlighted non-encrypted media messages 
will copy their HTTP URL instead of the filename</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retry downloading image thumbnails if they fail with a 404 or 500+ server 
error (uploads sometimes take a few seconds to become available on the 
server)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-encrypted media messages are now always downloaded on click and opened
with a desktop application (or the image viewer), instead of
being opened in a browser</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compress thumbnails and clipboard images in a separate process, to avoid
blocking every other backend operation while the compression is running</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the level of optimization applied to clipboard images, 
the previous setting was too slow for large PNG (10MB+)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase applied scrolling velocity when using the 
<code>scrollPageUp</code>/<code>scrollPageDown</code> keybinds, now similar to how it was before
Mirage 0.6.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't catch SIGQUIT (Ctrl+\ in terminal) and SIGTERM signals, exit immediately</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slightly increase the top/bottom padding to the multi-account bar in the 
left pane</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependencies: minimum nio version bumped to 0.15.0</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="removed">Removed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Themes: remove unused <code>controls.listView.smallPaneHighlight</code> property</li>
</ul>
<p>And lots of fixes, see <a href="https://github.com/mirukana/mirage/releases/tag/v0.6.1">full changelog</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We wanted to take a little bit of time to show off a state resolution library for Ruma, courtesy of @DevinR528 and @Timo. Ruma has a new crate to make resolving state easier, <a href="https://github.com/ruma/state-res">state-res</a>! The goal of this crate is to be the base for federation, it provides the necessary utilities to resolve state, sort power events (reverse topological ordering), sort events (based on mainline depth), and a lot of event authentication functions. It is still in the early stages of development, but will be hopefully proved out in <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit">Conduit</a>.</p>
<p>Other things that happened this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added the invite endpoints from the Federation API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Started requiring strong types for event-sending endpoints</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Augmented error types with error-specific fields (see the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/713341462?t=00h35m42s">livestream here</a>)</p>
