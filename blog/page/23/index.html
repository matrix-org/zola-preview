            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>It’s been just over 2 months since we revealed that <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/30/welcoming-gitter-to-matrix">Gitter was going to join Matrix</a> - and
we are incredibly proud to announce that Gitter has officially turned on true native Matrix connectivity:
<strong>all public Gitter rooms are now available natively via Matrix, and all Gitter users now natively exist on Matrix.</strong>
So, if you wanted to join the official Node.js language support room at <a href="https://gitter.im/nodejs/node">https://gitter.im/nodejs/node</a>
from Matrix, just head over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nodejs_node:gitter.im">#nodejs_node:gitter.im</a> and *boom*, you’re in!</p>
<p>This means Gitter is now running a Matrix homeserver at gitter.im which exposes all the active public rooms - so if you go to the the room directory in Element (for instance) and select gitter.im as a homeserver, you can jump straight in:</p>
<p><img src="https://matrix.org/blog/img/2020-12-07-gitter-roomdir.png" alt="Gitter room directory" /></p>
<p>Once you’re in, you can chat back and forth transparently between users on the Gitter side and the Matrix side, and you no longer have the ugly “Matrixbot” user faking the messages back and forth - these are ‘real’ users talking directly to one another, and every public msg in every public room is now automatically exposed into Matrix.</p>
<p><img src="https://matrix.org/blog/img/2020-12-07-gitter-matrix.gif" alt="Gitter and Matrix going native!" /></p>
<p>So, suddenly all the developer communities previously living only in Gitter (<a href="https://gitter.im/scala">Scala</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/nodejs/home">Node</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/webpack">Webpack</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/angular">Angular</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/rails">Rails</a> and thousands of others) are now available to anyone anywhere on Matrix - alongside communities bridged from Freenode and Slack; the native Matrix communities for Mozilla, KDE, GNOME communities etc. We’re hopeful that glueing everything together via Matrix will usher in a new age of open and defragmented dev collaboration, a bit like we used to have on IRC, back in the day.</p>
<p>This is also great news for mobile Gitter users - as the original mobile Gitter clients have been in a <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/issues/2281">holding pattern for over a year</a>, and native Matrix support for Gitter means they are now officially deprecated in favour of Element (or indeed any other mobile Matrix client).</p>
<h2 id="what-features-are-ready">What features are ready?</h2>
<p>Now, this is the first cut of native Matrix support in Gitter: much of the time since Gitter joined Element has been spent migrating stuff over from Gitlab to Element, and it’s only really been a month of work so far in hooking up Matrix. As a result: all the important features work, but there’s also stuff that’s yet to land:</p>
<p>Features ready today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to join rooms from Matrix via #org_repo:gitter.im</li>
<li>Bridging Edits, Replies (mapped to Threads on Gitter), Deletes, File transfer</li>
<li>Bridging Markdown &amp; Emoji</li>
</ul>
<p>What remains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to send/receive Direct Messages</li>
<li>Ability to plumb existing Matrix rooms into Gitter natively</li>
<li>Ability to view past Gitter history from Matrix. This is planned thanks to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716</a></li>
<li>Synchronising the full Gitter membership list to Matrix. Currently the membership syncs incrementally as people speak</li>
<li>Turning off the old Gitter bridge</li>
<li>Bridging emotes (/me support) (almost landed!)</li>
<li>Bridging read receipts</li>
<li>Synchronising room avatars</li>
<li>Bridge LaTeX</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuff we’re not planning to support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to join arbitrary rooms on Matrix from Gitter. This could consume huge resources on Gitter, and we’re not in a rush to mirror all of Matrix into Gitter. This will get addressed when Gitter merges with Element into a pure Matrix client.</li>
<li>Bridging Reactions. Gitter doesn’t have these natively today, and rather than adding them to Gitter, we’d rather work on merging Gitter &amp; Element together.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, we strongly recommend checking out the <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitterHQ/-/epics/10">native Matrix epic on Gitlab</a> for the unvarnished truth straight from the coal-face!</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-make-an-existing-chat-system-talk-matrix">How do you make an existing chat system talk Matrix?</h2>
<p>In terms of the work which has gone into this - Gitter has been an excellent case study of how you can easily plug an existing large established chat system into Matrix.</p>
<p>At high level, the core work needed was as simple as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add ‘virtual users’, so remote Matrix users can be modelled and represented in Gitter correctly: <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2027/diffs">https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2027/diffs</a>.
<ul>
<li>This can be accomplished by simply adding a <code>virtualUser</code> property to your chat message/post/tweet schema which holds the mxid, displayName, and avatar as an alternative to your <code>author</code> field. Then display the <code>virtualUser</code> whenever available over the <code>author</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add an application service to Gitter to bridge traffic in &amp; out of Matrix: <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2041/diffs">https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2041/diffs</a>
<ul>
<li>This &quot;application service&quot; comes pre-packaged for you in many cases, so for example you can simply drop in a library like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> in a Node.js application, and all of the Matrix talking complexity is handled for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Polish it!</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, Eric (lead Gitter dev) laid out the waypoints of the full journey:</p>
<ol>
<li>First big step was to add the concept of virtual users to Gitter. We could also have created a new Gitter user for every new matrix ID that appears, but tagging them as virtual users is a bit cleaner.</li>
<li>Figuring out how to balance the Matrix traffic coming into/out of Gitter.
<ol>
<li>Spreading the inbound load comes for free via our existing load-balancer setup (ELB) where we already have 8 webapp servers running the various services of gitter.im. We just run the Matrix bridge on those servers alongside each web and api process, and then the load-balancer’s <code>matrix.gitter.im</code> spreads out to the servers.</li>
<li>Events from Matrix then hit the load balancer and reach one of the servers (no duplication when processing events).</li>
<li>If something on Gitter happens, the action occurs on one server and we just propagate it over to Matrix (no duplication or locking needed).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>We have realtime websockets and Faye subscriptions already in the app which are backed by Mongoose database hooks whenever something changes. We just tapped into the same thing to be able to bridge across new information to Matrix as we receive it on Gitter.</li>
<li>Hooking up the official Matrix bridging <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> library to use Gitter’s existing MongoDB for storage instead of nedb.</li>
<li>Figuring out how to namespace the mxids of the gitter users:
<ol>
<li>It’s nice to have the mxid as human readable as possible instead of just the numerical userId in your service.</li>
<li>But if people can change their username in your service, you can’t change your mxid on Matrix. In the future, we’ll have portable accounts in Matrix to support this (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2787">MSC2787</a>) but sadly these are still vapourware at this point.</li>
<li>If you naively just switch the user’s mxid when they rename their username, then you could end up leaking conversation history between mxids(!)</li>
<li>So we went with <code>@username-userid:gitter.im</code> for the Matrix ID to make it a bit more human readable but also unique so any renames can happen without affecting anything.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For room aliases, we decided to change our <code>community/room</code> URI syntax to underscores for the room aliases, <code>#community_room:gitter.im</code></li>
<li>Figuring out how to bridge features correctly;
<ol>
<li>Emoji - mapping between <code>:shortcode:</code> and unicode emojis</li>
<li>Mapping between Gitter threaded conversations &lt;-&gt; Matrix replies</li>
<li>Mapping between Matrix mentions and Gitter mentions</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Keeping users and room data in sync
<ol>
<li>We haven’t gotten there yet, but the data comes through the same Mongoose hook and we can update the bridged data as they change on the Gitter end.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, the Matrix side of gitter.im is hosted by <a href="https://element.io/matrix-services">Element Matrix Services</a> and is a plain old Synapse, talking through to Gitter via the Application Service API. An alternative architecture would be to have got Gitter directly federating with Matrix by embedding a “homeserver library” into it (e.g. embedding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>). However, given Dendrite is still beta and assumes it is storing its data itself (rather than persisting in an existing backend such as Gitter’s mongodb), we went for the simpler option to start with.</p>
<p>It’s been really interesting to see how this has played out week by week in the Gitter updates in This Week in Matrix: you can literally track the progress and see how the integration came to life between <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/09/this-week-in-matrix-2020-10-09#gitter">Oct 9</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/23/this-week-in-matrix-2020-10-23#gitter">Oct 23</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/06/this-week-in-matrix-2020-11-06#gitter">Nov 6</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/27/this-week-in-matrix-2020-11-27#gitter">Nov 27</a> and finally <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/04/this-week-in-matrix-2020-12-04#gitter">Dec 4</a>.</p>
<p>Huge thanks go to Eric Eastwood, the lead dev of Gitter and mastermind behind the project - and also to Half-Shot and Christian who’ve been providing all the support and review from the Matrix bridging team.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>First and foremost we’re going to be working through the “What remains” section of the list above: killing off the old bridge, sorting out plumbed rooms, hooking up DMs, importing old Gitter history into Matrix, etc. This should then give us an exceptionally low impedance link between Gitter &amp; Matrix.</p>
<p>Then, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/30/welcoming-gitter-to-matrix">as per our original announcement</a>, the plan is:</p>
<p><em>In the medium/long term, it’s simply not going to be efficient for the combined Element/Gitter team to split our efforts maintaining two high-profile Matrix clients. Our plan is instead to merge Gitter’s features into Element (or next generations of Element) itself and then - if and only if Element has achieved parity with Gitter - we expect to upgrade the deployment on gitter.im to a Gitter-customised version of Element. The inevitable side-effect is that we’ll be adding new features to Element rather than Gitter going forwards.</em></p>
<p>Now, that means implementing some features in Matrix/Element to match...</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant live room peeking (less than a second to load the webapp into a live-view of a massive room with 20K users!!)</li>
<li>Seamless onboarding thanks to using GitLab &amp; GitHub for accounts</li>
<li>Curated hierarchical room directory</li>
<li>Magical creation of rooms on demand for every GitLab and GitHub project ever</li>
<li>GitLab/GitHub activity as a first-class citizen in a room’s side-panel</li>
<li>Excellent search-engine-friendly static content and archives</li>
<li>KaTeX support for Maths communities</li>
<li>Threads!</li>
</ul>
<p>...and this work is in full swing:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a proposal for fast peeking (via lazy-loading state over federation) at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2775/proposals/2775-lazy-loading-over-federation.md">MSC2775</a> and the new peek APIs at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2753/proposals/2753-peeking-via-sync-v2.md">MSC2753</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc2444/proposals/2444-peeking-over-federation-peek-api.md">MSC2444</a> (and even implemented by Dendrite)</li>
<li>Social Login for seamless onboarding via GitLab, GitHub &amp; friends is almost landed in Element: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/5426">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/5426</a></li>
<li>Spaces gives a curated hierarchical room directory: <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/2">https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/2</a></li>
<li>KaTeX support landed in Element Web a few weeks ago thanks to <a href="https://github.com/akissinger">akissinger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thosgood">thosgood</a></li>
<li>Threads are on the horizon, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2836">MSC2836</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only bits which aren’t already progressing yet are tighter GL/GH integration, and better search engine optimised static archives.</p>
<p>So, the plan is to get cracking on the rest of the feature parity, then merge Gitter &amp; Element together - and meanwhile continue getting the rest of the world into Matrix :)</p>
<p>We live in exciting times: open standards-based interoperable communication is on the rise again, and we hope Gitter’s new life in Matrix is the beginning of a new age of cross-project developer collaboration, at last escaping the fragmentation we’ve suffered over the last few years.</p>
<p>Finally, please do give feedback via <a href="https://gitter.im/matrix-org/gitter">Gitter</a> or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-org_gitter:gitter.im">Matrix</a> (or <a href="mailto:matrix@matrix.org">mail</a>!) on the integration and where you’d like to see it go next!</p>
<p>Thanks for flying Matrix and Gitter,</p>
<p>-- The Matrix Team</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.neilalexander.dev">Neil Alexander's Dendrite mxid</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.2">version 0.3.2</a>, which contains some bug fixes. Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Checking if a server is allowed to see an event has been optimised somewhat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to disable federation has been added</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application services are now sent correctly formatted client events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>create-account</code> has been simplified so that you can just point it to your Dendrite config</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/unpeek</code> support has been added (for MSC2753)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event IDs are now calculated far less often in the roomserver, since this is an expensive operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federation sender now caches events in memory to reduce load on the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;since&quot; parameter is now checked more thoroughly in the sync API, which led to a bug that could cause forgotten rooms to reappear (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kaniini">kaniini</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The polylith now proxies signing key requests through the federation sender correctly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for general Dendrite chat or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite-dev:matrix.org">#dendrite-dev:matrix.org</a> for development discussion.</p>

<p>⚠️ The <strong>OpenSSL</strong> project has pre-announced a <a href="https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2020-December/000186.html">high severity issue</a> that will be disclosed on Tuesday. We will be regenerating Docker images and releasing Synapse 1.24.0 and 1.23.1 on Tuesday following that announcement. Note that these releases contain security fixes of their own, and you are encouraged to upgrade.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.24.0rc2/CHANGES.md#synapse-1240rc2-2020-12-04">Synapse 1.24.0rc2</a> is out and includes numerous bug fixes and internal improvements, especially around our OpenID Connect (OIDC) and SAML providers. Of note, the OIDC provider can now re-try generating MXIDs when there's a collision, reaching parity with the SAML provider.</p>
<p>We've been talking about <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</a> for a few weeks, but the end is in sight: the PR is reviewed and the tests pass, so we're on track for including it in 1.25.0!  We're also on the cusp of a finishing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8868">a new algorithm</a> for calculating the auth chain difference in <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/implementing-stateres">State Resolution v2</a>, which should significantly reduce worst case performance.</p>
<p>Lastly, the deprecated <code>/_matrix/client/*/admin</code> Admin API endpoints <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8785">have been removed</a>. If you have tools which target these endpoints, please update them to use the <code>/_synapse/admin</code> URL prefix instead.</p>

<p>We've soft-launched the new bridge to all public Gitter rooms! You can now find any public room on Gitter checking out the room directory for <code>gitter.im</code> or directly by replacing the forward slash in the URI part of the Gitter room with an underscore and joining <code>#*:gitter.im</code>(replace the *). If you come across any bugs, feel free check the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=matrix">list of known problems and create an issue</a>. There will be a full announcement next week so stay tuned!</p>
<p>We've also added a few more features this week and now transform <code>:emoji:</code> syntax from Gitter to Unicode so they're compatible in Matrix, propagate the room topic/description, and some bug fixes around threaded conversations and replies. You can track our full progress from the <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitterHQ/-/epics/10">GitLab epic for the native Gitter-Matrix bridge</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>This was actually just the beginning, the ground work needed to lay the foundations for A Better Future. We already have <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;state=opened">a bunch of other merge requests</a> to continue down that path. Hopefully there shouldn’t be such large ones in the (near) future. So what’s next? The work that landed this week was a switch to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/">the SDK</a> for almost all endpoint queries. Now need to handle the syncs with it. Later on, we will use it to handle storage, and then enable E2EE as well, but that will take quite some time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Big progress from Fractal here! Will be good to hear more from the Fractal club to see what the ETA is for storage and E2EE.</p>
<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I've actually not had much time to work on Nheko, I did at least fix most of the UTD (Unable to decrypt) issues, when sending encrypted messages. This has been a long standing annoyance, but it should now finally not be an issue anymore (well... at least it should not be caused by Nheko as often anymore)! With this there are only a few tickets left to finally bring E2EE out of beta in Nheko (SSSS and bootstrapping cross-signing, as well as a general review for potential issues).</p>
<p>And while I have actually not been doing much work, we actually had more Pull Requests (and merged them too) this week than I have ever seen before in Nheko! Thank you very much to everyone who contributed. A short summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now uses the Nheko icon from your system theme, if available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can finally look at avatars in their full resolution!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Megolm sessions are now lazily loaded from disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The registration page now also has nice inline error messages, hinting at why a specific input is unacceptable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updates to the russian translation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The README now lists all required GStreamer plugins for voice and video calls.</p>

<p>It feels super great, when you have so many people contributing, I love it! &lt;3</p>

<p>On behalf of the Americans on the Synapse team: Happy Thanksgiving! This past week saw us land some improvements to the OpenID Connect SSO provider, bringing it closer to parity with the SAML provider. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8801">#8801</a> made it possible to gracefully handle username collisions when creating a new account over SSO.</p>
<p>We've also merged a pull request (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8785/">#8785</a>) from @dklimpel which removes deprecated paths for the Synapse Admin APIs. As of the next Synapse release, all Admin APIs will be accessibly only under the <code>/_synapse/admin/v1</code> path prefix.</p>
<p>Otherwise, much of our time has been spent on getting pull requests like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6739">#6739</a>, implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</a>, ready to merge. It's coming to a Synapse release soon!</p>
<p>Speaking of releases, we're looking forward to cutting a first release candidate of 1.24.0 early next week; keep your eyes peeled for that!</p>
<p>I'd be remiss in not mentioning that we started the week by <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/23/synapse-disclosing-cve-2020-26890">disclosing CVE-2020-26890</a>, which is a denial of service affecting Synapse versions prior to 1.20.0. If you've not upgraded, <em>please</em> do.</p>

<p>Lots of features added this week including Gitter threaded conversations and Matrix reply bridging, image/file uploads, transforming mentions so notifications flow, and better looking flairs!</p>
<p>Not everything is available on production yet but you can try out the bridge for yourself at <a href="https://gitter.im/gitter/testing-matrix-bridge">https://gitter.im/gitter/testing-matrix-bridge</a>: #5faa0809d73408ce4ff3ad8e:gitter.im</p>
<p>We'll be working through some of the bridge oddities and hoping to open up the bridge to all public rooms on Gitter soon. You can track our full progress from the <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitterHQ/-/epics/10">GitLab epic for the native Gitter-Matrix bridge</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/innereq/mx-puppet-vk">MX-Puppet-VK</a> bridge for <a href="https://vk.com/">VK (Vkontakte)</a> social network via <a href="https://github.com/innereq/mx-puppet-vk/commit/73042f8e93843e555408ad509921339d00e39dcc">this commit</a> have added initial support for User tokens. This means that we now can use it for puppeting the real user account, to automatically bridge all &quot;VK Messenger&quot; private dialogs and groups into Matrix. Previously bridge worked only with VK community tokens as bot, to bridge only conversation with specific communities.</p>
<p>To get the <code>VK User token</code> without registering new app (<a href="https://vk.com/dev/messages_api">and waiting approve from admins</a>), users can reuse the &quot;<a href="https://vk.com/kate_mobile">Kate Mobile</a>&quot; app token (or other app, that have access to <a href="https://vk.com/dev/messages">Messages API</a>) and receive it via <a href="https://vkhost.github.io/">https://vkhost.github.io/</a> service.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/benkuly/matrix-sms-bridge">matrix-sms-bridge</a> can finally be used with an Android smartphone as SMS-Gateway instead of gammu and a modem. @rebekka:imbitbu.de developed the app <a href="https://github.com/RebekkaMa/android-sms-gateway-server">android-sms-gateway-server</a>, that the bridge uses to send and receive sms messages. The new bridge version is used in combination with the app in production (medical care centre) for a week now. We have a throughput of 50-100 SMS message a day. The update is also integrated in <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>.</p>

<p>The new completer is now on master. Please try it out and report any issues you may find. It now actually inserts a user link, keeps a per room message history and should look quite a bit nicer and be faster,  when completing emojis or user names.</p>
<p>There were also quite a few cleanups, most of them done by Kirillpt! Some spacing here and there, saturation changes, the login page should now be less confusing, when you don't enter a valid mxid and toggles should now not get stuck in confusing intermediate states. There is also a russian translation now and some VOIP fixes. Pretty busy week, but I like it!</p>

<p>We released Synapse 1.23.0 on Wednesday! Read all about it on the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/18/synapse-1-23-0-released">Matrix Blog</a>. Otherwise, we'd like to highlight a few developments over the past week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We're discussing a policy for ending support for old versions of Python and PostgreSQL. If you have opinions, please <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8782">let us know on GitHub</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our initial implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</a> is undergoing review, and will likely land soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've been looking at ways to improve the efficiency of state resolution, and Erik has managed to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622#issuecomment-729620021">devise some algorithmic improvements</a> that yield an order of magnitude speedup for a handful of pathologic cases. We hope to have a better idea of how this might work for real world workloads soon.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, we'd like to take this opportunity to remind you to <strong>please regularly upgrade your Synapse.</strong> Especially if you're not yet on 1.20.0, as we'll be disclosing a denial of service issue which affects older versions on Monday.</p>

<p>mewmew wanted to use my fork of Synapse, so I made the changes there configurable (instead of hardcoding to my user ID) and even added a readme to list the features. It might also be useful for other people who want custom room IDs and other fun stuff.</p>

<p>For Synapse admins, this release support generating structured logs via the standard logging configuration (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8607">#8607</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8685">#8685</a>). This may require changing your synapse configuration; see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.23.0rc1/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1230">upgrade notes</a> for more information.</p>
<p>We've also added many new Admin APIs, contributed by <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">@dklimpel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add API to get information about uploaded media (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8647">#8647</a>)</li>
<li>Add API for local user media statistics (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8700">#8700</a>)</li>
<li>Make it possible to delete files that were not used for a defined time (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8519">#8519</a>)</li>
<li>Split API for reported events into detail and list endpoints. This is a breaking change to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8217">#8217</a> which was introduced in Synapse v1.21.0. Those who already use this API should check their scripts (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8539">#8539</a>) </li>
<li>Allow server admins to list users' notification pushers (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8610">#8610</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8689">#8689</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, Synapse 1.23.0 addresses some significant bugs, including regressions in the SQLite-to-PostgreSQL database porting script (<a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8729">#8729</a>, <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8730">#8730</a>, <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8755">#8755</a>) and an issue which could prevent Synapse from recovering after losing its connection to its database (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8726">#8726</a>). Synapse will also reject ACL modifications from clients which would otherwise cause a server to ban itself from a room (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8708">#8708</a>).</p>
<p>Installation instructions are available <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md">on GitHub</a>, as is the <code>v1.23.0</code> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0">release tag</a>.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/chagai95">@chagai95</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">@dklimpel</a>.</p>
<p>The full changelog for 1.23.0 is as follows:</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Heads up that we just cut another beta release of Dendrite - now at 0.3.0!</p>
<p>This is a really fun release given almost all the changes are contributed from
the wider community - so huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/MayeulC">MayeulC</a> and <a href="https://github.com/felix">felix</a>!</p>
<p>The main new feature is full Read Receipt support thanks to S7evinK, which
makes an enormous perceptual improvement when using Dendrite - so especial
thanks are due there :)</p>
<p>So, if you're interested in helping us test, please spin up a copy from
https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite and let us know how it goes - and if you're
already running one, now is an excellent time to upgrade!</p>

<p>This marks the start of Season 6 of Matrix Live (S06E01), a decision M+A apparently made on the fly just now. Incrementing a mostly-arbitrary counter... Imagine wielding that kind of raw power!</p>

<h3 id="analysis-of-the-matrix-event-graph-replicated-data-type">Analysis of the Matrix Event Graph Replicated Data Type</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@florian:dsn.tm.kit.edu">Florian</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fresh off the arXiv presses comes our</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06488">“Analysis of the Matrix Event Graph Replicated Data Type”</a> preprint!
This time, it is a deep dive into the data structure properties of the event graph:</p>
<p>What type of consistency guarantees does it provide,
how many of the other homeservers you share a room with can be faulty or malicious without violating those guarantees (short answer: all of them!),</p>
<p>and how is it possible that a frayed-out event graph ever laces back to just a few current events,
while there is a probability larger than zero for growth to arbitrarily high limits?</p>
<p>To shed light on those questions, we had a great cooperation between my <a href="https://dsn.tm.kit.edu/">Decentralized Systems and Network Services
Research Group</a> and <a href="https://www.math.kit.edu/stoch/~henze/">Prof. Dr. Norbert Henze from the Institute of Stochastics</a>.</p>
<p>While we are still in search of the right venue for peer-reviewed publication,
we went for a preprint this time to share our results with the scientific and the Matrix community in a timely manner.</p>

<p>In this figure, k is the number of participating servers, U_n is the current width of the event graph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, with a current width of U_n = 1000 events and k = 200 servers,
we can expect that the width goes below E(U_{n+1}) &lt; 600 events in just one step.*</p>

<h4 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h4>
<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2744">MSC2744</a> has entered FCP. As such we're switching it out for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2844">MSC2844</a>, which aims to define a global versioning system for all spec documents. Note that MSC2844 does not currently have FCP proposed. Its purpose for being in the focus this time around is for asking the team whether ideas proposed are plausible.</p>
<p>Thus this week's focus is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1544">MSC1544</a> (QR Code verification), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2790">MSC2790</a> (modal widgets) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2844">MSC2844</a> (global versioning).</p>
<p>We've also started making use of a Github board to track the state of an MSC through the currently somewhat ambiguous process of putting up an MSC that is ready for review to starting FCP. You can find the board here: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/31">SCT Backlog</a>.</p>
<p>Some explanation of the columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Awaiting SCT Input - These are MSCs that are deemed reviewable by the MSC author, and require review by a subsection of the Spec Core Team (usually one or two people) that are most familiar with the scope of Matrix that the MSC is relevant to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ready for FCP ticks - At least one individual from the Spec Core Team has signed off on the MSC. It is not time for others to give a cursory review - mainly sanity checking from the perspective of the part of Matrix that they work on. Note that fundamental flaws may still be found in this stage, requiring the MSC to be reworked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In FCP - The MSC is in Final Comment Period, where everyone has a last chance to get their ideas in. This happens after most of the Spec Core Team have given their ticks from the previous column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Done - These MSCs no longer need immediate attention by some portion of the Spec Core Team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These definitions are all flexible as we continue to see what works for the limited resources we have available for review.</p>
<p>Do not be alarmed if a particular MSC is not on this board, we're placing things on here as deemed necessary, and more will certainly be added in time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We are aware of a trivially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in versions of Synapse prior to 1.20.0. Complete details will be disclosed on Monday, November 23rd. If you have not upgraded recently, please do so.</p>
<p>Happy RC day! The first release candidate of Synapse 1.23 is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0rc1">now available</a>. For Synapse admins, we've added numerous new APIs thanks to contributions by <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">@dklimpel</a>, and we now support generating <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.23.0rc1/docs/structured_logging.md">structured logs</a> in a standard manner. The <code>structured</code> and <code>drains</code> logging options are now deprecated in Synapse's configuration.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0rc1">Synapse 1.23.0rc1</a> also includes several significant bugfixes, especially around regressions in the SQLite-to-PostgreSQL database porting script, as well a fix to an issue that would prevent Synapse from recovering after losing its connection to the database. Synapse will also now reject modifications to access control lists which would otherwise result in a server blocking itself from a room. This is a particularly interesting case of unintended consequences in protocol design, and we hope to write more about it soon.</p>
<p>Next week should see the full release of 1.23, followed by a first implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403"><em>MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</em></a> landing in the development branch for 1.24.

<p>Hello TWIM! From this week on we're changing how we're reporting updates on the Element clients. Each week, we'll include a section for cross-platform feature work the Element team is working on, and some sections for platform specific work too.</p>
<p><strong>Spaces (previously known as Communities)</strong></p>
<p>Communities are back! They've been renamed to Spaces, and on the Element team we've been busy exploring user experience and critical thinking for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a>, to allow users to organise rooms into useful groups.</p>
<p><strong>Social Login</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to reduce friction in authentication, we've been R&amp;Ding how to allow homeservers &amp; Matrix clients to support multiple SSO providers.. Most of the work so far is captured in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2858">MSC2858</a> and we're starting initial implementations in Element web next week.</p>
<p><strong>VoIP: Voice &amp; Video Calls</strong></p>
<p>We've started foundational research, design and engineering to improve both the usability and stability of native matrix VoIP in Element. We've also started to look at how we can improve the continuity of the user experience between native Matrix calls and our current implementation of Jitsi.</p>
<p><strong>Usability</strong></p>
<p>We've been focusing on improving post-registration actions all round to make Element provide better prompts for first actions, and empty states for views on all platforms, with a multitude of fixes having landed on Element Web, iOS &amp; Android in the last week. We've also started paid user testing to better understand specific pain points in the first time user experience, which we're looking to improve significantly in the coming weeks. </p>
<p><strong>Web platform</strong></p>
<p>v1.7.13 is now live! Which includes a bunch of fixes &amp; improvements on VoIP.</p>
<p><strong>Android platform</strong></p>
<p>v1.0.10 is now available on the Play Store. We're also doing ongoing work to catch up with feature parity to Element Web, and <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">Dominaezzz</a> is migrating SDK APIs to suspend functions: no more MatrixCallback!</p>
<p><strong>iOS platform</strong></p>
<p>v1.1.0 is soon to be live on TestFlight for beta testers, and we'll soon be turning our attention to fixing end-to-end encryption regressions.</p>

<p>A new release integrates an embedded h2 database into <a href="https://github.com/benkuly/matrix-spring-boot-sdk">matrix-spring-boot-bot</a>, which makes it a lot easier to write bots with persistency. You only need a few lines of code to write simple bots (<a href="https://github.com/benkuly/matrix-spring-boot-sdk/blob/master/matrix-spring-boot-bot-examples/ping-bot/src/main/kotlin/net/folivo/matrix/bot/examples/pingappservice/PingHandler.kt">e. g. a ping bot</a>). I also changed a lot under the hood (e. g. using type-safe Matrix-Id-classes instead of Strings).</p>
<h4 id="matrix-sms-bridge">matrix-sms-bridge</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/benkuly/matrix-sms-bridge">matrix-sms-bridge</a> now uses the h2 database from <a href="https://github.com/benkuly/matrix-spring-boot-sdk">matrix-spring-boot-bot</a> instead of neo4j, which makes it a lot more stable and fixes some bugs. We are using it in production with hundreds of target telephone numbers without problems. I also added an optional feature to use room aliases (e. g. #sms_4901234567:homeserver) to prevent multiple rooms with one target telephone number (which is still possible).</p>
<p>In a few weeks you can use this bridge with an old Android-Smartphone, which acts as an sms gateway with rest api.</p>

<p>Hello Matrix friends. I've been asked to share this here. I'm currently building a platform for building communities. I'm focused on deeper matrix integration with communities, private messaging built on top of matrix, and custom domain support. Feel free to check out <a href="https://gurlic.com">https://gurlic.com</a>. The matrix community is at <a href="https://gurlic.com/matrix">https://gurlic.com/matrix</a>, but I haven't had the time to post much. </p>
<p>We have communities (https://gurlic.com/space -&gt; <a href="https://gurlic.space">https://gurlic.space</a>)</p>
<p>We have galleries (https://gurlic.com/art -&gt; <a href="https://gurlic.art">https://gurlic.art</a>)
We have publications (https://gurlic.com/classics -&gt; <a href="https://classics.wtf">https://classics.wtf</a>)</p>
<p>We have user pages (https://gurlic.com/bob -&gt; https://bob.monster)</p>
<p>The UI is a little confusing now because we have longform articles (https://gurlic.com/homer/the-iliad-book-ii) and short social media posts (https://gurlic.com/privacy/post/324848317844422661).</p>
<p>I pretty much want all resources to have custom domain support, and matrix rooms for all communities, and nested communities. In the near future, I hope to have matrix servers for custom domains too. And of course, the source will also be open if folks want to host.</p>
<p>Right now, users on gurlic get a matrix account, and communities/galleries/publications get a room too, but i'm hoping to take some time to look at much deeper integration. Dendrite and hydrogen are great to build on top off...</p>

<p>Happy November from the Synapse team! As mentioned last week, we pushed a small <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.1">v1.22.1 release</a> last Friday which fixed two regressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug where an appservice may not be forwarded events for a room it was recently invited to. Broke in v1.22.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8676">#8676</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <code>Object of type frozendict is not JSON serializable</code> exceptions when using third-party event rules. Broke in v1.22.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8678">#8678</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't upgraded your Synapse in a while, <em>please do.</em></p>
<p>A major focus of Synapse is being able to meet the performance and reliability needs of massive homeservers like <code>matrix.org</code>. If you're curious about how Synapse's architecture has evolved over the years to meet these scaling challenges, check our our blog post from Tuesday: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/03/how-we-fixed-synapses-scalability">How we fixed Synapse's scalability!</a></p>
<p>Lastly, we anticipate releasing 1.23.0 in the next fortnight; keep your eyes peeled for release candidates and let us know if you have any feedback. For a preview of what's coming, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/compare/v1.22.1...develop">check out GitHub</a> for the new commits that have landed on the <code>develop</code> branch since our last release.</p>

<p>Not as yet, though a few people have reached out to me already and are building on top of it. I started it as a way to get going with Matrix dev and as a fun side project. That being said, I think providing the tools to Matrix-enable Elixir apps might lead to some interesting things.
If anyone has any precise ideas on how they would want to integrate their Elixir apps with Matrix, I'd be super happy to have a chat 👍️
Less precise ideas are also welcome, of course 🙂</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We had a major break-through in Synapse 1.22 which we want to talk about in
more detail: <strong>Synapse now scales horizontally across multiple python
processes.</strong></p>
<p>Horizontal scaling means that you can support more users and traffic by adding
in more python processes (spread over more machines, if necessary) without
there being a single bottleneck which all the traffic is passing through - as
opposed to vertical scaling where you make things go faster overall by making
the bottleneck go faster.</p>
<p>After many years of having to vertically scale Synapse (by trying to make the
main process go faster) we’re now finally at the point where you can configure
Synapse so that <strong>messages no longer flow through the main process</strong> -
eliminating the bottleneck entirely.  What’s more, the Matrix.org homeserver
has now been successfully running in this config and enjoying the massive
scalability improvements for the last 2 weeks! Huge kudos goes to Erik and the
wider Synapse team for pulling this off.</p>
<p>Some readers might wonder how this ties in with <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">Dendrite entering
beta</a>, given one
of Dendrite’s design goals is full horizontal scalability.  The answer is that
we’re very much using Dendrite for experimentation and next-gen stuff at the
moment (currently focused more on scaling downwards for P2P rather than
scaling upwards for megaservers) - while Synapse is the stable and long-term
supported option.</p>
<p>So, that’s the context - now over to Erik with more than you could possibly
ever want to know about how we actually did it...</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Synapse started life off back in 2014 as a single monolithic python process,
and for quite a while we made it scale by adding more and more in-memory
caches to speed things up by avoiding hitting the database (at the expense of
RAM).  It looked like this:</p>
<div style="margin: auto; max-width: 640px;">
    <img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse1.png"/>
</div>
<p>Eventually the caches stopped helping and we needed more than one thread of
execution in order to spread CPU across multiple cores. Python’s Global
Interpreter Lock (<a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">GIL</a>)
means that Python can mainly only use one CPU core at a time, so starting more
threads doesn’t help with scalability - you have to run multiple processes.</p>
<p>Now, the vast majority of the work that Synapse does is related to “streams”.
These are append only sequences of rows, such as the events stream, typing
stream, receipts stream, etc. When a new event arrives (for example) we write
it to the events stream, and then notify anything waiting that there has been
an update. The <code>/sync</code> endpoint, for instance, will wait for updates to streams
and send them down to long-polling Matrix clients. </p>
<p>Streams support being added to concurrently, so have a concept of the
“persisted up-to position”. This is the point where <strong>all</strong> rows before that
point have finished persisting. Readers only read up to the current “persisted
up-to position”, so that they don’t skip updates that haven’t finished
persisting at that point. (E.g. if two events A and B get assigned positions 5
and 6, but B finishes persisting first, then the persisted up to position will
remain at 4 until A finishes persisting and then it jumps to 6).</p>
<p>To split any meaningful amount of work into separate processes, we need to add
a mechanism where processes can be told that updates to streams have happened
(otherwise they’d have to repeatedly poll the DB, which would be deeply
inefficient). The architecture ended up being one where we had the “main”
process that streams updates via a custom replication protocol (initially
long-polling HTTP; later custom TCP) to any number of “worker” processes. This
meant that we could move sync stream handling (and other read apis) off the
main process and onto workers, but also that all database writes had to go
through the single main process (as it was a star topology, the main process
could talk to all workers but workers could only talk to the main process and
not each other).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse2.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse2.png" /></p>
<p>As an aside: cache invalidations also had to be streamed down the replication
connections, which has the side effect that we could only cache things that
would only be invalidated on the main process.</p>
<p>We continued to move more and more read APIs out onto separate workers. We
also added workers in front of the main process that would e.g. handle the
creation of the new events, authenticating, etc, and then call out to the main
process with the event for it to persist the event.</p>
<h2 id="moving-writes-off-the-main-process">Moving writes off the main process</h2>
<p>Eventually we ran out of stuff to move out of the main process that didn’t
involve writing to the DB. To write stuff from other processes we needed a way
for the workers to stream updates to each other. The easiest and most obvious
way was to just use Redis and its pub/sub support. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse3.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse3.png" /></p>
<p>This almost allowed us to move writing of a particular stream to a different
worker, <em>except</em> writing to streams generally also meant invalidating caches
which in itself requires writing to a stream. We needed a way of writing to
the cache invalidation stream from multiple workers at once.</p>
<p>Sharding the cache invalidation thankfully turned out to be easy, as workers
would simply call the cache invalidation function whenever they get an
invalidation notice over replication. In particular, the ordering of
invalidations from different workers doesn’t matter and so there isn’t a need
to calculate a single “persisted up-to position”. Sharding then just becomes a
case of adding the name of the worker that is writing the update to the
replication stream, and then workers reading from it can basically treat the
cache stream the same as if they were multiple streams, one per worker.</p>
<p>This then unlocks the ability to move writing of streams off the main process
and onto different workers - and so we added the “event persister” worker for
offloading the main event stream off the main process:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse4.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse4.png" /></p>
<h2 id="sharding-the-events-stream">Sharding the events stream</h2>
<p>Eventually the worker responsible for doing nothing but persisting events
started maxing out CPU. This meant that we had to look at sharding the events
stream, i.e. writing to it from multiple workers.</p>
<p>This is more complicated than sharding the cache invalidation stream as the
ordering of the events does matter; we send them down sync streams, in order,
with a token that indicates where the sync stream is up to in the events
stream. This means that workers need to be able to calculate a “persisted
up-to position” when getting updates from different workers. </p>
<p>The easiest way of doing that is to simply set the persisted up-to position as
the minimum position received over federation from all active writers. This
works, except events would only be processed after all other writers have
subsequently written events (to advance the persisted position past the point
at which the event was written), which can add a lot of latency depending on
how often events are written. </p>
<p>A refinement is to note that if you have a persisted up-to position of 10,
then receive updates at sequential positions 11, 12, 13 and 14, you know that
everything between 10 and 14 has finished persisting (as you received updates
about them), and so can set the persisted up-to position to 14. Annoyingly,
it’s not required that positions are sequential without gaps (due to various
technical considerations), and so in the worst case this still has the same
problems as the naïve solution.</p>
<p>To avoid these problems we change the persisted up-to position to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock">vector
clock</a> of positions; tracking a
vector of positions - one per writer. This still allows answering the query of
“get all events after token X” (as events are written with the position and
the name of the writer). The persisted up-to position is then calculated by
just tracking the last position seen to arrive over replication from each
writer. </p>
<p>This allows writing events from multiple workers, while ensuring that other
workers can correctly keep track of a “persisted up-to position”. Then it's
just a matter of inspecting the code to ensure that it does not assume that it
is the only writer to the stream. In the case of writing to the events stream,
we note that the function persisting events assumes it's the only writer for a
given room, so when sharding we have to ensure that there are no concurrent
writes to the same room. This is most easily done by sharding based on room
ID, and ensuring that the mapping of room ID to worker does not change
(without coordination).</p>
<p>The only thing left is to then encode the vector clock position into the sync
tokens. We want to ensure that these tokens are not too long, as they get
included as query string parameters (e.g. the <code>since=</code> parameter of <code>/sync</code>).
By assigning persistent unique integer IDs to workers the vector clock can be
persisted as a sequence of pairs of integers, which is relatively few bytes so
long as we don’t have too many workers writing to the events stream. We can
further reduce the size of the tokens by calculating an integer “persisted
up-to position” as we did before, encoding that and only including positions
for workers that are larger than the integer persisted upto position. (The
idea here is that most of the time only a small number of workers will be
ahead of the calculated persisted up-to position, and so we only need to
encode those).</p>
<p>And this is what we have today:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse5.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse5.png" /></p>
<p>The major limitation of the current situation is that you can’t dynamically
add/remove workers which persist events, as the sharding by room ID is
calculated at startup, and so changing it requires restarting the whole
system. This could be replaced by any system that allowed coordination over
which persister is allowed to write to a room at any given point. However this
is likely tricky to get right in practice, but would allow dynamic auto
scaling of deployments, or automatically recovering from a worker that gets
wedged/dies.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that sharding event persisters isn’t the only
performance work that’s been going on - switching everything over to python 3
and async twisted has helped, along with lots of smaller optimisations on the
hot paths, and further rebalancing workers (e.g. moving background jobs off
the master process to dedicated workers).  We’ve also benefited a lot from the
maintainability of rolling out mypy typing throughout the codebase.  And next
up, we’ll be going back to speeding up the codebase as a whole - starting with
algorithmic state resolution improvements! 🎉</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>So, how does it stack up?</p>
<p>Here’s the send time heatmap on Matrix.org showing the step change on Oct 16th
when we rolled out the second event persister (full disclosure: this also
coincides with moving background processes off the main Synapse process to a
background worker).  As you can see, we go from messages being spread over a
huge range of durations (up to several seconds) to the sweet spot being 50ms
or less - a spectacular improvement!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, here’s the actual CPU utilisation as we split the traffic from a
single event persister (yellow) to two persisters (one yellow, one blue),
showing the sharding beautifully horizontally balancing CPU between the two
active/active worker processes:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse-cpu.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse-cpu.png" /></p>
<p>We’ve yet to loadtest to see just how fast we can go now (before we start
hitting bottlenecks on the postgres cluster), but it sure feels good to have
all our CPU headroom back on Matrix.org again, ready for the next wave of
users to arrive.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>So there you have it: folks running massive homeservers (50K+ concurrent
users) like Matrix.org (and <em>cough</em> various high profile public sector
deployments) are no longer held hostage by the bottleneck of the main synapse
process and should feel free to experiment with setting up event persister
workers to handle high traffic loads.  Otherwise, if you can spread your users
over smaller servers, that’s also a good bet (assuming they don’t have
massively overlapping room membership, like we see on Matrix.org.)</p>
<p>The current <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/workers.md">worker
documentation</a>
is up-to-date, although does assume you are already very familiar with how to
administer Synapse.  It’s also very much subject to change, as we keep adding
new workers and improving the architecture.  However, now is a pretty good
time to get involved if you’re interested in large-scale Matrix deployments.</p>
