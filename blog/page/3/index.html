<p>We brought over all of the historical Gitter content to the <code>gitter.im</code> homeserver and gave everyone free rein over it via <a href="https://app.gitter.im/">app.gitter.im</a>, a Gitter branded Element instance.</p>
<p>Of course, since it's Matrix, you can use whatever client you want to access your public, private and one to one (now DM) conversations!</p>

<h2 id="ietf-mimi-dma">IETF/MIMI/DMA</h2>
<p>With the Extensible Events Core (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) being accepted last week, the focus now turns to all the other extensible event MSCs for images, files, etc. How does extensible events relate to IETF/MIMI/DMA, you ask? In our mission for having Matrix be the standard for interoperability, we need a content format that works for everyone. Events prior to MSC1767 <em>could</em> work with enough effort, though MSC1767's system makes things <em>a lot</em> easier when representing arbitrarily complex messaging features.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to TWIM for progress in this area. It's a relatively slow process, but we're working through it.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>This week's random MSC is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2785">MSC2785: Event notification attributes and actions</a>! This is effectively a replacement for the push rules system we have today, and a super interesting one (how do you even design a notifications system?). Focus has shifted a little bit since this MSC was first opened, though its ideas still comes up frequently when aiming to make smaller changes to push rules today.</p>

<p>We released another breaking change this week :p bump to v0.17.0</p>
<p>Introduced a couple of new features like upgrading voice calls to video calls, some neat helper functions for group calls. Fixes include cleaning group call state events, fixing the searchEvent function, a way to get own profile from server and then fallback to room profile and also fixes to the /markasdm command.</p>
<p>Complete changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>fix: ability to upgrade audio calls to video calls (td)</li>
<li>chore: add a fetchOwnProfileFromServer method which tries to get ownProfile from server first, disk then (td)</li>
<li>fix: clean expired member state events in group calls (td)</li>
<li>fix: hasActiveGroup call now checks all group calls (td)</li>
<li>fix: Check if argument is valid mxid in /maskasdm command (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>fix: Fake User object (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>fix: Request key in searchEvent method crashes because of wrong preconditions (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>refactor: Check config at file sending after placing fake event and add error handling (Krille)</li>
<li>chore: bump dart to 2.18 (Nicolas Werner)</li>
<li>fix: setMicrophoneMuted is now async to match setVideoMuted (td)</li>
<li>fix: implement activeGroupCallEvents to get all active group call state events in a room (td)</li>
<li>refactor: (BREAKING CHANGE) move staleCallChecker and expires_Ts stuff to an extension on Room, instead of Voip because it makes much more sense per room rather than on voip, also makes testing easier (td)</li>
<li>fix: populate local groupCalls list on instantiating VOIP() (td)</li>
<li>fix: starting stale call checker is now handled by the sdk itself because clients can forget to do so (td)</li>

<h3 id="ruma-website">Ruma (<a href="https://www.ruma.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>A set of Rust library crates for working with the Matrix protocol. Ruma’s approach to Matrix emphasizes correctness, security, stability and performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net">Kévin Commaille</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been a while since our last update in November, but it just means we have been busier than ever! A lot has happened to follow changes in the Matrix specification as well as fixing bugs in our codebase or making our API easier to use.</p>
<p>We have released Ruma 0.8.0 and 0.8.1 at the beginning of the month. It was long overdue with a lot of improvements, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stabilized support for all the changes and features of Matrix 1.4 and Matrix 1.5</li>
<li>Making our request types use owned instead of borrowed data</li>
<li>Replacing <code>ruma_api!</code> with more flexible macros</li>
<li>Fixing the serialization and deserialization of redacted events</li>
<li>Reorganizing our <code>*EventContent</code> traits to allow event content types to only implement what is really needed</li>
<li>Removing sensitive data from the <code>Debug</code>-format representation of our types </li>
</ul>
<p>And on the 15th we released Ruma 0.8.2 with a few bug fixes but also stabilized support for all the changes and features of Matrix 1.6!</p>
<p>Although it might be less visible in our changelogs, we also regularly add support for MSCs, and try to keep our implementations up-to-date. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sliding sync (MSC3575 and others, currently used by Element X via the matrix-rust-sdk)</li>
<li>Extensible events (MSC1767 and others)</li>
<li>Push rule condition for room version features (MSC3931 and MSC3932)</li>

<p>We also have a bunch of issues opened if you feel like contributing, so come say hi!</p>

            <p>Greetings Matrix fans! We've published Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.77.0">version 1.77</a>
as the new stable release this week. Synapse admins are encouraged to upgrade
to it at their convenience.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-stuff">The new stuff</h2>
<h3 id="experimental-support-for-intentional-mentions-msc3952">Experimental support for intentional mentions (MSC3952)</h3>
<p>Mentioning other users on Matrix is difficult: it is not possible to know if mentioning a user
by display name or Matrix ID will count as a mention, but is also too easy to mistakenly mention a user.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3952">MSC3952</a> proposes a solution. Its idea is to make the mentioning explicit in the protocol using a dedicated event property,
instead of relying on searching the body of the message as before.</p>
<p>Synapse now implements this as an experimental feature.</p>
<h3 id="experimental-support-to-suppress-notifications-from-message-edits-msc3958">Experimental support to suppress notifications from message edits (MSC3958)</h3>
<p>Have you ever been annoyed by a noisy notification that keep coming back, but you can't pinpoint
where it's coming from?
This is usually because edits to a message where you are mentioned (or that mention <code>@room</code>) will
retrigger a noisy notification. That can be pretty annoying when the message is edited 10 times!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3958">MSC3958</a>
is here to solve that, and Synapse now implements it as an experimental feature.</p>
<h3 id="the-quest-for-speed-continues">The quest for speed continues!</h3>
<p>Some iterative optimizations have been implemented that should make <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14971">joining or leaving</a>
large rooms even faster, and should also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14962">improve sending message</a>.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>See the full <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.77.0">changelog</a>, for a
complete list of changes in the release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our
thanks to everyone who contributed to these releases, including (in no particular
order) icp1994, dklimpel, Fizzadar and realtyem.</p>
<p>We are also grateful to anyone helping us make Synapse better by sharing their
feedback and reporting issues, or helping with community support questions.</p>

            <p>Hey all,</p>
<p><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/">Matrix 1.6</a> is out there! Like Matrix 1.5 <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/11/17/matrix-v-1-5-release">back in November</a>, this release is largely a maintenance update. Matrix 1.1 through 1.4 have been relatively major upgrades, so a little time between features doesn’t feel like a bad idea :)</p>
<p>As with all spec releases, we encourage implementations to gradually update over the next few months rather than have support for everything on release day - please be kind to the projects you use, and help them gain support if able.</p>
<p>Matrix 1.6 sees just 7 MSCs get merged, though this is to be expected from a maintenance release. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPJ9zFV5IE">Matthew’s Matrix 2.0 talk</a> at FOSDEM for an idea of what’s expected over the next few releases.</p>
<p>We’ve covered a couple of the MSCs below, but read on to the full changelog for the full picture.</p>
<h2 id="msc3030-jump-to-date-api">MSC3030: Jump to date API</h2>
<p>_It’s here! The time machine we’ve been waiting for! _</p>
<p>Primarily part of the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Gitter feature parity project</a> (congratulations to the team <a href="https://blog.gitter.im/2023/02/13/gitter-has-fully-migrated-to-matrix/">going all-in on Matrix</a>, by the way) to drive the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive">Matrix Public Archive</a>, the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1roomsroomidtimestamp_to_event">new API</a> gives clients the ability to jump back in time to a nearby event. Being able to find something that was posted on a given day/week, but not being sure of which keywords to look for is a major usability improvement - many thanks to the Gitter team for making Matrix better!</p>
<h2 id="msc3706-faster-joins-part-1">MSC3706: Faster joins (part 1)</h2>
<p><em>Matrix is going voom</em></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/01/31/synapse-1-76-released">Synapse 1.76</a> enabled faster joins by default, and while there’s a lot of Python going into making joins as fast as possible, the specification side is a relatively small change at the moment: <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/server-server-api/#put_matrixfederationv2send_joinroomideventid">just don’t send as many events during joins</a> (<code>omit_members</code>).</p>
<p>There’s potentially more work on the horizon for making faster joins even faster and more robust, and some of that might involve spec work: keep an eye on Synapse releases and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix">TWIM</a> for updates as we make our way to faster joins in Matrix 2.0 :)</p>
<h2 id="the-full-changelog">The full changelog</h2>
<p>MSCs are how the spec changes in the way it does - adding, fixing, and maintaining features for the whole ecosystem to use. Check out the full changelog below, and the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/proposals/">Spec Change Proposals</a> page for more information on how these MSCs got merged (hint: they submitted a proposal, which anyone can do - take a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkZz60RRfc">Matrix Live episode</a> where Matthew covers the proposal process).</p>

<p>In keeping with our (roughly) quarterly release schedule of the Matrix Spec, v1.6 is due to be released on February 14th. That's only four days from now! The headline features are a new Jump-to-Date Client-Server API (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>) and initial work on speeding up room joins (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706">MSC3706</a>), along with many other fixes and clarifications to the spec text itself.</p>
<p>If you haven't yet seen it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPJ9zFV5IE">Matthew's Matrix 2.0 talk</a> at FOSDEM walks through some of the upcoming features in the spec. Each will land in subsequent, future releases of the spec. Once all have landed, we'll call that Matrix 2.0 (in name and in actual version number).</p>
<p>Extensible events is one such upcoming feature. While the core proposal outlining the feature (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) will land in v1.6, the smattering of MSCs which describe how various event types will work under extensible events will span multiple upcoming spec versions. Watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2974">MSC2974: Widgets: Capabilities re-exchange</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC is relatively simple; proposing a method for widgets to ask the client for additional capabilities after it has already been initialised. Doing so allows for increased security and privacy workflows, as the widget need only ask for access to certain pieces of data at the point that it needs it (rather than all up front).</p>
<p>A similar transition of permission granting happened in mobile devices and apps. Initially mobile apps would ask for all permissions they would need up front - which users would blindly accept. These days, mobile OS's have shifted to a model where individual permissions are requested upon attempting to complete an action in an app. This way, users have better context on the reason for the permissions request. (Oddly, browsers have yet to reach this stage with extensions - those still ask for all permissions up front.)</p>
<p>Do check out the proposal and its technical details if widgets are your thing!</p>

<p>The UK Online Safety Bill is shaping up to be a catastrophic piece of legislation, mandating clientside scanning of end-to-end-encrypted communication to attempt to intercept CSAM (child sexual abuse material). By adding the requirement for a scanner which executes ambiguous rulesets to submit encrypted content to the authorities, it would massively undermine the security of encryption: you simply wouldn't be able to trust whether content stays encrypted, or the rules used to scan it and submit it to the authorities. We wrote about it at https://element.io/blog/the-online-safety-bill-an-attack-on-encryption/ to try to sound the alarm before it's too late.</p>

<p>Although having lost a lot of popularity in the last few years, <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> has a great performance and tiny asset size, which means great Matrix support for tiny browsers like on <a href="https://www.kaiostech.com/">KaiOS</a> or for small-size projects and games that wish to use Matrix as a simple back-end.</p>
<p>I hope to release a version v1.0.0 in the near future, but I wanted to share my first breakthrough as I managed to write a simple program that sends message (and state) events in versions that the homeserver supports. See the image below!</p>
<p>Support will mostly be from spec version v1.2 and on, but some legacy endpoints will remain available. You can find the project on <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk">GitHub</a> for now. Hopefully I'll have more to show you in the next few weeks!

<p>Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org">Ivan, the Language Mangler</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in the Rust SDK team is a bit special. We are making our farewells to Ben, as he is leaving Element. He will continue to hang around as its new gig involves Matrix, feel free to take a glance at <a href="https://effektio.org/">Effektio</a>. Once our tears have dried, we carried on with our current main focus: Sliding Sync, and Crypto.
The Sliding Sync client has seen improvements in terms of documentation, along with some clean ups, and stabilisation patches (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1439">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1440">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1449">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1482">4</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1467">5</a>…). The team has decided it's time to write a small testing framework to improve the safety of this code specifically. Indeed, it's quite challenging to test it, and as it's a fundamental piece of the user experience in ElementX and other Matrix clients, there is no debate to have: the quality requirements are high.
The Crypto part now. The Crypto Store has been refactored a little bit (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1477">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1457">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1462">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1465">4</a>…). There is other patches to handle inconsistencies if they happen, and to always mark our own device as verified (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1452">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1456">2</a>).
Apart from that, they have been many work on setting and exposing OpenTelemetry logs for multiple clients and platforms. It will help the teams to coordinate on bugs when they happen.
Finally, a new release of the <code>matrix-sdk-crypto-js</code> has landed: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1444">v0.1.0-alpha.4</a>.
Outside Matrix itself, we have a merge window for <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">the uniffi-async project</a>, along with more contributions to improve errors (<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1468">1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1467">2</a>). It means that the bindings to Swift and Kotlin will soon support native Rust async functions. More contributions are in the pipe to generate documentations for the foreign languages (Swift, Kotlin etc.) directly from Rust documentations.
I will conclude by saying that we were also quite busy preparing the demos for FOSDEM. It was a huge success and it makes us extremely happy :-).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 2017, <a href="https://t2bot.io/">t2bot.io</a> has provided communities on Matrix bots and bridges to use for free, and while there’s no plan to charge for access, the cost of running the service is about $12k USD/year just to exist.</p>
<p>Since August 2020, t2bot.io’s primary source of funding has been from the Matrix.org Foundation, though with the Foundation’s latest focus on raising funds for itself, it feels like the right thing to do is get t2bot.io independently funded.</p>
<p><strong>If you are able, please donate to t2bot.io <a href="https://t2bot.io/donations/">here</a>.</strong> All donations go towards the cost of operation, with any excess (if t2bot.io is so lucky…) going towards hiring developers to work on/build bridges as well as into the Foundation to thank them for keeping t2bot.io online all these years.</p>
<p>Currently, t2bot.io serves <em>86 thousand</em> Discord and Telegram communities, bridging 325 thousand users <em>each month</em>, and <em>11.3 million</em> users since 2017. There’s also 962 thousand rooms with a t2bot.io user in them, leaving only about 94 thousand rooms as archived, across 25 thousand different homeservers.</p>
<p>Operating at this scale requires, well, $12k USD per year: if you’re able, please consider donating. There’s also a question of whether t2bot.io should even be operating at this scale in the first place: Matrix is all about decentralization and owning your own conversations, which naturally means there should be many smaller bridges for communities or even a discord.com-provided bridge for everyone to use. For the time being though, t2bot.io is offered as a convenience and aims to adapt itself as needed to keep providing value.</p>
<p>Questions, concerns, etc are best discussed in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#help:t2bot.io">#help:t2bot.io</a> on Matrix. Nearly every detail of how t2bot.io works is intended to be shared openly, which includes the financial aspect of running the service, so ask away 🙂</p>

<p>Exactly one week ago, a good chunk of the community gathered in Brussels for the <strong>Matrix Community Meetup/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a></strong> in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/fringe/">fringe</a> of FOSDEM.</p>
<p>While we expected the need for everyone to just meet and exchange their ideas, we still wanted to provide a framework for things to get going.
After a &quot;quick&quot; introductory round of everyone presenting themselves and their connection to Matrix, constantly expanding the circle around the table as more people kept pouring through the <a href="https://hsbxl.be/enter">pink gate</a>, we built a timetable of topics from the introduction using the <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-barcamp/tree/nic/env/fosdem-2023">BarCamp Widget</a> developed and slightly modified for the physical BarCamp use case by Nordeck.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/hFUNxEWMiTLgMXRzZzWKfyRt.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Having this way to find people to discuss a topic was a great way to get started, and the discussions quickly took their own directions from there. Highlights included discussions about topics very dear to some people and finding others who are also interested, deep dives into the protocol, brainstorming, or even meeting random strangers on the (notoriously packed) tram to have technical discussions with. A lot of online friends connected, a lot of new friends were made, and even some old friends got to reconnect. It felt very familiar very quickly and leaving Ananace feeling &quot;I've spoken to more friendly and passionate people this last week than I've done for the last six months, that's for certain.&quot; DMs were opened and master keys were cross signed thanks to IRL QR code scanning. Drinks were drunk, Pizza was eaten, and Swedish candy was appreciated to the fullest extent. The scenery only added to the real REAL hackerspace experience, having to <del>make a call</del> ping on Matrix to have someone open the gate to the &quot;desolated courtyard, surrounded by crumbling buildings with broken windows&quot; and a door literally labeled &quot;A&quot;.</p>

<p>We are overjoyed by the incredible response by the community. Most of the people came there for a reason, and that was Matrix. And then they used the time to have some good time together. It was nice that we could help satisfy the huge demand for a get-together in the meat-space with this event.
We look forward to more physical meetups in the future (watch this space!).
Personally I had the best FOSDEM ever, and not just because it was my first one! 😉</p>

            <p>For the past two years, FOSDEM couldn’t happen in-person. Fortunately we could
help, and Matrix hosted the world's largest free &amp; open source software
conference online! This year we were finally back in-person… but not only.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/15/how-we-hosted-fosdem-2021-on-matrix">The set-up we have arranged in 2021</a>
and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/07/hosting-fosdem-2022-on-matrix">polished in 2022</a>
has proved to be robust and served us well during the pandemic. Returning to an
in-person conference didn’t mean we had to throw it all away… quite the
opposite!</p>
<p>This year the OSS community could gather in-person, go see each other’s stands,
and attend all too few of all the fascinating talks the speakers had prepared
for us… but the conference was yet more.. Some of us couldn’t make it in person
but could attend FOSDEM online from its Matrix Space. Devrooms were broadcasted
live into the Matrix rooms where devroom managers and speakers could interact
with the online audience.</p>
<p>In total, thousands of users joined us online, both locally and remotely as 
seen from the FOSDEM homeserver: an amazing audience given the possibility to be
on site.</p>
<p>For us, it was also an opportunity to announce Matrix 2.0 to a live audience!
Matrix 2.0 doesn’t mean we’re making breaking changes in the spec. It’s more of
a nickname we gave to the milestone <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/08/15/the-matrix-summer-special-2022#matrix-20">we had promised in summer to deliver by the
end of the year</a>
and had far too much giving the mother of all demos to a packed room of nearly
1500 people.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-ever-in-person-matrix-devroom">The first ever in-person Matrix devroom</h2>
<p>This year was also the first ever in-person devroom for the Matrix Foundation
and Community. We had many proposals and could have used the whole day, but we
had to share with many other deserving communities. We’re extremely grateful to
FOSDEM organisers for the devroom… and it was a huge success! At many points the
room was completely packed, with no seats left at all.</p>
<p>We could <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/matrix/">shoehorn 8 talks</a> in
the in-person devroom. Picking them was really difficult! When one of the
speakers unfortunately called in sick, the devroom healed the wound and filled
the gap very quickly.</p>
<p>The devroom started with a quick intro to Matrix from Matthew &amp; Amandine.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dPgYy-Y4f7w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Florian followed with a talk about MatrixRTC to explore what Matrix can do
beyond instant messaging</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P--LwIB3deA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Then Matthew did an awesome demo of Third Room and “3D widgets” (user generated
content) that can be embedded into its worlds. Of course with a nice “The Matrix
in Matrix” scene.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nG8qJ4on00Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Stunning 3D worlds are great, but the most popular use case for Matrix today is
instant messaging. And we did a lot as the Matrix Foundation to significantly
improve the performance with Sliding Sync, using matrix-rust-sdk as the showcase
implementation. Kegan and Ben covered Sliding Sync and matrix-rust-sdk
respectively, while Mauro showed us how Element X, the first client to use it,
doesn’t stop here and goes way beyond to provide a snappy, sturdy, polished
client.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5iIs1zWuVOU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Kim and Oliver from Nordeck made an interesting presentation about how widgets
can make Matrix a rich app creation environment.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hhEUe414scU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The Trixnity project then introduced their fast, multi-purpose, well-tested SDK.
A talk you don’t want to miss, particularly if you’re into Kotlin.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zDftIZm-DZ0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Pierre from Technostructures introduced us to <a href="https://technostructures.org/projects/kazarma/">Kazarma</a>
a bridge between Matrix and ActivityPub. In Pierre’s own words: “we talked a lot
about interoperability, and we found it sad that we talked about
interoperability for proprietary platforms, not with alternative decentralised
networks, so we tried doing that”. And they did. Bravo Pierre and the team!</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3olH1aUCkQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Finally Yan concluded the in-person devroom with a speedrun of all the Matrix
projects he could find around. The video is not out yet, so we’ll add it to the
second follow-up blog post: the one with the online devroom conferences!</p>
<h2 id="matrix-for-more-than-remote-attendance">Matrix for more than remote attendance</h2>
<p>FOSDEM staff used the Matrix rooms for on-site support. Whether the camera was
blurry, microphones didn’t work, or there was a missing power plug: staff could
be notified and answer very quickly before sending someone to actually solve the
issue. But it also allowed staff to notify devroom managers for small
adjustments, if speakers ever disappeared from the scene.</p>
<p>Staff also told us Matrix worked much more reliably than anything other than
walkie talkies from a coordination perspective and was more versatile. They
consider narrowing down their use of walkies next year in favour of a deeper
integration with Matrix. We’re excited to see that Matrix was yet again a great
solution in the stressful, high paced context of a conference that gathered
several thousand people in-person and several thousand more online.</p>
<h2 id="attending-in-person">Attending in-person</h2>
<p>Finally, a large part of the joy of attending FOSDEM comes from the people you
meet there. The least we can say is that our stand was busy. We ran out of
stickers and medium size t-shirts early on Sunday morning, but above all we had
plenty of interesting discussions.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/fosdem2023_stand_blurred.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>A few people discovered Matrix during FOSDEM and were blown away by messages
making it from Slack to Discord before their eyes, all thanks to Matrix and
bridges. The overwhelming majority of people who came to us were already happy
users willing to discuss architecture, our plans for the future, or even to
verify each other with QR Codes or emoji.</p>
<p>We want to thank the FOSDEM staff for organising this edition and using Matrix
again: a successful return to the in-person format that builds on the online
experience of the past two years. See you next year folks!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I managed to find some time to commit <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/develop/contrib/lnav"><code>lnav</code> configuration files for Synapse</a> this week. <code>lnav</code> is a log-viewing tool with too many bells and whistles for its own good. I particularly like it because it can interleave multiple log files by timestamp, and highlight log lines based on their severity. If you spend a lot of time looking at logs, these things can lower your blood pressure. Take a look if you think you'd find it useful.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org">Shay</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello TWIM! It's another week and here at Synapse we released
v1.76.0. The big news for this release is that faster joins are now 
enabled by default. It has arrived 🚀! In addition, some other notable 
features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the default room version to v10</li>
<li>Added a <code>set_displayname()</code> method to the module API for setting a user's display name</li>
<li>Implemented support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3890">MSC3890</a>: Remotely silence local notifications</li>
<li>Implemented experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3930">MSC3930</a>: Push rules for (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3381">MSC3381</a>) Polls</li>
<li>Add index to improve performance of the <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> endpoint used for jumping to a specific date in the timeline of a room</li>
</ul>
<p>and much more! You can read all about it <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.76.0">here</a>. Also, please note that the upgrade from 1.75 to 1.76 changes the account data replication streams in a backwards-incompatible manner. Server operators running a multi-worker deployment should consult <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.76/docs/upgrade.md#changes-to-the-account-data-replication-streams">the upgrade notes</a>.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="nheko">Nheko</h1>
<p>We did a lot of work on our markdown input this week. mauke finally fixed those pesky links with a closing parenthesis at the end from dropping that when linkified, without breaking links inside parentheses. Yes, it is still a regex and possibly outlawed in many civilized countries for having detrimental side-effects on society, but it works, so who am I to argue! Additionally we changed the newline behaviour (and fixed a bug related to line-breaks as well). A single line-break now corresponds to a line-break. You can find more about that decision <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@deepbluev7/109771668066978726">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/757">here</a>. You can opt out of that behaviour and other changes we do to the default cmark/commonmark behaviour using the new <code>/cmark</code> command. Speaking of other changes, we now support <code>||warning|spoiler||</code> as a way to enter spoilers, with the warning being optional as well as <code>~~text~~</code> for strike-through.</p>
<p>There is also now a workaround for Wayland users, who were bothered by stuck menus. This still needs to be fixed in Qt eventually, but in the meantime you can now close menus by clicking somewhere inside of Nheko thanks to a contribution by enigma9o7. Decodetalkers also made Nheko clean up notifications on exit and the fullscreen image overlay hide, when the save dialog is open. You can create DMs by pasting an mxid again now. Previously you needed to delete and re-enter the last character... The username completer should also now open around twice as fast and clicking notifications now once again restores Nheko from the tray. The last goodie was contributed by Malte. The invite dialog inside a room can now search for users you have a DM open or the server side userdirectory for suggestions.</p>
<p>Also, I am attending FOSDEM, so let's see if you can find me!

<h1 id="matrix-call-multitrack-recorder">Matrix Call Multitrack recorder</h1>
<p>Resulting from some past discussion of how matrix live may be improved, I did open https://github.com/vector-im/element-call/issues/789 to support multitrack recordings of participants.
However, it turns out this can quite easily be solved using a bot:</p>
<p>Therefor https://git.nordgedanken.dev/mtrnord/matrix-call-multitrack-recorder has been created. This is an early alpha bot using matrix-nio which can participate in both legacy WebRTC matrix native calls and Element-Call style calls.
Its purpose is to record each stream of a user to either a WAV or mp4 file.</p>
<p>However, since this is very early, it should be noted there currently exist some UX issues and some features are missing.</p>

<p>Most profoundly sliding sync has been upgraded to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1399">latest JSON schema with named views</a> giving the team time to test that before shipping it to a wider audience post FOSDEM.

<p>A few years ago, I've written a small bot-api in Rust that used (and still uses) Fractals Matrix-implementation. Since that has been abandoned <em>quite</em> a while ago, I wanted to look into porting my crate to the matrix-rust-sdk. As it turns out, there wouldn't really be any point in doing so. The SDK can be used more or less directly. Which I've learned, by writing a small <a href="https://github.com/msirringhaus/matrix_exif_bot">demo-bot</a>.</p>
<p>This rather simple bot parses the exif-data of pictures that are posted, extracts the GPS-data (if available) and replies with a Matrix location-event for the image location. The plan was to do this with threads, but the SDK sadly doesn't support those. So good old replies it is.
As a bonus, which turned out to be uglier than I thought, it'll also remove it's location-posts automatically, if the corresponding image gets removed.
Configurable autojoin on invite and a command to leave are implemented as well.</p>

            <p>Greetings Matrix fans! We've published Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.76.0">version 1.76</a>
as the new stable release this week. Synapse admins are encouraged to upgrade
to it at their convenience. Please take a look at the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.76/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1760">upgrade notes</a>
for any important information about upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="announcements">Announcements</h2>
<p>The big news is that faster joins for all has arrived! When joining a room for the first time,
Synapse 1.76.0 will request a partial join from the other server by default. Previously, server admins
had to opt-in to this using an experimental config flag.</p>
<p>Server admins can opt out of this feature for the time being by setting</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>experimental:
</span><span>    faster_joins: false
</span></code></pre>
<p>in their server config.</p>
<p>For everyone else, after a faster join Synapse considers that room &quot;partially joined&quot;. In this state, you should be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>read incoming messages (on clients which support lazy-loaded members in /sync);</li>
<li>see incoming state changes, e.g. room topic changes; and</li>
<li>send messages, if the room is unencrypted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Synapse has to spend more effort to complete the join in the background. Once this finishes, you will be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>send messages, if the room is encrypted;</li>
<li>retrieve room history from before your join, if permitted by the room settings; and</li>
<li>access the full list of room members.</li>
</ul>
<p>Practically, this means that the experience of joining a large room over federation should be greatly improved. In past
versions of Synapse, joining a large room such as Matrix HQ over federation could take up to 30 mins. This time has been
cut to ~20-30 seconds to partially join in the new release. Those of you who have been watching this know this has been
a huge undertaking, big shout out to the team for getting it over the line! We're excited the community to try it, as
always if you encounter any problems you are encouraged to file an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=BUG_REPORT.yml">issue</a>.</p>
<h3 id="changes-to-the-account-data-replication-streams">Changes to the account data replication streams</h3>
<p>Please note that Synapse has changed the format of the account data and devices replication streams (between workers).
This is a forwards- and backwards-incompatible change: v1.75 workers cannot process account data replicated by v1.76
workers, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Once all workers are upgraded to v1.76 (or downgraded to v1.75), account data and device replication will resume as normal.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-stuff">The new stuff</h2>
<h3 id="the-default-room-version-has-now-been-updated-to-v10">The default room version has now been updated to <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/rooms/v10/">v10</a></h3>
<p>Room version 10 is now the default room version in Synapse 1.76.0. This room version builds on v9 to introduce a new
<code>knock_restricted</code> join rule, allowing prospective members to more easily join such a room. The <code>knock_restricted</code> join
rule allows for prospective members of a room to join either through knocking or through <code>join_restrictions</code>, which allows
prospective members to join a restricted room based on whether they are a joined member of another room. You can read more
about restricted rooms <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms">here</a>.</p>

<p>Synapse has added some new, default push rules for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3381">MSC3881</a>-esque event types.</p>
<p>This allows for notifications from polls, ie when a poll starts or ends.</p>

complete list of changes in the release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our
thanks to everyone who contributed to these releases, including: katlol, thezaidbintariq,
dklimpel, FSG-Cat, tjay27, emgrav, villepeh.</p>

<p>The last week i worked on getting Dendrite to work on the I2P Network. It makes use of the existing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone">Pinecone</a> infrastructure which gets enabled to dial on I2P with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone/compare/main...BieHDC:pinecone:main">a small patch</a>. This has the main advantage that servers will automatically discover each other if they share a node and you don't have to seek out others in the distributed network. I host a 24/7 Seednode for I2P right now. I have also put the work in to enable a landing page just like a monolith deployment would have and you can just <a href="http://3do33c5purkmidtcdxkqindjplcm3l6uv6qysc5a3pfa7fd7lv6q.b32.i2p/">browse to it</a>. This hopefully increases the visibility too!
However, it can also dial into the Clearnet too. It is hardcoded to the Seednode run by the matrix and dendrite developers themselves and it is disabled by default, but can be enabled with a command line switch. It effectively is making a bridge between the I2P Network and Clearnet. In order to bridge the gap between Pinecone based servers and normal matrix servers as well, I have also made a very simple <a href="https://github.com/BieHDC/go-matrix2matrix-noobbridge">matrix2matrix bridge</a> which just connects to 2 (or more) Homeservers and exchanges the messages between 2 (or more) rooms. It also supports bridging and not-bridging files of any kind.
You could add other networks too as long as you can tie them together with Pinecone. For example, the <a href="https://github.com/eyedeekay/onramp">library</a> i use to connect to I2P also supports Tor and it can be added to function just like the I2P implementation. All you need is something that exposes a HTTP Client and a listener.
My personal goal is to make matrix independent from domain registrars, open ports, static IP addresses and anything that makes self hosting harder than it should be and thankfully all the software we need is already written, it just takes someone to tie it together.</p>

<p>A curl like tool but just for matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@saces:c-base.org">saces</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Working with curl and matrix - especially in constrained environments like read only containers - drove me nuts. Nuts enough to build my own version of curl that fits my needs.</p>
<p>main differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>return code 0 means its the data you asked for</li>
<li>HTTP 429 (Rate limit) is retried by default, all other 'soft failures' fail</li>
<li>pass token via <a href="https://gitlab.com/determinant/mxpassfile">mxpassfile</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Its still some work left, but things in the readme should work.</p>

<p>A KRunner plugin to list joined rooms and possibly other things from nheko.</p>

<h2 id="nheko-krunner-0-2-0">nheko-krunner 0.2.0</h2>
<p>nheko-krunner has had a new release! 0.2.0 brings support for the latest version of nheko, but it also adds a new feature: the KRunner plugin can be configured from KDE's System Settings app! Currently, the only configuration option is to change whether you are shown unread counts for rooms in the search results, but I can see this expanding in the future to add other useful configurations</p>
<p>If you are using openSUSE Tumbleweed, you should already have the update available to install!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bnjbvr:delire.party">bnjbvr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, <a href="https://github.com/ahal">ahal</a> contributed the <em>linkify</em> module, which implements a generic way to create substitutions based on regular expressions and their matches in Matrix messages.</p>
<p>For instance, it's possible to create a substitution so that when someone writes &quot;issue #21&quot; in the room, the bot will answer with &quot;https://github.com/bnjbvr/trinity/issues/21&quot;. And since it's configurable at runtime, you can create such substitutions with any format you want, create automated links as you'd like, and configure it per Matrix channel. This opens up a new world of possibilities! Also this generalizes what this bot's predecessor, <em>botzilla</em>, did with 3 different commands for expanding Github / Gitlab / Bugzilla links, so Trinity has now reached feature parity with it! Woohoo 🥳</p>

<h3 id="performance-improvements-and-fosdem-23">performance improvements and FOSDEM 23</h3>
<p>The most exciting change regarding more performance are asynchronous database transactions. This means that the cache stores values not only for reading from, but also for writing to the database. So every database transaction is executed asynchronously to the caller who changes values. This allows really fast sync processing even on slow systems like smartphones. This also removes delays in the UI, because changes are immediately applied (on the cache level). This was a problem with databases which don't allow parallel write transactions (like realm). This problem also seems to appear in Element Android and its realm database (at least with my huge account). Despite that, I've made some other improvements regarding the cache and sync processing.</p>
<p>I also added a simple benchmark to see how good the improvements are. The test creates 50 encrypted rooms and sends 10 messages to each room. The database is in-memory, but writing is simulated with a 10ms and reading with 5ms delay. Before the optimizations the sync needed 20s to be processed. After the optimizations it needed 5s. So 400% faster. In practice, with my relatively huge matrix account (200+ rooms) the initial sync took 2.5s (after waiting 30s for the server response) on the desktop. But this is just a teaser. If you want to know more, you'll have to wait another week for my Trixnity talk on FOSDEM 23. Contact me if you have topics that should definitely be included in the talk. 30 min are unfortunately filled quickly.</p>
<h3 id="indexeddb-support">IndexedDB support</h3>
<p>I've added IndexedDB as a new database and media backend for web. Really cool to see Trixnity in the web with a persistent database.</p>
<h3 id="fallback-keys-and-room-key-requests">fallback keys and room key requests</h3>
<p>Fallback keys are now supported by Trixnity. Furthermore room keys requests are answered and room keys are requested (when key backup is disabled) from own verified devices.</p>

<p>features/improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>add async transactions</li>
<li>add IndexedDB as database and media backend</li>
<li>support olm fallback keys</li>

<h3 id="synapse-website">Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week the Synapse team has been finishing a sprint on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3902">faster joins</a> project.
As a reminder, this is a year-long project to make Synapse quickly join a new room by lazily loading some of its state history in the background.
It is particularly needed when joining large rooms with lots of members: joining such rooms is bottlenecked on fetching, serialising, deserialising and validating a <em>huge</em> list of <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#mroommember">room member events</a>.
While the core logic and machinery has been in place for some time now, this sprint has concentrated on two pain points:</p>
<ul>
<li>making faster joins to work on Synapse installations <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/workers.html">using workers</a>, and</li>
<li>remaining edge cases needed for a good client UX.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="call-for-testers">Call for testers</h2>
<p>We hope to ship the first iteration of faster joins support in Synapse 1.76.0.
The release candidate <code>1.76.0rc1</code> will be released on Tuesday 24th Jan.
<strong>We'd like to encourage homeserver administrators to try it out</strong> before the release proper.
Once you've upgraded, try joining rooms which no-one else on your server is joined to.
We graciously welcome any bug reports---please file <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=BUG_REPORT.yml">GitHub issues</a> if you find anything out of the ordinary after joining a room.</p>

<p>Howdy! This release features one change, but an important change: We've finally fixed the poor UX around adding new connections in rooms via widgets. Up until today, the project selector input was quite poor and flaked out a lot. Missing search results, clipping dropdowns or duplicated entries were a common occurrence.</p>
<p>The new input field features a much improved look, so now you see the project name, description and avatar when searching across GitHub, GitLab and JIRA. The search time and accuracy should be much improved too.</p>
<p>If you've updated to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/2.6.1">previous releases, 2.6.0,1</a>, then now is a good time to do so because those releases contained a whole range of cool new stuff!</p>

<p>Nheko has another release already.  Shortly after releasing v0.11.0, we discovered a CPU utilization issue that causes nheko to use excessive CPU, even when idle.  We have released v0.11.1 to address this issue and also add a failure state for pending sent messages (to help avoid them getting stuck in the queue).  Packages are available at https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases/tag/v0.11.1 and on flathub for the flatpak users.</p>

<p>We are making big progress to set up ElementX. The new architecture of the project has land to develop, and we are making the final cleanup. Next steps will be to integrate the Rust Sdk in a more professional way. For now it’s an AAR built manually and copied to the project. We are also writing documentation to help onboarding developers on this project!</p>

<p>First and foremost: <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">UniFFI async is all done and submitted for review</a> 🎉 and first responses are pretty positive. Discussion has revealed some unlikely but possible undefined behavior that needs to be addressed and more review is needed. But overall, we are pretty confident that this will land soon. 🚀</p>
<p>Where there is light, there is shadow: When trying to integrate the community sqlite db backend we ran into a terrible bug in the underlying library that led to eventually having to abandon that port and go with a fresh implementation based on a different library - we are confident to show something, at least for crypto-db, fairly soon. Talking about crypto, aside from a few <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1348">smaller</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1365">improvements</a> the JS bindings on top have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1303">gotten some typing improvements</a> this week, too. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1347">Timeline has support for state events now</a>, too.</p>
<p>On Sliding sync we are looking at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1359">stabilization (tracking issue)</a> and optimizing for time-to-first-usage ahead of FOSDEM and getting a first iteration into the hands of people out there as part of Element-X. It’s a painstaking process with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1372">plenty of small fixes</a> and improvements on all parts. Through that and debugging on the interaction with the higher layers we were already able to shave off 900ms at cold-start-display-time, with more to come and other fixes, like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1358">logging improvements</a>, done along the way.</p>

<p>Greetings, fellow music lovers (and matrix enjoyers)! I had a brilliant idea whilst lounging on my couch, stuffing my face with pizza, and realized that I was too darn lazy to keep opening Spotify every time I want to skip a song. And lo and behold, I discovered that there was no way to command my Spotify account from the comfort of my Matrix room. So, I decided to create a bot to do the job for me (how convenient, right?). </p>
<p>It's currently in its alpha state, but any contributions are welcome, especially if you're a coding wizard.</p>
<p>To use it, all you need is a bot account on your favorite homeserver and a bit of setup magic. Check out the GitHub link for more information: https://github.com/VaiTon/matrixfy</p>

            <p>We published Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.75.0">version 1.75</a>
as the new stable release this week. Synapse admins are encouraged to upgrade
to it at their convenience. It seems like the blog post for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.74.0">version 1.74</a>
was eaten by Santa's reindeer, so this post will also cover changes from it.</p>
<h2 id="announcements">Announcements</h2>
<p>There were no special announcements for the 1.75 release.</p>
<h3 id="synapse-1-74-icu-dependency-for-improved-user-search">Synapse 1.74: ICU dependency for improved user search</h3>
<p>Synapse's search functionality has long been poor when searching for non-English
terms. Synapse 1.74 <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14464">introduced</a>
support for an optional improved user search experience which has a better
awareness of Unicode. To do so, we use the <a href="https://icu.unicode.org/">ICU library</a>
when Synapse is installed alongside the binding library <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyICU/">PyICU</a>.</p>
<p>Synapse installations using Matrix.org docker images or debian packages will
automatically have the new search mode enabled.</p>
<p>From-source installations will need to include the <code>user-search</code> extra when
<code>pip install</code> Synapse, e.g. <code>pip install matrix-synapse[user-search]</code>.
<strong>NB:</strong> because PyICU is not distributed as source-only on PyPI, you will need
to ensure the ICU development headers are available on your system. See the
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.75/upgrade.html#unicode-support-in-user-search">upgrade notes</a>
for more info.</p>
<p>Please try out the new search mode and let us know how you find it in practice.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-stuff">The new stuff</h2>
<h3 id="support-rfc7636-proof-key-for-code-exchange-for-oauth-single-sign-on">Support <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636">RFC7636</a> Proof Key for Code Exchange for OAuth single sign-on</h3>
<p>Synapse 1.75 adds support for RFC7636 code challenges in the OAuth 2.0 flow.</p>
<p>This is required by Twitter SSO and enabling it can protect against the
&quot;authorization code interception attack&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="experimental-support-for-removing-account-data-msc3391">Experimental support for removing account data (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3391">MSC3391</a>)</h3>
<p>Experimental support for removing account data has landed in Synapse.
It was previously possible to create or update account data but not remove them, this is now possible.</p>
<p>The support is experimental and needs to be enabled with a configuration flag since the MSC hasn't landed yet.</p>
<h3 id="more-faster-remote-room-joins-fixes-and-improvements">More faster remote room joins fixes and improvements</h3>
<p>In case you missed it we are working on dramatically improve performance of remote room joins, you can refer
to <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/18/testing-faster-remote-room-joins">this blog post</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The last two Synapse releases brings that a lot closer to a proper release; in
particular they contain a lot of work to support faster joins in deployments
with multiple workers. The project continues in earnest; we hope to have more to
show off in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>See the full <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.75.0">changelog</a>, for a
complete list of changes in the release. Also please have a look at the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.75/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1740">upgrade
notes</a> for 1.74 version.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our
thanks to everyone who contributed to these releases, including (in no particular
order): Ashish Kumar, Dirk Klimpel, Jeremy Kescher, Jeyachandran Rathnam,
Nick Mills-Barrett, Jason Little, Villepeh and Vertux.
We are also grateful to anyone helping us make Synapse better by sharing their
