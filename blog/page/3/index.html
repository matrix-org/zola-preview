            <p>This is the second in a series of three posts which discuss recent work to improve type annotations in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent">Sydent</a>, the reference Matrix Identity server. <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/03/type-coverage-for-sydent-motivation">Last time</a> we discussed the motivation for doing this work in the first place: the <em>why</em>. Now I want to talk about the <em>how</em>. How did we add annotations to individual files, and across the project as whole? What common idioms did we learn on the way?</p>
<h2 id="the-process-of-improving-coverage">The process of improving coverage</h2>
<p>From experience adding typing to Synapse, we decided to annotate one module at a time. We configured a list of files in <code>pyproject.toml</code> which we knew passed mypy's checks. We could run <code>mypy</code> in CI to check that new PRs didn't introduce type problems in modules already covered.</p>
<p>From there, the workflow was</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a new module to annotate. Add it to the list of <code>files</code> in mypy's configuration.</li>
<li>Run <code>mypy</code>. See how many errors you get.</li>
<li>Choose an error. Fix it. Re-run <code>mypy</code>.</li>
<li>Repeat until no errors remaining.</li>
<li>Submit for review.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two parts in there which involve a choice. Being honest, I made those choices unscientifically: I tried to choose the easy tasks to do first. My first target was actually the entire <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/418">sydent.util</a> subpackage. Probably a bit too large for a first bite! My thinking was that <code>util</code> sounded like something with few dependencies that would have impact across the whole source tree.</p>
<p>Within a given module, I'd try to fix easier errors first: partly for confidence, partly to build up momentum, and partly to get myself familiar with that piece of source code. For example, I'd often start by telling mypy that <code>mylist = []</code> was actually was a <code>List[str]</code> (rather than the generic <code>List[Any]</code> which it would use otherwise).</p>
<p>Picking and choosing easy targets works fairly well, but sometimes that means you end up fixing an error that's really a symptom of an earlier one. Other times fixing one error, e.g. by giving a return type annotation to a function—would solve a series of other errors throughout the file. Watching the total number of errors mypy reports bob up and down was intriguing!</p>
<p>In retrospect, I think it would be smoother to generate some kind of dependency graph for the package. I'm imagining a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a> where whose vertices are modules, and there's an edge <code>A -&gt; B</code> if <code>A</code> imports from <code>B</code>. The sinks of this DAG (i.e. modules which don't depend on any others in the package) are the ideal place to start: you can get something strictly typechecked there without having to annotate a long chain of dependencies across other files. Another strategy would be to see which modules were the least precise according to mypy's reports—but more on those <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/17/type-coverage-for-sydent-evaluation">next time</a>.</p>
<h3 id="you-re-at-the-mercy-of-your-dependencies">You're at the mercy of your dependencies</h3>
<p>I think this is my single biggest takeaway from the process of adding annotations to Sydent.
I'll admit the phrasing is melodramatic, but I think it rings true. </p>
<p>Improving coverage boils down to giving the typechecker more information about your program. The more information it has, the more it can check—and the more errors it can spot. (Hopefully this doesn't make typing come across like a pyramid scheme.) If your dependencies aren't typed, mypy can't validate you're correctly providing inputs and correctly consuming outputs. You might have a bigger impact on overall typing coverage by annotating a dependency (directly or via stubs). I have a hunch that bugs are more likely in code that uses an external dependency: we're much more familiar with the details of our own source code compared to that of a third party we trust.</p>
<p>It's worth looking to see if your dependencies have a newer version including type annotations. Failing that, they may have a stub package added to <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs">typeshed</a> and published on PyPI. I saw example of both cases when choosing how to configure mypy for Sydent. If some of your dependencies are under your control, consider annotating them—you'll feel the benefits across multiple projects pretty quickly.</p>
<h3 id="annotations-when-working-with-twisted">Annotations when working with twisted</h3>
<p>Twisted is Sydent's biggest dependency, and I certainly felt at its mercy! In particular, it has a few quirks which make it trickier to annotate applications using it. Here's a summary of the work we had to do to get those annotations working.</p>
<h4 id="partially-typed-modules-and-stubs">Partially typed modules and stubs</h4>
<p>Early into the process, mypy reported that calling the function <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.log.html#err">twisted.python.log.err</a> was an error. It did so because I was running mypy in <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-strict">--strict mode</a>. We'll talk more about why I did so and what this means <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/17/type-coverage-for-sydent-evaluation">next time</a>; for now, it's enough to know that calling a function that isn't fully annotated from within a function that is constitutes an error under strict mode. <code>twisted</code> is partially annotated: many key modules and functions have type annotations, but others don't. I was reluctant to give up on <code>--strict</code>. Instead, I decided to stub the <code>err</code> function myself.</p>
<p>A stub is a cut-down version of a python function, class or module which lives in a <code>.pyi</code> file. All implementation details are removed; only type annotations remain. Stubs are useful when you want to write annotations for code you don't control. The <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed">typeshed</a> library is probably the best example: a collection of third party stubs for the standard library, plus some popular third party packages. Microsoft's <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs">python-type-stubs</a> is another example. They'd also solve the problem I mentioned at the end of the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/03/type-coverage-for-sydent-motivation">first part</a>: I could use a stub to <em>teach</em> mypy that <code>IResponse.headers</code> was a <code>Headers</code> object. </p>
<p>Writing a stub for <code>log.err</code> was straightforward, thanks mainly to Twisted's thorough documentation. I chose to write it by hand, rather than use <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubgen.html">stubgen</a>. I'd heard of the latter, but was reluctant to use it for a few reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Twisted is a big project with many big files. I didn't want to commit huge stub files for me and my colleagues to maintain.</li>
<li>The more our stubs cover, the larger the risk of a stub becoming out-of-date with twisted itself. Upstream twisted is the best place for these annotations.</li>
<li>We only need annotations for the bits of twisted that we're using.</li>
<li>And, being honest: I wanted the low-level experience of writing stubs, cross-referencing between the source and working how to best capture its type semantics.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this decision to write a targeted stub made sense at the time. After all, <code>twisted.python.logging.err</code> is just one simple function! But for the project as a whole, I regret not using <code>stubgen</code> to generate module-level stubs. The reason for this is that a <code>.pyi</code> stub file accounts for an entire module: <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5880#issuecomment-439237176">no more and no less</a>. This means that the stubs I was writing for parts of twisted only covered the functions and classes I'd stubbed. Any existing annotations in the twisted source code would be ignored, along with any types that mypy was able to infer for itself.</p>
<p>I think it would have been more efficient to use <code>stubgen</code> to generate stubs and patch them up, rather than writing them. That would have helped avoid a few cases I encountered where stubbing one function would cause additional typechecking failures (because mypy was no longer examining the twisted source for that file). It would also have meant that I could just faithfully stub Twisted as it is; in practice, I would sometimes hesitate to stub to avoid having to cover another module. <code>sydent.http</code> was the most painful part of the source tree for this: that's where we make the most use of Twisted.</p>
<h4 id="defer-inlinecallbacks"><a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.defer.html#inlineCallbacks">defer.inlineCallbacks</a></h4>
<p>This is a decorator which allows us to write code in the style of <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> without actually using that syntax. (Twisted predates <code>asyncio</code> and the <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> syntax, introduced in Python 3.4 and 3.5 respectively. It was originally released in 2002, back when Python had released version 2.2.) We only use it in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/e4b4dbbdf25255d19effceae7061ad9b3eefc374/sydent/http/matrixfederationagent.py#L125-L132">one place in Sydent</a> nowadays, but I've seen used across Synapse too. I mention it here because it was a bit fiddly to annotate. Here's its use in Sydent:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>    @defer.inlineCallbacks
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>request(
</span><span>        self,
</span><span>        method: bytes,
</span><span>        uri: bytes,
</span><span>        headers: Optional[</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;Headers&quot;</span><span>] = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">None</span><span>,
</span><span>        bodyProducer: Optional[</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;IBodyProducer&quot;</span><span>] = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">None</span><span>,
</span><span>    ) -&gt; Generator[</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;defer.Deferred[Any]&quot;</span><span>, Any, IResponse]:
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>request</code> is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator">generator function</a> because its body uses the <code>yield</code> keyword. Yielding allows the function to relinquish control back to twisted's reactor, only for its execution to be resumed asynchronously in the future. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html?highlight=typing%20generator#typing.Generator">Generator</a> type takes three parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <code>YieldType</code>, <code>Deferred[Any]</code>;</li>
<li>a <code>SendType</code>, <code>Any</code>; and</li>
<li>a <code>ReturnType</code>, <code>IResponse</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why have I opted to use <code>Any</code> here, when we've seen (and will see) that this limits mypy's ability to run checks? The answer is that we yield two different types within the function. Firstly a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/e4b4dbbdf25255d19effceae7061ad9b3eefc374/sydent/http/matrixfederationagent.py#L152-L153">routing result</a>:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>        routing: _RoutingResult
</span><span>        routing = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">yield </span><span>defer.ensureDeferred(self._route_matrix_uri(parsed_uri))
</span></code></pre>
<p>and later, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/e4b4dbbdf25255d19effceae7061ad9b3eefc374/sydent/http/matrixfederationagent.py#L194-L195">the IResponse</a> we go on to return:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>        res: IResponse
</span><span>        res = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">yield </span><span>agent.request(method, uri, headers, bodyProducer)
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this example:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We yield a value <code>y: Deferred[Any]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That will later be resolved by twisted to an <code>x: Any</code> value. Twisted will send that value to <code>request</code>, and the execution continues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This repeats, until we eventually return an <code>IResponse</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I could more correctly annotate the <code>YieldType</code> as <code>Deferred[Union[_RoutingResult, IResponse]]</code> so that the <code>SendType</code> was <code>Union[_RoutingResult, IResponse]</code>. But this would mean we end up having some kind of type check at each yield point: a <code>cast</code>, or a <code>type: ignore</code>, or a runtime <code>isinstance</code> check. It didn't feel like it was worth the boilerplate, especially since I could narrow e.g. <code>res: Any</code> to <code>res: IResponse</code> with minimal effort.</p>
<p>This problem doesn't arise with using the <code>async/await</code> syntax:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">async def </span><span>foo() -&gt; int:
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">return </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">1
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">async def </span><span>bar() -&gt; </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">None</span><span>:
</span><span>    x = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>foo()
</span><span>    reveal_type(foo())
</span><span>    reveal_type(x)
</span></code></pre>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>$ mypy example.py
</span><span>example.py:6: note: Revealed type is &quot;typing.Coroutine[Any, Any, builtins.int]&quot;
</span><span>example.py:7: note: Revealed type is &quot;builtins.int*&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Behind the scenes, I <em>think</em> that <code>x = await foo()</code> is really using the same mechanism as the <code>inlineCallbacks</code> approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>An <code>async def</code> function is really a generator function behind the scenes.</li>
<li>When we <code>await foo()</code>, we yield the expression <code>foo()</code></li>
<li>Then the machinery running our coroutine <code>c</code> will call <code>c.send(x)</code> to resume execution, where <code>x</code> is the value produced by waiting for <code>foo()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the <code>await</code> form, mypy knows two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the value <code>foo()</code> which was yielded should be <code>Awaitable[T]</code>, and</li>
<li>the value <code>x</code> send to the coroutine should come from awaiting <code>foo()</code>, and therefore be of type <code>T</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mypy can't assume or enforce these rules for the yield form, which can yield and send whatever it likes. There's no reason why the send type should be related to the yield type. Here's a toy example:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">from </span><span>typing </span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>Any, Dict, Generator
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>generator_function() -&gt; Generator[int, str, Dict[str, Any]]:
</span><span>  y: int = </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">10
</span><span>  x: str = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">yield </span><span>y
</span><span>  print(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;Coroutine was sent&quot;</span><span>, x)  </span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># -&gt; Coroutine was sent hello
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">return </span><span>{</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;got&quot;</span><span>: x, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;done&quot;</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">True</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>coroutine = generator_function()
</span><span>y = next(coroutine)
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">try</span><span>:
</span><span>  coroutine.send(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;hello&quot;</span><span>)
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">except </span><span>StopIteration </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">as </span><span>e:
</span><span>  return_value = e.value
</span><span>  print(return_value)  </span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># -&gt; {&#39;got&#39;: &#39;hello&#39;, &#39;done&#39;: True}
</span></code></pre>
<p>All in all, the handling of <code>inlineCallbacks</code> is a situation specific to working with (older?) twisted code. It's still nice to understand what's going on behind the scenes though!</p>
<h4 id="zope-interface-interface"><code>zope.interface.Interface</code></h4>
<p>Twisted makes use of <code>zope</code>'s <code>Interface</code> to define a number of abstract interface classes. Speaking personally, I've not seen it used outside twisted, and I think that means it's not supported by much of the typechecking tooling. For example, I've definitely seen PyCharm struggle to realise that it's okay to pass a <code>Response</code> to a function which expects an <code>IResponse</code>! Here's a more complicated example where <code>PyCharm</code> isn't happy with me widening the type <code>LoggingHostnameEndpoint</code> to <code>IStreamClientEndpoint</code>, even though <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/92ff7a878a25696365b10cc49e32f5cba32c5960/sydent/http/matrixfederationagent.py#L379-L380">the latter implements the former</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-12-10-pycharm-false-positive.png" alt="Screenshot from pycharm showing a false positive warning" /></p>
<p>Mypy out of the box doesn't play well with a zope <code>Interface</code> (nor does any other typechecker I tried). Fortunately, the excellent <a href="https://github.com/Shoobx/mypy-zope">mypy-zope</a> plugin helps here: it teaches mypy that any class like <code>Response</code> which <code>@implements(IResponse)</code>  can be passed in place of an <code>IResponse</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tricks-of-the-trade">Tricks of the trade</h3>
<p>At this point I'd like to share a few generic lessons about typing I'd picked up. Nothing ground-breaking here: I think these are all fairly well-known. Hopefully they're the start of a good cheat sheet for annotating—though it pales in comparison to the <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html">Mypy cheat sheet</a>.</p>
<h4 id="annotating-decorators">Annotating decorators</h4>
<p>Annotating decorators is fiddly, but it's also vitally important. An unannotated decorator will mask or throw away your decoratee's annotations! The way to write the annotation is best explained by the <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generics.html#declaring-decorators">mypy docs</a>, but briefly: it involves a <code>TypeVar</code> and sometimes a <code>cast</code> too. Here's an example.</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">from </span><span>typing </span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>TypeVar, Callable, Any, cast
</span><span>
</span><span>F = TypeVar(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;F&quot;</span><span>, bound=Callable[</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">...</span><span>, Any])
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>decorator(input: F) -&gt; F:
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>wrapped(</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">*</span><span>args: Any, </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">**</span><span>kwargs: Any) -&gt; Any:
</span><span>        print(</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">f</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;Calling </span><span>{f.__name__}</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span>)
</span><span>        </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">return </span><span>input_func(*args, </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">**</span><span>kwargs)
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">return </span><span>cast(F, wrapped)
</span></code></pre>
<p>The idea here is</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>Callable[..., Any]</code> to describe a generic function with no particular signature.</li>
<li>Use that as a bound on a type variable <code>F</code>. At each usage of <code>@decorator</code>, mypy will deduce a more specific version of <code>F</code>, e.g. <code>Callable[[int], str]</code>.</li>
<li>Within that usage of <code>@decorator</code>, <code>F</code> is fixed to that specific type. We use <code>-&gt; F</code> to express that &quot;we return a function with the same signature as the decoratee&quot;.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, we don't have a good way to tell <code>mypy</code> that <code>wrapped</code> also has that signature <code>F</code>. We resort to a <code>cast</code> to force mypy to accept this without proof.</li>
</ol>
<p>This might change in the future, e.g. when <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html?highlight=paramspec#typing.ParamSpec">ParamSpec</a> is <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/8645">fully understood</a> by mypy.</p>
<h4 id="prefer-object-over-any">Prefer <code>object</code> over <code>Any</code></h4>
<p>Both of these are general types for expressing &quot;I don't know anything about this expression&quot;. But only the former will undergo static type checks. We want those type checks to guard against bugs accidentally introduced in the future. For instance, imagine a class with an <code>Any</code> attribute.</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">from </span><span>typing </span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>Any
</span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>dataclasses
</span><span>
</span><span>@dataclasses.dataclass
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">class </span><span>C:
</span><span>    label: Any
</span></code></pre>
<p>Imagine in the future we add a new method which assumes that <code>label</code> is a string:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>greeting(self) -&gt; str:
</span><span>        </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">return </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;My name is &quot; </span><span>+ self.label
</span></code></pre>
<p>Mypy will consider this valid, because no type-checking is done on an <code>Any</code> value. It will complain that it can't prove that <code>greeting</code> returns a <code>str</code>, if <code>--warn-return-any</code> is enabled; but putting that aside, it can't identify the call site as a bug. The bug slips through to runtime.</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>C(</span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">123</span><span>).greeting()  </span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># TypeError: can only concatenate str (not &quot;int&quot;) to str
</span></code></pre>
<p>Replacing the <code>Any</code> with <code>object</code> does allow mypy to spot the problem.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>error: Unsupported operand types for + (&quot;str&quot; and &quot;object&quot;)  [operator]
</span></code></pre>
<h4 id="type-ignore-and-cast-sparingly"><code># type: ignore</code> and <code>cast</code> sparingly</h4>
<p>There's a good chance that mypy knows better than we do, so we should only overrule it if there's no better option. There are two techniques for this. One option is to tell mypy to just silence the error, by appending a <code># type: ignore</code> comment to the erroneous line. The other is to force it to accept that a certain expression has a given type: that's what <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html?highlight=paramspec#typing.cast">cast</a> is for.</p>
<p>I never like using either of these, but sometimes they're the most practical choice. I'd recommend two best practices for their use, however:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only ignore a specific error code, e.g. <code># type: ignore[assignment]</code>.  Those codes can be displayed by passing <code>--show-error-codes</code> to mypy.</li>
<li>Leave a comment before every <code>#type: ignore[...]</code> and every <code>cast</code> to justify their correctness. I don't think this is a widely-held practice. I picked it up from the Rust world, where it's <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/documentation.html#function-docs-include-error-panic-and-safety-considerations-c-failure">encouraged</a> as a way to justify <code>unsafe</code> source code.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="there-s-good-stuff-in-typing">There's good stuff in <code>typing</code></h4>
<p>It's worth a read through the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">module documentation</a>—plenty of things in there I wish I'd known about sooner. There's lots in the toolkit to chose from. Some bits I use fairly often include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html?highlight=typing%20protocol#typing.Protocol">Protocol</a>: lets you formalise duck typing. To use it, define a class that inherits from <code>Protocol</code>. Its methods and attributes are all stubs which describe what you require of objects belonging to this type. It's like an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html?highlight=abc#module-abc">abstract base class</a> or interface, but purely at typecheck time.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html?highlight=typing%20generic#typing.Generic">Generic</a>: define your own generic types. A bit of a slippery slope to type mania!</li>
<li>[Optional<code>](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html?highlight=typing%20generic#typing.Optional): I use this all the time. It's always good to make your </code>None`s explicit!</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html?highlight=typing%20generic#typing.NewType">NewType</a>: I haven't had a chance to use it much. As I understand it, it's a way to define a &quot;strong typedef&quot;. For example, we can use it to distinguish lengths from durations, even if they're both represented by a <code>float</code> at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to call out two parts of <code>typing</code> in particular:</p>
<h4 id="overload"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html?highlight=typing%20generic#typing.overload">overload</a></h4>
<p><code>overload</code> is a way to provide extra information about a function depending on how it's called. For instance, consider this function which takes a <code>str</code> or <code>bytes</code> as input and returns its uppercase version.</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>upper(x: Union[bytes, str]) -&gt; Union[bytes, str]:
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">return </span><span>x.upper()
</span></code></pre>
<p>The problem with this annotation is that we'll have to check at every call site to see if the return value was a <code>bytes</code> or a <code>str</code> object. But we know that uppercasing a <code>str</code> gives us a <code>str</code>, and uppercasing a <code>bytes</code> gives us a <code>bytes.</code> We can use <code>overload</code> to express this.</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">from </span><span>typing </span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>overload
</span><span>
</span><span>@overload
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>upper(x: str) -&gt; str: </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">...
</span><span>
</span><span>@overload
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>upper(x: bytes) -&gt; bytes: </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">...
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>upper(x: Union[bytes, str]) -&gt; Union[bytes, str]:
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">return </span><span>x.upper()
</span></code></pre>
<p>The first two <code>@overload</code> definitions are like stubs: they're purely used for their annotations. The actual runtime implementation is specified at the end, undecorated. (<strong>NB</strong>: this specific example is better expressed without overloads, by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html?highlight=typing%20generic#typing.AnyStr">AnyStr</a>.)</p>
<p>I was really impressed to see how <code>mypy</code> could use this overloading information. Here's an example:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">from </span><span>typing </span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>overload, Literal
</span><span>
</span><span>@overload
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>f(x: int) -&gt; Literal[</span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">1</span><span>]: </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">...
</span><span>
</span><span>@overload
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>f(x: str) -&gt; Literal[</span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">2</span><span>]: </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">...
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>f(x: object) -&gt; int:
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">if </span><span>isinstance(x, int):
</span><span>        </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">return </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">1
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">elif </span><span>isinstance(x, str):
</span><span>        </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">return </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">2
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">return </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">3
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">if </span><span>f(</span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">10</span><span>) == </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">2</span><span>:
</span><span>    print(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;potato&quot;</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can see that <code>f(10) == 1</code> and so the equality is always <code>False</code>: we'll never print the word &quot;potato&quot;. Mypy can reason through this too, if we ask it nicely.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>$ mypy example.py

</span></code></pre>
<h4 id="typeddict"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html?highlight=typeddict#typing.TypedDict">TypedDict</a></h4>
<p>I mentioned this <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/03/type-coverage-for-sydent-motivation">in last week's post</a>) when talking about the missing <code>await</code> bug.
Subclassing from <code>TypedDict</code> allows us to define a new type whose values are dictionaries with</p>
<ul>
<li>a fixed set of keys (some mandatory, some not), and</li>
<li>a fixed type for each key's value.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0589/">PEP 589</a> can best describe the motivation, but in short: there's a lot of source code out there that passes dictionaries around. <code>TypedDict</code> is a way to gradually add typechecking to that code, without having to refactor it to use e.g. a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html">dataclass</a> or a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple">NamedTuple</a>. Let's have a quick example.</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">from </span><span>typing </span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>List, TypedDict
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">class </span><span>Person(</span><span style="color:#4ec9b0;">TypedDict</span><span>):
</span><span>    full_name: str
</span><span>    nicknames: List[str]
</span><span>    age: int
</span><span>
</span><span>p: Person = {
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;full_name&quot;</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;David Matthew Robertson&quot;</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;nicknames&quot;</span><span>: [</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;dmr&quot;</span><span>],
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;age&quot;</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">29</span><span>,
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Mypy will detect if you delete or omit a required key, or if you insert a key that's not part of the type.</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#608b4e;"># error: Key &quot;age&quot; of TypedDict &quot;Person&quot; cannot be deleted
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">del </span><span>p[</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;age&quot;</span><span>]
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># error: Missing keys (&quot;full_name&quot;, &quot;nicknames&quot;, &quot;age&quot;) for TypedDict &quot;Person&quot;
</span><span>p2: Person = {}
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># error: TypedDict &quot;Person&quot; has no key &quot;eye_colour&quot;
</span><span>p[</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;eye_colour&quot;</span><span>] = </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;brown&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>TypedDict</code> is a useful tool, but there are a few important gotchas to be aware of. In my view, these are all minor and worth putting up with, to benefit from the extra type information that a <code>TypedDict</code> provides. Let's take a look.</p>
<h5 id="typeddict-is-incompatible-with-dict"><code>TypedDict</code> is incompatible with <code>Dict</code></h5>
<p>This one surprised me at first. Why can't I pass my <code>TypedDict</code> to a function that accepts a generic dictionary?</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>json
</span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">from </span><span>typing </span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>Dict, TypedDict
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">class </span><span>Foo(</span><span style="color:#4ec9b0;">TypedDict</span><span>):
</span><span>    bar: str
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>print_size(d: Dict[object, object]) -&gt; </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">None</span><span>:
</span><span>    print(len(d))
</span><span>
</span><span>f: Foo = {</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;bar&quot;</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;baz&quot;</span><span>}
</span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># error: Argument 1 to &quot;print_size&quot; has incompatible type &quot;Foo&quot;; expected &quot;Dict[object, object]&quot;
</span><span>print_size(f)
</span></code></pre>
<p>The answer is that it wouldn't be type-safe! For all we know, the function <code>print_size</code> might mutate its argument <code>d</code>. It might add a key, remove a key, or change the type of a value. Each of those would break the contract that <code>TypedDict</code> is supposed to enforce, so mypy is correct to flag this as an error. <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/4976">This GitHub issue</a> has more discussion.</p>
<p>There are few workarounds for this kind of problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>The function might be able to accept a <code>TypedDict</code> directly.</li>
<li>The function could accept a <code>Mapping</code> instead of a <code>Dict</code>. This is type-safe because the <code>Mapping</code> type does not offer mutating methods such as <code>pop</code>, <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__del__</code>; but it only works if the function does not mutate the dictionary.</li>
<li>A more drastic approach would discard the <code>TypedDict</code> information with a <code>cast</code> to <code>Dict[str, object]</code> or similar. If so, I'd strongly recommend a comment explaining why the cast is correct and safe.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="mixing-mandatory-and-required-fields">Mixing mandatory and required fields</h5>
<p>Secondly, defining a <code>TypedDict</code> with a mixture of optional and required keys is a little fiddly. All keys can be made optional by passing <code>total=False</code> in the class definition. To have some keys optional and others mandatory, we have to make <em>two</em> TypedDicts. Say for instance we wanted to allow a potentially-missing <code>favourite_colour</code> field to <code>Person</code>. We can't add an annotation <code>favourite_colour: Optional[str]</code> to the first class body. That's optional in a different sense: it would mean that <code>favourite_colour</code> is a mandatory field which is allowed to be <code>None</code>. Instead, we apply <code>total=False</code> to a subclass:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">from </span><span>typing </span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>List, TypedDict
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">class </span><span>_PersonRequired(</span><span style="color:#4ec9b0;">TypedDict</span><span>):
</span><span>    full_name: str
</span><span>    nicknames: List[str]
</span><span>    age: int
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">class </span><span>Person(</span><span style="color:#4ec9b0;">_PersonRequired</span><span>, total=</span><span style="color:#4ec9b0;">False</span><span>):
</span><span>    favourite_colour: str
</span></code></pre>
<p>This means that a valid <code>Person</code> dictionary may have no <code>favourite_colour</code> key. If it is present, it must be a <code>str</code>.</p>
<p>The syntax is unfortunately a little clunky. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0655/">PEP 655</a> acknowledges this and proposes an alternative.</p>
<h5 id="typeddict-is-typecheck-time-only"><code>TypedDict</code> is typecheck-time only</h5>
<p>One final note: a <code>TypedDict</code> does no validation or conversion whatsoever. If mypy can't know the keys and values a dictionary will have a typecheck-time, you'll need to validate it by hand at runtime. We see this a lot because when deserialising json objects into a dictionary. Here's an example.</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>json
</span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">from </span><span>typing </span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>TypedDict
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">class </span><span>Foo(</span><span style="color:#4ec9b0;">TypedDict</span><span>):
</span><span>    bar: str
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># note: Revealed type is &quot;Any&quot;
</span><span>reveal_type(json.loads(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">{}</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span>))
</span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># no error. mypy can&#39;t do analysis on Any.
</span><span>f: Foo = json.loads(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">{}</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>

            <p>On <strong>Monday, 13th December</strong> we plan to publish a security release of libolm at 15:00 UTC to address a single high severity issue. To the best of our knowledge, only matrix-js-sdk and clients relying on it for E2EE are affected by this issue. This includes Element Web/Desktop and their forks (like SchildiChat). The release of libolm will be immediately followed by a security release of matrix-js-sdk and the affected clients. Users of these clients are encouraged to <strong>upgrade as soon as the patched versions are released</strong>.</p>
<p>We will be reaching out to downstream packagers to ensure they can prepare patched versions of the affected packages at the time of the release. The details of the vulnerability will be disclosed in a blog post on the day of the release. There is so far no evidence of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild.</p>
<p>The patched version numbers will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>libolm 3.2.8</li>
<li>matrix-js-sdk 15.2.1</li>
<li>Element Web/Desktop 1.9.7</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your patience while we work to resolve this issue.</p>

<p>One thing you might not know is that TWIM bot is a space traveler, sent by the Matrix scientists to explore that zone called &quot;The Possibilities&quot;. The <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> room is a portal to its energy tank, and we had received a distress signal!</p>
<p>To help the TWIM explorer fulfil its mission, we asked the Matrix community to fuel it with news before it crashed into space debris made of aggregated ignorance!</p>
<p>This week again, the community has been very active and explored many possibilities of the Matrix universe!</p>

<p>A group of Finnish Matrix admins have set up a free homeserver for Finnish public called pikaviestin.fi (literally instant messenger dot fi). It offers a bunch of bridges and registration requires an e-mail address in one of Finnish e-mail providers or organizations. We welcome all Finns to register there and help decentralize Matrix.

<p>The end of the year is drawing to a close. Thus many of the Spec Core Team members are focusing on implementation in order to meet deadlines. Review is still occurring though! As above, we have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a> (allow guests to send more event types). This was born out of next-generation VoIP work, but it should have a positive impact on improving the guest experience in Matrix on the whole.</p>
<p>Otherwise work is still ongoing by Bruno and others on untangling the aggregations MSCs, specifically <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2676">MSC2676</a>.</p>
<p>And finally, Alexandre Franke has <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3542">PR'd some work</a> to allow for matrix.org's OpenAPI spec to be widely available, meaning anyone with a <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> (or other <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> viewer) client can easily pull it and start sending requests against a Matrix homeserver.

<p>Goooood evening TWIM readers!</p>
<p>I want to start by drawing attention to a blog post which we published today: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/03/type-coverage-for-sydent-motivation">Type coverage for Sydent: motivation</a>. This the first in a series of three articles discussing what we've learned from making Sydent pass the <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/">mypy</a> type checker in strict mode. Improving type coverage across Synapse, Sygnal, and Sydent has been a major focus of the backend team at Element for the past few months, and we think we've learned a few useful things in the process.</p>
<p>This week we also <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/30/synapse-1-48-0-released">released Synapse 1.48</a> with loads of internal improvements, new Admin APIs, better alignment with the Matrix 1.1 spec, and more. We're planning one more release for the year, 1.49 on December 14th, and then we're taking a break until Synapse 1.50 on January 11th.</p>
<p>Importantly: Synapse 1.49 will be the last release to support Python 3.6, PostrgreSQL 9.6, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) — if you're reliant on any of these platforms, please ensure you have plans to upgrade.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think of the article (and the Synapse release!), and we'll see you next week!</p>

<h3 id="gitter">Gitter</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org">madlittlemods (Eric Eastwood)</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the vein of <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Gitter feature parity</a> on Matrix, we've made the first steps towards a better public static archive. We merged an experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> into <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> which lets you use the unstable <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> client API endpoint go from a given timestamp to the closest event ID. This will allow us to implement a calendar jump to date interface to be able to navigate to any day in the rooms history. Our first target to add the jump to date UI in is <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen</a> since we plan to server-side render Hydrogen for the actual public static archive as well.</p>
<p>To enable the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> unstable API endpoints in Synapse, add <code>experimental_features</code> -&gt; <code>msc3030_enabled: true</code> to your <code>homeserver.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/client/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/rooms/&lt;roomID&gt;/timestamp_to_event?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;
</span><span>{
</span><span>    &quot;event_id&quot;: ...
</span><span>    &quot;origin_server_ts&quot;: ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Also as part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>, when you use the client API endpoint, if your homeserver sees that the closest event it has locally in the database is next to a gap in the history, it will go out and ask other federated homeservers what they have as the closest event instead.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/timestamp_to_event/&lt;roomID&gt;?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;
</span><span>{
</span><span>    &quot;event_id&quot;: ...
</span><span>    &quot;origin_server_ts&quot;: ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>*--</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> to import batches of historical messages is still marching along getting some polishing passes and strengthening the assertions in the Complement tests to make sure things are going absolutely correctly. It's also good to see <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> utilizing it and catching a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11241">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11219">bugs</a> along the way 💪.</p>

<p>Stop the press. This is a last minute TWIM. We've been beavering away on <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot</a>. It's gained many features in the last week, but the big thing is that hookshot has gained the ability to provision connections over a provisioning API, which means it should hook nicely into Dimension (and other integration managers, in the future)!</p>
<p>Other notable features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple webhooks per room</li>
<li>Support for the username/text fields on an incoming webhook (slack style)</li>
<li>Named webhooks, so each hook now has a sensible displayname</li>
<li>The ability to spawn GitHub actions from rooms using the <code>!gh workflow run</code> command</li>
<li>Lots of new supported events from GitLab, such as reviews and tag pushes</li>
<li>Hosted documentation (so all of the above is easy to setup), it's a bit in progress atm.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're aiming for a release very very soon, hopefully in the next week or so!

<p>We finally figured out what caused the issues with the flatpak on GNOME, especially on Arm. It should now work properly, if you use Flathub. On the Pinephone (and other systems, that don't set a locale/use the C locale), timestamps should now not be needlessly long anymore. Redactions got a face-lift to distinguish them better from normal messages. We added a workaround for Synapse not allowing you to leave a banned room. We now delete the room from the room list permanently if Synapse returns &quot;unknown room&quot; when trying to leave it. Spaces can now show the entire hierarchy in the sidebar (if you pull it out) and you can navigate to subspaces by clicking on them in the roomlist, even if you collapsed the space hierarchy in the sidebar.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">Krille Fear</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we have released FluffyChat 1.0.0 with a whole new design, a lot of bug fixes and huge performance improvements.</p>
<h3 id="new-design">New design</h3>
<p>The new design has bigger message bubbles with fancy shadows and bigger fonts. The contrast has been improved and some elements, like the time on every single message bubble, are now hidden by default. But they are not gone! Detailed message information are now accessible in the new message info page, where we not also can see the message type and the timestamp, but also the whole JSON source code of each timeline event.</p>
<h3 id="spaces">Spaces</h3>
<p>Spaces have got a lot improvements and bug fixes. They have moved to the bottom bar of the chat list (while this bottom bar is still hidden if you have not joined any space yet). The multi account switcher have instead been moved to a top left drop-down menu. So we finally got rid of the drawer, which seems to be a deprecated material design feature anyway. This new UX makes spaces much easier to use. You can long press on them to go to the space settings and long press on any chat in the chat list, to add or remove a chat to (or from) a space.
We still have no support for the spaces summary API though so we don't have yet the ability to discover new rooms inside of a space but this feature might land soon in the Matrix Dart SDK.</p>
<h3 id="multi-account">Multi Account</h3>
<p>FluffyChats multi account is still in beta but got a lot of bug fixes as well. You are now able to sort your accounts in &quot;bundles&quot; which can be very handy. The new account switcher button gives you a much better overview over your connected Matrix accounts now.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>We did a lot refactoring under the hood in our Matrix Dart SDK and have improved our in-app database a lot. On the web it now uses IndexedDB natively while it tunes all database transactions on all platforms. This leads to the fastest FluffyChat experience we ever had and makes the app finally kinda usable with bigger accounts on all platforms. The room list is now lazy loaded which speeds up the app start (especially with multi account enabled) a lot.
Choose your own primary color
This was a long requested feature. You can now choose your favorite color to style your FluffyChat for your needs:</p>
<p>What will you choose? Let me know in the comments. I mostly like blue on my Ubuntu desktop.</p>
<h3 id="new-major-version">New major version?</h3>
<p>Ahhh by the way... What does it mean that we now have FluffyChat 1.0.0? It does NOT mean that the previous versions were not yet stable or ready for daily use. It just means that we make so many changes at once that we thought, bumping the first digit of our pseudo-semver version string might make sense. We totally messed up our versioning and are now going to do it better. Promised!!
What's next?
We are often asked: What is the roadmap of FluffyChat?
Well... we still don't have a clear roadmap and might never have. FluffyChat is completely driven by volunteers. But what I can say that we would like to do in the next months is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better QA -&gt; We would like to write some integration tests, push release candidates before new releases and involve everyone in testing them to offer the best stability possible.</li>
<li>Native video calls -&gt; Yes! There will soon land support for native video calls in the Matrix Dart SDK and we are going to implement this in FluffyChat.</li>
<li>Stories -&gt; Like you might know from SnapChat, WhatsApp or Instagram, stories are little messages you can send to all of your contacts and which will disappear after 24 hours. I would really like to implement this in FluffyChat!</li>
<li>Better notifications for iOS</li>
<li>Deeper support for spaces</li>
<li>Knocking feature</li>
<li>Drag&amp;Drop for web</li>
</ul>
<p>But as I said this is what we would like to do. We can't give any warranties on anything. We can only do our best. But you can help us if you like (You don't have to).</p>

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a>, a multiplatform Matrix SDK written in Kotlin, has grown up since the last release 6 month ago! It has it first release candidate for v1.0.0!</p>
<p>If you don't heard about Trixnity: Trixnity aims to be strongly typed, customizable and easy to use. You can register custom events and Trixnity will take care, that you can send and receive that type.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing is the new trixnity-client module. It provides a high level client implementation and allows you to easily implement clients for Desktop, Mobile and Web. You just need to render data from and passing user interactions to Trixnity. The key features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
exchangeable database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
fast cache on top of the database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
E2E (olm, megolm)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
verification</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
room list</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
timelines</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
user and room display name calculation</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
asynchronous message sending without caring about E2E stuff or online status</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
media support (thumbnail generation, offline &quot;upload&quot;, etc.)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
redactions</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, Trixnity only supports JVM in all modules, but JS and Native will follow soon (to be exact: when Kotlin 1.6.10 and ktor 2.0.0 is released). I also implemented the module trixnity-olm, which implements the wrappers of libolm for Kotlin JVM/JS/Native.</p>
<p>Cross signing is one of the next big features, I want to implement.</p>

            <p><em>This is the first of three posts on improving type coverage in Sydent. Join us next Friday for the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/10/type-coverage-for-sydent-annotation">second part</a>!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent">Sydent</a> is the reference Matrix Identity server. It provides a <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/identity_service/r0.3.0">lookup service</a>, so that you can find a Matrix user via their email address or phone number (if they've chosen to share it).</p>
<p>We recently worked on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/issues/414">improving Sydent's type coverage</a>: the proportion of its source code with explicit annotations denoting the kind of data that each variable, expression and return value is expected to hold. These annotations are optional, but if present, they allow tools like <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">mypy</a> to analyze your programs and spot entire classes of bugs <em>before</em> you ship them! In this instance, we aimed to make Sydent pass <code>mypy --strict</code>, which <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/commit/7bdaac2774840e1f9697d30515f367c5c8c16866">it now does</a>. Here's what the process looked like:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/TWGXKTFpjYxlbnHRkZFAzljQ.png" alt="Coverage as measured by mypy. Precision and the number of typed expressions increase over the latter half of 2021." /></p>
<p>Two lines show two different measures of how well-typed the project is. The grey region covers our two-week sprint towards improving coverage; the earliest data point is from just before previous efforts to improve typing earlier in the year.</p>
<p>In a series of posts, I'd like to reflect on this sprint and share what we've learned. In particular, I aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>explain why we wanted to improve type coverage <em>now</em>;</li>
<li>work through examples to see how (if?) mypy could have spotted bugs;</li>
<li>describe the annotation process;</li>
<li>illustrate common patterns I learned along the way;</li>
<li>discuss the checks that <code>mypy</code> provides; and finally</li>
<li>reflect on the state of Python's typing ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this first part, we'll concentrate on the first two topics; the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/10/type-coverage-for-sydent-annotation">second</a> covers the middle two; and the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/17/type-coverage-for-sydent-evaluation">third</a> the last two.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-this-now">Why do this now?</h2>
<p>It took us a long time (too long) to notice that the Sydent instance serving <code>matrix.org</code> <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/19317">was failing to send SMS messages for verification</a>. We suspected that something was going wrong with our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/main/sydent/sms/openmarket.py">API call to OpenMarket</a>. Our first step was to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/issues/410">improve logging</a>, so we could start to deduce what was going wrong and why. Whilst trawling through logs, we spotted <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/413#pullrequestreview-775154313">
one problem</a> which meant we weren't actually sending off the API request in the first place. Further investigation revealed a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/415">strings-versus-bytes confusion</a> which meant that we would always (incorrectly) interpret the API response as having failed.</p>
<p>All in all, phone number verification was unknowingly broken in the 2.4.0 release, to be fixed in 2.4.6 a month later. How could we do better? Better test coverage is (as ever) one answer. But <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/413#pullrequestreview-775154313">it struck me</a> that the two bugs we'd encountered might be ripe for automatic detection:</p>
<ul>
<li>we created an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Awaitable">Awaitable</a> but didn't <code>await</code> it or use it in any way, and</li>
<li>we tried to look up a <code>str</code> key in a dictionary which mapped <code>bytes</code> to <code>bytes</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Could a static analysis tool like <code>mypy</code> detect these? How much work would it take to do so? Are there other bugs and problems we could spot with it? I was curious to answer these questions and learn more about the tools that Python's typing ecosystem provides.</p>
<h2 id="could-typing-have-spotted-these-problems">Could typing have spotted these problems?</h2>
<p>Let's start with the first of question: what can <code>mypy</code> detect?</p>
<h3 id="the-missing-await">The missing <code>await</code></h3>
<p>Instead of writing <code>x = await foo()</code>, we simply had <code>x = foo()</code> and didn't then go on to <code>await x</code>. Mypy doesn't have means to detect this at present. There was interest in <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/2499">this issue</a> on such a feature, with related threads <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5597">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/5650">here</a>.</p>
<p>Are there other opportunities to spot the error? Here's the relevant bit of source code from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/2e3b7576b17e92080319e08c0c0ebf566935636c/sydent/http/servlets/msisdnservlet.py#L93-L98">before the fix</a>.</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>            sid = self.sydent.validators.msisdn.requestToken(
</span><span>                phone_number_object, clientSecret, sendAttempt, brand
</span><span>            )
</span><span>            resp = {
</span><span>                </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;success&quot;</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">True</span><span>,
</span><span>                </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;sid&quot;</span><span>: str(sid),
</span><span>                </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;msisdn&quot;</span><span>: msisdn,
</span><span>                </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;intl_fmt&quot;</span><span>: intl_fmt,
</span><span>            }
</span></code></pre>
<p>The call to <code>requestToken</code> produces a value of type <code>Awaitable[int]</code>. If we tried to assign that to an expression of type <code>int</code> we'd get an error that mypy can spot.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>$ cat example.py
</span><span>async def foo() -&gt; int:
</span><span>    return 1
</span><span>
</span><span>async def bar():
</span><span>    x = foo()      # no error
</span><span>    y: int = foo() # error: rhs is Awaitable[int], but lhs expects int
</span><span>
</span><span>$ mypy --check-untyped-defs example.py
</span><span>example.py:6: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type &quot;Coroutine[Any, Any, int]&quot;, variable has type &quot;int&quot;)
</span><span>Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that we have to specifically ask mypy to typecheck the body of <code>bar</code> by passing <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-check-untyped-defs">--check-untyped-defs</a>; by default, <code>mypy</code> will only typecheck annotated code.</p>
<p>We might also have been able to detect the error by looking at how we used <code>sid</code>. Unfortunately, the only use of was in a conversion <code>str(sid)</code>, which is a perfectly type-safe call for both <code>sid: int</code> and <code>sid: Awaitable[int]</code>. But let's put that aside for a second—suppose we added <code>&quot;sid&quot;: sid</code> directly into the <code>resp</code> dictionary. Could mypy have spotted there was a problem with <em>that</em>?</p>
<p>Unfortunately not. Because <code>resp</code> has no annotation, we have to rely on how it's used to spot any type inconsistencies. There's only one use of <code>resp</code>: as the return value from its enclosing function, <code>render_POST</code>. Mypy's only chance to spot a type problem would be to compare the mypy's inferred type for <code>resp</code> to the return type of <code>render_POST</code>. What are those types? We can use <code>reveal_type</code> to see the former is <code>Dict[str, object]</code>. For the latter:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>    @jsonwrap
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">def </span><span>render_POST(self, request: Request) -&gt; JsonDict:
</span></code></pre>
<p>The return type is <code>JsonDict</code>, which is an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/2e3b7576b17e92080319e08c0c0ebf566935636c/sydent/types.py#L17">alias</a> for <code>Dict[str, Any]</code>. This is bad news, because <code>Dict[str, object]</code> and <code>Dict[str, Any]</code> are compatible. Digging a level deeper, this is because <code>sid: Any</code> holds true for both <code>sid: int</code> and <code>sid: Awaitable[int]</code>—so there's no error to spot here. The <code>Any</code> type is compatible with any other type whatsoever! Mypy uses <code>Any</code> as a way to <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/kinds_of_types.html#the-any-type">defer all type checking to runtime</a>; mypy won't (and can't!) statically analyse the usage of an expression of type <code>Any</code>. Indeed, mypy's reports will tell you how many <code>Any</code>s you're working with, and offer a variety of options to <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#disallow-dynamic-typing">warn or error on usages of <code>Any</code></a>.</p>
<p>If we were inserting <code>sid</code> directly into a dictionary, we could do better by annotating the dictionary (or the function's return type) as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict">TypedDict</a>. This is a way to specify a dictionary with a fixed set of keys, each with a fixed type. It comes in really handy for Sydent, Sygnal and Synapse—all of <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/">the Matrix APIs</a> exchange JSON dictionaries, so anything we can do to teach mypy about their shape and types is gold dust.</p>
<p>In short, there were options for detecting this with some code changes, but no magic wand that would have spotted the error in the code as written.</p>
<h3 id="the-strings-bytes-confusion">The strings/bytes confusion</h3>
<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/415/files#diff-4b3e0551612818927c87fe0100262ec230e0342def9d3f09214b93dea3efacb8L103-R107">error</a> was here:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>        headers = dict(resp.headers.getAllRawHeaders())

</span></code></pre>
<p>In this sample, <code>resp.headers</code> is a <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.web.http_headers.Headers.html">twisted.web.http_headers.Headers</a> instance. <code>getAllRawHeaders</code> is <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.web.http_headers.Headers.html#getAllRawHeaders">documented</a> as returning an iterable of <code>(bytes, Sequence[bytes])</code> pairs. Even better, mypy can see this because <code>getAllRawHeaders</code> is <a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/5c24e99e671c4082a1ddc8dbeb869402294bd0dc/src/twisted/web/http_headers.py#L261">annotated</a> (many thanks to the twisted authors for this). Mypy should be able to deduce that we build a dictionary <code>headers: Dict[bytes, Sequence[bytes]</code>. We can check this using <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html#when-you-re-puzzled-or-when-things-are-complicated"><code>reveal_type</code></a>:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>        headers = dict(resp.headers.getAllRawHeaders())
</span><span>        reveal_type(headers)
</span></code></pre>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>$ mypy
</span><span>sydent/sms/openmarket.py:110: note: Revealed type is &quot;builtins.dict[builtins.bytes*, typing.Sequence*[builtins.bytes]]&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>(The <code>*</code> in <code>builtins.bytes*</code> here means mypy has <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50499509/5252017">inferred</a> that the dictionary's keys are bytes, rather than being told explicitly that they must be bytes.)</p>
<p>That's all fine and dandy. But why didn't we spot this before if the annotations were all in place in twisted? Let's put aside the fact that, erm, we weren't running mypy in Sydent's CI <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/416">until the recent sprint</a>, unlike our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/5640992d176a499204a0756b1677c9b1575b0a49/.github/workflows/tests.yml#L21">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/blob/4a7367e84476a4b1054b1fe20e9e06f9f66e27f8/.github/workflows/pipeline.yml#L18-L26">projects</a>. Checking out the problematic version, we can run mypy on the file we know to contain the bug.</p>

<p>Huh. Mypy spots something, but not the error we were hoping for. What's going on here? We can ask mypy to show its working with <code>reveal_type</code> again.</p>

<p>Ahh, the <code>Any</code> type. As mentioned above, this represents a value whose type can't be statically determined. We're left to runtime checks to detect the problem. But we won't detect it at runtime, because dictionaries don't enforce any kind of type requirements on their keys and values.</p>
<p>The problem here is that mypy can't see that <code>resp.headers</code> is a twisted <code>Headers</code> object. If we could inform it of this, mypy would spot our bug:</p>

<p>Unfortunately it'd be a pain to annotate our application code to mark every use of <code>IResponse.headers</code> as a <code>Headers</code> object. We'll see a better way to do things in this <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/10/type-coverage-for-sydent-annotation">the next post</a>, which discusses the nitty-gritty details of adding annotations file-by-file.</p>

            <h2 id="a-full-day-of-matrix-talks">A full day of Matrix talks</h2>
<p>This year, the Matrix.org Foundation is excited to host the first ever <em>Matrix.org Foundation and Community</em> devroom at FOSDEM. A full day of talks, demos and workshops around Matrix itself and projects built on top of Matrix.</p>
<p>Matrix is the open source project that publishes the Matrix open standard for secure, decentralised, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed reference implementations.</p>
<p>We encourage people working on the Matrix protocol or building on it in an open source project to submit a proposal! Note that companies are welcome to talk about the Matrix details of their open source projects, but marketing talks are not welcome.</p>
<p>We want this devroom to be a space where the Matrix community can show its work, where developers can talk about the challenges they faced and how they overcame them, and where people can get a glimpse of the future of the Matrix protocol and ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="talk-details">Talk Details</h2>
<p>The talks will be pre-recorded in January. They will be played during FOSDEM, followed by a session of live Q&amp;A depending on the format. During the playback of the talk, people will be able to comment and ask questions in the chat (via Matrix!).</p>
<p>The talks can follow one of three formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 min lightning talk, ideal to showcase your project and make people want to have a look at it</li>
<li>20 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A, for topics that can be covered briefly</li>
<li>50 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A for more complex subjects which need more focus</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly encourage you to prepare a demo when it makes sense, so people can actually see what your work looks like in practice!</p>
<p>Of course, the proposal must respect the FOSDEM terms as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conference language is English. All content must relate to Free and Open Source Software. By participating in the event you agree to the publication of your recordings, slides and other content provided under the same licence as all FOSDEM content (CC-BY).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="submitting-a-proposal">Submitting a Proposal</h2>
<p>Proposals must be <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22">submitted on FOSDEM's conference management system Pentabarf</a> before December 17th 2021. If you are not used to Pentabarf, you can follow this <a href="https://eyskens.me/beginners-guide-to-pentabarf/">beginners guide to Pentabarf</a>.</p>
<p>We expect to receive more requests than we have slots available. The devroom organisers (two community members and one core team rep) will be reviewing the proposals and accepting them based on the potential positive impact the project has on Matrix (as defined in by the Mission section of https://matrix.org/foundation).</p>
<p>If a project proposal has been turned down, it doesn't mean we don't believe it has good potential. Maintainers are invited to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> Matrix room to give it some visibility.</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.48.0">Synapse 1.48.0</a> is out now!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Synapse 1.49, due out on December 14th, will be the <strong>last release of Synapse to support Python 3.6 or PostgreSQL 9.6</strong> per our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.48/deprecation_policy.html">platform dependency deprecation policy</a>. Accordingly, we will remove support for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) at the same date, as it ships with Python 3.6.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="password-resets-and-identity-servers">Password resets and identity servers</h2>
<p>This release removes the long-deprecated <code>trust_identity_server_for_password_resets</code> configuration option. This option was initially deprecated in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.4.0">Synapse 1.4.0</a> back in October 2019.</p>
<p>Admins of servers still using this configuration option will need to update their Synapse configuration to send password resets through an SMTP server directly rather than relying on identity servers to send them on their behalf.</p>
<h2 id="new-admin-apis-and-improved-alignment-with-matrix-1-1">New <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin APIs</a> and improved alignment with Matrix 1.1</h2>
<p>This release also introduces a handful of new admin APIs, allowing administrators to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#controlling-whether-a-user-is-shadow-banned">un-shadow-ban users</a>, <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#block-room-api">block a room</a>, and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/background_updates.html#run">run specific background updates</a> (but we'll talk about this last one a bit later on). The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#delete-room-api">delete room API</a> has also been updated to be able to run in the background or to block a room pre-emptively, even if the server doesn't know about it yet.</p>
<p>This release also brings Synapse into greater alignment with version 1.1 of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">the Matrix specification</a> by adding support for API paths beginning <code>/_matrix/client/v3</code> and <code>/_matrix/media/v3</code>.</p>
<h2 id="background-updates">Background updates</h2>
<p>When Synapse updates from one version to another, it might need to run large scale updates on its database. In order to avoid blocking startup for too long while waiting for these updates to run, Synapse runs them in the background after starting.</p>
<p>Lately the Synapse team has been doing some work to improve the performance of these background updates. More specifically, this release includes a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11421">performance fix</a> for a background update introduced in Synapse 1.47.0, as well as a <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/background_updates.html#run">new admin API</a> to let admins rerun specific updates.</p>
<p>Future Synapse updates will also include <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11306">module capabilities</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11260">more configuration options</a> for controlling background updates.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release also includes some improved support of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> to help threading. It also adds support for the stable identifiers from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2778">MSC2778</a>, bringing Synapse closer to supporting end-to-end (or end-to-bridge) encryption support for application services.</p>
<p>We also now publish a Docker image, <code>matrixdotorg/synapse:develop</code>, which tracks the development head of Synapse.</p>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.48.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/binarymaster">Stanislav Motylkov</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tulir">Tulir Asokan</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Neeeflix">Neeeflix</a>.</p>

<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (serverside aggregations) is getting lots of updates from Bruno in order to align the proposal with what is currently implemented in the wild (as it's easier to iterate on incremental improvements from a starting point grounded in reality). This MSC is a bit of a special case though, as it was implemented with stable prefixes before the MSC landed (in the before times...).</p>
<p>Regardless, thank you very much to Bruno for going through and finally untangling and help land aggregations in the spec! This MSC is one of four which describe how aggregations should work in Matrix, and it's great to see them finally being properly spec'd, especially as further features start to be built on top of them (such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440/">threading</a>!).</p>
<p>And finally, a further thank you to community members <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3509">an OpenAPI schema fix</a>!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a>!</p>
<p>This proposal aims to allow appservices to get ever greater visibility into what is happening on the homeserver, while still maintaining full process separation.</p>
<p>A lot of the time solutions to complex problems require knowing when a user has registered or logged in, with what name/3pids etc, when users change their emails, etc. Hooking into these non-room-based actions can help with developing useful features. Maybe you want an appservice that plays a sound effect whenever a user signs up to your homeserver!</p>
<p>These days, that is often achieved by homeserver implementation-specific solutions, such as <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/">modules</a> in Synapse. Being able to notify of these events using a standard API shape would be hugely beneficial to generalisation of projects.</p>
<p>So give the proposal a look over and review if that interests you!

<p>As predicted last week, we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/23/synapse-1-47-1-released">released Synapse 1.47.1</a> on Tuesday. This is a security release which fixes an issue with Synapse's built-in media repository. Admins are strongly encouraged to upgrade.</p>
<p>Otherwise, relatively slow week: a handful of of the team have been away (Happy Thanksgiving, Americans!), but we <em>did</em> release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.48.0rc1">Synapse 1.48.0rc1</a>. Most importantly, this release candidate includes changes to improve the efficiency of large background updates from past releases, which should significantly reduce database load when upgrading. It also adds support for the <code>/v3</code> APIs defined in version 1.1 of the Matrix specification.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about 1.48 when it's formally released next week, but as always, we appreciate folks trying out the release candidates and letting us know how they behave.</p>

Matrix Webhook Receiver (MWR) is an add-on for the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-webhooks">matrix-appservice-webhooks</a> bridge. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">Webhooks</a> are essentially web interfaces for applications to &quot;push&quot; data to.
The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.</p>
<p>This is where MWR comes in:
It can receive any (JSON) content, optionally reformat it nicely (customizable!), and forward it to the webhooks bridge which will post it to a room for you. If you are running any software service, there is a good chance it can notify you via webhooks!</p>
<p>Right now, several example configurations exist, ready for you to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>GitLab (including Community Edition/self hosted)</li>
<li>Ansible Tower/AWX</li>
<li>Grafana Alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here is the GitHub webhook as seen in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org">#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org</a>:
<img src="/blog/img/webhook_receiver.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>More examples of apps currently in development: Prometheus Alertmanager, Jellyfin</p>
<p>It is also easy to use to send messages from the commandline with standard tools (<code>curl</code>), e.g. for your cron jobs! See the README for an example.</p>
<p>Some other webhook matrix things exist, but often require</p>
<ul>
<li>➖ admin access to server (appservices)</li>
<li>➖ installing and running and maintaining a specific bot per service</li>
<li>➖ create and set up accounts and passwords for each bot to use</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, MWR requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>➖ matrix-appservice-webhooks set up on your server by your admin</li>
<li>➖ some knowledge of how to send POST requests for one time setup. I want to improve that, suggestions are welcome!</li>
<li>➕ MWR can be installed and run by anyone who can access the bridge</li>
<li>➕ one single MWR supports any amount of notifying apps!</li>
<li>➕ you don't need admin access to the server to add more apps</li>
<li>➕ no need to develop a bot/plugin to support new apps, just write a quick jinja template</li>
<li>➕ multiple people can use a single MWR instance by sharing HTTP basic auth credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>Other features:</p>
<ul>
<li>can post into encrypted rooms (see readme)</li>
<li>automatically generated API docs</li>
<li>message formatting presets including html markup or m.notice</li>
<li>arbitrarily customizable webhook URLs</li>
<li>list and manage currently installed webhooks in your browser (<a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver/blob/main/examples/GUI_screenshot.png">screenshot</a>)</li>

<p>What a massive update! At this rate I won't need to leave my Matrix client for anything!</p>
<h3 id="matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot">↗</a></h3>
<p>A multi purpose multi platform bridge, formerly known as matrix-github</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks! Some exciting new news on the bridge front: I've renamed <code>matrix-github</code> to <code>matrix-hookshot</code> to better reflect it's not-just-GitHub-ness. That's not all though, as there are new features too:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridge now supports <strong>Rust</strong> as a companion language (we're aiming to rewrite critical sections in rust). Some parts of the formatting code have already been rewritten.</li>
<li>The bridge now supports JIRA (full puppeting!)</li>
<li>The bridge now supports generic webhooks too, with the ability to write <strong>custom handling code</strong> inside the state event to process these hooks into pretty messages.</li>
<li>Basic support for GitHub discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the works:</p>
<ul>
<li>A provisioning API to hook into integration managers</li>
<li>More GitLab support</li>
<li>Better GitHub discussions support</li>
</ul>
<p>We're not quite ready for a 0.2.0 release, but please check us out at https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot.</p>

<p>An interesting update, and Half-Shot even demoes it in today's Matrix Live!</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the 0.9.0 release last week, we have of course been busy fixing all the bugs different people reported. Messing around with the sticker pack editor and then leaving room should not make Nheko crash anymore. The problems where the flatpak has issues starting on Gnome systems are still under investigation. We thought we had a solution, but that seems to have broken other stuff! 💥</p>
<p>Apart from that we have been doing some after release party cleanup. Apart from some refactorings, you can now filter your rooms on whether they are a direct chat or not in the sidebar. This is in addition to the filters we already had for favourites, spaces and your other personal tags. User colors should also now be much less biased towards blue and jdenticons should have more variance. Expect the next release to be a much more colorful experience!</p>
<p>Speaking of colors, Twily made this awesome ZX Spectrum inspired logo after we changed our Gitlab bot to be more colorful! Check it out:

<p>maubot <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> was released last weekend. Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling encryption should be much easier: the device ID can be entered in the web UI or you can just do <code>mbc auth --update-client</code> to automatically log in and store the access token and device ID in maubot.</li>
<li><code>mbc auth</code> can now log in with SSO.</li>
<li>The standalone mode for running a single plugin with a static config is now mostly functional and <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/maubot/usage/standalone.html">somewhat documented</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I finally took a day to figure out Sphinx/autodoc and made some decent-looking autogenerated <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/python/latest/">docs for mautrix-python</a>. I'll probably extend that to generate maubot-specific API references too eventually.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev">MTRNord</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today is a good day for those calling me a spy, someone not wanting to care about privacy and for those who did publicly harass me for server_stats.</p>
<p>People using the API likely already noticed it wasn't reachable for a while. Effective immediately I am currently leaving all rooms  the bot is part of. This will take days or even months considering this are 6397 rooms at the time of writing. I am not going into the motives of why I am shutting it down. It comes down to personal reasons.</p>
<p>There won't be any dump of the data. The source will be kept public. Note though if anyone ever tries to run it that you need about 600GB of space for synapse, a lot of CPU, a lot of RAM and plenty of workers as this can easily crash synapse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Server_Stats was an incredibly useful project. It pains me a lot to see it go, but it pains me even further that its author got harassed. This is not an acceptable behaviour, and we are better than that as a community. Thanks for this incredible project MTRNord, it's been both exciting and useful.</p>

            <p>Today we are releasing Synapse 1.47.1, a security update based on last week's release of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/17/synapse-1-47-0-released">Synapse 1.47.0</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.1">release</a> patches one high severity issue affecting Synapse installations 1.47.0 and earlier using the media repository. An attacker could cause these Synapses to download a remote file and store it in a directory outside the media repository. </p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>This only affects homeservers using Synapse's built-in media repository, as opposed to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse-s3-storage-provider">synapse-s3-storage-provider</a> or <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a>.</li>
<li>Attackers cannot control the exact name or destination of the stored file.</li>
</ul>
<p>To quote from the advisory:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="ghsa-3hfw-x7gx-437c-cve-2021-41281-path-traversal-when-downloading-remote-media"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-3hfw-x7gx-437c">GHSA-3hfw-x7gx-437c</a> / CVE-2021-41281: Path traversal when downloading remote media.</h3>
<h4 id="impact">Impact</h4>
<p>Synapse instances with the media repository enabled can be tricked into downloading a file from a remote server into an arbitrary directory, potentially outside the media store directory.</p>
<p>The last two directories and file name of the path are chosen randomly by Synapse and cannot be controlled by an attacker, which limits the impact.</p>
<p>Homeservers with the media repository disabled are unaffected. Homeservers configured with a federation whitelist are also unaffected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-3hfw-x7gx-437c">advisory</a> has full details, including workarounds.</p>
<p>This issue was discovered and fixed by our internal security team.</p>
<p>Please update at your earliest convenience.</p>

            <p>Friday already? Did this week already happen? It looked like the spacetime continuum was broken and we didn't know who did it. We needed witnesses to solve the case: did things really happen this week? And the witnesses showed up! A huge thanks to everyone in the Matrix community who reported their progress, and to everyone currently working on making awesome projects around Matrix!</p>
<p>The case is closed: the week has not been stolen from us. Time appears to have wings, and flies faster than we had anticipated.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h3 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h3>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3489">MSC3489: Sharing streams of location data</a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>This week we finally, finally had one of the aggregation-related MSCs, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> (event relationships) enter final comment period! This MSC, along with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issue-406544216">several others</a>, document the stuff that powers message edit, reactions, the upcoming threading and polls MSCs, and much more! So it's really great to see the MSCs start to actually land.</p>
<p>Speaking of threading <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> has had a good amount of review from the Spec Core Team last week. Threading in Matrix has been a long awaited feature for chat applications - as well as helping extend the flexibility of Matrix as a data structure even further. The MSC relies on both <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (or a modified version of it), so the latter will be an area of focus for review for next week.</p>
<h3 id="spec-prs">Spec PRs</h3>
<p>It seems that the recent <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">Matrix v1.1</a> has drummed up some more community support for spec PRs. Thank you to everyone who's sent in clarifications, changes and even typo fixes. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aankur12-1610">fixes to the OpenAPI fields, and for typo corrections in the spec copy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for helping review them. Thank you both! </p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2867">MSC2867: Marking rooms as unread</a>!</p>
<p>This is definitely a feature that I would love to have for chat. Note that this MSC proposes marking <em>a room</em> as unread, rather than a specific point in the room's timeline. This is intentional as noted in the document, as the latter is more complicated, as it intersects with sending out read receipts to other users.

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> we plan to release a <strong>security release, Synapse 1.47.1</strong> on the coming <strong>Tuesday, 23rd of November</strong>; see the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/18/pre-disclosure-upcoming-security-release-of-synapse-1-47-1">predisclosure</a>.</p>
<p>We released Synapse 1.47.0 after squashing a couple of problems related to database migrations remaining in 1.47.0rc2.  Briefly, this release includes</p>
<ul>
<li>new features for users of the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin</a> and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">module</a> APIs;</li>
<li>a number of long-standing bug fixes, including a thorny bug which prevented joining certain old rooms; and</li>
<li>continuing efforts to prototype new MSCs and improve type coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/17/synapse-1-47-0-released">blog post</a> has a better summary, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0">GitHub</a> has the full gory details.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.1">Sydent 2.5.1</a>, a minor release which improves the way we handle and log various error cases.</p>
<p>Thank you as ever to our community contributors, and everyone out there who's using Synapse to communicate!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> also reminds us</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we release the fix, the changes will be publicly known and bad actors will have the ability to deduce the vulnerability. Most servers don't run release candidates, so releasing the fix in an RC will mean there's a larger window for an attacker to exploit the problem. Internally, there will be an RC deployed to test homeservers and eventually matrix.org. This means we'll be able to confidently recommend the upgrade to server administrators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dkasak:termina.org.uk">dkasak</a> adds</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that's the very reason we have dedicated security releases, instead of just rolling the security fixes into a feature release. The security release doesn't contain anything new apart from the security fix so it minimizes the chance of things going wrong.</p>

<p>Keep your servers up to date, and your users safe, administrators!</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.7.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement &quot;best effort&quot; basic IRC moderation in plumbed rooms if bot has ops on IRC</li>
<li>Allow configuring topic sync for plumbs (IRC&lt;-&gt;Matrix or one way)</li>
<li>Allow using forward slash (/) as MXID separator for IRC ghosts</li>
<li>Bump max mautrix version to &lt;0.12</li>
<li>Small fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Plumb moderation! If the bridge bot has ops on IRC it will do its best to map kicks and bans (regarding IRC users) from Matrix. This definitely isn't perfect and is meant as a convenience.</p>
<p>Topic synchronization is now configurable for plumbs as well to make it possible to share the same topic between an IRC channel and a plumbed Matrix room. Default is still off and it requires the bridge bot to have enough PL to work.</p>
<p>The separator for IRC ghosts can now be changed to forward slash (/) from the default underscore (_). This happens by modifying the regex in the registration file. Only do this for new installations and it will cause <em>all</em> IRC users to duplicate in rooms who you can't remove and probably other bad side effects as well. The default may be changed in the future.</p>
<p>There were lots of refactoring issues so I hope I fixed all of them 🙈.</p>
<p>Best effort your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="mjolnir-v1-2-1-released">Mjölnir v1.2.1 released</h3>
<ul>
<li>New feature: if a user on your homeserver reports abuse, Mjölnir may now show the abuse report in your moderation room and offer you two-click moderation options. This feature is considered a preview for the time being.</li>
<li>Performance improvements for protections that need to lock back in the history of a room, decreasing the number of cases in which we could end up timing out.</li>
<li>Many improvements to testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Any rumor of a v1.2.0 Docker image borked by yours truly is sadly true. There should be no risk in 1.2.0 but, to be on the safe side, if you have updated to 1.2.0, please update to 1.2.1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's one feature I've wanted for a while, and it's going to make moderation a lot easier! Thanks Mjolnir teams for keeping us safe!</p>

<p>There was the &quot;Sign in with Matrix&quot; project recently</p>
<p>I tried to do something similar with https://matrix-login.lyc.fi / https://gitlab.com/ptman/matrix-login</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An important note on the interesting projects using Matrix for the login: those are community projects, and there are MSCs in the works to &quot;do it right&quot; at the Spec level!</p>
<p>As Matthew Hodgson <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29242445">reported in a comment on Hacker News</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The direction we're headed in the Matrix spec core team is instead towards replacing Matrix's current auth mechanisms with normal Open ID Connect (rather than wrapping our own OIDC-like thing, as we do today) - as per https://github.com/sandhose/matrix-doc/blob/msc/sandhose/oauth2-profile/proposals/2964-oauth2-profile.md The common login flow would then be for users to be authed by their server using a trusted OIDC identity provider, rather than ever trusting arbitrary clients with their credentials.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have compiled <a href="https://austinhuang.me/matrix-homeservers.html">a list of public homeservers</a> available for registration, since previous such efforts to make these homeservers more discoverable fell through. This list serves as a sanitized version of the asra.gr list, with only homeservers intended for public consumption included. It is a static list and does not include pings, but rather than focusing on the technical aspect, my list has an emphasis on the written rules of a homeserver, which I believe to play a larger role in the Matrix experience. Hope this can spark other efforts in maintaining a better list!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's one very useful list of hand curated servers! The transparency about the inclusion criteria is very much appreciated. Good job!</p>

<p>Hi everyone! Did you ever feel lost in the Matrix world? The room directory is big, but it's still hard to find something you like. Or are you a room moderator, but there is not much activity in your room because it doesn't have enough users?</p>

            <p>On <strong>Tuesday, 23rd November</strong> we plan to release Synapse 1.47.1 at 12:00 UTC to address a single high severity issue. This vulnerability was discovered internally by our security team. Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org team and the wider Matrix community.</p>
<p>If you're a server administrator running Synapse, <strong>please be prepared to upgrade as soon as the patched version is released</strong>.</p>
<p>We will be reaching out to downstream packagers to ensure they can prepare patched versions of affected packages at the time of the release. The details of the vulnerability will be disclosed in a blog post on the day of the release. There is so far no evidence of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience while we work to resolve this issue.</p>
<p><em>Edit, 2021-11-19: The opening paragraph was amended to note that the vulnerability was discovered internally.</em></p>
<p><em>Edit, 2021-11-22: The opening paragraph was amended to include a release time of 12:00 UTC.</em></p>
