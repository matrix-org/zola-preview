        <div>
            <p>It was drawn to our attention this afternoon that there is a bug in our GDPR data portability tooling that resulted in the data dump including some events that should not have been included.</p>
<p>This tooling has recently been updated (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/baf081cd3b040926e2d14dfd1c555307bba59245/synapse/handlers/admin.py#L98">here is the new code</a>), and the bug only affects reports generated with the updated tool. So far we have generated one report using the updated tooling.</p>
<p>The bug affects events which:</p>
<ul>
<li>were sent in rooms in which, at the point at which the message was sent, the message visibility was set to 'shared' or 'world readable', and</li>
<li>were pulled in over federation from another server after the data subject left the room</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, 'shared' message visibility means <em>anyone in the room can view the message, from the point in time at which visibility was set to 'shared'</em> and 'world readable' means <em>anyone can read the messages without joining the room, from the point in time at which visibility was set to 'world readable'</em>.</p>
<p>Events are pulled onto a homeserver over federation when a user on that homeserver tries to access events which, for whatever reason, their homeserver does not already have a local copy. This most often happens when their homeserver is offline for any period of time, but can also happen when a user is the first user from their homeserver to join a room with active participants on other homeservers.</p>
<p>We're still analysing the data but so far it looks like the bug resulted in only a small number of events that were not publicly-accessible being shared (there were also publicly-accessible events mistakenly included). At this stage we have identified 19 events from 4 users across 2 rooms (the dump contained ~3.5 million events). This is not to diminish the severity of the bug - just to reassure that the scale of its impact appears to be extremely limited.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that any encrypted events erroneously included in the dump will not have been decryptable (since the data subject would not have had access to the keys).</p>
<h3 id="update-2019-08-06">Update (2019-08-06)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In our original analysis we stated that 19 events were shared erroneously. On closer analysis we missed 5 other timeline events - the correct figure is 24 timeline events originating from 4 users over 2 rooms. However, this figure focused on timeline data and does not take into account all state events (such as user joins, parts, topic changes etc). When considering these too, a further 56 state events were erroneously shared, referencing 64 users across these 2 rooms (mainly detailing when users had joined/left the room after the requesting user themselves had left). These membership events contained avatar &amp; display name details which may not have been public (but in practice, the vast majority appear to be public data).</p>
<p>Aside from the events referenced above, the full dump contained ~20,000 events that also ought not to have been included; however <strong>these events were already publicly accessible due to being part of publicly accessible rooms</strong> (eg Matrix HQ) and so we do not consider them a breach of data.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-caused-the-bug">What caused the bug?</h2>
<p>Events that are pulled in over federation are assigned a negative 'stream ordering' ID. This is designed to avoid their being sent down the sync (where they would likely be out of sequence). In normal operation (accessing your homeserver via a Matrix client) these events would be appropriately filtered, but a bug in the data dump tooling caused them to be included.</p>
<p>The bug was introduced as a result of two factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The event filtering code assumes that the user is currently in the room - this was not intuitive, and was not called out in the documentation</li>
<li>When we fetched the events from the database, we tried to limit to events sent before the user left the room. On reflection, we used the wrong ordering mechanism (stream ordering instead of topological ordering), resulting in the inclusion of events that were fetched from a remote server after the data subject had left</li>
</ul>
<p>We are working to fix the bug, and we'll update here when it is resolved. As a reminder, please do report security bugs responsibly as per the <a href="https://matrix.org/security-disclosure-policy/">Security Disclosure Policy</a> so we can validate the issue and mitigate abuse.</p>
<p>As is standard practice for any data breach, we have notified the ICO.</p>

            <p>As a step towards implementing Terms of Service for Sydent Identity Servers (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2140">MSC2140</a>), we're rolling out a couple of changes to the two Identity Servers run by New Vector (running at vector.im and matrix.org):</p>
<ol>
<li>We have erased all of the data where there is any chance that the data subject didn't understand how, why or with whom their data was being shared.</li>
<li>We've made a change to Sydent so that it no longer persists new associations relating to users on homeservers not run by New Vector.</li>
</ol>
<p>The impact of these changes is that users on homeservers not run by New Vector will no longer be discoverable by their email or telephone number via the Identity Servers running at vector.im and matrix.org. As we roll out the rest of the changes for Terms of Service for Identity Servers, this functionality will again be made available for users who make an informed choice to opt in.</p>
<h2 id="registration-with-email-and-password-reset">Registration with Email and Password Reset</h2>
<p>In the short term, the New Vector Identity Servers will continue to support registration with email (signing up with an email address as well as a matrix username) and password reset. However, as we continue to improve Identity Server data hygiene practices, we will phase out their use in registration with email and password reset entirely. We have already made the change to Synapse to support password reset without relying on an Identity Server (though this can optionally be re-enabled).</p>
<p>Once Synapse can support registration with email without relying on an Identity Server <strong>we will announce a schedule for disabling registration with email and password reset in our Identity Servers entirely</strong>. After this point, homeserver administrators will have to make sure their homeservers are configured to send email to keep registration with email and password reset working. More details on this to follow - please watch this space.</p>

We have a number of community PRs still with active members, but most are waiting for reviews, which <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> is working towards.</p>
<h4 id="the-plan">The Plan</h4>
<p>A couple TWIMs ago we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/05/this-week-in-matrix-2019-07-05">teased</a> that Dendrite had a plan in the works. Well one meeting later and here is the proposal:</p>
<p>It will take a while for Dendrite to become feature complete with Synapse, but we’d like people to be able to actually use Dendrite before then. Instead of waiting for feature-completeness, we propose a set of milestones for Dendrite development to reach and prioritize development for.</p>
<p>These milestones are currently listed on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/milestones">Dendrite’s github</a>. The first is “Bot Hosting”, which means, once complete, Dendrite would be suitable as a “bot hub”, allowing server admins to run massive bridges on top of Dendrite while taking advantage of its horizontal-scaling capabilities. As written in the description, this goal includes basic CS API support, as well as federation with other homeservers. At this stage Dendrite should already be usable in rooms with other Synapse servers, which should make it a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>After that is several more milestones, each representing another use case that Dendrite can fill.</p>
<p>Don’t be alarmed at the currently quite small percentage of completeness, as these milestones have just been built from the open issue list. We’re actually quite far along to #1 already :)</p>
<p>We also want to mention that the milestones aren’t completely built yet - there’s still a few more issues to comb through. It’s taken a few days as <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> can’t help himself to fix things as he goes along. A few open issues have also been closed as they had already been fixed earlier.</p>
<p>This is all mentioned in this week’s Matrix Live above by the way, so be sure to catch for some extra details if you’re interested.</p>
<p>We look forward to shipping you a working Dendrite soon™. And as always feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!yjVgJUsMLYLAONsoii:jki.re?via=matrix.org&amp;via=privacytools.io&amp;via=ru-matrix.org">#dendrite-dev:matrix.org</a> for discussion.</p>

<p>I've written a <a href="https://github.com/Madic-/Scripts/tree/master/Linux/sendtomatrix">linux shell script</a> with which you can send (multiline) messages to a matrix room. It only needs a username / password or access token, server fqdn and roomid as argument or provided by a configuration file. Arguments can overwrite settings from the file, for e.g. using same credentials but different channel. If no access token is provided, a new one will be requested and used to send the message. You can use the script for e.g. cronjobs, nagios notifications or ci pipelines. An example for a cronjob and a nagios notification script is also provided.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>If you’ve been looking for a way to have you own Matrix homeserver without having to run it yourself, you may be interested to hear that <a href="https://modular.im">Modular</a> (the Matrix hosting provider run by <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a>, the startup which hires many of the Matrix core team) is now offering a personal-sized small homeserver hosting service, supporting a minimum size of 5 user servers.</p>
<p>A lot of recent performance work on Synapse has been driven by the need to make smaller dedicated servers more efficient to run - and so if you run your own homeserver you’ll be benefiting from all this work too :)  Meanwhile, if you choose to outsource your server hosting to Modular, you’ll be indirectly supporting core Matrix and Synapse development, given most of the core Matrix team work for New Vector - it’s through buying services like this which lets us keep folks able to hack on Matrix as their day job.</p>
<p>See more details <a href="https://modular.im/personal-hosted-homeservers">over at the Modular blog post</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A bit of everything this week, we’ve made changes to support the upcoming edits and reactions release, worked on soft log out, experimented with improving general perf for small homeservers, landed open tracing support, improved db query load.<br />
Next week we’ll see about landing the small homeserver perf improvements, work on id hashing in sydent, fix some e2ee bugs (made easier to track down with OpenTracing), do some more database performance work and start gradually rolling out the new Sygnal instance.</p>

<p>Jason back on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix, <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">Construct</a> made the crazy-loading mode of client sync the default. Crazy-loading is an approach to initial sync that goes beyond lazy-loading for a better UX. It's even backwards compatible with clients that don't support lazy-loading.</p>
<p>Construct also made significant progress on implementing version 3 and 4 rooms during the week. This is nearly complete, and should be ready for testing by the weekend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good to know there is progress with new room versions as more and more rooms start to be moved over to v4. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#zemos-test:matrix.org">#zemos-test:matrix.org</a> for testing and more info.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Work continues on the major revamp of ruma-events mentioned in the last update.<br />
...<br />
There are also a few modules that are somewhat blocked on an issue in ring. Some of the types in ruma-events contain types from ruma-signatures which don't implement Clone and PartialEq because they contain types from ring which don't.<br />
...<br />
Rust 1.36 was released, and it includes stabilization of the Future trait, one of the long-awaited building blocks for first-class async support in Rust. [...] the biggest reason for Ruma's development hiatus is waiting for async networking in Rust to mature, and this is one of the final pieces of foundational support we've been waiting for. The remaining pieces are async/await syntax, which is expected in either the next version or the one following it, and finally, waiting for important libraries like Hyper and Tokio, as well as web frameworks, to adopt the new stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack">the slack bridge</a> has had another RC release this week 0.3.0-rc2 which has been deployed onto matrix.org :). In other news, we are nearly done with the port of the bridge to Typescript (slated for the 0.4 release) which has allowed us to clean up the codebase significantly and <strong>splat</strong> a lot of bugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm for any movement toward TypeScript - seems to be a winner in the JS-world. Says Half-Shot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm a bit fanatical about Typescript, it's objectively better to write things in TS than JS if you have the freedom to do so. It's also allowed us to keep the bug count down on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">Discord bridge</a>, so I'm starting to look at the other bridges for typescript support too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The new Spec proposal <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2162">MSC2162: Signaling Errors at Bridges</a> landed! It is about adding permanent errors: The ability of bridges to mark events as not delivered to all participants. While there is already code supporting the feature, the Spec process is important for getting everyone on board and finding potential problems with the current approach.</p>
<p>In spite of being a relatively small proposal, there were already a lot of suggestions and directions in which it can evolve. Shoutout and thanks to everyone who already contributed to it with their comments!</p>
<p>Meanwhile on the more practical front a <a href="https://github.com/V02460/matrix-react-sdk/tree/reliable_riot">fork of Riot Web</a> was extended to now support the actual visual display of bridge error markings on messages.</p>

Continuum also loads previews for http image links in text messages automatically. The usual http cache control rules are still followed in those cases.</p>

This includes some last minute polish of reactions and edits, and also adds initial support for soft logout. This release will have reactions and message editing enabled via configuration on riot.im once it stabilises.<br />
Self-hosted installs that wish to do the same would need to alter their config.json in similar fashion. This is because these features currently depend on unstable APIs, and we don't want to move them out of labs and fully on by default until that is resolved.</p>

<p>I had/stole the idea to create a bot which uses message edits to send frames of an ASCII-art animation. I indeed created the bot, which works to a degree, but is quickly punished by rate-limiting, which limits the effectiveness. Still it's quite fun, you can <a href="https://github.com/benparsons/matrix-ascii-bot">check out the code here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>'s work on <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> is interesting for bot or other client devs, and there is a new guide available: <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-matrix-bot-sdk">http://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-matrix-bot-sdk</a></p>

<p>Dendrite continues marching forward! As more attention is turned towards our fairly lengthy PR list, contributors who have not done so already are reminded to merge Dendrite's master branch into their PRs, as converting the project to go modules caused a lot of conflicts. A tag has been added to each PR that needs forward merging, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Aneeds-merge-foward">visible here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="synapse-1-1-0-released">Synapse 1.1.0 released</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/04/synapse-1-1-0-released">shipped v1.1.0</a>, which provides an overhaul of docker configuration, more authentication options and improved db io. It’s worth noting that v1.1.0 is the first Synapse release to drop support for Python 2 (and Postgres 9.4), this paves the way for using Python 3 only functionality.</p>
<p>We’ve been working on supporting soft logout, more edits and reactions support, open tracing support not to mention a complete rewrite of the push server Sygnal. We’ll be rolling out new Sygnal gradually over the next week or two.</p>
<p>Finally, aided by dropping Python 2 support, we’ve been putting in a bunch of work to improve Synapse in resource constrained environments. This will be a constant theme over the coming months.</p>

<p>A Python module meant to act as a base class for a Matrix bot.<br />
The MatrixBot class will connect to the Matrix server, start a listener on each joined room, and listen for room invites from other users.

<p><a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma-library">koma</a> got some improvements, based on what's learned developing Continuum, which is a desktop client based on it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make api calls suspendable functions (which are like Kotlin's flavor of async). This way, the caller don't need to worry about forgetting to call await or a coroutine being left unstarted.</li>
<li>Borrowing from functional programming, model the outcome of a call as a discriminated union, which can be either a success or a failure. The successful case is optimized with inline classes, an experimental feature in Kotlin 1.3, and wrapping is avoided.</li>
<li>Make MatrixError a subclass of HttpError, because the http status code can be handy</li>

<p>Another week, which means more work on the mx-puppet-bridge ecosystem! A new &gt; bridge has been added, mx-puppet-discord. Soru finally added license files &gt; (Apache-2-0) and some readmes.</p>
<h4 id="mx-puppet-bridge"><a href="https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-bridge">mx-puppet-bridge</a></h4>
<ul>

<li>relate remote event IDs to matrix event IDs</li>
<li>handle edits in both directions</li>
<li>handle redactions in both directions</li>
<li>initiating conversations from matrix! Invite a ghost for 1:1 or follow a &gt; room alias for rooms</li>

<p>This is the new puppeting bridge! The idea is that, in the long run, this will &gt; be run in conjunction with <a href="https://github.com/">matrix-appservice-discord</a> Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord), where mx-puppet-discord handles DM &gt; puppeting and matrix-appservice-discord the remaining. For this, the message &gt; parsing was split in a new repository, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-discord/matrix-discord-parser">matrix-discord-parser</a>. The idea is that, in the &gt; future, when inviting a ghost on matrix-appservice-discord it'll initiate &gt; conversation within mx-puppet-discord</p>
<ul>
<li>basic text messages</li>
<li>handle files</li>
<li>handle edits, deletes</li>

            <p>Right folks, this is our first post 1.0 release, which means that we have now
officially <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/04/08/synapse-deprecating-postgres-9-4-and-python-2-x">dropped support for Python 2 and Postgres
9.4</a>.
This means that we can start making use of Python 3 specific features and you
should expect lots of associated performance wins over the coming months. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v110">upgrade notes</a> for more.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.1.0 also contains a reworked approach to the Docker image, as well lots
of performance improvements with special focus on DB IO - expect more to come
in this area.</p>
<p>Special thanks to community member <a href="https://github.com/galexrt">Alexander
Trost</a> for rounding out  our SAML support and also
to <a href="https://github.com/dhoffend">Daniel Hoffend</a> for contributing the ability
to disable local password authentication.</p>
<p>As ever, you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.1.0">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>. Note, Synapse is now available from PyPI, pick it up <a href="https://pypi.org/project/matrix-synapse/">here</a>. Also, check out our <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/installing-synapse">Synapse installation guide page</a></p>

<h1 id="synapse-1-1-0-2019-07-04">Synapse 1.1.0 (2019-07-04)</h1>
<p>As of v1.1.0, Synapse no longer supports Python 2, nor Postgres version 9.4.
See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v110">upgrade notes</a> for more details.</p>
<p>This release also deprecates the use of environment variables to configure the
docker image. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.1.0/docker/README.md#legacy-dynamic-configuration-file-support">docker README</a>

<h2 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix regression in 1.1rc1 where OPTIONS requests to the media repo would fail. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5593">#5593</a>)</li>
<li>Removed the <code>SYNAPSE_SMTP_*</code> docker container environment variables. Using these environment variables prevented the docker container from starting in Synapse v1.0, even though they didn't actually allow any functionality anyway. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5596">#5596</a>)</li>
<li>Fix a number of &quot;Starting txn from sentinel context&quot; warnings. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5605">#5605</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="internal-changes">Internal Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update github templates. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5552">#5552</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="synapse-1-1-0rc1-2019-07-02">Synapse 1.1.0rc1 (2019-07-02)</h1>
<p>As of v1.1.0, Synapse no longer supports Python 2, nor Postgres version 9.4.
See the <a href="UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v110">upgrade notes</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added possibility to disable local password authentication. Contributed by Daniel Hoffend. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5092">#5092</a>)</li>
<li>Add monthly active users to phonehome stats. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5252">#5252</a>)</li>
<li>Allow expired user to trigger renewal email sending manually. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5363">#5363</a>)</li>
<li>Statistics on forward extremities per room are now exposed via Prometheus. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5384">#5384</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5458">#5458</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5461">#5461</a>)</li>
<li>Add --no-daemonize option to run synapse in the foreground, per issue #4130. Contributed by Soham Gumaste. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5412">#5412</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5587">#5587</a>)</li>
<li>Fully support SAML2 authentication. Contributed by <a href="https://github.com/galexrt">Alexander Trost</a> - thank you! (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5422">#5422</a>)</li>
<li>Allow server admins to define implementations of extra rules for allowing or denying incoming events. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5440">#5440</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5474">#5474</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5477">#5477</a>)</li>
<li>Add support for handling pagination APIs on client reader worker. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5505">#5505</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5513">#5513</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5531">#5531</a>)</li>
<li>Improve help and cmdline option names for --generate-config options. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5512">#5512</a>)</li>
<li>Allow configuration of the path used for ACME account keys. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5516">#5516</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5521">#5521</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5522">#5522</a>)</li>

<li>Split public rooms directory auth config in two settings, in order to manage client auth independently from the federation part of it. Obsoletes the &quot;restrict_public_rooms_to_local_users&quot; configuration setting. If &quot;restrict_public_rooms_to_local_users&quot; is set in the config, Synapse will act as if both new options are enabled, i.e. require authentication through the client API and deny federation requests. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5534">#5534</a>)</li>
<li>The minimum TLS version used for outgoing federation requests can now be set with <code>federation_client_minimum_tls_version</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/5550">#5550</a>)</li>

            <p><em>Canonical version of this article at <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-matrix-nio">https://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-matrix-nio</a></em></p>
<p>This article concerns <a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">asyncio</a>. We'll build a simple &quot;echo bot&quot;, meaning a bot which replies to messages with the text it has just read. Note that this article does not cover E2EE with matrix-nio.</p>
<h2 id="instantiation-and-login">Instantiation and Login</h2>
<p>First create a new venv, and install matrix-nio via <code>pip</code>. On the command line, run:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span>python3 -m venv env
</span><span>source env/bin/activate
</span><span>pip install matrix-nio
</span></code></pre>
<p>Next, create a new Python file, and open it for editing. We'll import everything we require for this tutorial:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">from </span><span>importlib </span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>util
</span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>asyncio
</span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">from </span><span>nio </span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">import </span><span>(AsyncClient, SyncResponse, RoomMessageText)
</span></code></pre>
<p>We're importing asyncio so we can use the <code>AsyncClient</code> class from matrix-nio.</p>
<p>Create a new instance of <code>AsyncClient</code> by passing the homeserver and username as arguments:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>async_client = AsyncClient(
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;https://matrix.org&quot;</span><span>, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">YOUR-USERNAME-HERE</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;
</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Then login, and await the response:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.login(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span>)
</span><span>print(response)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Of course, we are using an async client, and awaiting the response. Because of this, we must call the <code>async_client.login()</code> from an async method, like so:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">async def </span><span>main():
</span><span>    response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.login(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span>)
</span><span>    print(response)
</span><span>
</span><span>asyncio.run(main())
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that for versions of Python before 3.7 the asyncio syntax must be:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">async def </span><span>main():
</span><span>    response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.login(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span>)
</span><span>    print(response)
</span><span>
</span><span>loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
</span><span>loop.run_until_complete(main())
</span></code></pre>
<p>The remainder of this tutorial assumes you are running everything from an <code>async</code> method.</p>
<p>The response string should look like:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span>Logged in as @pyconweb-bot:matrix.org, device id: ZBLAJHLKVP.
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="get-into-a-sync-loop">Get into a <code>/sync</code> loop</h2>
<p>To get updates from a Matrix homeserver to the client, the client makes a request to the <code>/sync</code> endpoint. In the matrix-nio AsyncClient, this is wrapped by the <code>sync()</code> method. We can get the latest updates:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>sync_response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.sync(</span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">30000</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>30000 means we will wait up to 30 seconds before returning. <code>sync_response</code> will now contain a Python object containing a mapping of the (JSON) <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#get-matrix-client-r0-sync">response from the Matrix homeserver</a>. We'll inspect this response in the next section.</p>
<p>In fact, we expect there to be updates regularly, so let's create a very simple loop:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">while </span><span>(</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">True</span><span>):
</span><span>    sync_response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.sync(</span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">30000</span><span>)
</span><span>    print(sync_response) </span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># note that this could be LARGE!
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># do some reading from sync_response
</span></code></pre>
<p>In this way, every time there is a response (i.e. new events) from the homeserver, they are made available in <code>sync_response</code> for processing, and we loop again.</p>
<h2 id="explore-the-sync-response-object">Explore the sync response object</h2>
<p><code>sync_response</code> <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#get-matrix-client-r0-sync">can contain multitudes</a>, depending on the rooms this user is part of, or has been part of. <code>sync_response.rooms.join</code> contains updates for the rooms which the current user is &quot;joined to&quot; (meaning, is a member of.)</p>
<p>Of these joined rooms, we are (perhaps!) most interested in the events on the timeline. These are stored in <code>timeline.events</code>, see below:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">if </span><span>len(sync_response.rooms.join) &gt; </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">0</span><span>:
</span><span>
</span><span>    joins = sync_response.rooms.join
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">for </span><span>room_id </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">in </span><span>joins:
</span><span>        </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">for </span><span>event </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">in </span><span>joins[room_id].timeline.events:
</span><span>            print(event)
</span></code></pre>
<p><em>Message events</em> are a specific type of event which contain an Instant Messenger message. We can check the type before proceeding:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">for </span><span>event </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">in </span><span>joins[room_id].timeline.events:
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">if </span><span>isinstance(event, RoomMessageText):
</span><span>        print (event.body)
</span></code></pre>
<p>In these cases, where the event is a message to a room, the <code>body</code> field will contain the message text.</p>
<h2 id="isolate-specific-message-event-objects">Isolate specific message event objects</h2>
<p>Knowing that we can get the message text from an event, we can read it to determine a response. Let's make a new variable and have it store some string we'll check for:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>response_string = </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;!replybot&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now let's suppose we're in our <code>/sync</code> loop, and just received an event. We can filter messages that are meant for our bot as follows:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">if </span><span>len(sync_response.rooms.join) &gt; </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">0</span><span>:
</span><span>    joins = sync_response.rooms.join
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">for </span><span>room_id </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">in </span><span>joins:
</span><span>        </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">for </span><span>event </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">in </span><span>joins[room_id].timeline.events:
</span><span>            </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">if </span><span>hasattr(event, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&#39;body&#39;</span><span>) </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">and </span><span>event.body.startswith(response_string):
</span><span>                print(event)
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="use-room-send">Use <code>room_send</code></h2>
<p>To send messages, matrix-nio provides a <code>room_send()</code> method. There are three arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>the room_id</li>
<li>the message type, we will use &quot;m.room.message&quot;</li>
<li>a JSON object representing the content of the message</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's improve the example above, by sending back a message to echo the ones we isolated above:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span>joins = sync_response.rooms.join
</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">for </span><span>room_id </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">in </span><span>joins:
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">for </span><span>event </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">in </span><span>joins[room_id].timeline.events:
</span><span>        </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">if </span><span>hasattr(event, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&#39;body&#39;</span><span>) </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">and </span><span>event.body.startswith(response_string):
</span><span>            response_body = event.body.replace(response_string, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;&quot;</span><span>).strip()
</span><span>            content = {
</span><span>               </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;body&quot;</span><span>: response_body,
</span><span>               </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;msgtype&quot;</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;m.text&quot;
</span><span>            }
</span><span>            </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.room_send(room_id, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&#39;m.room.message&#39;</span><span>, content)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now whenever the bot receives a message &quot;!replybot <em>some message</em>&quot; it will send back &quot;some message&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-sync-next-batch-tokens">Use of /sync next_batch tokens</h2>
<p>Finally, let's consider the importance of <code>next_batch</code> tokens. Whenever you receive a response from the <code>/sync</code> endpoint, the response will contain a &quot;next_batch&quot; field, which you then pass on the next request to ensure you have the latest messages. matrix-nio keeps track of this automatically, so it doesn't get repeated messages. However, when you stop the program and call the <code>.sync()</code> method again, how can you tell it where to start from? First let's get the latest <code>next_batch</code> token:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">async def </span><span>main():
</span><span>    response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.login(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">YOUR-USERNAME-HERE</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span>, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;&quot;</span><span>)
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">while </span><span>(</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">True</span><span>):
</span><span>        sync_response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.sync(</span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">30000</span><span>)
</span><span>        print(sync_response.next_batch) </span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># this is the token
</span></code></pre>
<p>Then we'll write the token to a file:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">async def </span><span>main():
</span><span>    response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.login(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">YOUR-USERNAME-HERE</span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">%%</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;</span><span>, </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;&quot;</span><span>)
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">while </span><span>(</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">True</span><span>):
</span><span>        sync_response = </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">await </span><span>async_client.sync(</span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">30000</span><span>)
</span><span>
</span><span>        </span><span style="color:#608b4e;"># we write the token to a file here
</span><span>        </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">with </span><span>open(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;next_batch&quot;</span><span>,</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;w&quot;</span><span>) </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">as </span><span>next_batch_token:
</span><span>            next_batch_token.write(sync_response.next_batch)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Once that token is written, we know we can re-use it for the first <code>/sync/</code> request next time:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#569cd6;">async def </span><span>main():

</span><span>        async_client.next_batch = next_batch_token.read()
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">while </span><span>(</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">True</span><span>):

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With this, you can see that in very few lines, it's possible to write a working Matrix bot in Python, using <a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a>.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>A few weeks ago there was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20178267">some
discussion</a> around the privacy
of typical Matrix configurations, particularly how Riot's default config uses
vector.im as an Identity Server (for discovering users on Matrix by their email
address or phone number) and scalar.vector.im as an Integration Manager (i.e.
the mechanism for adding hosted bots/bridges/widgets into rooms). This means
that Riot, even if using a custom homeserver and running from a custom Riot
deployment, will try to talk to *.vector.im (run  by New Vector; the company formed by the core
Matrix team in 2017) for some operations unless an alternative IS or IM has
been specified in the config.</p>
<p>We haven't done as good a job at explaining this as we could have, and this
blog post is a progress update on how we're fixing that and improving other
privacy considerations in general.</p>
<p>Firstly, the reason Riot is configured like this is for the user's convenience:
in general, we believe most users just want to discover other people on Matrix
as easily as possible, and a logically-centralised server for looking up user
matrix IDs by email/phone number (called third party IDs, or 3PIDs) is the only
comprehensive way of doing so.  Decentralising this data while protecting the
privacy of the 3PIDs and their matrix IDs is a Hard Problem which we're unaware
of anyone having solved yet.  Alternatively, you could run a local identity
server, but it will end up having to delegate to a centralised identity server
anyway for IDs it has no other way to know about. Similarly, providing a
default integration server that just works out of the box (rather than
mandating the user configures their own) is a matter of trying to keep Riot's
UX simple, especially when onboarding users, and especially given Riot's
reputation for complexity at the best of times.</p>
<p>That said, the discussion highlighted some areas for improvement.
Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>When doing work on making Matrix <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix">GDPR
compliant</a>
back in May 2018, we set up a single <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/policies/blob/master/docs/matrix-org/privacy_notice.md">privacy
policy</a>
for the services we run, and got users to agree to it by locking them out of
the matrix.org homeserver until they did.  However, we missed that users not
on the matrix.org homeserver might still be using our Identity Service (IS)
&amp; Integration Manager (IM) without accepting the privacy policy.  Over the
last few weeks we've been working on addressing this - it turns out that
it's a pain to fix, given the Identity Service doesn't have the concept of
users, so tracking which users have agreed to the policy policy or not means
some fairly major changes. The current proposal is to change the Identity
Service to use a form of OpenID to authenticate users against their
homeserver in order to check they've accepted the IS's terms of use - see
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2140">MSC2140</a> for the gory
details.</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, Riot is being updated to prompt the user to accept the IS &amp; IM terms
of use (if different to the HS's), and thus make it crystal clear to the user
that they are using an IS &amp; IM and that they have the option not to if desired - see https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/10167 and associated
<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+label%3Ap1+label%3Aprivacy+label%3Aphase%3A1+identity">issues</a>.
This includes also explicitly prompting the user as to whether they want
3PIDs they provide at registration to be discoverable, as per
https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/10091.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Riot on iOS &amp; Android gives the option of scanning your local addressbook to
discover which of your contacts are on Matrix.  The wording explaining this
wasn't clear enough on Android - which we <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20181515">promptly
fixed</a>.  Separately, the
contact details sent to the server are currently not obfuscated.  This is
partially because we hadn't got to it, and partially because obfuscating
them doesn't actually help much with privacy, given an attacker can just
scan through possible obfuscated phone numbers and email addresses to
deobfuscate them.  However, we've been working through obfuscating the
contact details anyway by hashing as per
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2134">MSC2134</a>, which has all
the details.  We're also adding an explicit lookup warning in Riot/Web, as
per https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/10093.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a bug where Riot/Web was querying the Integration Manager every
time you opened a room, even if that room had no integrations (actually, it
did it 3 times in a row).  This got <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3115">fixed and
released</a> in
Riot/Web 1.2.2 back on June 19th.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matrix needs to authenticate whether events were actually sent by the server
that claimed to send them.  We do this by having servers sign their events
when they create them, and publishing the public half of their signing keys
for anyone to query.  However, this poses problems if you receive an event
which is signed by a server which isn't currently online.  To solve this, we
have the concept of <code>trusted_key_servers</code> (aka notary servers), which your
server can query to see if they know about the missing server's keys.  By
default, matrix.org is configured as Synapse's trusted notary, but you can
of course change this. If you choose an unreliable server as the notary
(e.g. by not setting one at all) then there's a risk that you won't be able
to look up signing keys, and a splitbrain will result where your server
can't receive certain events, but other servers in the room can.  This can
then result in your server being unable to participate in the room entirely,
if it's missing key events in the room's lifetime.</p>
<p>Our plan here is to get rid of notaries entirely by changing how event
signing works as per
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1228">MSC1228</a>, but this is
going to take a while.  Meanwhile we're going to check Synapse's code to
ensure it doesn't talk to the notary server unnecessarily.  (E.g. it should
be caching the signing keys locally, and it should only use the notary
server if the remote server is down.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When doing VoIP in Matrix, clients need to use a TURN server to discover
their network conditions and perform firewall traversal.  The TURN server
should be specified by your homeserver (and each homeserver deployment
should ideally include a TURN server).  However, for users who have not
configured a TURN server, Riot (on all 3 platforms) defaulted to use
Google's public STUN service (<code>stun.l.google.com</code>).  STUN is a subset of
TURN which provides firewall discovery, but not traffic relaying.  This
slightly increased the chances of calls working for users without a proper
TURN server, but not by much - and rather than fall back to Google, we've
decided to simply remove it from Riot (e.g.
https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/commit/24832a2b14fb72ae6f051d5aba40262d11eef65d).
This means that VoIP might get less reliable for users who were relying on
this fallback, but you really should be running your own TURN server anyway
if you want VoIP to work reliably on your homeserver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We should make it clearer in Riot that device names are world-readable, and
not just for the user's own personal reference. This is
https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/10216</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, much of the work on improving these issues is still in full
swing, although some has already shipped.  As should also be obvious, these
issues are categorically not malicious: Matrix (and Riot) literally exists to give users full control and autonomy over their communication, and privacy is a key part of that. These are avoidable issues which can and will be solved.  It's worth noting that we have to prioritise privacy issues alongside all the other development in Matrix however: there's no point in having excellent privacy if there are other bugs stopping the platform from being usable.</p>
<p>We'll do another blog post to confirm once most of the fixes here have landed -
meanwhile, hopefully this post provides some useful visibility on how we're
going about improving things.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Here's Neil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With 1.0 shipped we are now starting to take a closer look at Synapse performance more generally and this will be a theme for us over the coming months. We want to improve not only large scale deployments such as Matrix.org but also optimise for smaller instances.</p>
<p>You may have seen a few trial servers run by core team members in matrix.org community rooms popping up and this is a precursor for a broader effort to make synapse more manageable on less powerful infrastructure. My own instance has been sat at a pretty steady 256MB of RAM.</p>
<p>Other than that, based on 1.0 feedback, we have been working on improving the Synapse upgrade path and expect to put out a new release next week containing the tweaks. Specifically this means improving configuration for Docker installs, and configuration management for sending emails.</p>
<p>We’re also implementing open tracing into Synapse, initially to help with e2ee debugging, but it will make tracking down strange behaviour easier more generally.</p>
<p>Finally we’re bringing our push server Sygnal kicking and screaming into 2019 and will upgrade to Python 3, drop gevent for twisted and update our vendor specific libraries, not mention improving the monitoring and alerting. We’ll also add in open tracing which will help hunt down push failures.</p>
<p>Finally finally, look out for a DAG visualisation tool written by GSOCer Eisha referenced elsewhere in TWIM  - we consider this to be seriously cool, and can’t wait to start using it in anger.</p>
<p>Note: 1.0 is the last release to support python 2 and postgres 9.4, the next Synapse release will drop support for both, see <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/04/08/synapse-deprecating-postgres-9-4-and-python-2-x">https://matrix.org/blog/2019/04/08/synapse-deprecating-postgres-9-4-and-python-2-x</a> for more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week was spent working on a big revamp of <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events">ruma-events</a>, the library that defines Rust types for the &quot;events&quot; used in Matrix.
After some discussion in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a>, I decided to make a move towards treating ruma-events as a higher-level library. Previously, ruma-events has more or less offered Rust types that are exact representations of the JSON structures used by Matrix. However, by representing events this way, it would be possible for users to easily create values that, while valid JSON, would be invalid events according to the specification.
The way we're approaching this problem is by separating serialization/deserialization of JSON from validation of events.</p>

<h3 id="gsoc-project-matrix-visualisations-mortar-board">GSOC project: Matrix Visualisations 🎓</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@eisha:matrix.org">Eisha</a> appeared with this terrific GSOC update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The GSoC project “Matrix Visualisations” has made good progress during this first period:</p>
<ul>
<li>The implementation of the CS API backend has been completed to properly retrieve events from a room in real time.</li>
<li>Many features have been added to the UI, here are some of them:
<ul>
<li>The DAG is displayed vertically, every node of the same “depth” are on the same level in the graph and each node has outgoing arcs for each of its previous events (if they have already been retrieved).</li>
<li>The node at the top of the DAG allows to fetch earlier events by selecting it.</li>
<li>Each node can have two different colors whether its “origin” is the HS the application is currently talking to or not.</li>
<li>The full JSON body of an event can be displayed by double clicking on its node.</li>
<li>It is possible to select which fields of the events will be directly included in the labels of the nodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A (server-side) backend has been implemented so that the application can directly talk to the PostgreSQL database of Synapse. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend">this repo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the support of the Federation API has been postponed so I could work on this Synapse database backend.
The UI of the application isn’t very beautiful or well-organised yet, as the effort is focused on the backends and core functionalities for now, but improvements will be made once these functionalities will be completed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/koma-im/continuum-desktop">continuum</a> tweaked the appearance of placeholder avatars. To make most users appear visually distinct, continuum has always used colors based on checksums and usernames to generate placeholders if any user doesn't have an image as avatar. In previous versions, it always used two characters of the name. In the new version, if the username contains ideographic (usually east-asian) characters, a single character would be used. The reason is that the number of ideographic characters is vast and duplicates are less common, and most of them are close to a square or circle in shape so a single one would fit the GUI component better.</p>
