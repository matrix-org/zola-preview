We will release 1.20.0 early next week.</p>
<p>Aside from that we continue to work on performance analysis and the sharding of the event persister continues - it‚Äôs proving to be a really tough job but we are getting there. We‚Äôve also been making progress on the room knocking implementation</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome back! This week we made some groundbreaking progress - this is not a joke, we found a bug in Synapse while breaking multiple Matrix rooms, causing the Matrix team a lot of unnecessary stress. Let me explain:
The good news is that Conduit is starting to federate now. This means that you should be able to join all public rooms of the Matrix network and exchange messages. Note that Conduit does not do all the checks it should be doing yet making it stop sending messages from time to time as well as that advanced features like loading the history, syncing temporary data like read receipts or accepting invites are not implemented yet.</p>
<p>The bad news is that, while Synapse is happy to accept Conduit's messages when it is already part of the room, joining into one of the rooms Conduit servers are part of didn't work because of an event validation bug. The Matrix team did an excellent job at fixing this bug and releasing a Synapse patch the same day, but the damage has been done making a few rooms inaccessible to old Synapse servers.
Thanks to everyone who supports me on &quot;Liberapay&quot; (https://liberapay.com/timokoesters) or Bitcoin!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey bridge developer enthusiasts! Myself and ChristianP (bridge crew of matrix.org) have been working hard on freshening up the matrix-appservice-bridge library. It's no secret that it was using &quot;classic&quot; Javascript rather than ES6 syntax, was poorly documented in places and there were no types at all to make use of.</p>
<p>But that's all changed now, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/2.0.0-rc1">2.0.0-rc1</a> release brings fresh types, new convenience methods, a total swichover from Bluebird Promises to native Promises and much much more. If you are looking to quickly get set up writing bridges, it's never been easier.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/tree/develop/examples/slack-starter">slack-starter</a> project to get your first taste of bridge excellence and see what you think.</p>
<p>As this is an RC, feedback is valuable and logging bugs helps us all. Please do so if you encounter any issues üòÑ</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi encryption fans. This week the bridge team has been churning away at adding support for encrypted rooms in the <code>matrix-appservice-bridge</code> library, to enable support in <code>matrix-appservice-irc</code>, <code>matrix-appservice-slack</code>, and anyone else using the library. This is probably the most exciting feature the library has seen in a long time! </p>
<p>The feature will be a simple config toggle, so existing bridges will have to do very little work to support it.</p>
<p>The first phase plans to use <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a> with bridge users syncing like real users, but eventually the hope is that this will be all built into the library.

<blockquote>
<p>0.6.3 and 0.6.4 were released this week, and I'm now working on desktop notifications support and push rules control.</p>
<h4 id="added">Added</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add a <strong>system tray icon</strong>.</p>
<p>A left click will bring up the Mirage window, 
middle will quit the application and right will show a menu with these </p>
<p>options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>closeMimizesToTray</code> setting to the config file, defaults to <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Controls whether closing the Mirage window will leave it running in the 
system tray, or fully quit the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a discrete <strong>read marker indicator</strong> to messages, shows how many people </p>
<p>have this event as their last seen one in the room.<br />
A way to see who read the message and when will be added in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: add <code>chat.message.localEcho</code> and <code>chat.message.readCounter</code> color properties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>zoom</code> setting, defaults to <code>1.0</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>lexicalRoomSorting</code> setting, to sort rooms by their name instead of</p>
<p>recent activity.<br />
A restart is needed to apply changes to this setting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restrict Mirage to a single instance per config folder, trying to launch a</p>
<p>new window will instead focus the existing one.<br />
The <code>MIRAGE_CONFIG_DIR</code> and <code>MIRAGE_DATA_DIR</code> environment variables can be</p>
<p>set to run different &quot;profiles&quot; in parallel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the visible lag when opening a chat page, switching rooms should be </p>
<p>a lot smoother</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When using the <code>focusPreviousMessage</code> and <code>focusNextMessage</code> keybinds, if no</p>
<p>message is focused and the timeline has been scrolled up, 
focus the message in the center of the view instead of returning to the </p>
<p>bottom of the timeline and focusing the last one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't re-center the room list on clicks by default.</p>
<p>This prevents the list from jumping around every time a room is selected.<br />
The previous behavior can be restored with the new <code>centerRoomListOnClick</code></p>
<p>setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show a better terminal error message than &quot;Component is not ready&quot; when the </p>
<p>window creation fails, giving details on what went wrong in the code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an account's access token is invalid (e.g. our session was signed out </p>
<p>externally), say so with a popup and cleanly remove it from the UI, 
instead of spamming the user with errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename message context menu option &quot;Debug this event&quot; to just &quot;Debug&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unify up/down and (shift+)Tab navigation for the account Sessions page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to the UI scale/zoom via keybinds are now persisted across restarts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: <code>uiScale</code> is now bound to <code>window.settings.zoom</code>.</p>
<p>This change is necessary to keep the zoom keybinds working.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fixed">Fixed</h4>
<ul>
<li>A bunch of stuff, see the full changelog for <a href="https://github.com/mirukana/mirage/releases/tag/v0.6.3">0.6.3</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mirukana/mirage/releases/tag/v0.6.4">0.6.4</a></li>

<p>Hemppa the bot is a multi-purpose Matrix bot for writing new functionality easily with Python. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hemppa gained a small but big feature for making fediverse better: per-room Mastodon tooting support. This means that you can set up a Mastodon account in your room and anyone with moderator rights can toot to that account. This way you and your roommates can super easily send toots to the world directly from Matrix. Mastodon (unlike the big alternative) supports RSS feeds out of the box so it's very easy to subscribe to users and hashtags with stock RSS bot.  Toot #hemppathebot if you like it! Another new contribution worth mentioning is welcome which can send welcome messages to users registering on the server or joining a room. <a href="https://github.com/vranki/hemppa">https://github.com/vranki/hemppa</a></p>

<p>Another week, another <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby SDK</a> release. This time adding a little fix to avoid duplicate state events being passed twice to the application if identical ones arrive in both state and timeline, also adds a global state event handler and moves room event handling to not depend on room instances themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asked how much the SDK is used in production, Ananace said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a little, we've hooked Matrix into our server orchestration / configuration management system TheForeman - which is a Rails application. Also got a colleague who's doing a bot to linkify internal ticket IDs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to @q-b and @jtescher we have implemented more of the federation endpoints (bringing us up to about 85% completion) and every (one) endpoint of the Push Gateway API!</p>
<p>We fixed a bug where federation endpoints expected access tokens instead of server signatures for authentication. In the future, we may add an API that requires signatures on requests.</p>
<p>Finally, we've also continued progress on the non-exhaustive type updates for backwards compatibility; we expect to finish this within the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Normally the ping shows how long other servers take to receive the sending-server's message. Some servers receive it quickly, some take hours. All this flows into the statistic of the sending server. I wrote a small program that's the other way around. Instead of measuring the sending-server's ping, it associates each measurement with an echo-bot (instead of the sending server), so this plot shows which maubots are the fastest to respond (it's probably not accurate at all, because most of the pings were started on conduit servers this week, but it's interesting nevertheless):</p>

<p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696/#4756651216732160">View project: 	Ruma procedural macro refactoring and more</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Wow the summer has flown by, it feels like just yesterday I was learning how to rebase and what exactly it is Ruma does. I exaggerate slightly, but it is a big library with lots of public API surface. I have learned more in the last few months than in two years of school. I have been able to observe and participate in a project with a community growing around it, been a part of discussions about design and best practices, given and received numerous code reviews as well as learned the process of addressing the feedback, and working from a specification. In short, this has been an amazing opportunity to gain experience in all the things that are hard to obtain in a classroom.</p>
<p>My project goal was to improve the existing macros in ruma-events-macros and ruma-api-macros. It became clear early on that this would include some major API changes and that improving the macros as they were was pointless without also moving to a new public API. While improving the durability and readability of the macro code I also rewrote entire sections to accommodate the new design.</p>
<p>A quick overview of the Matrix protocol for reference: a client sends content that is interpreted by the server as events. The server distributes those events out to other clients and other servers (the server case is known as federation). Ruma groups these events by kind Message, State, Ephemeral, ToDevice and Basic which are represented as generic structs (<code>StateEvent&lt;C&gt;</code>). Each event kind needs to be able to hold many different content types, for state events there is room creation, room name, and membership events to name a
few. Using the macros, enums are generated to represent all state event possibilities, so a variant for membership, room name, etc. These types exist to support the core API request and response types for each endpoint that is defined by the Matrix specification.</p>

<p>One of my personal goals was to become more familiar with git. With the help of my mentor I now feel more confident using this tool that is so essential to developers. I became fairly adept at merging, rebasing, and navigating all the headaches that come with that. I learned plenty of new commands. A few highlights: <code>cherry-pick</code> and specific uses of <code>reset</code> to avoid copy-pasting fixes and adding more commits. I used the <code>reset</code> command to craft good commits, splitting work into appropriate chunks. I am glad that I had the opportunity to hone my git skills. I feel like I have accomplished my goal and then some!</p>
<p>I am proud of the work that I have done: Being part of moving ruma-events much closer to the <code>0.22</code> release and creating macros to generate types specific to the Matrix specification. Working with the community that has grown around Ruma has been rewarding and I plan on sticking around.</p>

<p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6060943798173696/#5751467312414720">View project: HTML Embeddable Matrix Chat Rooms</a></p>
<hr />
<p>My name is <a href="https://github.com/arnav-t/">Arnav Tiwari</a> and I am a prefinal year undergraduate student from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/">IIT Kharagpur</a> and I wanted to share my amazing journey with Matrix. I am a budding open-source enthusiast and this was my first experience with Google Summer of Code. For the past few months, I had been working on a project to develop an <a href="https://github.com/arnav-t/riot-embedded">HTML embeddable chat client</a> under the GSoC program for Matrix. Matrix provides a highly versatile SDK for making custom clients that can be leveraged for a variety of applications, one of which is using Matrix to power an embeddable chat client. A chat client itself can have numerous forms, whether it being a live chat to a simple comments section. This project was intended to provide an easy-to-use and yet highly customizable client that can be deployed on a website with minimal effort.</p>
<p>My goal for the project was to have a useable project by the end of the coding period, however, as it turned out, the project was going to be tested in the real world far sooner than that. The need for an embeddable client and the feasibility of the project to fulfill this role was demonstrated during the second month of the coding period itself. The client was <a href="https://2020.commcon.xyz/live/">deployed on the website of CommCon 2020</a>, a virtual conference on communication technologies (an apt place to be tested, coincidentally). On the days leading up to the conference and during the conference itself, I helped the organizers to set up, integrate, and troubleshoot the client when required. While the process went mostly without any hiccups, there was one small incident when the client broke during production. Since the project was still pretty early in development, I didn‚Äôt expect it to be bug-free and had anticipated the possibility of this happening. I was keeping an eye on things, which proved to be a prudent decision as I was able to fix this problem quickly and with minimal downtime. The rest of the conference went smoothly and the client performed quite well even when the number of users was quite large (A testament to Matrix‚Äôs scalability). Getting to experience this was a pleasant surprise since I never expected to have real users so soon, much less so many at once. Seeing the client being used out in the wild was a very fulfilling thing to witness. I also gained some very valuable feedback, courtesy of Dan, CommCon‚Äôs master of ceremonies. </p>
<p>Over the next month or so, I kept on steadily adding features and building up the client. The next big break for the project came in the form of another conference. <a href="https://akademy.kde.org/2020">KDE Akademy 2020</a>. This was a big surprise as I genuinely didn‚Äôt expect to see another large conference using the project so soon. The conference was scheduled to be held after a week or so after the end of the coding period. This time, however, the integration was almost completely handled by the conference organizers themselves since it had to be integrated with their version of BigBlueButton, a web conferencing system. As the conference drew nearer, things seemed to be working out well and there was no sign of trouble. When the day of the conference finally came, however, many things seem to break simultaneously due to an apparent incompatibility with BBB. In the end, despite the numerous attempts by the conference organizers and myself to remedy the issues, they had to roll back to an older version of the chat since the risk would be too great. The organizers were understandably disappointed since they had spent a while working on the integration and had seen the great potential of using this client in place of their old chat system.. Even though It was a sad conclusion to the journey, there were still many lessons to be learned. Most importantly, even though the client might work well in standalone circumstances, ease of integration might have some room for improvement. Open-source development never truly stops and I don‚Äôt intend to give up on this project. I look forward to constantly improving it and seeing more people adopt it.</p>
<p>These past few months were a spectacular experience. Even before starting this journey, I knew I would learn a lot but this still managed to exceed all my expectations. I got to learn things I never would have thought I would be able to experience under GSoC. I met some awesome people along the way, I‚Äôm extremely grateful to my mentors Ben Parsons and Travis Ralston for being the best mentors anyone could ever ask for. They were always approachable and friendly throughout the entire program and I never hesitated before asking for their help. Without their guidance, all of this would‚Äôve certainly not been possible. Lastly, I want to express my gratitude to Matrix for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to undertake this project. The Matrix community is full of talented people who will go the extra mile if you ask them for help. It has truly been a pleasure working with them and I hope to continue working with them in the future. Cheers and hope to see continue seeing you all!</p>

<p>Since we suddenly have multiple projects that've separately gone on to trial our new and shiny Matrix-on-location for multiple respective use-cases, from conferences to anonymous - encrypted - support chats, we've had to end our soft-launch period <strong>very</strong> quickly.</p>

In its place we've put something in a very similar vein: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1960">MSC1960</a> (OpenID Connect exchange for widgets).</p>
<p>We had another long overdue Spec Core Team retro this week. On the whole it felt very productive, and we've hopefully helped identify some key issues and actions going forward to help internally organise the way the team spends time on MSCs (read: unblocking review progress from the team).</p>
<p>We're still working out our exact strategy asynchronously at the moment, so expect more details to follow soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we put out a new release candidate for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.0rc3">Synapse 1.20.0</a>, highlights include shadow ban support, more async/awaiting and unread message counts being added to sync responses to support upcoming notifications work. </p>
<p>Aside from that Erik has been continuing to get event persistence sharding ready for shipping. He already has a working version, but currently all workers will run at the speed for the slowest instance. Once that is fixed we will put it on matrix.org to see how it performs.</p>
<p>Patrick has finished up on asyncing all the things, and is now studying flame graphs to figure out where all the cycles on the main process are going.</p>
<p>Andrew has been taking a look at the knocking <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC</a>, expecting concrete progress in the next few weeks. </p>
<p>Brendan has been working notifications support and is currently in VoIP land helping Dave on trying to level up our VoIP support.</p>
<p>Finally Oliver has dusted off his TURN tester from last Summer to get it working before he returns to university. The idea is that it will act a bit like the federation tester for but for TURN configuration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Released 0.0.36 with end-to-end encryption enabled! üéâ<br />
Most of this week was spent on performance improvements for IE11, where asm.js runs quite slow. Decryption is run in parallel on 4 workers in that browser, giving a massive speed-up and added responsiveness (the UI would freeze for 7 seconds when opening a room prior to this). There is still some polishing to do on sharing room keys, which I will get to next week, but all in all, it should work well. Next week I also want to get started on supporting key backup, so you can also read your encrypted history from before you logged in.</p>

<h3 id="maunium-sticker-picker">Maunium sticker picker</h3>
<p>This isn't strictly a client, but it's in the clients section.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting stuff into the spec or even implemented in Elements is very slow, so while we wait for proper native sticker packs and pickers (i.e. not in an iframe/webview), I decided to make a better sticker picker widget: <a href="https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker">https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker</a></p>
<p>The goal is to be as fast and simple as possible. The picker and sticker packs are just some static files that can be served anywhere (no compilation required). It doesn't require self-hosting anything except said static files, and it has been confirmed to work on all three Elements.</p>
<p>There's a Telegram import script that's used to reupload stickers to Matrix and generate the static sticker pack files that the picker widget uses. It's technically also possible to make the sticker pack files yourself, but there's no easy way to do that yet.</p>
<p>Due to the simplicity of the picker there's no authentication, which also means everyone sees the same sticker packs. One way to get around that limitation is to have a unique URL for each user. I'll probably write a bot to manage copies of the picker for multiple users in the future.</p>
<p>Other future improvements include remembering frequently used stickers (surprisingly, all three Elements keep localStorage for widgets), importing Telegram animated stickers and searching for stickers by emoji/name</p>
</blockquote>
<p>later more words appeared from Tulir:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the initial announcement, my sticker picker has received some more features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a slider to configure the number of stickers shown per row</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequently used stickers now show up at the top</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imported all the packs from Scalar (the default integration manager)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A model of productivity, Tulir also announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>my sticker picker has dark theme support too now</p>

<p>I'm <a href="https://github.com/Tyagdit">Tyagraj Desigar</a> and I worked on <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid">Opsdroid</a> with <a href="https://github.com/Cadair">Stuart Mumford</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew">Drew Leonard</a>. Opsdroid is a python framework for creating platform agnostic bots usable with multiple chat services including matrix.</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>
<p>The project's focus was on the interaction layer (called a connector) between opsdroid and matrix. As it stood, the connector used the deprecated <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a> and had no support for encryption. The aim was to change this by moving over to <a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a>.</p>
<p>I had planned to work on some other features as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>A database module for opsdroid using matrix state events</li>
<li>Support for unused matrix events</li>
<li>Homeserver lookup using <code>.well-known</code> API requests</li>
<li>Device verification process for the bot</li>
</ul>
<p>Porting to nio and adding encryption support was the bulk of the project, and the <strong>minimum</strong> I wanted to accomplish by the end of the project. I wanted to have a connector that worked as it did already with support for encrypted rooms which needed minimal extra configuration.</p>
<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>The process began with <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/pull/1418">This PR</a> which gave us a head start with the migration to matrix-nio. Through helping to review the PR I got to understand how matrix-nio and opsdroid work. </p>
<p>The implementation of encryption support was a little tricky in that it was tough to figure out the process required to do that in the context of the connector. One problem we faced was the installation of dependencies. Installing <code>libolm</code>, a C library which nio uses for encryption was a less than smooth process. This spawned a couple side projects that dealt with the CI, testing and installation of opsdroid. In the end we found a solution and had a working connector on our hands.</p>
<p>Next we shifted focus to the database module. It was based on <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/database-matrix">this project</a>. I rewrote it with nio and added a few features. The idea was straightforward but the implementation had many catches since we were working under some constraints for the interfacing with opsdroid. It went through several iterations before we settled on the final product.</p>
<p>The encryption and database took longer than I had initially expected which meant we didn't get to work on adding support for more events and homeserver lookups. I had a go at adding device verification steps while working on the encryption support but that turned out to be quite complicated and would introduce some breaking changes, besides cross-signing had just been introduced so we decided to drop that till nio implemented some way to leverage cross-signing.</p>
<p>Along the way some issues cropped up with the testing frameworks and CI that were hard to pinpoint and caused further delays but were solved eventually.</p>
<h2 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am extremely happy with what I've accomplished and hope that I have been able to achieve the standards set by the matrix community. It was a challenging and exhilarating experience. I have learned more in this project than I could've imagined and gained a ton of invaluable experience with software development thanks to my mentors who pushed me forward and guided me throughout. This journey was beyond amazing and I will be sure to contribute to matrix moving forward.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="whoami">whoami?</h2>
<p>I'm <a href="https://github.com/Chethan2k1">CH Chethan Reddy</a>. I'm currently pursuing Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering at the <a href="https://www.nitt.edu/">National Institute of Technology, Trichy in India</a>. In my free time I like to swim, work on projects I find interesting, watch movies and do a lot of other &quot;interesting&quot; stuff. This summer I have interned in Matrix.org for around 3-4 months under GSoC and in this blog I'll be sharing my experience.</p>
<h2 id="why-matrix-org">Why Matrix.org?</h2>
<p>Being passionate about privacy, I wanted to select an organization that actively works on that, and clearly, Matrix.org topped my list. For anyone who doesn't know what Matrix is, in simple words, It is a decentralized communication protocol that supports many awesome features like messaging, end-to-end encryption, voip/video calls support, etc. It uses simple RESTful http APIs which keeps things very simple. The best part of the protocol is, it is decentralized, so if you have a custom domain name, you can setup a synapse server in a jiffy. Knowing all these who wouldn't choose Matrix?</p>
<h2 id="my-work">My Work</h2>
<p>I worked on Desktop Client called <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a>. It is a light-weight Desktop Client that uses Qt Framework in the frontend and also uses a mtxclient library that implements Matrix-client server API written in C++. The scope of my project involved implementing Device-Verification and Cross-Signing in Nheko.</p>
<p>For people who have not used Matrix before, it is important to note that every device of a particular user is considered as a separate unit rather than user itself. For end-to-end encrypted chat to be viewable from a device, that particular device should be trusted by the sender's device. Device-verification and Cross-Signing are methods used for verifying.</p>
<p>Coming to <a href="https://chethan2k1.github.io/blog/final-report.html">the work I have implemented</a>, Device-verification is completely implemented in Nheko. As of now, SAS verification with to-device and room message verification is supported in Nheko. As far as Cross-Signing is concerned, verifying signatures of Cross-Signing keys and showing the verified status of devices have been implemented. The only remaining unfinished parts are SSSS and signing the keys after verification. After that Cross-signing should be feature-complete.</p>
<p>I wished to implement SSSS during my GSoC period, but I couldn't because I did not anticipate the additional things which came with verification while making my proposal. The additional works included : implementing the UI, changes to the userprofile dialog, working on the caching of verified users, and user keys. Moreover, due to the current pandemic, there were a few sudden changes in my academic schedule, which interrupted my work to some extent. While contributing at times I was stuck on some bugs like verifying the signatures, some random crashes in UserProfile and setting up relations in Room-Verification. However, with the help of my mentors, I was able to fix these bugs.</p>
<p>I'm really happy about the work I have done. I am hoping to further work on Nheko in the future, complete Cross-Signing and work on additional features for Nheko.</p>
<h2 id="community-and-mentors">Community and Mentors</h2>
<p>The best part of my experience this summer was the the Matrix community and the learning I had. I am really lucky to be part of the Matrix community which has many passionate people collectively working on really cool projects with clients, bridges, servers, bots and the spec. A special thanks to Uhoreg and Sorunome who have helped me in navigating through the spec.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, a big shout-out to both my mentors, Nico and red_sky, who were always there to help me with any issue in the project in spite of their personal commitments and dealt with my stupid questions with utmost patience and kindness. Without their active help and guidance this experience definitely would not have been so fun and great, they have clearly surpassed the expectations I had from mentors.</p>

<hr />
<p>Hello! I am <a href="https://github.com/nikofil">Nikos</a>, an MSc student in Computer Security. My original goal for this GSoC was to implement the basics of end-to-end encryption for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb">Go-NEB</a>, which is a popular and easily extendable bot for the Matrix protocol. I chose this project because it ticked off a lot of the boxes that I look for in a project: The Matrix protocol is very interesting and the e2e specification is fascinating, Go-NEB is written in Go which I wanted to learn better, plus I believe personally that crypto should be easy for everyone to use and adopted more.</p>
<p>My initial plan was to first create bindings in gomatrix for libolm, the C library that implements most of the necessary algorithms for Olm/Megolm, the protocols used in Matrix' end-to-end encryption. Then, I was going to write some nice APIs around those bindings so that most of the work done is hidden from the client that uses the library, and finally I would call these APIs from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb">Go-NEB</a> when needed to set up the encrypted sessions between devices in a room and use them to encrypt/decrypt messages as necessary. What we found out soon after GSoC started was that another library called <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-go">mautrix-go</a> that was based on gomatrix already did most of these things. My task then became to change the uses of gomatrix in Go-NEB for mautrix-go and make some slight changes to the latter if there were some incompatibilities. A month later, that task was done.</p>
<p>With two months to go in GSoC, my mentors came up with a new task: to implement a service for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb">Go-NEB</a> that allows other client developers to test their e2ee implementations easily. That resulted in a service called &quot;cryptotest&quot; which allows other clients in a specified room to execute some Neb commands which would trigger functions like the forwarding of keys between clients, another feature that had to be implemented in mautrix. Something else that I wanted to add and grabbed my interest was SAS device verification, a multi-step process that involves users comparing a string of numbers or emojis out-of-band to configure they are indeed talking to each other and not to a MITM. These were my main tasks during the second month and I was happy to have achieved them and made a decent verification API for clients to use. They were soon merged into mautrix and Go-NEB.</p>
<p>For my third month I proposed to implement a new Matrix feature called cross-signing, which was similar to SAS verification but dealt with verifying other users instead of their devices who would in turn verify their own devices, creating a graph of trust between users and devices. This functionality was strongly coupled with SSSS, another new feature that allows clients to store their encrypted secrets (in this case the multiple necessary signing keys) on the server, as well as in-room verification which allows verification between users. This task was more challenging as it uses multiple algorithms (some of which not in libolm) for deriving the keys, using them to encrypt other keys which in turn sign other keys. It was also more satisfying when I finally managed to generate the keys, store and retrieve them and then use them to sign another user and when I was done I felt like my understanding of cryptography levelled up.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm very satisfied with the overall experience. The spec was very clear in most cases and when it wasn't the community was always helpful and responsive. They were also happy to discuss the spec with me and explain the more intricate details. For that reason I wasn't asking questions directly to my mentors (besides for defining my tasks) but to the overall community. I'm also very grateful to my mentors, <a href="https://github.com/uhoreg">@uhoreg</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Kegsay">@Kegan</a> for picking me for this project and helping me with the planning aspect and reviewing my PRs. I'd lastly like to thank the maintainer of mautrix, <a href="https://github.com/tulir/">@tulir</a>, for reviewing and merging a lot of my work into his library.</p>

<p>Erik has made an initial, naive implementation of a sharded Event Persister worker - the non-sharded version currently being one of the biggest bottlenecks on matrix.org right now. It still needs a bit of polish to be production ready, and Sytest will need some updating to support testing it, but otherwise progress is looking good!</p>
<p>Brendan is polishing his unread counts implementations, while Rich is writing up the push rules replacement tech in an MSC. Rich has also been optimizing the device code in Synapse to both simplify the code, as well as cut down on unnecessary device data being sent over federation.</p>
<p>Patrick has finished converting Synapse's database code to be fully async! This has the benefit of making profiling the matrix.org Synapse process much more sane, and we're already starting to find a few little places where Synapse is burning CPU unnecessarily! Now, Synapse won't be fully async'd until Twisted itself is, and we drop support for older Twisted versions that aren't, which is not <em>soon</em>. However the majority of the code that developers touch and that is executed being async has massive benefits either way üôÇ</p>
<p>Andrew has been working on having a confirmation pop up after users click the link in their email, to help prevent phishing scams. He's also trying to finally make Synapse spec-compliant in accepting identifier dictionaries during user-interactive authentication.</p>

<p>Introducing a new bridge to the family, tomsg-matrix!</p>
<p>A friend of mine preferred using <a href="https://git.tomsmeding.com/tomsg/">his own chat protocol</a>, but having a chat protocol is useless without having people to talk to. Since I prefer using Matrix I thought it would be a fun exercise to try and create a bridge using Rust.</p>
<p>The bridge uses the newly created (still very WIP) <a href="https://github.com/lieuwex/matrix-appservice-rs">matrix-appservice-rs</a>. A Rust library that builds on top of the Ruma suite, the goal is for it to be comparable to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-node">matrix-appservice-node</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>.</p>

<p>I create  service for sending corporate information: some service (for example zabbix) can send message to this service (over http-api) and service will create room (if needed), invite user and send message to this room. Service will change status of message in his database to <code>readed</code> when user will read this message. Also service can send any changes statuses of this message by callback url. Editing old messages also supported: for example zabbix can send UID problem to this service and it is will edit old &quot;problem message&quot; to &quot;problem resolved&quot;.</p>

This means you can finally write <code>:fire:</code> and have it expand to üî•!

<p>I've been mostly reviewing PRs this week (and trying to get some other work in line, like MSCs, synapse stuff, etc). With this hopefully Chethans work on cross-signing will be merged soon, which will give us most of the building blocks to have cross-signing in Nheko (his work is basically only missing Secure Secret Storage and Sharing). We hope to fix the few remaining build issues in the next week or so.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has mostly been focused on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/milestone/8">beta milestone tasks</a> and bug fixes. Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Joining rooms which the server already belongs to when invited by a user from another homeserver is now significantly faster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client API no longer refers to the device DB directly, instead using the new user API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of locking issues have been fixed in the federation sender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/join</code> endpoint now accepts <code>?server_name=...</code> query parameters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device list updater now obeys the backoff period and blacklisted status from the federation sender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uploaded media will no longer be truncated to 0 bytes when <code>max_file_size_bytes</code> option is set to 0 (for unlimited)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media API now correctly cleans up temporary directories when errors occur</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media API now returns unique media IDs and metadata when multiple users upload the same file, whilst maintaining deduplication on disk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rejecting invites over federation multiple times should now work properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redactions are now permanent and are committed to the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some caches have been added to the roomserver for room IDs, state key IDs and event type IDs to reduce pressure on the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The redaction endpoint is now spec-compliant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some places where global errors were overwritten have been fixed (thanks oliverpool!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some state key checks in the roomserver membership updaters have now been tidied up (thanks oliverpool!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 55%, up from 54% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 70%, down from 71% last week due to a single flakey test</p>

<p>This week Erik has been working on sharding the Event Persister worker as we aim further for horizontal scalability for Synapse. Some of the complication comes from ensuring that sysadmin's don't misconfigure things where multiple event persisters persist events in the same room.</p>

<p>Patrick has been continuing on the async/await train and has just submitted the final PR which async's our <code>runInteraction</code> method - the one that most database calls go through. Synapse is nearly 100% async! He's also been submitting a flurry of shadow ban PRs, which will be another powerful tool for moderation.</p>
<p>Brendan and Rich are continuing to work on the Notifications rewrite, with Brendan finishing up unread counts, and Rich polishing up designs for the new replacement for push rules.</p>
<p>Andrew (<em>who dat? - ed.</em>) is continuing to work on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">knocking MSC</a> and has fleshed out the CS and SS details. There are still some open questions though, so please give feedback if you notice anything off!</p>
<p>Finally, Olivier has been working on making sure you get your missed messages when your homeserver has been offline for a while, as well as various Sygnal fixes and matrix-synapse-ldap3.</p>
<p>Them's the news!</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A multi-account Matrix client that allows you to authorize webapps to access parts of your account, designed with collaboration in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the webapp I've been talking about for a while that allows webpages limited access to your account. Currently, apps can view the name, avatar, alias, and type of a room that's been opened with the app, and that's just about it.</p>
<p>The big interesting thing about mxapps right now is the architecture. Just about all of the logic is running in a shared worker. This means that you can duplicate as many tabs as you want and it will all act as the same client. It also has multi-account support.</p>
<p>Features coming ~soon~ at some point will be full state event support and easy-to-follow docs on how to make an app, plus Vue plugins to make development really easy.</p>
<p>You can checkout the live version on <a href="https://mxapps.kb1rd.net/">mxapps.kb1rd.net</a>, but it is a bit useless...</p>
<p>There are some work-in-progress docs on the structure on <a href="https://docs.mxapps.kb1rd.net/">docs.mxapps.kb1rd.net</a></p>
<p>I'll post an example app in a bit ;)</p>

<p>What a great use of workers! The possibilities for this are really impressive...</p>
<h3 id="mirage">Mirage</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@miruka:privacytools.io">miruka</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small 0.6.2 release this week, mostly bug fixes:</p>
<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When replying to a message, you can now press enter without entering any</p>
<p>text to send it directly (useful to &quot;forward&quot; a message).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending a file while replying to a message will create a pseudo-reply,</p>
<p>consisting of an &quot;In reply to&quot; text message with no body, followed by the
actual file event.</p>
<p>This is a workaround to the reply restrictions imposed by the Matrix spec.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Composer aliases cannot contain whitespace anymore.</strong></p>
<p>This includes spaces, hard tabs or newline characters.
If an alias from your config still has whitespace, only the first word</p>
<p>will be taken into account (ignoring any leading or trailing space).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faster server browser loading, now gathers all needed data with a</p>
<p>single request instead of one for each server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-focus the &quot;Join&quot; button on invited room pages</p>
<p>((Shift+)Tab can be used to navigate between buttons)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-focus the &quot;Forget&quot; button on left room pages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: modify <code>chat.message.styleSheet</code> to add some spacing between HTML </p>
<p>list items, see
<a href="https://github.com/mirukana/mirage/commit/48663ae8465e90646855435b47b89c01395ae4d9">48663ae</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fixed">Fixed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix @username autocompletion closing if there's more than one character</p>
<p>after the @</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the partial text from IME (input method editors) and touch screen </p>
<p>autocompleting keyboards and for username autocompletion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reset IME state upon autocompleting a username</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix clicking on autocompletion list user not making the username a mention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix UI freezing when mentioning user lacking a display name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix mentioning users with blank display name (e.g. only spaces), mention</p>
<p>them by their user ID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix text fields/areas unable to be focused on touch screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix random chance of profile retrieval requests failing if one of the logged</p>
<p>in account doesn't federate with other servers (e.g. localhost synapse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix composer text saved to disk for the wrong account if that text begins</p>
<p>by an account alias</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Servers can potentially return an outdated member list for rooms on initial </p>
<p>sync, which is one of the possible cause of &quot;Members not synced&quot; error for 
encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>When loading the full room list, discard members from the initial sync list
that are absent from the full list.</p>
<p>For those not using the AppImage or Flatpak, this fix requires <strong>matrix-nio 0.15.1</strong> or later to take effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When erasing an account alias inside the composer, send a </p>
<p>&quot;x isn't typing anymore&quot; notification corresponding to that account </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix potential 403 error on chat pages for invited rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start loading room history immediately when the room join state changes,</p>
<p>e.g. when clicked &quot;Join&quot; for an invited room page.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Released 0.0.34 this week with some fixes to the room list sorting and fixing several crashes. If you clear your session, it will also sort low priority rooms at the bottom of the room list, even if unread, making it a bit more usable until we add more UX refinements to the room list. </p>
<p>Most of the effort this week however has gone into working on end-to-end encryption, having investigated using the rust-sdk for a couple of days, and now looking into a custom implementation based on libolm. This is well on its way with key upload working and device tracking nearing completion.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just merged the new event store a few days ago. This means Nheko now doesn't keep messages in RAM! Everything is stored on disk and mapped into memory from disk. This may reduce memory usage a tiny bit, but may increase latency while scrolling a bit. Try it out and give your feedback!</p>
<p>For the developers reading this, I collected some ramblings on my blog here: <a href="https://blog.neko.dev/posts/nhekos-event-store-v2.html">https://blog.neko.dev/posts/nhekos-event-store-v2.html</a> . Yes, I designed that site when I was like 15, I know the dark theme is a bit too much... Just use Firefox and the alternate stylesheet for light mode! Anyway, I'm very interested to hear how other clients implement their event stores!</p>
