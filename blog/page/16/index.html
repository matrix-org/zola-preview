<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>Work on Spaces continues with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946</a> (Space Summary API), specifically revolving around how to paginate the summary. This has called into question how <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1898#issuecomment-896717689">pagination across Matrix works in general</a>, which is a prime target for refactoring - perhaps an upcoming consistent pagination MSC? :)</p>
<p>Otherwise, as listed above, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289</a> (room v8) has merged! It brings with it the ability to grant the ability to join a room based on one's membership in another room. While the was originally conceived for allowing users that are part of one Space to be allowed to join rooms, it has been built upon in other creative ways. Such as in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3325">MSC3325</a>, where it could be used to make room upgrades more seamless!</p>
<p>And finally, a special thanks to Lukas Lihotzki for all of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Alukaslihotzki+sort%3Aupdated-desc+">their spec PRs</a> this week. They're been stellar!</p>

<p>Big news! <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/08/10/synapse-1-40-0-released">Synapse 1.40 is out</a> and it comes with support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">Room Version 8</a>! Version 8 includes &quot;<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>&quot; which are only visible and joinable by members of a specific Space (or via direct invitation). This finally makes it <em>useful</em> to use Spaces as containers for private rooms, like you might with a company, guild, or open source community. Once invited to the parent Space, members can join and discover the otherwise private rooms within. No more <code>/invite</code> spam every time you bring someone on board!</p>
<p>Also: If you've received any push notifications in Element Android or Element iOS this week, they've come via our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/releases/tag/v0.10.0">shiny new stateless release of Sygnal</a>!

All of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10245">big</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10498">pieces</a> are now merged for full-fat federated historical messages in Synapse üí™</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> was also consolidated and updated to propose the <code>/batch_send</code> implementation we're using in Synapse. There is also a plan for how this can be backwards compatible with existing room versions so no need for those pesky room upgrades. This will help us be able to jump in early and use this for Gitter as soon as the new event types become stable.

<h3 id="ement-el">Ement.el</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alphapapa:matrix.org">alphapapa</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el">Ement.el</a>, a Matrix client for Emacs, continues to improve.  Some of the changes in the past week:</p>
<p><em>Additions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Messages may now be written in Org-mode syntax (a format similar to but more powerful than Markdown).  Internally, it's automatically converted to HTML and sent as the message's formatted body.  This supports nearly any HTML feature that Org-mode can export to, including rich text, bulleted and numbered lists, and even tables (this message is being written directly in Org syntax; see a table of new bindings at the end of this list).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An optional pop-out compose buffer makes writing and editing long messages easier (also being used for this message).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read/fully-read marker lines are now displayed after the last read message, and these are synced with the server and other clients.  These lines can also be placed with a command, making it easy to return to a certain event later, even on other clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usernames at the beginning of messages may optionally be colored to match the addressee's username.  This especially helps following conversations in busy rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ement.el is confirmed to work with Pantalaimon, the E2EE-aware reverse proxy, making encrypted rooms work transparently.  Once Pantalaimon is installed and configured, connecting through it with Ement.el is trivial, and this step is documented in the readme.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Improvements</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Per-user displayname and message colors have improved (and configurable) contrast ratio with the background color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reactions are sorted by the number of users who have sent each one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unread rooms are displayed more prominently in the room list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New default bindings make it quick to jump to the mentions and notifications buffers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync timeouts are handled more gracefully and Ement.el re-syncs automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various minor fixes and enhancements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And here's the new-bindings table, written directly in Org syntax and sent automatically as HTML:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Binding</th><th>Command</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>S-SPC</td><td>Scroll up</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-SPC</td><td>Move to last-read marker</td></tr>
<tr><td>C-k</td><td>Delete message</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-g M-l</td><td>Switch to room list buffer</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-g M-m</td><td>Switch to mentions buffer</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-g M-n</td><td>Switch to notifications buffer</td></tr>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You now get notified, if someone reuses a megolm session index, because that in theory could be used by an attacker to send seemingly verified messages. We also now render decryption errors more nicely and users can now explicitly request decryption keys (in addition to the automatic key requests in the background that already existed). We also fixed an issue, that could corrupt the database when using the flatpak and if you lost your network connection, Nheko should now reconnect faster instead of potentially waiting 17 minutes for a TCP timeout. The storage for cross-signing secrets should now be more reliable, you can close image popups with the &quot;Escape&quot; key, close the current room by double clicking it and a few more miscellaneous bugfixes.</p>
<p>You can track the remaining E2EE bits, before we declare our E2EE support as stable, in this comment now: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/23#issuecomment-894689158</p>

For me it's hard to maintain the list and actually read through things as choosing which one to process feels overwhelming due to the amount of items.</p>
<p>Randomization to the rescue! I made a Pocket plugin for Maubot which gives me a random article from my list and allows me to easily archive it. Now I don't need to decide which article to pick, the computer does that for me!</p>

<p>Ps. Maubot is truly awesome as a bot system, well documented and easy to develop on üòª</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.40.0 is out now!</p>
<h2 id="support-for-room-version-8">Support for Room Version 8</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse includes stable support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">Room Version 8</a>! Version 8 codifies a concept of &quot;<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>&quot; which are private rooms joinable only by direct invitation or by being a member of other, designated Spaces / rooms.</p>
<p>This means you can create a Matrix Space for your company, team, or guild, and instead of inviting people to the Space <em>and</em> directly to a bunch of private rooms, you can simply configure your private rooms such that membership in the Space <em>automatically</em> confers access to the private rooms.</p>
<p>This is a major improvement to access control in Matrix, and we can't wait to use it ourselves.</p>
<p>Note that client support for managing restricted rooms is still forthcoming, and you'll want to ensure that your users are on homeservers which support v8 before upgrading existing rooms. To ensure compatibility across federation, the default for newly created rooms remains at v6 for the time being.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>A few other items worth calling out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synapse can now optionally recycle PostgreSQL connections after a specified number of transactions (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10440">#10440</a>), which may mitigate slow memory leaks in the database. Thanks to GitHub user hifi.</li>
<li>We have a whole new documentation page explaining <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.40/development/room-dag-concepts.html">Room DAG Concepts</a> like depth, stream ordering, extremities, outliers, and state groups.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.40/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#list-accounts">Admin API for listing accounts</a> now returns a <code>creation_ts</code> property indicating when an account was created. Thanks to work by dklimpel.</li>
<li>Synapse should better detect character encodings in URL previews thanks to a contribution by srividyut.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to further work towards implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716: Incrementally Importing History into Existing Rooms</a>, we've landed support for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2033">MSC2033</a>: The <code>/account/whoami</code> endpoint now includes the <code>device_id</code> associated with the access token used to make the request.</li>
<li>(Experimental) <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244</a>: The <code>/_matrix/client/r0/capabilities</code> endpoint may include metadata about which room versions support which capabilities (like knocking on restricted joins).</li>
<li>(Experimental) <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2285">MSC2285</a>: Clients may mark messages as read on the server without updating their externally visible read receipts, implemented by SimonBrandner.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just the highlights; please see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.40.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hifi">hifi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SimonBrandner">SimonBrandner</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/srividyut">srividyut</a>.</p>

<p>It's demo week again this week! We've got three great demos to share with you this month:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robert, the latest addition to the Matrix VoIP team, gives us a sneak peek at his experiments with implementing native full mesh video calls in Matrix</li>
<li>Gil, from the Element iOS team, gives us an update on the implementation of Spaces in the app</li>
<li>and finally Ryan, who's been exploring ways to use Matrix beyond chat, shows us his shiny new full stack integration test solution for Matrix client and servers</li>
</ul>
<p>And I hear there might also have been a bonus demo that managed to sneak its way lower down this post üòâ</p>

<p>Today in not-Synapse news, we're getting ready for a new release of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a>, our reference implementation of a Matrix push notification gateway, early next week. The most significant change is that Shay, one of our Outreachy interns, has determined that Sygnal can function completely statelessly, removing the need for a SQLite or PostgreSQL database. This clears the path for proper horizontal scaling and high availability deployments of Sygnal.</p>
<p>On the Synapse side of the world, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289: Room version 8</a> entered Final Comment Period (FCP) and we expect it to be merged into the Matrix spec over the weekend.

<p>State res has been tested a lot, so it's okay to join any public rooms (room version 6 preferred).</p>
<p>The barebones DEPLOY.md is the easiest and most tested way to install Conduit. We also have docker images, but I think the documentation still needs to be improved (please contribute if you can!)</p>

<p>Heya, we are very grateful for all the awesome translators helping us translate FluffyChat! Unfortunately, we aren't the best at managing such a huge effort as translating such a large app into so many different languages. As a result, suggestions went un-reviewed on weblate for long, people weren't able to submit translations, etc. We are very sorry for that, but want to work on fixing that! As, well, we are only really programmers with little time, we thought of asking for help from the community (you all!)! That is why we are looking for a translation manager for FluffyChat. No programming experience at all is required, it'd mostly be about managing our weblate and answering translation-related questions. If you are interested, please plop into our room <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fluffychat:matrix.org">#fluffychat:matrix.org</a> and say so! (And ping <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a> if you don't get answers). Looking forward to a where translations are managed better, and thank you again for everyone who did bite through all this and contributed translations so far!</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I added a sticker/emoji pack editor to Nheko. This means you now don't need to create packs manually in /devtools anymore, but you can create and edit packs much more conveniently. There are still some rough edges, but we expect to sort those out in the near future. Make sure you check out the demo video I recorded!</p>
<p>Furthermore LorenDB has been busy porting more of the remaining dialogs to Qml, dialogs should now float properly on Wayland and have a proper close button on KDE. We also fixed a few more encryption bugs, which means we should be able to mark E2EE as stable in Nheko soon and we cleaned up old cruft in the codebase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if that's not enough for you, since it's demo week, Nico's also showing off Nheko's brand new sticker goodness!</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289</a> has entered FCP, adding support for Room Version 8, which includes support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083</a> (Restricting room membership based on membership in other rooms).</li>
<li>We‚Äôve been working on a tool for migrating communities to spaces, which will be available in Element Web</li>
<li>We‚Äôre adding pagination to the Spaces Summary API to improve support for spaces with large numbers of rooms when browsing Spaces room lists</li>
<li>On iOS, we‚Äôve been working on suggesting Spaces in room lists</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VoIP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mute status signalling now landed on develop! Thanks again to Simon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Web</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Voice messages! They‚Äôre out on develop.element.io and planning to go out for release soon. Let us know if you run into any issues, or have suggestions on how to make it better.</li>
<li>Made Improvements to our changelog automation, which should lead to much more joyous changelogs</li>
<li>We merged initial client-side support for <a href="https://posthog.com/">Posthog</a> analytics, adhering to the user‚Äôs existing analytics opt-in preferences</li>

<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Same thing for voice messages as web ^</li>
<li>We started discussions (and experimenting) about SwiftUI for new features. Minimal target version is 11 but some new features, like notifications for keywords, users and rooms completion, etc, will be available for devices running iOS 13 (maybe 14).</li>
<li>We have updated our contributing guide (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md</a>)</li>
<li>We adopted Towncrier to manage our change logs. Check the contributing guide above for the rules we defined and how we use towncrier across our 3 iOS repositories</li>
<li>Blank notifications (‚ÄúMessage‚Äù) are being fixed and improved. There will still be a fallback notification content but it should happen less often. In this case, we will display ‚ÄúNotification‚Äù</li>
<li>In parallel, we are continuing working on performance improvements. We still target an instant start for XL accounts (with thousands of rooms)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Same thing for voice messages as web ^ + fixed a rare crash</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo K.</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A collaborative whiteboard based on the [matrix] protocol. <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard">github</a></p>
<p>A lot has happened this week. The biggest task was the switch to a proper build system (the project now is based on yarn and webpack). This gave the opportunity to do lots of refactoring and code cleanup. Additionally there is now a spec for the whiteboard events which got implemented this week. For the ones who are curious, here is the file: <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard/blob/main/spec.md">spec</a></p>
<p>There are also a couple of new features and fixes. Most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Text tool</strong> was added. Text in different colors and sizes can be added to the whiteboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Image tool</strong> was added. Images are uploaded and than rendered on the canvas (not yet published but will be available in a couple of days)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The styling was improved. There are less gray areas which I did not like and the corners are less round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the repository got a lot of love with more details in the <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard/blob/main/readme.md">readme</a> and better code/folder structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is now also a matrix room for feedback, issues and ideas: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TheBoard:matrix.org">#TheBoard:matrix.org</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to try it at: https://toger5.github.io/TheBoard/ (preferable not with your main matrix account)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/circles-ios">Circles</a> is an iOS app for end-to-end encrypted secure social networking and sharing, built on top of Matrix.  Its goal is to provide a safe and convenient way for close friends and families to share things that they wouldn't post publicly -- e.g. for parents to safely share pictures of their kids.</p>
<p>Recent updates to the Circles beta include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for use with any Matrix homeserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emoji reactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown formatting for posts and photo captions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better support for larger screens (iPad)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The latest beta build of Circles (v0.90) is available from Apple on <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/cWuDwqpG">TestFlight</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've also added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE 1</strong> - If you're using an existing account, you'll need to tap the &quot;Advanced Options&quot; on the login screen so you can give it your password for SSSS / encrypted key backup / recovery / etc.  Otherwise Circles will try to use a login password that it generates with <a href="https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/matrix-doc/blob/single-password-SSSS/proposals/3265-login-and-ssss-with-single-password.md">MSC 3265</a> so it can do everything safely using just a single password.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 2</strong> - Circles is NOT RECOMMENDED for use on an account that you're already using for Matrix chat, for the above reason and more.  If you do this, prepare to see lots of extra, weird rooms in Element / Fluffy / Nheko / whatever chat client you're using.  Also if you decide to try this anyway, please let me know how it goes.  :-)</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 3</strong> - Circles is not available yet in France.  Sorry.  I gotta update my encryption compliance documentation with Apple.</p>

After a <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-raises-30m-as-matrix-explodes/">moment of reading this huge news</a>, however, I was relieved - Matrix has <em>exploded in popularity</em>, and <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> have all new funding to keep driving the ecosystem forward.

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>

<li><em>There were no new MSCs created this week.</em></li>

</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>While a quiet week for MSC state changes (shown above), there's still plenty of work and collaboration happening!</p>
<p>Spaces work marches forward as MSC3083 has been merged - allowing for users to join a room in a space based on their membership in a space. We think this will really help with the management of Spaces that contain lots of rooms that are otherwise invite-only.</p>
<p>Otherwise <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3291">MSC3291</a> (Muting in VoIP calls) has been receiving positive feedback this week!</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289</a> (room v8) is ticking along as the implementation is tested in Synapse and Complement tests.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/29/synapse-1-39-0-released">Synapse 1.39.0</a> is out! </p>
<p>Of all the pull requests we landed, my hat is off to MadLittleMods and his Graphviz prowess in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10250">#10250</a>, which moves us one step further down the path toward <em><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a>: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms.</em> Mmm. Graphs.</p>
<p>But back to Synapse! You should check out the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/29/synapse-1-39-0-released">release announcement</a>, but the bulk of the work this cycle went into internal cleanups. Synapse should also be slightly more performant, reliable, and should log fewer spurious errors. Of note, ShadowJonathan did a lot of work with <code>pyupgrade</code> and <code>com2ann</code> to move the entire codebase to more modern Py3.6+ conventions and inline type annotations; thanks, ShadowJonathan!</p>
<p>Synapse 1.39 also continues our march toward unifying Synapse's interface for extension modules, and we've now exposed plugin hooks for the <code>account_validity</code> option, and experimentally implemented hooks for third party event rules.</p>
<p>Lastly, special thanks to kroeckx who has submitted 17 pull requests against our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">SyTest test suite</a> in the past month, mainly arising from running SyTest against <a href="https://conduit.rs/">Conduit</a>. Thank you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello! This week, I created a <a href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/matrix-synapse-backend">matrix 1-click app</a> on the DigitalOcean marketplace. It's basically a pre-baked droplet image that is pre-configured with synapse, element-web, caddy, postgres, plus some setup and moderation tools. My intent was to make self-hosting a Matrix system as easy as pointing some DNS records and running a single script. It makes a lot of sense for smaller, more casual Matrix homeservers, and can serve as a good starting point! It also includes some small utility scripts - <code>./reset-password</code>, <code>./new-user</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Secrets like the postgres password and registration password are generated on first boot, there's no sensitive data baked into the image. Of course, it would be nice to be able to verify this - the source code used to build the image is being open sourced. I'm just waiting for some internal processes to finish. It will show up at https://github.com/digitalocean/marketplace-matrix somewhat soon!</p>

<li>
<p>Lazy joining of IRC users (see below)</p>

</ul>
<p>The biggest impact feature this time around is configurable lazy joining IRC users which improves the experience of joining massive IRC channels by not flooding the homeserver with join events. This is now the default and can be changed globally by the bridge admin or overridden per room by users.</p>
<p>Many fixes here and there. Still a few issues left before 1.0 and a lot of testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ajbura:matrix.org">ajbura</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cinny is a web-based matrix client focusing primarily on simple, elegant and secure interface.</p>
<p>The story started when a friend of mine introduced me to matrix and even after his help it was too difficult for me to get around with Element. I guess it was because Element is too different from other popular chat apps. Then I tried to find a good alternative for web but no success.</p>
<p>That's when me and my friend thought about creating Cinny. For the few weeks we were doing it for fun but when we shared a screenshot of the prototype, the response from people was surprising and that's when things got interesting. We got to know that a lot of people out there are looking for a simple and modern client and so we started building it.</p>

<p>This summer's gone by so fast it feels like it's only been a week! Here's a summary of what's happened with Ruma the past few weeks:</p>
<p>We have had a productive summer with our two Google Summer of Code students, Adam Blanchet and Devin Ragotzy. Adam finished implementing the last of our Identity Service API endpoints, bringing us to 100% implementation of all the Matrix API endpoints! (And we promise there are no bugs because &quot;Rust,&quot; right?)</p>
<p>Besides improving the Matrix ecosystem, Devin has been helping the Rust ecosystem at large by writing some Clippy lints to improve our codebase and upstreaming his additions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I made <a href="https://github.com/davidmehren/maubot-ldap-inviter">maubot-ldap-inviter</a>, a maubot plugin that (surprisingly) invites users into Matrix rooms, according to their membership in LDAP groups.</p>
<p>We are switching from RocketChat to Matrix in the next round of a software engineering course where students work on software projects in small groups.</p>
<p>RocketChat has a LDAP sync, which we previously used to auto-add students and tutors to the chatrooms they need to be in (global announcement room, helpdesk, chat for their group etc.).
As there was no such feature for Matrix, I built the bot over the last few days.</p>
<p>It's still somewhat specific to our LDAP setup, but if anyone wants to use the bot and has questions, just open an issue in the repo!</p>

<h3 id="theboard">TheBoard</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a personal project I started a couple of weeks ago. I was dreaming of a good open source solution for OneNote or GoodNotes far a long time. There are already great projects, like<a href="https://xournalpp.github.io/">Xournal++</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lovasoa/whitebophir">Whitebophir</a>. But, they do not include the extent of possibilities to flexible host, collaborate and structuring the notes I have wished for.</p>
<p>Recently, I was thinking about the exact requirements I wanted for such a whiteboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Real time synchronization (cloud storage)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authentication/account infrastructure (to invite and collaborate on one whiteboard)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding/Removing ppl to a whiteboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliable hosting (when having cloud storage, I don't want to trust a one-man project to continue hosting. And a lot of ppl won‚Äôt self-host.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structuring whiteboards in categories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Viewing history and display which part has been drawn by which person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annotating other whiteboards with new layers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hosting for media like PDF's and images</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at this list, Matrix was such an obvious choice. I could comment every point but basically with: &quot;A whiteboard should be a Matrix room&quot; everything is said.</p>
<p><strong>TheBoard (probably not the final name) is exactly that.</strong> The frontend is not done yet, but already in an okay looking and usable state.</p>
<p><strong>Before trying it out:</strong> It takes really long to log in with an account with lots of rooms. So, I highly recommend to NOT use your main Matrix account.
Additionally, it is necessary to tag rooms as whiteboards. (really un-intuitive UX that will be improved) But for now the + button needs to be pressed and a (empty (not necessary but recommended) AND UNENCRYPTED) room needs to be selected.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I just (on Friday) finished initial spaces support to categorize the whiteboard in notebooks (aka spaces). They can only be create within a matrix client that supports spaces. But they will be displayed properly in TheBoard. (see screenshot)</p>
<p>Any problems, ideas and feedback is highly welcome as a github issue or in the matrix channel #TheBoard:matrix.org.</p>
<h4 id="tldr">TLDR:</h4>
<p>This project is whiteboard (similar to OneNote) which is</p>
<p>using Matrix as its backend. All your drawings are stored in matrix rooms
on your matrix server and are accessible to anyone who is invited.</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.39.0 is now available!</p>
<p>We've done quite a bit of work this release on Synapse's new interface for extension modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synapse's <code>account_validity</code> option has been extracted into a built-in <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.39/modules.html#account-validity-callbacks">extension module</a>. If your configuration previously enabled <code>account_validity</code>, it will continue working as before, but it is now easier to override and customize.</li>
<li>The third party event rules callbacks have also been <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.39/modules.html#third-party-rules-callbacks">experimentally ported</a> to the new module interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also improved the Space Summary API to list all rooms which a user could join (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10298">#10298</a>). This is especially important with the pending standardization of Room Version 8, which includes <em><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083</a>: Restricting room membership based on membership in other rooms.</em></p>
<p>MadLittleMods landed several pull requests on the path to implementing <em><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a>: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms</em> (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10250">#10250</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10276">#10276</a>).</p>
<p>More than anything else, this release contains an absolutely enormous load of internal cleanup. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>ShadowJonathan ran <code>pyupgrade</code> on the entire codebase, bringing it up to modern Py3.6+ conventions, then separately used <code>com2ann</code> to move us from legacy <code># type: foo</code> type hints to more modern inline annotations.</li>
<li>We finished converting several integer columns in our database to bigint as a precautionary measure.</li>
<li>We've made innumerable improvements to our CI configuration; including moving completely to GitHub Actions.</li>
<li>Countless small improvements to performance, reliability, and error logging.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that's not all! Synapse 1.39 also allows for setting credentials for HTTP proxy connections thanks to work by dklimpel; previously, Synapse was only able to provide authentication for HTTPS proxies.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.39/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1390">Upgrade Notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.39.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this rele ase.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/andir">andir</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ilmari">ilmari</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LukeWalsh">LukeWalsh</a>, <a href="https://github.com/moritzdietz">moritzdietz</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ShadowJonathan">ShadowJonathan</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/xmunoz">xmunoz</a>.</p>

            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Big news today: Element, the startup founded by the team who created Matrix,
just raised $30M of Series B funding in order to further accelerate Matrix
development and improve Element, the flagship Matrix app. The round is led by
our friends at <a href="https://protocol.ai">Protocol Labs</a> and <a href="https://metaplanet.com">Metaplanet</a>,
the fund established by Jaan Tallinn (co-founder of
Skype and Kazaa).  Both Protocol Labs and Metaplanet are spectacularly on
board our decentralised communication quest, and you couldn't really ask for
a better source of funding to help take Matrix to the next level.  Thank you
for believing in Matrix and leading Element's latest funding!</p>
<p>You can read all about it from the Element perspective over at the
<a href="https://element.io/blog/element-raises-30m-as-matrix-explodes">Element Blog</a>,
but suffice it to say that this is enormous news for the Matrix ecosystem as a
whole.  In addition to transforming the Element app, on the Matrix side this
means that there is now concrete funding secured to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>finish building out <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/06/introducing-the-pinecone-overlay-network">P2P Matrix</a>
and get it live (including finishing Dendrite, given our P2P work builds on Dendrite!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1419820122143961093">native decentralised E2EE voip/video conferencing</a> for Matrix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fully build out our
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">relative decentralised reputation system</a>
in order to combat abuse in Matrix.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously this is in addition to all the normal business-as-usual work going
on in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting <a href="https://element.io/blog/spaces-the-next-frontier/">Spaces</a> out of beta</li>
<li>adding Threading to Element (yes, it's finally happening!)</li>
<li>speeding up room joins over federation</li>
<li>creating 'sync v3' to lazy-load all content and make the API super-snappy</li>
<li>lots of little long-overdue fun bits and pieces (yes, custom emoji, we're looking at you).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're wondering whether Protocol Labs' investment means that we'll be
seeing more overlap between <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> and Matrix, then yes -
where it makes tech sense to do so, we're hoping to work more closely
together; for instance collaborating with the libp2p team on our P2P work
(we still need to experiment properly with gossipsub!), or perhaps giving
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/travis/msc/ipfs/proposals/2706-IPFS.md">MSC2706</a>
some attention.  However, there are no plans to use cryptocurrency incentives
in Matrix or Element any time soon.</p>
<p>So, exciting times ahead!  We'd like to inordinately thank everyone who has
supported Matrix over the years - especially our Patreon supporters, whose
donations pay for all the matrix.org infrastructure while inspiring others to
open their cheque books; the existing investors at Element (especially <a href="https://notion.vc">Notion</a>
and <a href="https://automattic.com">Automattic</a>, who have come in again on this round); all the large scale
Matrix deployments out there which are effectively turning Matrix into an
industry (hello <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/21/germanys-national-healthcare-system-adopts-matrix">gematik!</a>) -
and everyone who has ever run a Matrix server, contributed code, used the
spec to make their own Matrix-powered creation, or simply chatted on Matrix.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Matrix wouldn't exist without you: the protocol and network
would have fizzled out long ago were it not for all the people supporting it
(the matrix.org server can now see over 35.5M addressable users on the
network!) - and meanwhile the ever-increasing energy of the community and the
core team combines to keep the protocol advancing forwards faster than ever.</p>
<p>We will do everything we possibly can to succeed in creating the long-awaited
secure communication layer of the open Web, and we look forward to large
amounts of Element's new funding being directed directly into core Matrix
development :)</p>
<p>thanks for flying Matrix,</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix core team.</p>

            <p>It's only been two weeks since Dendrite 0.4 landed, but there's already a
significant new release with Dendrite 0.4.1 (it's amazing how much work we
can do on Dendrite when not off chasing low-bandwidth and P2P Matrix!)</p>
<p>This release further improves memory performance and radically improves
state resolution performance (rumour has it that it's a 10x speed-up).
Meanwhile, SS API sytest coverage is up to 91%(!!) and CS API is now at 63%.</p>
<p>We're going to try to keep the pressure up over the coming weeks - and once
sytest is at 100% coverage (and we're not missing any big features which sytest
doesn't cover yet) we'll be declaring a 1.0 :)</p>
<p>If you're running Dendrite, please upgrade.  If not, perhaps this would be a
good version to give it a try?  You can get it, as always from,
https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.1.  The changelog
follows:</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for room version 7 has been added</li>
<li>Key notary support is now more complete, allowing Dendrite to be used as a notary server for looking up signing keys</li>
<li>State resolution v2 performance has been optimised further by caching the create event, power levels and join rules in memory instead of parsing them repeatedly</li>
<li>The media API now handles cases where the maximum file size is configured to be less than 0 for unlimited size</li>
<li>The <code>initial_state</code> in a <code>/createRoom</code> request is now respected when creating a room</li>
<li>Code paths for checking if servers are joined to rooms have been optimised significantly</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>A bug resulting in <code>cannot xref null state block with snapshot</code> during the new state storage migration has been fixed</li>
<li>Invites are now retired correctly when rejecting an invite from a remote server which is no longer reachable</li>
<li>The DNS cache <code>cache_lifetime</code> option is now handled correctly (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a>)</li>
<li>Invalid events in a room join response are now dropped correctly, rather than failing the entire join</li>
<li>The <code>prev_state</code> of an event will no longer be populated incorrectly to the state of the current event</li>
<li>Receiving an invite to an unsupported room version will now correctly return the <code>M_UNSUPPORTED_ROOM_VERSION</code> error code instead of <code>M_BAD_JSON</code> (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/meenal06">meenal06</a>)</li>

<p>üö® Yesterday we published Synapse 1.38.1 which <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10456">mitigates a client bug</a> triggered by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9919">changes to /sync responses</a> in 1.38.0. Specifically, new Element Android sessions were unable to decrypt messages in end-to-end encrypted conversations.</p>
<p>‚öôÔ∏è Otherwise, we've been doing quite a lot of internal / infrastructure work. Notably, we've completed the move from three separate CI systems to just one: GitHub Actions. We're also, for the first time, publishing Debian packages for our Release Candidates. We hope these changes move us towards a more reliable and seamless release process.</p>
<p>We'll have a lot to talk about re: Synapse 1.39 next week, but until then, enjoy the weekend! üèñ</p>

<p>A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<hr />
<p>This week brings plenty of usability improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is now the <code>list-contacts</code> bot command to--you guessed it!--list the Matrix puppets of all of your contacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's now possible to sync a chat with a LINE user by inviting their Matrix puppet to a DM, instead of having to wait for someone to send you a message in LINE for the bridge to auto-sync it. This is especially useful with <code>list-contacts</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LINE group chats that haven't been used recently are now included in the set of chats that get bridged on a <code>sync</code> operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of chats to sync at startup time &amp; on-demand is now configurable, as a bridge config setting &amp; a parameter to the <code>sync</code> command, respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes make it possible to sync LINE chats/groups that previously may not have gotten synced, due to the intricacies of how LINE on Chrome handles chat history (especially on first use of the bridge).</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LorenDB has rewritten the invite dialog as well as the memberlist in Qml. This means they work now much more reliably and show the users in appropriate colors and a few other small improvements.</p>
<p>Apart from that, Nheko now has support for sending stickers! This is based on Sorunome's awesome <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2545">MSC2545</a>, so no integration manager is needed and it is trivially easy to share your sticker packs (just invite someone into the same room!). You can use stickers from your account data or upload stickers into a room so every room member can use it. If you found a sticker pack you like, you can enable a pack from a room globally by going into Nheko's room settings. You can check my current preferred set of stickers here: matrix:r/nico's-stickers:neko.dev</p>
<p>Currently you can't edit a sticker pack yet from Nheko. Support for that will come in the near future. Until then you can use either FluffyChat, Element's DevTools or <a href="https://github.com/deepbluev7/stickerpicker">my hack to import Telegram sticker packs into a room</a>. Note that Nheko's sticker pack support is incompatible with integration server based sticker packs like the one Element uses. On the other hand, you don't need an integration manager to use them! Custom emote support based in the image packs MSC is coming in the future to Nheko too.</p>
<p>Furthermore we fixed some bugs to move E2EE in Nheko out of Beta. We are close now and we have a plan!</p>
<p>That's all, don't get your hands too sticky!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/02/this-week-in-matrix-2021-07-02">three weeks already since our last update</a> and we have a fair amount of new things to report.</p>
<p>As I write this, our interns Alejandro and Kai are at GUADEC, the annual GNOME conference, presenting during the interns lightning talk. The former has submitted a couple of merge requests (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/793">!793</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/794">!794</a>) that were necessary for the UI to accommodate his upcoming multi-account work. The latter has provided <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/788">a view for when no room is selected</a>. As for their mentor, Julian, he changed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/795">member loading so it only happens once a room is opened</a>, to improve performances. He also changed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/796">Matrix event handling to use <code>SyncRoomEvent</code></a>, which paves the way for display of various message types in the timeline of a room.</p>
<p>Giuseppe offered two nice additions to the login view:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in the form, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/783">one can now type enter to login</a> (it previously required to click on the button in the headerbar)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/791">errors are now displayed</a>, providing useful feedback on why the login may have failed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And to conclude this summary, we welcome üéâ newcomer Veli Tasalƒ± who fixed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/issues/802">a papercut I reported</a>: <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/787">when typing long messages, buttons next to the message entry were expanding along with the entry and now they keep nicely aligned</a>.</p>

<h4 id="bridges">Bridges</h4>
<h4 id="linkedin">LinkedIn</h4>
<p>We've integrated the LinkedIn bridge into Beeper. The bridge is in beta and is generally ready for use. Since the last update, we moved it to <a href="https://gitlab.com/beeper/linkedin">GitLab</a>, added a Docker image, and implemented reaction and redaction handling in both directions! We also fixed a bunch of bugs across the board to improve reliability.</p>
<h4 id="android-sms">Android SMS</h4>
<p>The Android SMS bridge mentioned in the last update is progressing. It should be ready for self-hosted use in a few weeks, so our next update will probably include that.</p>
<p>Related to the SMS bridge, I've made <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-syncproxy">mautrix-syncproxy</a>, which is a microservice to do the <code>/sync</code>ing required for end-to-bridge encryption (to-device events and such) in the cloud and forwarding the data to the normal appservice transaction endpoint. When combined with <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-wsproxy">mautrix-wsproxy</a>, it allows the SMS bridge to only have a websocket connection, which uses significantly less battery than a HTTP request every 30 seconds. The sync proxy partially implements <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3202">MSC3202</a> and the to-device part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> (partially because it only does individual users rather than all appservice-owned users).</p>

<p>Several GNOME contributors and I have been following TWIM and really enjoyed the concept. Since open source is about <del>stealing</del> sharing ideas, we wanted to deploy something similar for GNOME.</p>
<p>I gave this room's beloved <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/twim-o-matic">twim-o-matic</a> a try and fiddled a bit with the code. But I soon found that it is too specialised for matrix.org.

<p>Here is <a href="https://thisweek.gnome.org/posts/2021/07/twig-1/">how it looks in practice with a companion website for GNOME</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>This week I have developed a new plugin for <a href="https://octoprint.org/">OctoPrint</a> which is a tool for controlling and monitoring 3D printers, which sends notifications about your prints and status of your 3D printer to matrix. The existing OctoSlack plugin also has Matrix support but fell foul of the /sync response changes in Synapse 1.38, and also sent the images from the camera to Matrix as inline images rather than m.image events, so they didn't render on some clients.</p>
<p>My new plugin can send messages on most events supported by OctoPrint, but the core events which are configurable through the OctoPrint web UI are print started, paused, completed and failed as well as print progress notifications. If you want Matrix notifications for your 3D prints, you can install the plugin through the official <a href="https://octoprint.org/">OctoPrint plugin repository</a> or by installing from the <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/octoprint-matrix-notifier-plugin">GitHub repository</a>. If you have any feature requests or pull requests, contributions to the plugin are very welcome.</p>

            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>We‚Äôre incredibly excited to officially announce that the national agency for
the digitalisation of the healthcare system in Germany (<a href="http://gematik.de">gematik</a>)
has selected Matrix as the open standard on which to base all its
interoperable instant messaging standard - the TI-Messenger.</p>
<p>gematik has released a <a href="https://fachportal.gematik.de/anwendungen/ti-messenger">concept paper</a>
that explains the initiative in full.</p>
<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>With the TI-Messenger, gematik is creating a nationwide decentralised private
communication network - based on Matrix - to support potentially more than
<strong>150,000</strong> healthcare organisations within Germany‚Äôs national healthcare system.
It will provide end-to-end encrypted VoIP/Video and messaging for the whole
healthcare system, as well as the ability to share healthcare based data,
images and files.</p>
<p>Initially every healthcare provider (HCP) with an HBA (HPC ID card) will be
able to choose their own TI-Messenger provider. The homesever for HCP
accounts will be hosted by the provider‚Äôs datacentre. The homeserver for
institutions can be hosted by TI-Messenger providers, or on-premise.</p>
<p>Each organisation and individual will therefore retain complete ownership and
control of their communication data - while being able to share it securely
within the healthcare system with end-to-end encryption by default. All
servers in the Matrix-based private federation will be hosted within
Germany.</p>
<p>Needless to say, security is key when underpinning the entire nation‚Äôs
healthcare infrastructure and safeguarding sensitive patient data. As such,
the entire implementation will be <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html">accredited by BSI</a>
(Federal Office for Information Security) and <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html">BfDI</a>
(Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information).</p>
<h2 id="the-full-context">The full context...</h2>
<p>Germany‚Äôs digital care modernisation law (‚ÄúDigitale Versorgung und Pflege
Modernisierungs Gesetz‚Äù or DVPMG), which came into force in June 2021, spells
out  the need for an instant messaging solution.</p>
<p>The urgency has increased by a significant rise in the use of instant
messaging and video conferencing within the healthcare system - for instance,
the amount of medical practices using messenger services doubled in 2020
compared to 2018 (much of this using insecure messaging solutions).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gematik.de/">gematik</a>, majority-owned by Germany‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/english-version.html">Federal Ministry of Health</a>,
is responsible for the standardised digital transformation of Germany‚Äôs
healthcare sector. It focuses on improving efficiency and introducing new
ways of working by setting, testing and certifying healthcare technology
including electronic health cards, electronic patient records and
e-prescriptions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gematik.de/anwendungen/ti-messenger/">TI-Messenger</a> is gematik‚Äôs
technical specification for an interoperable secure instant messaging
standard. The healthcare industry will be able to build a wide range of apps
based on TI-Messenger specifications knowing that, being built on Matrix, all
those apps will interoperate.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 organisations - ranging from local doctors to clinics,
hospitals, and insurance companies - can potentially standardise on instant
messaging thanks to gematik‚Äôs TI-Messenger initiative.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-interoperability">The road to interoperability</h2>
<p>By 1 October 2021, TI-Messenger will initially specify how communication
should work in practice between healthcare professionals (HCPs). Physicians
will be able to find and communicate with each other via TI-Messenger
approved apps - specifications include secure authentication mechanisms with
electronic health professional cards (eHBAs), electronic institution cards
(SMC-B) and a central <a href="https://hl7.org/FHIR/">FHIR</a> directory. The first
compliant apps for HCPs are expected to be licensed by Q2 2022.</p>
<p>Eric Grey (product manager for TI-Messenger at gematik), reckons there will
initially be around 10-15 TI-Messenger compliant Matrix-based apps for HCP
communications available from different vendors. </p>
<p>Healthcare professionals will be able to choose a TI-Messenger provider, who
will be hosting their personal accounts and provide the messenger-client. </p>
<p>Healthcare organisations will choose a TI-Messenger provider to build the
dedicated homeserver infrastructure (on prem or in a data center), provide
the client and ongoing support.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-the-matrix-community">What does this mean for the Matrix community?</h2>
<p>Matrix is already integral to huge parts of the public sector; from the French
government‚Äôs Tchap platform, to Bundeswehr‚Äôs use of BwMessenger and adoption
by universities and schools across Europe. </p>
<p>Germany‚Äôs healthcare system standardising on Matrix takes this to entirely the
next level - and we can‚Äôt wait to see the rest of Europe (and the world!)
converge on Matrix for healthcare!</p>
<p>We'll have more info about TI-Messenger on this week's Matrix Live, out on
Friday - stay tuned!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, we <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.0">released Dendrite 0.4.0 on Monday</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/12/dendrite-0-4-0-released">wrote a blog post about it</a>! It's taken us a little while to get to this release, but it includes a number of quality-of-life improvements and changes that will significantly reduce the amount of resources needed to run a Dendrite server. The full changelog is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.0">available on GitHub</a> and many juicy details in the aforementioned blog post, but at a high level this release includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All-new state storage, designed to reduce the amount of disk space that the roomserver takes up to store room state by aggressively deduplicating state blocks and snapshots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved appservice support, with a number of bridges now working with Dendrite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared secret registration (using the same API shape as Synapse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimisations in the federation API <code>/send</code> and <code>/get_missing_events</code> endpoints to reduce memory usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved state resolution v2 performance when dealing with power level events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per-room queuing to reduce head-of-line blocking on the roomserver input API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of bug fixes around invites, registration, sync and media, and 5 panics fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the release, we've been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Completing key notary support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing <code>state_default</code> for power levels in gomatrixserverlib</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolving some issues around rejecting invites, particularly when the remote server is not available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the cost of checking if the local server is in a given room</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since our last update, our Sytest compliance numbers have been on the rise again, taking us ever closer to our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 61%, up from 60% last time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 92%, up from 80% last time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appservice APIs: 52%</p>

<p>The big news of the week is the release of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/13/synapse-1-38-0-released">Synapse 1.38</a>, which converts several integer columns to <code>bigint</code>, allowing Synapse to process more than 2 billion (231) events.

<blockquote>
<p>But that's not the only thing new in Synapse 1.38. We also landed the ability to set an expiry time on cache entries, allowing you to reclaim memory from infrequently accessed caches. Configuring this to &quot;1h&quot; on matrix.org has already yielded a noticeable reduction in overall memory use üìâ:</p>

This will allow messaging LINE contacts that the bridge didn't yet create a portal for.</p>
<p>And please, <em>feel free to try out this bridge!</em> It should be serviceable for day-to-day usage now. I still won't be able to host a public instance of it for a while, though (as it is fairly hefty due to having to run Chrome), so you'll have to self-host if you want to try it.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nik:matrix.teckids.org">Nik</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the first weeks of July, <a href="https://teckids.org">Teckids e.V.</a> held their annual summer camp for kids between 9 and 15 years. This year, after we started introducing Matrix and Element as a chat platform from September 2020 onwards, the camp was heavily relying on the platform for various parts.</p>
<p>Before the camp started, we invited all 90 participants to a chat room to get together, share a bit about what they expect, already did with coding and technical stuff, talk about what food they'd like to have for the barbecue, and stuff like that. Many of them engaged in the discussion, and started exploring Element (before you ask, yes, we hat a lot of snow and party poppers üòõ!). Some got really excited that they could even change or add features to Element, or ask for such changes ‚Äì we had to promise to hold a session where we find out how to add one new animation to Element. Unfortunately, Element is developed on GitHub, so the potential young contributors are locked out by the exclusive Terms of Use there. We are trying to reach out to Element HQ to find a solution.</p>
<p>During the camp, verifying crypto sessions using emojis again made for a good party game to get to know each other (like, find the kid a nickname belongs to on the camp site, start verification, and compare emojis ‚Äì a lot of fun that we, again, did not even have to start, because someone always finds out about it and asks what it is about).</p>
<p>Now that everyone got to know Matrix for chatting, in one of our workshops, the participants discovered that not only people, but also devices can send messages, and react to replies ‚Äì in that workshop, the kids built a chat-ops IoT door beel (for their tent on site, or room at home). They soldered a circuit board to fit an ESP (MicroPython) micro controller on, and coded a small program (using templates with differing complexity levels), defining what the door bell should send when a button is pressed, on what messages to react, and the like. We produced a fun video about the project (German audio, English subtitles): https://eduvid.org/videos/watch/20a50c25-ecb4-48c0-9b13-de2548f290d4?subtitle=en . The (minimal and somewhat buggy) MicroPython client library is published as <a href="https://edugit.org/hacknfun/thema-mechatronik/mytrix">¬µtrix</a>.</p>
<p>Now, sadly, the event is over, and we slowly see (as expected, only a part of the) participants moving over to our long-term project chatrooms; we will start clearing the virtual camp site chatroom during the weekend to make room for a new group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asked about the regularity of these events, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nik:matrix.teckids.org">Nik</a> replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are still experimenting with our new camp formats. As bad as it all is, COVID caused a lot of innovation here because we were forced to leave the known roads we normally travelled, and now we are starting to integrate all that new stuff (like really embracing Matrix) into outdoor and presence events. I think we are on a really good way with it, and surely I will keep posting updates that might be of interest for the greater community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe in Matrix+Element and encourage my clients and law firms to get ahead of the curve or get left behind and become irrelevant. Email has to die, its just the worst.

<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone! Did you ever feel lost in the Matrix world? The room directory is big, but it's still hard to find something you like. Or are you a room moderator, but there is not much activity in your room because it doesn't have enough users?</p>
<p>This is why I want to share rooms (or spaces) I find interesting.</p>
<hr />
<p>This week's room is: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#formula1:matrix.org">#formula1:matrix.org</a></p>
<p><strong>&quot;The pinnacle of motorsport! We're in an exciting time in Formula 1 with a close championship and exciting battles. Come hang out and chat about the upcoming race in Silverstone on July 18th!&quot;</strong></p>

<p>If you want to suggest a room for this section, tell me in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#roomoftheweek:fachschaften.org">#roomoftheweek:fachschaften.org</a></p>
