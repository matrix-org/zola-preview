<p>The Spec Core Team did some shuffling of our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/31">backlog board</a> this week in order to ensure that all in-flight and in-focus items are reflected on it.</p>
<p>Outside of that was the usual rounds of MSC review by team members.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2199">MSC2199: Canonical DMs</a>!</p>
<p>While the name may not make much sense to the layperson, the idea of a &quot;canonical&quot; Direct Messaging room (DM) is one that would always be referenced whenever a DM between two people is requested. That is, instead of potentially having a few different DM rooms with someone, both you and the other person would always know which room to use when DM'ing each other.</p>
<p>We don't really have this today. DM rooms are just group rooms with only you and someone else in them. If you attempt to DM another user, your client will try to guess the best room to use for this through some clever heuristics. What's lacking is a defined way to always arrive at the same room for this action.</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to define one, and would allow other functionality to be built on top of it, such as definitively knowing which room to send user-to-user data into, and to read from.</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan Abolivier</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week the Synapse team released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.62.0">Synapse 1.62</a>! It features a lot of changes, including a fairly big update of spam checker callbacks, performance improvements around syncing and device management, improved customisation of <code>.well-known</code> client files, and much more. Read all about it on the Matrix.org blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/07/06/synapse-1-62-released</p>
<p>Apart from this, we've been working on refining and fine-tuning our processes as a team over the past few weeks, which, among other things, resulted in the creation of <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/development/reviews.html">this documentation</a> that gives contributors some insight on how we review pull requests on Synapse. Olivier has also landed his work on running <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/">Complement</a> (our next-gen integration test suite) against instances of Synapse using workers, which is a massive improvement for our CI.</p>

The Windows, MacOS and iOS versions are awaiting approval from the respective stores.</p>
<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand new icons from Remix Icons (https://github.com/Remix-Design/RemixIcon)</li>
<li>Messages can be redacted (for now only by the message owner)</li>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can now edit aliases in Nheko! This means you can publish your own aliases in the room directory as well as in the room. If an alias can't be used by people (because it isn't listed in the room directory), that alias is highlighted in red with an easy option to fix it (if you have permissions to do so). You can also easily switch the primary (canonical) alias of the room.</p>
<p>With this the feature set I wanted to have for the next release is complete. I wanted to focus on improving moderation and room management capabilities in Nheko and it does now have a very basic sets of capabilities to do so. I do already have plans to expand on them though!</p>
<p>So instead of working on new features, I will be focusing on bug fixes. For a start if someone has the username <code>room</code>, Nheko will now omit the reply fallback to prevent pinging the whole room. The verification window now also should always be big enough to show its contents and we now properly explain to users, why emojis might look different on different devices fixing an issue reported via Twitter... There is also a new icon for the room directory (it is now a building, very punny, huh?).</p>

<p>A custom html element, web component, to display the latest messages from a matrix room</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>matrix-room-element</code> -&gt; <code>npm@v0.0.58</code> (GPLv3)</p>
<p><code>&lt;matrix-room-element/&gt;</code> is a web component (vanilla JS/HTML/CSS &amp; distributed un-minified) that can be imported and inserted in any web page, to display the content of a (public, soon with authentication, and private room support) matrix room.</p>

<p>Development is continuing, some new web-components have now prototypes:</p>

<li><code>&lt;matrix-event/&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It is still heavy in development, and still looking for the right patterns (web components, and matrix).</p>
<p>We're trying to make composable components that can be inserted in any web page, and maybe help users use Matrix as a CMS, embedable anywhere (web). Our first use case is on https://libli.org (that now comes with a <code>/login</code> endpoint - alpha) (this event in libli, loading a <code>matrix-room-element</code> with correct room-id/event-id, https://libli.org/thisweekinmatrix:matrix.org/$KsbQ0JsqAXN9g-57M-aXyVohZYM3SZkKKkuUb9dW928).</p>

            <p>Hey all, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.62.0">Synapse
1.62</a> is out! Let's
have a look inside.</p>
<h2 id="spam-checker-improvements">Spam checker improvements</h2>
<p>In the past few weeks, the Synapse team has been working with the Matrix.org
Trust &amp; Safety team to help module developers build more efficient protections
against spam. As a consequence of this work, Synapse 1.62 introduces new ways
for modules to communicate the result of actions taken against a specific
message or operation through the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.62/modules/spam_checker_callbacks.html">spam checker module
callbacks</a>.</p>
<p>Previously, most spam checker callbacks would be expected to return a boolean
indicating whether a specific operation should be qualified as spam. Starting
from Synapse 1.62, modules are now expected to return either
<code>synapse.module_api.NOT_SPAM</code> (to indicate an action is not spammy), or an error
code that is part of <code>synapse.module_api.errors.Codes</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the previous behaviour is still supported but is now deprecated, and
will be removed in a future version of Synapse.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.62/upgrade.html#new-signatures-for-spam-checker-callbacks">the upgrade
notes</a>
for a list of the affected callbacks and an example of this change. Note that on
top of the list described there, the <code>check_event_for_spam</code> callback was also
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.62/upgrade.html#new-signature-for-the-spam-checker-callback-check_event_for_spam">updated with a similar
change</a>
in Synapse 1.61.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse includes important performance improvements around
syncing, specifically around handling device lists and notifications.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.62 also introduce a changes of its optional dependency on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-synapse-ldap3">LDAP3
authentication provider
module</a> to
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-synapse-ldap3/releases/tag/v0.2.1">v0.2.1</a>
in order to fix an issue with usernames that include uppercase characters.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.62.0">full
changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.62/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1620">upgrade

<p>I had the chance to have Ryan with me for a special edition of Open Tech Will Save Us on Thunderbird to celebrate their 102 release, which includes Matrix support for the first time in a stable release.</p>
<p>We covered many interesting topics, such as the importance of specifying the expected behaviour of clients and servers in a protocol to deliver the best experience to end users (wink, wink, reminds you of something?), why Thunderbird was more dormant and is now vibrant as ever, what they plan for the future. I had good fun and I hope attendees did too! Next episode is going to be at the end of July, but you can already join the

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2974">MSC2974: Widgets: Capabilities re-exchange</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC is a relatively simple it. Currently widgets are only allowed to specify their capabilities (what the widget is allowed to do, like reading the logged-in user's display name) when the widget is loaded. This MSC attempts to allow that model to be extended to let widgets ask for additional (or fewer) permissions over time.</p>
<p>I can't help but be reminded of the shift in permissions on iOS and Android here in how they shifted from &quot;ask all permissions up front&quot; to &quot;ask for permission for each thing when it's used in the app&quot; :)</p>
<p>Check it out if widgets are your thing!</p>

<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.9">Dendrite 0.8.9</a> which contains a number of improvements around backfilling room history, amongst other things.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Incoming device list updates over federation are now queued in JetStream for processing so that they will no longer block incoming federation transactions and should never end up dropped, which will hopefully help E2EE reliability</li>
<li>The <code>/context</code> endpoint now returns <code>&quot;start&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;end&quot;</code> parameters to allow pagination from a context call</li>
<li>The <code>/messages</code> endpoint will no longer return <code>&quot;end&quot;</code> when there are no more messages remaining</li>
<li>Deactivated user accounts will now leave all rooms automatically</li>
<li>New admin endpoint <code>/_dendrite/admin/evacuateUser/{userID}</code> has been added for forcing a local user to leave all joined rooms</li>
<li>Dendrite will now automatically attempt to raise the file descriptor limit at startup if it is too low</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>A rare crash when retrieving remote device lists has been fixed</li>
<li>Fixes a bug where events were not redacted properly over federation</li>
<li>The <code>/invite</code> endpoints will now return an error instead of silently proceeding if the user ID is obviously malformed</li>
</ul>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever noticed that some people are just plain @*%&amp;!¬ß%&quot;+? Well, to quickly deal with what they wrote, Nheko now has a <code>/redact @userid:server.name</code> command, so you can redact everything they wrote (as long as it is in the currently cached section of the timeline). Note that you will run into rate limits when using that and Nheko is not yet applying an appropriate backoff in that case.</p>
<p>Similarly, q234rty fixed a lot of cases where icons in Nheko were either blurry or the wrong size. We fixed a few crashes, the room list should now not sometimes store the wrong order of rooms, brausepulver made large avatars cropped locally (since servers don't guarantee any size over 96x96 when cropped and synapse doesn't properly save the full image size in that case) and added a menu entry to copy a roomlink. You can also now define new powerlevels for users instead of using the existing levels in the room and Jason fixed some compiler warnings when a private member struct doesn't have an explicit constructor on some compilers. Nheko also now downloads the full online key backup when you explicitly toggle the switch.</p>
<p>A more noticeable topic might be, that Nheko now requires servers which support the v1.1 API or later and will not allow you to login or register otherwise. At the same time we also enabled support for the shiny and new knock_restricted rule and all remaining groups code was removed (you know, the feature from before spaces were cool).</p>
<p>I also updated Nheko on my work laptop now and since I was quite surprised by how fast it starts now (while my room count is over 900 !), I attached a video of that below for your pleasure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because sometimes you just have to do something else and it might be interesting to some people:</p>
<ul>
<li>I fixed calls not working when trying to use Element Web with a Conduit server: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/8931</li>
<li>I fixed Element Android still using the unstable endpoint (i.e. the one from the MSC, that proposed it) to list aliases: https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/6288</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes fixing something that annoys you isn't even that hard, and since it annoys you, you have some motivation to fix it. I call this Anger Driven Development (ADD). If you have some things that annoy you, I encourage to try fixing them for a bit. It might help out some other people too. If that makes you want to contribute to Nheko, don't hesitate to join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> and ask me to help you out with whatever fix you are trying to contribute.</p>
<p>This time I just decided to clean out some issues, that came up in the Conduit development channel and that weren't fixed yet. Turns out it was just a few lines to change and it hopefully makes the Matrix experience better for everyone in  the long run. The changes were also quickly reviewed and are merged now. Do you have any such little fixes that no one hears about, but you are proud of them? Please post about them, I'd love to see them!</p>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last few weeks, a significant push on rust-crypto-support for Nodejs has taken place, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/803">this PR</a>. Major parts are available, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/763">infrastructure to create releases ready</a>, however, a pretty rare huge memory allocation that causes a crash in Nodejs on the CI has blocked progress of the team recently. Debugging this <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/804">costs a lot of time and it is yet unclear</a>, how much of a problem this really is (as the cause stays mysterious), however it has also been seen in the wild on Windows now-- a concerning development.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean, there isn't any development going on. Thanks to the active community around the project, we now have a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/560">fix to prevent us from processing the same transaction twice</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/785">a method to create permalinks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/771">you can now verify sessions through FFI</a> as well as use the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/739">Client Builder via FFI</a>.

<p>Dart Matrix SDK: Version 0.10.2</p>
<p>This week, the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.10.2">version 0.10.2</a>. In this version, we added experimental support for native group call signaling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401">MSC3401</a>. We have been playing with it in our internal clients, and we have to say that we are pretty happy with the result! There are still some bugs, as sometimes a new call is creating instead of joining the existing one. But it's looking great!</p>
<p>We also took the opportunity to fix some bugs in call handling. Now the ringtone is properly properly when rejecting a call. Also, when opening the client, we don't trigger a call event anymore if the call end event is in the sync response.</p>
<p>We also did some refactoring for the sync handler, reducing the usage of JSON objects and adding some try catch to handle issues when handling event room updates. We switched to custom CachedStreamController so even if the stream has already been listened to, you can still access the last sent value.</p>
<p>Finally, when sending messages when under unreliable connection, messages could be sent out of order. This is now fixed thanks to the implementation of a message sending queue.</p>

            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Today we're exceptionally releasing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.61.1">Synapse
1.61.1</a>, which comes
as a security release. <strong>Server administrators are encouraged to update as soon as
possible.</strong></p>
<p>This release fixes a vulnerability with Synapse's URL preview feature. URL
previews of some web pages can lead to unbounded recursion, causing the request
to either fail, or in some cases crash the running Synapse process.</p>
<p>Homeservers with the <code>url_preview_enabled</code> configuration option set to <code>false</code>
(the default value) are unaffected. Instances with the <code>enable_media_repo</code>
configuration option set to <code>false</code> are also unaffected, as this also disables
the URL preview functionality.</p>
<p>Server administrators who are unable to update Synapse should disable URL
previews by setting <code>url_preview_enabled: false</code> in their configuration file.
They can also delegate URL preview to a separate, dedicated worker to ensure the
process crashing does not impact other functionality of Synapse.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-22p3-qrh9-cx32">this security

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The big news from the spec <del>this</del> last week is the release of Matrix v1.3 üéâ (read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release">blog post</a> if you haven't already)! Roughly three months since the release of Matrix v1.2, this release brings improvements such as knocking on rooms, room version 10, reduced metadata in encrypted messages and the first pieces of aggregations finally landing in the spec proper. And more! See the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release">blog post</a> for the full changelog.</p>
<p>Most of the Spec Core Team has been away this week, thus there has not been much moving forwards. But we do have two new MSCs from <a href="https://github.com/duxovni">@duxovni</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Johennes">@Johennes</a>, which you can view above.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3077">MSC3077: Support for multi-stream VoIP</a> by <a href="https://github.com/SimonBrandner">@SimonBrandner</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC allows for differentiating between different incoming streams of media coming from a single user by adding a <code>sdp_stream_metadata</code> dictionary to Voice over IP (VoIP)-related events. This is a relatively simply addition with useful functionality, such as allowing a single user to share both their camera feed and screen share at the same time!</p>
<p>Check it out if that kind of stuff interests you!</p>

            <p>Hey everyone! Guess what? <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.61.0">Synapse
1.61</a> is out! Let's
have a look at it.</p>
<h2 id="farewell-groups">Farewell, groups</h2>
<p>If you are new to Matrix, you might have not heard of the feature referred to as
&quot;groups&quot; or &quot;communities&quot; (depending on the context). This feature allowed
grouping rooms and users to better represent a community, one of which being
<code>+matrix:matrix.org</code> which used to represent the Matrix community. This may
sound similar to <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/17/the-matrix-space-beta">Matrix
Spaces</a>, and it would
make sense since Spaces are meant to be a more powerful replacement for groups.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/04/05/synapse-1-56-released">Synapse 1.56</a>,
support for groups was deprecated, with a plan to fully remove it in a
later release of Synapse. This has now been done as of Synapse 1.61, and most of the
code supporting this feature has now been removed.</p>
<p>Note that this means that administrators of homeservers using workers can remove
endpoints related to groups from their reverse proxy configuration. See <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.61/upgrade.html#removal-of-deprecated-communitygroups">the
upgrade
notes</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="media-retention">Media retention</h2>
<p>A common issue we see homeserver administrators struggle with is managing the
disk space used by Synapse. A non-negligible part of that disk space usage is
dedicated to storing files uploaded by Matrix users, both local and remote.</p>
<p>Up until now Synapse would only provide administrators with limited, manual ways
to manage the media store of their homeserver, via the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/admin_api/media_admin_api.html">admin
API</a>.</p>
<p>As of this release, Synapse now allows administrators to define retention
lifetimes for local and remote media. This allows media that hasn't been
accessed in a long time to be automatically deleted, therefore freeing up disk
space. Server administrators wishing to control media retention more finely can
also define different policies for remote and local media.</p>
<p>This feature can be enabled by configuring the <code>media_retention</code> setting, see
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#media_retention">the configuration
guide</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse introduces a change in the return value of the
<code>check_event_for_spam</code> spam checker module callback, in order to allow modules
more flexibility in communicating to users why their messages are rejected. This
is part of ongoing improvement works around spam checker callbacks, watch this
space next time for more information!</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.61.0">full
changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.61/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1610">upgrade
notes</a>

thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular
order) <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk

<blockquote>
<p>This week the team released Synapse 1.61, which main new feature is media retention. That's right, you can now control how long Synapse keeps media files around, which should help server admins manage Synapse's disk space usage more efficiently. On a different note, this release of Synapse removes support for groups/communities (which was deprecated back in Synapse 1.56), as it has now been replaced by Spaces. Farewell groups, you have served your users well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since I skipped the last update, this one is a bit longer :3</p>
<p>First of all there have been lots and lots of updates to the translations! Finnish is now at 100% thanks to the tireless work of Aminda and Lurkki.</p>
<p>Nheko now also shows a nice badge on Unity compatible desktops (like KDE) for unread messages (although that doesn't work properly for multiple profiles being open at the same time due to limitations in that desktop protocol. Thank you d42 for contributing this, may you role a natural 42 every dice throw!</p>
<p>Syldra fixed up the paste behaviour (which didn't properly tie into undo in some edge cases), cleaned up how we find some of our dependencies and made cusor movement more consistent across systems.</p>
<p>Finally we fixed our glare resolution when verifying other sessions, which will be especially noticeable when verifying Cinny, since that responds to verification requests in a different way than I tested before! This should get rid of a whole range of verification issues people might have experienced. As part of our stabilization for the next release, we also fixed a crash on logout because I fatfingered and deleted a return statement, we now send an Element Android compatible height attribute on emotes, properly compile when the C++ version is set to 20, we once again support the current version of the hidden read receipts MSC (so that others can't tell what you read), edits now properly update in replies again, you can close the image overlay again by clicking outside, cancelled uploads properly get removed again, logging out and back in now doesn't mess up your configuration anymore and pinned messages now properly refresh once the events are loaded.</p>
<p>Phew, that was a mouthful. And we are not even done yet!</p>
<p>I spent some time on making Nheko compilation a bit faster again as well as improve startup speed. This might order your room list a bit weirdly for a few days after updating, but should normalize when receiving a few messages in some rooms. With this we now don't need to load the last message in all rooms on startup. This makes Nheko startup now only take 7 seconds on my old laptop (when not doing something CPU heavy at the same time). The remaining startup time is 40% building up the font database and 40% loading the powerlevels for each room. So we do have the chance to speedup startup by probably another 60%. It is unlikely that is necessary though.</p>
<p>When I discovered Matrix, Element was still called Riot. At the time some of the big design changes started happening to make it the Element you know today. One of the sideeffects was that the roomlist was consistently taking up 20% of my CPU on my Laptop, which I used at the time (and am forced to use now again, since I broke my newer laptop). It also used a lot more RAM than it does today. So for that reason I started shopping around for what other clients there are and I found Nheko. Clearly because it isn't a webclient, it had to be faster and use less RAM. Well, it did maybe a bit, but frankly the difference wasn't that much. Especially since at the time it loaded and rendered ALL your messages on startup (kinda). It never removed messages from memory, so it would just continuously render more and more parts of your timeline, which clearly increased RAM usage. It did however never resort the full roomlist, which made it not use a lot of CPU.</p>
<p>Since I didn't know any web development at the time, but I knew some C++, I started contributing to Nheko. At some point I made the roomlist constantly resort, which used quite some amount of CPU, but I quickly fixed that. At the time the most noticeable difference was that my fans didn't spin when using Nheko, but Element did (because of the roomlist sorting, iirc). RAM usage was pretty bad though. So that was one of the next projects, removing all events from RAM and only pulling them from the database as needed. While this means some additional load when switching rooms, it did decrease RAM requirements by quite a bit. Some new features made us still require loading data for every room from the database on startup, which causes quite some noticeable startup delay. The latest changes however got rid of most of that. We now don't need to load the messages from the database anymore. The only thing we still load is a small info object with roomname, notification and member count as well as the power levels of the room.</p>
<p>Since I recently broke my new and fast laptop, I decided to checkout how things changed on my old and slow laptop. Nowadays I am not in 15 rooms anymore, but I am in 900 rooms, but Matrix, servers as well as clients, has also gotten a lot more performant. So in the end I decided to do a little benchmark of where things stand. <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This is completely unscientific and unfair, so please take those numbers with a grain of salt. Almost no one runs such a slow laptop as I do, so likely your measurements will completely different. Even more, I was video recording the benchmark, which makes both clients a lot slower. Nonetheless it does somewhat mirror my personal experience.</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion that with 900 rooms, Nheko takes about 10-20 seconds to load and be ready for use on my system, while Element takes about 3 to 4 minutes. So basically Element handles 60 times as many rooms about 2x slower than it did back in the day, while Nheko got a bit faster or about the same speed on the same hardware (but still 60x as many rooms). I've attached a sped up video to this post, so that you can compare it for yourself. But since a lot of people ask, I guess the reason is that I wanted to see how fast you can make a Matrix client. I think I somewhat achieved that in the startup time department, but switching rooms still has a loooooong way to go. Also it is just fun to implement whatever you want in a client, since you are the maintainer and none can tell you how bad of an idea it is. That's probably the reason a lot of people start their own clients? (Although I didn't start Nheko, I just wrote too much code and people didn't want to review it anymore.)</p>
<p>That's it, I hope your eyes didn't glaze over with me babbling on about things. See you next time! :3

            <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>It‚Äôs another quarter and therefore <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/">another spec release</a>! Matrix 1.2 was <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/02/matrix-v-1-2-release">released</a> back in February, and while a bit late in the quarter this time around we‚Äôve still got some exciting additions coming to you in this release.</p>
<p>Like last time, the speed of these releases might feel a bit quick for developers: fret not if you‚Äôre still working on v1.1 or v1.2 implementations. We‚Äôre not expecting that implementations update as soon as a new spec release is published, but rather that the ecosystem gradually update over the course of the next few months. Implementations should be aiming for as close to realtime as they can get though, particularly considering v1.4 is expected to have some large features (more on that later on).</p>
<p>Matrix 1.3 sees 14 MSCs get merged, but we can‚Äôt possibly go into detail on them all here. We‚Äôve picked some notable highlights and recommend the full changelog at the bottom for a complete idea of what‚Äôs been going on.</p>
<h2 id="aggregations-and-the-relationships-made-along-the-way">Aggregations and the relationships made along the way</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs no secret that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1849">MSC1849</a>-style server-side aggregation of related messages have been in the review backlog for a while. We ended up splitting <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1849">MSC1849</a> down into more reviewable chunks like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2675">MSC2675</a>, allowing us to finally land the first pieces into Matrix 1.3 today.</p>
<p>In the spec there aren‚Äôt currently any defined relationships which make use of aggregations or even the <code>rel_type</code> described by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2674">MSC2674</a>, but we do expect that v1.4 of the spec will have support for at least threads (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>) and edits (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676</a>), filling the gap. For now, we‚Äôve decided that holding aggregations back until v1.4 doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense, so we have launched them into the world as-is for custom relations or for clients &amp; servers to prepare for what‚Äôs expected to be coming in v1.4 of the spec.</p>
<p>To further prepare for threads, we‚Äôve also removed some restrictions of rich replies through <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3676">MSC3676</a>, thus allowing replies to be constructed with non-text messages like images. Check out the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#rich-replies">new rich replies module</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="join-if-you-can-or-just-knock">Join if you can, or just knock</h2>
<p>When we launched restricted rooms in Matrix 1.2 we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/02/matrix-v-1-2-release#public-but-not-too-public-join-rules">noted</a> that we forgot to handle a case where someone might want to support <em>both</em> knocking and restricted rooms at the same time. We‚Äôve fixed that with a stop-gap join rule from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3787">MSC3787</a> in <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/rooms/v10/">room version 10</a>.</p>
<p>The new <code>knock_restricted</code> join rule allows the room to keep its desire to be restricted whilst also allowing members who do not meet the criteria to knock on the room instead. We‚Äôll likely expand on this sort of mixing of join rules in proposals like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3386">MSC3386</a> down the line, however for now this should cover the gap in support. Next up: figuring out how to make encrypted room history available to these new joiners in a safe way.</p>
<h2 id="a-thread-for-next-time">A thread for next time</h2>
<p>Originally planned for this release, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>-style threads are anticipated to be ready for v1.4 (next quarter) with support for notifications and, of course, a whole new way to communicate in a room.</p>
<p>Threads are one of the more complicated features we‚Äôve tried to land in recent history as it has a large impact on a wide variety of the spec: everything from event relationships (fixed in this release) to read receipts to push notifications needs to be worked out to build a system that not only users can understand, but also the developers trying to build it. With this massive surface area we just weren‚Äôt comfortable with adding threads to v1.3 as-is, given problems like notifications aren‚Äôt yet fully solved.</p>
<p>Alongside threads, we also anticipate that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676</a>-style message editing will be landing in v1.4, finally specifying how to update an event‚Äôs contents without having to redact &amp; re-send. Although message editing has been supported for a long time in some clients, we're excited that it will finally become part of the official specification, meaning it can be implemented more widely. Messaging clients are encouraged to give the proposal an early read and possibly even attempt implementation if not already done to help us ensure the system is in a reasonable state for inclusion in the spec, though we do note that feature requests for edits will likely be deferred to a future MSC.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix">This Week In Matrix</a> for updates on what v1.4 is expected to include, and how things are progressing.</p>
<h2 id="the-full-changelog">The full changelog</h2>
<p>MSCs are how the spec changes in the way it does - adding, fixing, and maintaining features for the whole ecosystem to use. The blog post can‚Äôt cover them all, but that doesn‚Äôt make them any less important! Check out the full changelog below, and the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals/">Spec Change Proposals</a> page for more information on how these MSCs got merged (hint: they submitted a proposal, which anyone can do - take a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkZz60RRfc">Matrix Live episode</a> where Matthew covers the proposal process).</p>

<p>The release date for Matrix v1.3 has been set in stone for Thursday, June 16th 2022! Expect a blog post on the day detailing all of the new additions.</p>
<p>The bot that posts MSC updates in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> and elsewhere has been switched from @mscbot:amorgan.xyz to @mscbot:matrix.org. The backend of the bot uses https://github.com/Informo/specs-bot/.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2000">MSC2000: Server-side password policies</a>!</p>
<p>This is a proposal that adds a mechanism for homeserver administrators to define a password policy for users. This policy can decide rules such as a minimum password length, whether a digit is required, etc. This policy can be enforced by the homeserver when a user registers an account or changes their account password and is communicated to the client so that it can also be enforced locally.</p>
<p>Astute readers will possibly note that authentication in Matrix will eventually be replaced by OAuth2 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2964">MSC2964</a>). This will move operations like password policy enforcement from the homeserver to a separate authentication service, essentially removing the need to reinvent-the-wheel in a homeserver.</p>
<p>Registration, login and managing passwords and connected third-party IDs is often a complex part of a Matrix homeserver. Moving these out to a separate authentication service will both unlock new features (log in with Matrix!) as well as reduce the resources required to implement a Matrix homeserver.</p>

<li>
<p>Update to the check_event_for_spam module callback: Deprecate the current callback signature, replace it with a new signature that is both less ambiguous (replacing booleans with explicit allow/block) and more powerful (ability to return explicit error codes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add storage and module API methods to get monthly active users (and their corresponding appservices) within an optionally specified time range.</p>

<li>
<p>Support the new error code ORG.MATRIX.MSC3823.USER_ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED from MSC3823.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.8">Dendrite 0.8.8</a>, which contains the following improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of state resolution has been increased significantly for larger rooms</li>
<li>A number of changes have been made to rate limiting:
<ul>
<li>Logged in users will now be rate-limited on a per-session basis rather than by remote IP</li>
<li>Rate limiting no longer applies to admin or appservice users</li>
<li>It is now possible to configure additional users that are exempt from rate limiting using the <code>exempt_user_ids</code> option in the <code>rate_limiting</code> section of the Dendrite config</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Setting state is now idempotent via the client API state endpoints</li>
<li>Room upgrades now properly propagate tombstone events to remote servers</li>
<li>Room upgrades will no longer send tombstone events if creating the upgraded room fails</li>
<li>A crash has been fixed when evaluating restricted room joins</li>

<p>FluffyChat 1.5.0 goes Material You</p>
<p>FluffyChat 1.5.0 has been released and will soon be in all stores. This release comes with a bunch of bugfixes and introduces the first iteration of a Material You based design. We also try to support Android 12 accent colors (while this does not seem to work yet). On other platforms, our own purple shape will stay the default.</p>
<p>I like the new Material You design while we needed to tweak it at some points. Also the dropdown menu misses some elevation but this is a known issue in the Flutter repo which will be fixed soon.</p>
<p>This is also the first build with Flutter 3 which should improve the performance a little bit. Unfortunately it brings some regressions. We are forced to ship a little bug with it: Sharing on iPads seems to be broken. I'm very unhappy with this situation but otherwise we would have ended up in different releases for different platforms. As there afaik are not that many iPad users out there, we decided to live with this compromise and ship a bugfix release asap.</p>
<p>Yeah... Flutter has a lot of pros but also a lot of cons. Every new release of this framework leads to the fear of new regressions. Shipping a new major release where basic stuff like &quot;Sharing&quot; is just broken, is totally stupid... but that's the decision of Google. :-P</p>
<p>We didn't want to wait to ship the new design and also we needed a new release to come back to F-Droid where FluffyChat wasn't available in the last weeks because of a ProGuard problem, which should be fixed now.</p>

<p>Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fheese:element.io">Florian Heese</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Element Call Beta 2</strong></p>
<p>This week we landed Element Call beta 2 (https://call.element.io) including a bunch of nice updates. First of all, everything is now end-to-end encrypted by default: not only the WebRTC streams but also the matrix signaling (It was consciously disabled in beta 1 for debugging purposes). Moreover, we have experimental support for spatial audio rendering. Give it a try ‚Äî you can find it in the settings section. It's a lot of fun to play with and really supports immersion during a video call. This release also introduces a whole new experimental way of communicating: Walkie-talkie mode. In that mode, videos are disabled, and everyone is muted by default. To speak, press the ‚Äòpush-to-talk‚Äô (PTT) button ‚Äî takes me back to my childhood üôÇ</p>

<p>This week, the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.9.12">version 0.9.12</a>. In this version, we updated our Matrix API Lite package, in which we fixed the issue with the room hierarchy endpoint with some improper parsing and wrong type coming from the generation of the spec Open API documentation.</p>
<p>We also did some housekeeping and renamed some methods and getter to make them explicit. For example, the <code>futureSender</code> getter is now an asynchronous method called <code>fetchEventSender()</code> to make it clear that calling this function may trigger an API call.</p>

<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we've been working on getting Matrix 1.3 out the door and generally working towards a better process for handling releases alongside critical proposals for the protocol. The goal is to be able to ship these major features while reducing the risk of a release falling behind. Watch this space for more details as this should result in MSCs getting through the process a little bit quicker.</p>
<p>For Matrix 1.3, we're targeting <strong>Thursday, June 16th, 2022</strong> as our release date, though this comes with a small asterisk: we're looking to land quite a lot of stuff so might have to adjust the date once more as needed. We do feel reasonably confident in the date though - watch for blog posts titled Matrix 1.3 in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've had breakthroughs this week on implementing a native Matrix SFU (selective forwarding unit) which speaks <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401">MSC3401</a>, thanks to <a href="https://siobud.com/">Sean DuBois</a> - all round WebRTC superstar, project lead for the <a href="https://github.com/pion/webrtc">Pion</a> WebRTC implementation for Go, and author of <a href="https://webrtcforthecurious.com/">WebRTC for the curious</a>.</p>
<p>Sean generously contributed an initial proof of concept to show how you'd build an MSC3401 SFU using Pion at https://github.com/matrix-org/sfu-to-sfu - which (I think?) is the first time that the first implementation of a major core MSC has been contributed from outside the core team.  Huge thanks to Sean to setting the ball going on this - the current PoC demonstrates not just SFU capability but also the decentralised cascading architecture which makes MSC3401 unique. The initial PoC speaks a 'test jig' version of MSC3401 hooked up to a simple web client for experimentation, but Matthew's now experimenting with adding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sfu-to-sfu/pull/10">genuine Matrix support</a> to it via mautrix-go, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/2423">hooking up Element Call</a> to speak to it.</p>
<p>Adding SFU support to Element Call will mean that we can support more than ~7 simultaneous calls - and with MSC3401-style decentralised cascading, we should be able to support hundreds or even thousands. There's lots of work remaining here, but the ball is now rolling.  For more info about SFUs and MSC3401, check out Matthew's <a href="https://2021.commcon.xyz/talks/extending-matrix-s-e2ee-calls-to-multiparty">CommCon 2021 talk</a> (which was what prompted Sean's implementation work here!)</p>
<p>Separately, we've been running Element Call on staging with E2EE enabled for the last few weeks, and should be releasing the first major Element Call update next week.  And once SFUs land, then Element Call can exit beta - watch out Zoom!</p>

<p>libolm 3.2.12 has been released.  The main update in this release is that the <code>olm_sas_calculate_mac_fixed_base64</code> is now exposed in all the official bindings, so that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3783">MSC3783</a> can be implemented.  Aside from that, there have been some minor fixes and improvements.  See the <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/-/releases/3.2.12">changelog</a> for more information.</p>

<p>While most of the work in the background continues (Sliding-Sync PoC, Wasm+NodeJS support, UniFFI macros), the first few parts surface through the cracks and show themselves in new PRs:  <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/675">basic wasm web-js and nodejs support has landed</a> with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/721">more APIs</a>, tests and documentation on the way; the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/728">Sliding Sync PoC</a> has been upgraded to the latest JSON layout and now provides a first set of reactive API via FFI, too. Furthermore this week has seen a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/716">cleanups</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/717">simplifications</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/712">clarifications</a> around the OlmMachine and crypto types, and we're <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/729">fixing a bug in the state store</a>, where not all data has been properly encrypted in the past.</p>

<p>Dart Matrix SDK : Version 0.9.9</p>
<p>This week, the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.9.9">version 0.9.9</a>. In this new version, we added a search function to allow searching for an event in database and on server through several requests to the <code>/messages</code> endpoint.</p>
<p>There was also some work on updating the image size when generating thumbnail, which allow saving a bit of calculation when sending events. If using a custom resizer make sure to update the resize response as <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/company/frontend/famedlysdk/-/snippets/2342277">here</a>.</p>
<p>We also did some refactor with the event sender getter. The getter result is now a future to allow requesting the member event to the server if we cannot find it in memory, to help fix the issue when the user was not found in memory.</p>
<p>Finally, a quick helper function (<code>client.waitForSync</code>) was added. It allows you to wait for a room to appear in (left, join, invited) section of the sync response.</p>
<p>See you next time ;)</p>

<p>Only a small update this week. One new feature and some much needed Ansible improvements.</p>
<p>Pipes move messages from one room to an other. Useful if you are in important rooms but only want to monitor a single room. 
The Ansible role can now manage more aspects of MCM. Mainly in the post setup phase. The major one being if you run into encryption errors for any reason you can run the playbook with the fix tag and it will generate you a new device ID and encryption store.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pipes move all messages from one room to an other.</li>
<li>Adding a filter now uses the room the command was sent from by default if the roomid is not specified.</li>
<li>Ansible role now has tags for start, stop, configs, fix and all.</li>
<li>Ansible role backs up the configuration.toml file to prevent the possibility of data loss.</li>
