            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Today we're exceptionally releasing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.61.1">Synapse
1.61.1</a>, which comes
as a security release. <strong>Server administrators are encouraged to update as soon as
possible.</strong></p>
<p>This release fixes a vulnerability with Synapse's URL preview feature. URL
previews of some web pages can lead to unbounded recursion, causing the request
to either fail, or in some cases crash the running Synapse process.</p>
<p>Homeservers with the <code>url_preview_enabled</code> configuration option set to <code>false</code>
(the default value) are unaffected. Instances with the <code>enable_media_repo</code>
configuration option set to <code>false</code> are also unaffected, as this also disables
the URL preview functionality.</p>
<p>Server administrators who are unable to update Synapse should disable URL
previews by setting <code>url_preview_enabled: false</code> in their configuration file.
They can also delegate URL preview to a separate, dedicated worker to ensure the
process crashing does not impact other functionality of Synapse.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-22p3-qrh9-cx32">this security
advisory</a>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io">Andrew Morgan (anoa)</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3834">MSC3834: Opportunistic user key pinning (TOFU)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3837">MSC3837: Cascading profile tags for push rules</a></li>

<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The big news from the spec <del>this</del> last week is the release of Matrix v1.3 üéâ (read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release">blog post</a> if you haven't already)! Roughly three months since the release of Matrix v1.2, this release brings improvements such as knocking on rooms, room version 10, reduced metadata in encrypted messages and the first pieces of aggregations finally landing in the spec proper. And more! See the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release">blog post</a> for the full changelog.</p>
<p>Most of the Spec Core Team has been away this week, thus there has not been much moving forwards. But we do have two new MSCs from <a href="https://github.com/duxovni">@duxovni</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Johennes">@Johennes</a>, which you can view above.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3077">MSC3077: Support for multi-stream VoIP</a> by <a href="https://github.com/SimonBrandner">@SimonBrandner</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC allows for differentiating between different incoming streams of media coming from a single user by adding a <code>sdp_stream_metadata</code> dictionary to Voice over IP (VoIP)-related events. This is a relatively simply addition with useful functionality, such as allowing a single user to share both their camera feed and screen share at the same time!</p>
<p>Check it out if that kind of stuff interests you!</p>

            <p>Hey everyone! Guess what? <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.61.0">Synapse
1.61</a> is out! Let's
have a look at it.</p>
<h2 id="farewell-groups">Farewell, groups</h2>
<p>If you are new to Matrix, you might have not heard of the feature referred to as
&quot;groups&quot; or &quot;communities&quot; (depending on the context). This feature allowed
grouping rooms and users to better represent a community, one of which being
<code>+matrix:matrix.org</code> which used to represent the Matrix community. This may
sound similar to <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/17/the-matrix-space-beta">Matrix
Spaces</a>, and it would
make sense since Spaces are meant to be a more powerful replacement for groups.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/04/05/synapse-1-56-released">Synapse 1.56</a>,
support for groups was deprecated, with a plan to fully remove it in a
later release of Synapse. This has now been done as of Synapse 1.61, and most of the
code supporting this feature has now been removed.</p>
<p>Note that this means that administrators of homeservers using workers can remove
endpoints related to groups from their reverse proxy configuration. See <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.61/upgrade.html#removal-of-deprecated-communitygroups">the
upgrade
notes</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="media-retention">Media retention</h2>
<p>A common issue we see homeserver administrators struggle with is managing the
disk space used by Synapse. A non-negligible part of that disk space usage is
dedicated to storing files uploaded by Matrix users, both local and remote.</p>
<p>Up until now Synapse would only provide administrators with limited, manual ways
to manage the media store of their homeserver, via the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/admin_api/media_admin_api.html">admin
API</a>.</p>
<p>As of this release, Synapse now allows administrators to define retention
lifetimes for local and remote media. This allows media that hasn't been
accessed in a long time to be automatically deleted, therefore freeing up disk
space. Server administrators wishing to control media retention more finely can
also define different policies for remote and local media.</p>
<p>This feature can be enabled by configuring the <code>media_retention</code> setting, see
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#media_retention">the configuration
guide</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse introduces a change in the return value of the
<code>check_event_for_spam</code> spam checker module callback, in order to allow modules
more flexibility in communicating to users why their messages are rejected. This
is part of ongoing improvement works around spam checker callbacks, watch this
space next time for more information!</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week the team released Synapse 1.61, which main new feature is media retention. That's right, you can now control how long Synapse keeps media files around, which should help server admins manage Synapse's disk space usage more efficiently. On a different note, this release of Synapse removes support for groups/communities (which was deprecated back in Synapse 1.56), as it has now been replaced by Spaces. Farewell groups, you have served your users well.</p>
<p>See the full Synapse 1.61 release announcement on the matrix.org blog here: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/17/synapse-1-61-released</p>
<p>Aside from this, the team is as always hard at work on making Synapse better and more efficient.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I skipped the last update, this one is a bit longer :3</p>
<p>First of all there have been lots and lots of updates to the translations! Finnish is now at 100% thanks to the tireless work of Aminda and Lurkki.</p>
<p>Nheko now also shows a nice badge on Unity compatible desktops (like KDE) for unread messages (although that doesn't work properly for multiple profiles being open at the same time due to limitations in that desktop protocol. Thank you d42 for contributing this, may you role a natural 42 every dice throw!</p>
<p>Syldra fixed up the paste behaviour (which didn't properly tie into undo in some edge cases), cleaned up how we find some of our dependencies and made cusor movement more consistent across systems.</p>
<p>Finally we fixed our glare resolution when verifying other sessions, which will be especially noticeable when verifying Cinny, since that responds to verification requests in a different way than I tested before! This should get rid of a whole range of verification issues people might have experienced. As part of our stabilization for the next release, we also fixed a crash on logout because I fatfingered and deleted a return statement, we now send an Element Android compatible height attribute on emotes, properly compile when the C++ version is set to 20, we once again support the current version of the hidden read receipts MSC (so that others can't tell what you read), edits now properly update in replies again, you can close the image overlay again by clicking outside, cancelled uploads properly get removed again, logging out and back in now doesn't mess up your configuration anymore and pinned messages now properly refresh once the events are loaded.</p>
<p>Phew, that was a mouthful. And we are not even done yet!</p>
<p>I spent some time on making Nheko compilation a bit faster again as well as improve startup speed. This might order your room list a bit weirdly for a few days after updating, but should normalize when receiving a few messages in some rooms. With this we now don't need to load the last message in all rooms on startup. This makes Nheko startup now only take 7 seconds on my old laptop (when not doing something CPU heavy at the same time). The remaining startup time is 40% building up the font database and 40% loading the powerlevels for each room. So we do have the chance to speedup startup by probably another 60%. It is unlikely that is necessary though.</p>
<p>When I discovered Matrix, Element was still called Riot. At the time some of the big design changes started happening to make it the Element you know today. One of the sideeffects was that the roomlist was consistently taking up 20% of my CPU on my Laptop, which I used at the time (and am forced to use now again, since I broke my newer laptop). It also used a lot more RAM than it does today. So for that reason I started shopping around for what other clients there are and I found Nheko. Clearly because it isn't a webclient, it had to be faster and use less RAM. Well, it did maybe a bit, but frankly the difference wasn't that much. Especially since at the time it loaded and rendered ALL your messages on startup (kinda). It never removed messages from memory, so it would just continuously render more and more parts of your timeline, which clearly increased RAM usage. It did however never resort the full roomlist, which made it not use a lot of CPU.</p>
<p>Since I didn't know any web development at the time, but I knew some C++, I started contributing to Nheko. At some point I made the roomlist constantly resort, which used quite some amount of CPU, but I quickly fixed that. At the time the most noticeable difference was that my fans didn't spin when using Nheko, but Element did (because of the roomlist sorting, iirc). RAM usage was pretty bad though. So that was one of the next projects, removing all events from RAM and only pulling them from the database as needed. While this means some additional load when switching rooms, it did decrease RAM requirements by quite a bit. Some new features made us still require loading data for every room from the database on startup, which causes quite some noticeable startup delay. The latest changes however got rid of most of that. We now don't need to load the messages from the database anymore. The only thing we still load is a small info object with roomname, notification and member count as well as the power levels of the room.</p>
<p>Since I recently broke my new and fast laptop, I decided to checkout how things changed on my old and slow laptop. Nowadays I am not in 15 rooms anymore, but I am in 900 rooms, but Matrix, servers as well as clients, has also gotten a lot more performant. So in the end I decided to do a little benchmark of where things stand. <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This is completely unscientific and unfair, so please take those numbers with a grain of salt. Almost no one runs such a slow laptop as I do, so likely your measurements will completely different. Even more, I was video recording the benchmark, which makes both clients a lot slower. Nonetheless it does somewhat mirror my personal experience.</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion that with 900 rooms, Nheko takes about 10-20 seconds to load and be ready for use on my system, while Element takes about 3 to 4 minutes. So basically Element handles 60 times as many rooms about 2x slower than it did back in the day, while Nheko got a bit faster or about the same speed on the same hardware (but still 60x as many rooms). I've attached a sped up video to this post, so that you can compare it for yourself. But since a lot of people ask, I guess the reason is that I wanted to see how fast you can make a Matrix client. I think I somewhat achieved that in the startup time department, but switching rooms still has a loooooong way to go. Also it is just fun to implement whatever you want in a client, since you are the maintainer and none can tell you how bad of an idea it is. That's probably the reason a lot of people start their own clients? (Although I didn't start Nheko, I just wrote too much code and people didn't want to review it anymore.)</p>
<p>That's it, I hope your eyes didn't glaze over with me babbling on about things. See you next time! :3

            <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>It‚Äôs another quarter and therefore <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/">another spec release</a>! Matrix 1.2 was <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/02/matrix-v-1-2-release">released</a> back in February, and while a bit late in the quarter this time around we‚Äôve still got some exciting additions coming to you in this release.</p>
<p>Like last time, the speed of these releases might feel a bit quick for developers: fret not if you‚Äôre still working on v1.1 or v1.2 implementations. We‚Äôre not expecting that implementations update as soon as a new spec release is published, but rather that the ecosystem gradually update over the course of the next few months. Implementations should be aiming for as close to realtime as they can get though, particularly considering v1.4 is expected to have some large features (more on that later on).</p>
<p>Matrix 1.3 sees 14 MSCs get merged, but we can‚Äôt possibly go into detail on them all here. We‚Äôve picked some notable highlights and recommend the full changelog at the bottom for a complete idea of what‚Äôs been going on.</p>
<h2 id="aggregations-and-the-relationships-made-along-the-way">Aggregations and the relationships made along the way</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs no secret that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1849">MSC1849</a>-style server-side aggregation of related messages have been in the review backlog for a while. We ended up splitting <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1849">MSC1849</a> down into more reviewable chunks like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2675">MSC2675</a>, allowing us to finally land the first pieces into Matrix 1.3 today.</p>
<p>In the spec there aren‚Äôt currently any defined relationships which make use of aggregations or even the <code>rel_type</code> described by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2674">MSC2674</a>, but we do expect that v1.4 of the spec will have support for at least threads (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>) and edits (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676</a>), filling the gap. For now, we‚Äôve decided that holding aggregations back until v1.4 doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense, so we have launched them into the world as-is for custom relations or for clients &amp; servers to prepare for what‚Äôs expected to be coming in v1.4 of the spec.</p>
<p>To further prepare for threads, we‚Äôve also removed some restrictions of rich replies through <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3676">MSC3676</a>, thus allowing replies to be constructed with non-text messages like images. Check out the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#rich-replies">new rich replies module</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="join-if-you-can-or-just-knock">Join if you can, or just knock</h2>
<p>When we launched restricted rooms in Matrix 1.2 we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/02/matrix-v-1-2-release#public-but-not-too-public-join-rules">noted</a> that we forgot to handle a case where someone might want to support <em>both</em> knocking and restricted rooms at the same time. We‚Äôve fixed that with a stop-gap join rule from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3787">MSC3787</a> in <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/rooms/v10/">room version 10</a>.</p>
<p>The new <code>knock_restricted</code> join rule allows the room to keep its desire to be restricted whilst also allowing members who do not meet the criteria to knock on the room instead. We‚Äôll likely expand on this sort of mixing of join rules in proposals like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3386">MSC3386</a> down the line, however for now this should cover the gap in support. Next up: figuring out how to make encrypted room history available to these new joiners in a safe way.</p>
<h2 id="a-thread-for-next-time">A thread for next time</h2>
<p>Originally planned for this release, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>-style threads are anticipated to be ready for v1.4 (next quarter) with support for notifications and, of course, a whole new way to communicate in a room.</p>
<p>Threads are one of the more complicated features we‚Äôve tried to land in recent history as it has a large impact on a wide variety of the spec: everything from event relationships (fixed in this release) to read receipts to push notifications needs to be worked out to build a system that not only users can understand, but also the developers trying to build it. With this massive surface area we just weren‚Äôt comfortable with adding threads to v1.3 as-is, given problems like notifications aren‚Äôt yet fully solved.</p>
<p>Alongside threads, we also anticipate that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676</a>-style message editing will be landing in v1.4, finally specifying how to update an event‚Äôs contents without having to redact &amp; re-send. Although message editing has been supported for a long time in some clients, we're excited that it will finally become part of the official specification, meaning it can be implemented more widely. Messaging clients are encouraged to give the proposal an early read and possibly even attempt implementation if not already done to help us ensure the system is in a reasonable state for inclusion in the spec, though we do note that feature requests for edits will likely be deferred to a future MSC.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix">This Week In Matrix</a> for updates on what v1.4 is expected to include, and how things are progressing.</p>
<h2 id="the-full-changelog">The full changelog</h2>
<p>MSCs are how the spec changes in the way it does - adding, fixing, and maintaining features for the whole ecosystem to use. The blog post can‚Äôt cover them all, but that doesn‚Äôt make them any less important! Check out the full changelog below, and the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals/">Spec Change Proposals</a> page for more information on how these MSCs got merged (hint: they submitted a proposal, which anyone can do - take a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkZz60RRfc">Matrix Live episode</a> where Matthew covers the proposal process).</p>

<p>The release date for Matrix v1.3 has been set in stone for Thursday, June 16th 2022! Expect a blog post on the day detailing all of the new additions.</p>
<p>The bot that posts MSC updates in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> and elsewhere has been switched from @mscbot:amorgan.xyz to @mscbot:matrix.org. The backend of the bot uses https://github.com/Informo/specs-bot/.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2000">MSC2000: Server-side password policies</a>!</p>
<p>This is a proposal that adds a mechanism for homeserver administrators to define a password policy for users. This policy can decide rules such as a minimum password length, whether a digit is required, etc. This policy can be enforced by the homeserver when a user registers an account or changes their account password and is communicated to the client so that it can also be enforced locally.</p>
<p>Astute readers will possibly note that authentication in Matrix will eventually be replaced by OAuth2 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2964">MSC2964</a>). This will move operations like password policy enforcement from the homeserver to a separate authentication service, essentially removing the need to reinvent-the-wheel in a homeserver.</p>
<p>Registration, login and managing passwords and connected third-party IDs is often a complex part of a Matrix homeserver. Moving these out to a separate authentication service will both unlock new features (log in with Matrix!) as well as reduce the resources required to implement a Matrix homeserver.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.8">Dendrite 0.8.8</a>, which contains the following improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of state resolution has been increased significantly for larger rooms</li>
<li>A number of changes have been made to rate limiting:
<ul>
<li>Logged in users will now be rate-limited on a per-session basis rather than by remote IP</li>
<li>Rate limiting no longer applies to admin or appservice users</li>
<li>It is now possible to configure additional users that are exempt from rate limiting using the <code>exempt_user_ids</code> option in the <code>rate_limiting</code> section of the Dendrite config</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Setting state is now idempotent via the client API state endpoints</li>
<li>Room upgrades now properly propagate tombstone events to remote servers</li>
<li>Room upgrades will no longer send tombstone events if creating the upgraded room fails</li>
<li>A crash has been fixed when evaluating restricted room joins</li>
</ul>

<p>FluffyChat 1.5.0 goes Material You</p>
<p>FluffyChat 1.5.0 has been released and will soon be in all stores. This release comes with a bunch of bugfixes and introduces the first iteration of a Material You based design. We also try to support Android 12 accent colors (while this does not seem to work yet). On other platforms, our own purple shape will stay the default.</p>
<p>I like the new Material You design while we needed to tweak it at some points. Also the dropdown menu misses some elevation but this is a known issue in the Flutter repo which will be fixed soon.</p>
<p>This is also the first build with Flutter 3 which should improve the performance a little bit. Unfortunately it brings some regressions. We are forced to ship a little bug with it: Sharing on iPads seems to be broken. I'm very unhappy with this situation but otherwise we would have ended up in different releases for different platforms. As there afaik are not that many iPad users out there, we decided to live with this compromise and ship a bugfix release asap.</p>
<p>Yeah... Flutter has a lot of pros but also a lot of cons. Every new release of this framework leads to the fear of new regressions. Shipping a new major release where basic stuff like &quot;Sharing&quot; is just broken, is totally stupid... but that's the decision of Google. :-P</p>
<p>We didn't want to wait to ship the new design and also we needed a new release to come back to F-Droid where FluffyChat wasn't available in the last weeks because of a ProGuard problem, which should be fixed now.</p>

<p>This week we landed Element Call beta 2 (https://call.element.io) including a bunch of nice updates. First of all, everything is now end-to-end encrypted by default: not only the WebRTC streams but also the matrix signaling (It was consciously disabled in beta 1 for debugging purposes). Moreover, we have experimental support for spatial audio rendering. Give it a try ‚Äî you can find it in the settings section. It's a lot of fun to play with and really supports immersion during a video call. This release also introduces a whole new experimental way of communicating: Walkie-talkie mode. In that mode, videos are disabled, and everyone is muted by default. To speak, press the ‚Äòpush-to-talk‚Äô (PTT) button ‚Äî takes me back to my childhood üôÇ</p>

<p>We also did some housekeeping and renamed some methods and getter to make them explicit. For example, the <code>futureSender</code> getter is now an asynchronous method called <code>fetchEventSender()</code> to make it clear that calling this function may trigger an API call.</p>

<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we've been working on getting Matrix 1.3 out the door and generally working towards a better process for handling releases alongside critical proposals for the protocol. The goal is to be able to ship these major features while reducing the risk of a release falling behind. Watch this space for more details as this should result in MSCs getting through the process a little bit quicker.</p>
<p>For Matrix 1.3, we're targeting <strong>Thursday, June 16th, 2022</strong> as our release date, though this comes with a small asterisk: we're looking to land quite a lot of stuff so might have to adjust the date once more as needed. We do feel reasonably confident in the date though - watch for blog posts titled Matrix 1.3 in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>This week was a short one, but work continues on fast room joins, testing Synapse with workers on Complement,
and increasing the efficiency of Synapse with regard to database i/o. In addition, we released v1.60.0 (https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases), which includes</p>
<ul>
<li>work to reduce the possibility of database corruption</li>
<li>a fix to a bug introduced in Synapse 1.60.0rc1 that would break some imports from <code>synapse.module_api</code></li>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.7">Dendrite 0.8.7</a>! This is a <strong>highly recommended</strong> update since it fixes some fairly large bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support added for room version 10</li>
<li>A number of state handling bugs have been fixed, which previously resulted in missing state events, unexpected state deletions, reverted memberships and unexpectedly rejected/soft-failed events in some specific cases</li>
<li>Fixed destination queue performance issues as a result of missing indexes, which speeds up outbound federation considerably</li>
<li>A bug which could cause the <code>/register</code> endpoint to return HTTP 500 has been fixed</li>

<p>Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've had breakthroughs this week on implementing a native Matrix SFU (selective forwarding unit) which speaks <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401">MSC3401</a>, thanks to <a href="https://siobud.com/">Sean DuBois</a> - all round WebRTC superstar, project lead for the <a href="https://github.com/pion/webrtc">Pion</a> WebRTC implementation for Go, and author of <a href="https://webrtcforthecurious.com/">WebRTC for the curious</a>.</p>
<p>Sean generously contributed an initial proof of concept to show how you'd build an MSC3401 SFU using Pion at https://github.com/matrix-org/sfu-to-sfu - which (I think?) is the first time that the first implementation of a major core MSC has been contributed from outside the core team.  Huge thanks to Sean to setting the ball going on this - the current PoC demonstrates not just SFU capability but also the decentralised cascading architecture which makes MSC3401 unique. The initial PoC speaks a 'test jig' version of MSC3401 hooked up to a simple web client for experimentation, but Matthew's now experimenting with adding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sfu-to-sfu/pull/10">genuine Matrix support</a> to it via mautrix-go, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/2423">hooking up Element Call</a> to speak to it.</p>
<p>Adding SFU support to Element Call will mean that we can support more than ~7 simultaneous calls - and with MSC3401-style decentralised cascading, we should be able to support hundreds or even thousands. There's lots of work remaining here, but the ball is now rolling.  For more info about SFUs and MSC3401, check out Matthew's <a href="https://2021.commcon.xyz/talks/extending-matrix-s-e2ee-calls-to-multiparty">CommCon 2021 talk</a> (which was what prompted Sean's implementation work here!)</p>
<p>Separately, we've been running Element Call on staging with E2EE enabled for the last few weeks, and should be releasing the first major Element Call update next week.  And once SFUs land, then Element Call can exit beta - watch out Zoom!</p>

<p>Dart Matrix SDK : Version 0.9.9</p>
<p>This week, the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.9.9">version 0.9.9</a>. In this new version, we added a search function to allow searching for an event in database and on server through several requests to the <code>/messages</code> endpoint.</p>
<p>There was also some work on updating the image size when generating thumbnail, which allow saving a bit of calculation when sending events. If using a custom resizer make sure to update the resize response as <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/company/frontend/famedlysdk/-/snippets/2342277">here</a>.</p>
<p>We also did some refactor with the event sender getter. The getter result is now a future to allow requesting the member event to the server if we cannot find it in memory, to help fix the issue when the user was not found in memory.</p>
<p>Finally, a quick helper function (<code>client.waitForSync</code>) was added. It allows you to wait for a room to appear in (left, join, invited) section of the sync response.</p>

</div>
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>We just wanted to take a moment to welcome <a href="https://rocket.chat">Rocket.Chat</a> to Matrix, given the <a href="https://rocket.chat/press-releases/rocket-chat-leverages-matrix-protocol-for-decentralized-and-interoperable-communications">recent announcement</a> that they are switching to using Matrix for standards-based interoperable federation!  This is incredible news: Rocket.Chat is one of the leading open source collaboration platforms with <a href="https://rocket.chat/company/about-us">over 12 million users</a>, and they will all shortly have the option to natively interoperate with the wider Matrix network: the feature has already landed (in alpha) in <a href="https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases/tag/4.7.0">Rocket.Chat 4.7.0</a>!</p>
<p>We‚Äôd like to thank the whole Rocket.Chat team for putting their faith in Matrix and joining the network: the whole idea of Matrix is that by banding together, different independent organisations can build an open decentralised network which is far stronger and more vibrant than any closed communication platform.  The more organisations that join Matrix, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">more useful and valuable</a> the network becomes for everyone, and the more momentum there is to further refine and improve the protocol.  Our intention is that Matrix will grow into a massive open ecosystem and industry, akin to the open Web itself‚Ä¶ and that every organisation participating, be that Rocket.Chat, Element, Gitter, Beeper, Famedly or anyone else will benefit from being part of it. We are stronger together!</p>
<p>Rocket.Chat‚Äôs implementation follows the ‚Äú<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix#how-do-you-make-an-existing-chat-system-talk-matrix">How do you make an existing chat system talk Matrix?</a>‚Äù approach we published based on our experiences of linking Gitter into Matrix. Looking at the initial <a href="https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23688">pull request</a>, the implementation lets Rocket.Chat act as a Matrix Application Service, effectively acting as a bridge to talk to an appropriate Matrix homeserver.  From chatting with the team, it sounds like next steps will involve adding in encryption via our upcoming <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/699">matrix-sdk-crypto node bindings</a> - and then looking at ways to transparently embed a homeserver like Dendrite, sharing data as much as possible between RC and Matrix, so Rocket.Chat deployments can transparently sprout Matrix interoperability without having to run a separate homeserver.  Super exciting!</p>
<p>You can see a quick preview of a Rocket.Chat user chatting away with an Element user on matrix.org via Matrix here:</p>
<p><video style="width: 100%" src="/blog/img/164530391-e8b17ecd-a4d0-4ef8-a8b7-81230c1773d3.mp4" controls></video></p>
<p>So, exciting times ahead - needless to say we‚Äôll be doing everything we can to support Rocket.Chat and ensure their Matrix integration is a success.  And at this rate, they might be distinctly ahead of the curve if they start shipping Dendrite!  Meanwhile, we have to wonder who will be next? Nextcloud? Mattermost? Place your bets‚Ä¶ ;)</p>

<li>Quentin and Maximilien from Deuxfleurs are creating Garage, a robust and distributed storage backend that can run on old computers. Who can use it? Why? And when should I not use it? Let's find out!</li>
<li>Nathan from the Guardian Project is working with wind, butter, and rasperries to provide applications and messaging to people in low-connectivity areas. A fascinating dive off the grid.</li>

<p>The upcoming release of Matrix v1.3 is still in the works, but near! Expect a solid release date to be announced next week.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2872">MSC2872: Move the widget title to the top level of the definition</a>!</p>
<p>A bite-size MSC which aims to clean up the definition of a widget state event... by moving the &quot;title&quot; field to the root of the state event, alongside the existing &quot;name&quot; field.</p>
<p>This MSC needs someone to write an implementation in at least one homeserver and client to move forwards. Perhaps that someone could be you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.6">Dendrite 0.8.6</a> which contains a number of fixes and tweaks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Room versions 8 and 9 are now marked as stable</li>
<li>Dendrite can now assist remote users to join restricted rooms via <code>/make_join</code> and <code>/send_join</code></li>
<li>The sync API no longer returns immediately on <code>/sync</code> requests unnecessarily if it can be avoided</li>
<li>A race condition has been fixed in the sync API when updating presence via <code>/sync</code></li>
<li>A race condition has been fixed sending E2EE keys to remote servers over federation when joining rooms</li>
<li>The <code>trusted_private_chat</code> preset should now grant power level 100 to all participant users, which should improve the user experience of direct messages</li>
<li>Invited users are now authed correctly in restricted rooms</li>
<li>The <code>join_authorised_by_users_server</code> key is now correctly stripped in restricted rooms when updating the membership event</li>
<li>Appservices should now receive invite events correctly</li>
<li>Device list updates should no longer contain optional fields with <code>null</code> values</li>
<li>The <code>/deactivate</code> endpoint has been fixed to no longer confuse Element with incorrect completed flows</li>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We added a way to edit permissions in Nheko now. It is an unconventional drag and drop dialog, where you drag users and permissions between different roles. We are hoping that this will make powerlevels easier to understand. Be careful when trying it, the wrong powerlevels might make your room unusable. Now... the bad part about that is, that powerlevels add around 50-100 new strings to translate... Help is appreciated! &lt;3</p>
<p>Nheko now also supports fallback keys, which should make E2EE more reliable after long periods of being offline and you can send images by pressing enter again. The privacy screen is also now fixed for separate room windows and our flatpak supports more image formats.

<blockquote>
<p>Since our last update from about a month ago, we had two bugfix releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruma 0.6.2 added methods to get the current room powerlevels from a <code>StrippedPowerLevelsEvent</code> and to get a user's membership whether the state event is redacted or not, and added a missing export to track member changes.</li>
<li>Ruma 0.6.3 fixed the serialization and deserialization of events with a dynamic <code>event_type</code> and added convenience constructors for logging in with a <code>UserIdentifier</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also landed a bunch of internal work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvement in our macros, notably to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1109">support unstable prefixes for event types</a>.</li>
<li>Some cleanup like removing some dead code, removing unnecessary <code>PartialEq</code> implementations, and fixing missing feature flags.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1109/commits/1cae9d253bb43c9ad8699cd3b59b89da23bd0e73">minimum supported rust version is now 1.59</a> and we use the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1137">Rust 2021 Edition</a>.</li>
<li>We started to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1132">refactor our tests</a> to have more helpful failure messages.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1114">push rules don't apply to the user's own events</a></li>
<li>Add support for <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1112">MSC3700: Ignore <code>content.sender_key</code></a></li>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1902">MSC1902: Split the media repo into s2s and c2s parts</a>!</p>
<p>Homeservers currently make use of Client Server Media APIs to pull media from other homeservers over federation. This has worked for a long time, but is a bit of a confusing blur of the lines between client&lt;-&gt;server and server&lt;-&gt;server traffic. It also makes it difficult to require different authentication rules for clients versus servers.</p>
<p>This MSC aims to help clean that up. Take a look if you're interested!

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week's <code>testing</code> updates are now in <code>master</code>!</p>
<p>Also included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better error handling:</strong> if the backend hits an error that causes your connection to KT chats to be dropped, the bridge should notify you about it (not that it should ever happen in the first place, but you never know!)</li>
<li><strong>Better logging:</strong> the Node module can be configured to print the arguments of RPC commands received from / sent to the Python module.  The example Node config includes a default set that should be helpful for general debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Room metadata bridging:</strong> setting an Open Chat title &amp; topic from Matrix should work now!
<ul>
<li>Setting the title of a Direct Chat should work too, but topics remain unbridged (since KT Direct Chats don't have topics/descriptions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Defensive error handling:</strong> Attempts to add a non-friend user to a DM will be refused by the bridge, since KT only allows Direct Chats between friends
<ul>
<li>KT does allow &quot;1:1 Open Chats&quot; between non-friends, but those aren't bridged yet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, <code>testing</code> adds support for joining KakaoTalk rooms from Matrix, either by joining an existing portal or providing an Open Chat URL to the bot with a <code>join</code> command. ...However, I've been unable to test this, since KT is stingy about whom it allows to join Open Chats!  So please give this a try if you can.</p>
<p>In other news, this bridge is now listed on <a href="https://matrix.org/bridges/#kakaotalk">Matrix.org</a>! ü•≥  Thanks Thib !</p>
<p>Also, for the time being, I will be taking a hiatus from this bridge &amp; the LINE bridge, as I'll be quite occupied for the foreseeable future on account of having joined Element ü§©!!

<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.13.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>Read default port and listen address from config url (@BtbN)</li>
<li>Improvements to pillifying IRC nicks, again</li>
<li>Fixes for AUTOQUERY not always working correctly</li>
<li>Allow anyone to use STATUS command to get their own status</li>
<li>Filter control characters only for plumbs so people can send garbage to IRC if they wish from Matrix</li>
<li>Support for converting IRC color codes to Matrix (@tjaderxyz)</li>
<li>Fixed compose docker Synapse configuration for registration</li>
<li>Improved Python 3.10 compatibliy (@BtbN)</li>
<li>Hidden room to hide joins using restricted rooms join rule (@BtbN)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some cool stuff this time around! Aside from many bug fixes this release has two great new features: IRC message colors and hiding invites from channels.</p>
<p>IRC colors are enabled by default and are rendered how your Matrix client sees fit. They can be disabled per network if needed.</p>
<p>Hiding joins works with room v9 restricted join rules feture to allow IRC ghosts to join rooms without an invite from the bridge bot first. This clears some clutter and may even make joining a bit faster in the long run - we will see. This feature is disabled by default and needs to be enabled by the bridge administrator as it is consiered a &quot;labs&quot; feature for now.</p>
