            <h2 id="mautrixtelegramnowsupportsdoublepuppeting">mautrix-telegram now supports double puppeting</h2>
<a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been working away on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>, and has a major breakthrough:
<blockquote>It means you can log in to the bridge with your Matrix account to make messages you send from other Telegram clients appear from your Matrix account.<br /><br />It can also be used to enable bridging of ephemeral events, which synapse doesn't send to appservices (read receipts, typing notifications, presence).<br /><br />Also, the bridge has a new HTML parser which should be much better than the old one. It might have caused some new bugs though (like m.emote bridging breaking)</blockquote><br /><h2 id="coffeeandthefaqbot">Coffee and the FAQBot</h2><br />I've been slowly working on matrix.org the last couple of months, updating the FAQ, updating content and UI/appearance of <a href="/blog/try-matrix-now">try-matrix-now</a>. As you may know, the <a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee/FAQBot">FAQBot</a>, created and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee">Coffee</a>, uses try-matrix-now for it's data, so Coffee updated the bot to start to use some of the new fields.<br /><blockquote>The final puzzle piece needed for FAQBot has been put into place: https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/extract-web-to-org<br />This is the bit that grabs "Try Matrix Now!" and turns it into questions that FAQBot can use.<br />While I was working on that bit of code anyway, I also added support for the new 'home', 'repo', 'room' and 'language' fields. FAQBot will now give more and better information accordingly. For example, it is now possible to ask, "where is the Riot Android source code?" although it is generally better to just ask "where can I find Riot Android?" which combines several fields into a single answer.<br />4 of 7 items are now completed: https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/FAQBot/issues/2<br />and the remaining 3 items before FAQBot's release are just the final review and integration tests.</blockquote>
<h2 id="newdiscordbridgemaintainer">New Discord Bridge Maintainer</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has been working stridently on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">Discord Bridge</a> lately, and the project has now attracted a second maintainer:
<blockquote>We've got a new member of the maintainer crew in discord bridge land (bringing the total count to 2.) I'd like to welcome Sorunome :). They are going to be helping review the influx of PRs, chew some issues and be a point of contact in the community. They've already filled my PR queue up and it's going to help us move even faster!</blockquote>
In other Bridge news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> 1.5.0 is out now, uses the latest matrix-js-sdk and matrix-appservice-node, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/master/CHANGES.md">contains a lot of changes</a>.
<h2 id="brunounittests">Bruno unit tests</h2>
Bruno, the latest and greatest addition to the [riot-web] team, has been working on configuring end to end unit tests. His scripts now install synapse from the metal, install riot and then run a test suite. Take a look at the animation below to get the idea!

<h2 id="fractal3295">Fractal 3.29.5</h2>
<a href="@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre Franke</a> tells us about new features in Fractal 3.29.5, and how the project has benefited from <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a> contributors:
<blockquote>Fractal got a big new release 3.29.5, which includes Eisha's multi-line input (with markdown syntax highlighting) and Julian's room details redesign, as well as his refactor on avatar code which leads to a perf boost.</blockquote>
<h2 id="ananacegrafanawebhookformatrixnotifications">Ananace: Grafana webhook for Matrix notifications</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/ananace/">Ananace</a>, always working on sysadmin tooling with matrix, comes back with a new tool: <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-grafana-matrix">Grafana webhook for Matrix notifications</a>. This release is described as "the very first 'It doesn't crash instantly' version", but this is surely a useful project.
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ananace-grafana.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3425" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ananace-grafana.png" alt="" width="458" height="145" /></a></p>
<h2 id="quaternionlibqmatrixclientsupportlocalecho">Quaternion / libQMatrixClient support local echo</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> had a surprising week while working on his QMatrix projects:
<blockquote>/me accidentally found a year-old feature branch in his Git and thought of rebasing it in order to <em>eventually</em> continue working on it. As a result, libQMatrixClient and Quaternion master branches support local echo from today. Too bad the same trick doesn't work for E2EE.</blockquote>
Too bad indeed!

            <h2 id="specstatusandrequests">Spec Updates!</h2>
First of all: we've just released the first draft of the proposal for our next generation State Resolution algorithm as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">MSC1442</a> (State Resolution: Reloaded).  This is the result of a massive amount of work from Erik - if you are at all interested in the problems that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1953">state resets</a> have plagued us with, then you will want to <strong>read the proposal and please comment on it</strong>!
<p>The next step on State Resolution: Reloaded (once approved) is to be able to actually roll it out - and to this end, richvdh has proposed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1425">MSC1425 (Room Versioning proposal)</a>. This was published at the beginning of the week but we haven't had any feedback yet - again, please read &amp; give feedback as the intention is to start working on this as soon as possible!  Matthew's also been updating the Lazy Loading proposal (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1227">MSC1227</a>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Matrix Spec is now awash with activity, lots of work from <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> and others to accelerate progress. Take a look at the <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">proposals list</a> to stay up to date, or straight to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc">matrix-doc</a> repo and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> room to get the raw activity.</p>
<p>Finally, discussions relating to the spec proposal process itself have attracted attention: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1426">MSC1426</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1421">MSC1421</a>, and we're already trialling the new process (using Github PRs rather than Google Docs) in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">MSC1442</a> (State Resolution: Reloaded) already.</p>
<h2 id="nheko05x">nheko 0.5.x</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> 0.5.1 is out, and it's great! Get a version for your platform from <a href="https://bintray.com/mujx/matrix/nheko/">bintray.com</a>. I've been using it for the last week or so (on macOS) and found it very stable and usable. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mujx:matrix.org">mujx</a> commented that "highlights were encryption support &amp; desktop notifications on all platforms", but you can get much more thorough notes from the <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko/releases">release notes</a>.

<h2 id="plasma">Plasma</h2>
It's been several weeks since we mentioned <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/">Plasma</a>, but work on the C2S parts of the spec implementation have been happening quietly behind the scenes. Project lead <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/">Nico</a> said recently:
<blockquote>I've updated the CI test server with the latest snapshot version of plasma. <code>createRoom</code> and <code>invite</code> C2S endpoints are fully implemented and should work as expected.</blockquote>
You can find the full list of implemented endpoints <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/blob/master/README.md">in the readme</a>, and also read the <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/blob/master/docs/architecture.md">architecture overview</a>.
<h2 id="kitsuneliveonstage">kitsune, live on stage</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> presented an introduction to Matrix (for a technical audience) at the Tokyo Linux Users Group - you'll need to skip to 1h41m16s into the video.

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> continues working on <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad">GTAD</a>, and this week has started automatically including docs in <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a>:
<blockquote>GTAD is now aware of description and summary fields in API descriptions so you can use them with Javadoc/Doxygen.

SimpleMatrix is planning to use <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/matrix-java-sdk">matrix-java-sdk</a>, but for now is a visual mockup, it doesn't currently connect to Matrix.

<h2 id="talesofhalfshotandhismanybridges">Tales of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> and his many Bridges</h2>
<h3 id="arrivalofthediscorddms">Arrival of the Discord DMs</h3>
<blockquote>After lots of begging, frustration and eventually an offer of a free lunch (thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">Anoa</a>): I give you Discord DMs.<br />This first cut bridges over existing regular and group DMs to Matrix. In the future we will also allow you to create DMs from Matrix so that you can contact users without even logging into Discord. With thanks to the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discord:half-shot.uk">#discord:half-shot.uk</a> community for helping shape this feature!<br /><br />Currently this is in PR form but is very likely to make it into the 0.3 release of <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</a>.</blockquote>
<h3 id="halfshotfixesthefooneticircbridge">Half-Shot fixes the Foonetic IRC bridge</h3>
For those who (want to) use Foonetic IRC channels, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> is here for you! Previously this bridge had been down due to invalid certificates, but this is now resolved.
<h2>Synapse</h2>
Synapse 0.33 landed on Thursday, boasting 2x speed-ups for /sync and (briefly) meaning that the matrix.org homeserver felt impressively snappy and fast!  Ironically traffic levels promptly grew again such that the synapse master process is now the bottleneck once more, but between incremental state res, python 3 and upcoming room-sharding work we should see the performance fixes continuing to come!  Meanwhile, lots of PRs in the queue for Synapse 0.34 - including Lazy Loading support as per (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1227">MSC1227</a>), and a whole new set of stats functionality for tracking per-room and per-user stats.
<h2>Riot</h2>
Lots of activity in the build up to Riot/Web 0.16 - merging the new Slate rich text editor to /develop (try it now!), upgrading Jitsi and turning it on by default (at last!! - again, try it on /develop, although you'll have to enable it in Labs).  We'd be particularly interested in how Jitsi is behaving, as so far for us it's been unrecognisably improved over the previous deployment.
<p>Meanwhile, lots of work on Lazy Loading members on Riot/Web and Riot/iOS, and lots of stability perf work in general across mobile.</p>
<h2>State Resolution Special... Matrix Live!</h2>
And finally, all you could ever want to hear about the new State Resolution algorithm on a special edition of Matrix Live, starring Erik &amp; Matthew!

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We've just released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.0">Synapse 0.33.0</a>!  This is a <strong>major performance upgrade</strong> which speeds up /sync (i.e. receiving messages) by a factor of almost 2x!  This has already made a massive difference to the CPU usage and snappiness of the matrix.org homeserver since we rolled it out a few days ago - you can see the drop in sync worker CPU just before midday on July 17th; previously we were regularly hitting the CPU ceiling (at which point everything grinds to a halt) - now we're back down hovering between 40% and 60% CPU (at the current load).  This is actually fixing a bug which crept in around Synapse 0.31, so please upgrade - especially if Synapse has been feeling slower than usual recently, and especially if you are still on Synapse 0.31.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-19-at-13.00.01-1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3406" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-19-at-13.00.01-1-1024x639.png" alt="" width="813" height="507" /></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile we have a <strong>lot</strong> of new stuff coming on the horizon - a whole new algorithm for state resolution (watch this space for details); incremental state resolution (at last!) to massively speed up state resolution and mitigate extremities build up (and speed up the synapse master process, which is now the bottleneck again on the matrix.org homeserver); better admin tools for managing resource usage, and all the Python3 porting work (with associated speedups and RAM &amp; GC improvements).  Fun times ahead!</p>
<p>The full changelog follows below; as always you can grab Synapse from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.   Thanks for flying Matrix!</p>

<h2 id="fluffychatforubuntutouch">fluffychat for Ubuntu Touch</h2>
New to me, <a href="https://github.com/ChristianPauly/fluffychat">fluffychat</a> is a "Simple Matrix Messenger for <a href="https://ubports.com">Ubuntu Touch</a>". The design philosophy for this app is focused on simplicity, and the hope is for it to complement <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a>, another Ubuntu Touch client.
<blockquote>Why are you not just contributing to uMatriks?
uMatriks is great and it's superb, that someone has created a Matrix Client for Ubuntu Touch. But sometimes you have a so detailed vision of a user interface, which you want to implement, that you can not just contribute to an existing project. However, I would like to work with the uMatriks developers together. We could use the same push gateway for example.</blockquote>

            <p>Folks, Synapse 0.32.0 is an important security update: please upgrade as soon as you can.</p>
<p>The release focuses on security; fixing several federation bugs and adding new features for countering abuse. Notably it includes the ability to blacklist &amp; whitelist servers allowed to send events to a room on a per-room basis via the new 
m.room.server_acl
state event: see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aiuROf1__7ZFkJvDdAZQfBNxyzjYd-ijiRAcHJYqJCM/edit">MSC1383</a> for details.  This also closes out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/709">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/709</a> - one of our oldest feature requests from users who wish to be able to limit the servers allowed to participate in a given room.</p>
<p>It's important to understand that server ACLs only work if all the servers participating in the room honour them.  In future this will be handled better (as part of ongoing work in making it easier to incrementally version and upgrade the federation protocol).  This means that for the ACLs to work, any servers which don't yet implement ACLs (e.g. older Synapses) have to be ACL'd from the room for the access control to work.  
<b>Therefore please upgrade as soon as possible to avoid this problem.</b></p>
<p>This ongoing flurry of security work is in general all part of moving towards the long-awaited stable release of the Server-Server API. In parallel we've been working on the other main outstanding point: State Resets (i.e. scenarios where you get unexpected results when resolving conflicts between different servers' copies of a room).  There will be a few more major changes and upgrades on the horizon as we fix these, but then we'll finally be able to cut an r0 release of the Server-Server API and Matrix will be one massive step closer to being out of beta!</p>
<p>As always, you can get the new update from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.32.1">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.32.1</a>

<h2 id="googlesummerofcode">Google Summer of Code</h2>
The second evaluation for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a> is nearly here, so we have some updates from the student participants:
<h2 id="apwhitehatisworkingondendrite"><a href="@apwhitehat:matrix.org">apwhitehat</a> is working on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a></h2>
<blockquote>Dendrite updates for TWIM (before GSoC 2nd eval):
This month we've got most of the federation APIs working on Dendrite. These are:
<ul>
 	<li>State APIs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/486">#486</a></li>
 	<li>Get missing events API <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/516">#516</a></li>
 	<li>Query user devices <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/498">#498</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We still need to figure out pagination for backfill API.</p>
<p>On applications services, we've got a lot of APIs working, thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>. Authentication now acknowledges App services, though lot of other stuff is under review. I am eagerly waiting for it to land.</p>
</blockquote>
On the same topic, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> says:
<blockquote>We've had a PR from fadeAce/dirichlet_zby for the server-side implementation of end-to-end encryption support in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>. Will be looking forward to seeing that land as well.</blockquote>
There is an explanation of the endpoints required for this <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.3.0.html#end-to-end-encryption">in the CS API docs</a>.

<blockquote>Encryption in matrix-python-sdk should now work fairly well.<br />The biggest parts to write were device tracking and key persistence.

Last week I mistakenly referred to <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">Koma</a> as being written in Rust, then Java. This was all incorrect, though being written in Kotlin, Koma does run on the JVM and use JavaFx.

This week we welcome Bruno to the Riot team, he's off and away working on getting integration tests set up.
<p>Otherwise:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>More work on the Jitsi integration</li>
 	<li>More work troubleshooting E2E failures</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases/tag/v0.15.6">v0.15.6</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases/tag/v0.15.7-rc.1">v0.15.7-rc.1</a> now available</li>

Welcome to This Week in Matrix, let's see what updates the community has to offer this week!
<h2 id="koma">koma</h2>
Announcing his update nearly a week ago, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@radicus:matrix.org">radicus</a> released <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/releases/tag/0.7.3">v0.7.3</a> of <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">koma</a>.
<blockquote>There have been quite some changes since updates of the project were last posted, but the major ones are:
<ul>
 	<li>Upgrade to JavaFx 9</li>
 	<li>Experimental support for infinite scroll on message list</li>
 	<li>Rewrite ListView to improve performance and reduce jar file size</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="dialogflowconnector">dialogflow connector</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@vurpo:vurpo.fi">vurpo</a> has released <a href="https://gitlab.com/vurpo/matrix-dialogflow">matrix-dialogflow</a>, which allow the use of DialogFlow agents as chatbots:
<blockquote>I've written a little bot for connecting a DialogFlow agent to Matrix as a chatbot. I did this for my own personal purposes but I know someone else might find this handy as well.</blockquote>
<h2 id="mautrixtelegram">mautrix-telegram</h2>
<a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:
<blockquote>New stuff in mautrix-telegram:
<ul>
 	<li>A basic telematrix database import script</li>
 	<li>Improved config for relaybot message formatting, including the option to use Matrix displaynames (instead of just mxid localparts)
I've also been planning an improved Matrix-&gt;Telegram formatting converter and a provisioning API for integration managers like Dimension.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="jmsdk">jmsdk</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> has been working on a matrix client this week. To that end, he has implemented <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk">jmsdk</a>, a "very early version of the matrix sdk and common classes (client, bot, …)"
<blockquote>Currently implemented the matrix client on the java with full support of the C2S API. It still under development and contains bugs.</blockquote>
He has also been working on a "bot sdk with core classes to write custom bots and appservices."
<h2 id="matrixappservicevoip"><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/matrix-appservice-voip">matrix-appservice-voip</a></h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> has been working on VoIP bridging between Matrix and regular phones using Freeswitch:
<blockquote>We have successful VoIP bridging between Matrix and regular phones using Freeswitch, for 1:1, both directions! a v0.1 is scheduled in a few days once configuration is possible and a getting started doc is written.
<p>Next steps:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>more voice backends (think Jitsi, etc.)</li>
 	<li>SMS support with Twilio and/or OVH initially</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd">mxisd</a> integration to automatically invite bridge users if needed and suggest bridge users</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxgwd</a> integration to auto-join HS regular users if a VoIP bridge user invites them, so &gt; calls are directly seen</li>
 	<li>And much more in later releases</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="transform">transform</h2>
A wild <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bettiah:matrix.org">bettiah</a> appeared, announced a completely new homeserver implementation in TypeScript:
<blockquote>I have been working on a homeserver implementation over at <a href="https://github.com/bettiah/transform">https://github.com/bettiah/transform</a> . It is fairly basic at the moment, but the development experience is straight-forward and even fun.</blockquote>
I'm interested to see a TypeScript backend running, and of course it's great to have more homeserver implementations! Some highlights from the <a href="https://github.com/bettiah/transform">readme</a>:
<blockquote>Transform is a matrix homeserver built using Typescript and Redis. It is not fully functional yet.
<strong>Status:</strong> Register, Login, CreateRoom, Invite &amp; Join seem to be functional with riot web client. But quite a lot of functionality is missing and the software is definitely not ready for deployment in a public facing role.
<strong>Design:</strong> A lot of the code is auto-generated from the excellent swagger specs for the client-server api.
<strong>Contributing</strong>: It is early days yet. However, Typescript has enabled safe &amp; rapid progress. Redis streams too seem to have a very well thought out api and the whole thing has been a fun experience so far. Contributions are very welcome.</blockquote>
<h2 id="dsntravellersourcecodereleased">dsn-traveller source code released!</h2>
Good news for those following the progress of <a href="https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/">dsn-traveller</a>, the source is now publicly available!

<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> 0.3.0.2 has been released - no new features, just small fixes including one for an unlucky typo preventing 0.3.0.1 from generating .cpp files with GTAD.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> 0.0.9.2 is out, another step towards 0.1. Aside from bugfixes and using the latest libQMatrixClient, it features an entirely new timeline layout similar to that of Riot (the old one is still around too). Also, you can now change some settings through the menu rather than by editing a configuration file or registry - including switching timeline layouts on the fly!</blockquote><br /><h3><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-22-at-23.18.28.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3348" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-22-at-23.18.28-1024x563.png" alt="" width="1024" height="563" /></a></h3><br /><h3>Loading Artist sticker packs!</h3><br />TravisR says:<br /><blockquote>The Official Loading Artist sticker pack got added to <a href="http://dimension.t2bot.io/">Dimension</a> ?</blockquote>

<blockquote>I am currently writing a high-level API on top of gomatrix. As gomatrix is suitable for bots but not for clients, I decided to write a layer above it.

It will have similar API as libqmatrixclient, but in Golang.
It is currently under heavy development, and API breaking changes are frequent.

<h3>Terraform Provider</h3>
TravisR writes:
<blockquote>I've been working on a Terraform provider for matrix. It is still a work in progress, however I plan to have the basics completed in the coming days. The provider gives you the opportunity to create users, rooms, and other objects on your homeserver, making your homeserver part of your infrastructure. This could be useful for people who want to set up a monitoring room, or for setting up default rooms on a homeserver instance. In particular, this provider will be used by the monitor bot (see last week's post) to set up the test homeservers for seeing how the bot scales with increased server counts.

<h3>And finally...</h3>
On the core team it's been an irregular week; as mentioned in last TWIM we spent most of it in workshops working through spec issues as part of the mission to finally get to an 'r0' stable release of the spec across all APIs - not just the Client/Server API.  The majority of this was spent making up for lost time on the S2S API, analysing its various holes and designing solutions to them.  Things are looking promising - we're keeping the work under wraps though given the potential for abuse, although we should see more gaps being fixed in the coming days.  Meanwhile we're aiming to get the r0 stable release out by the end of August.  We also unblocked a few longstanding MSCs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/433">.well-known</a> URIs and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1232">media limits</a>), although in the end the S2S stuff took priority.  On the client side we did a lot of design sessions on Riot/Mobile (working out how the new app design should work on Mobile - watch this space for details!) and also how to speed up app launch (the concept of Hybrid Sync; somewhere between an initial sync and an incremental sync - basically an initial sync which can be interrupted in order to let the user use the app whilst the initial sync is still ongoing) - we'll write up the notes and publish these asap.
<p>We also announced the <a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">Open Governance</a> work which we've been doing in order to extend control of the Matrix spec to properly include the wider Matrix community - the plan is to get the Matrix.org Foundation legal entity set up roughly around the same time as the r0 release of the spec in August, and formally decouple control of the Matrix spec from New Vector (the company we set up last year to hire the core team).</p>
<p>We'd also like to welcome mujx (developer of nheko) and kitsune (developer of Quaternion and libQMatrixClient) to the new core team as we start trialling the new governance structure (which mainly amounts at this point to getting review approvals on spec proposals and changes from the relevant domain experts on the new team).  This brings us to a full complement for the team: Erik (servers), richvdh (servers, crypto &amp; clients), Dave (clients &amp; push/identity) and uhoreg (crypto, general) from the current core team; and Anoa (servers, AS API), TravisR (integrations, AS API; acting with Dimension hat on), mujx &amp; kitsune from the community.</p>
<p>Otherwise, spec work has taken priority over writing software, with the exception of: APwhitehat doing as much federation work in Dendrite as part of GSoC as the current unstable state of the API allows; Michael (t3chguy) has been blitzing through P1 Riot/Web issues.  Next week should be back on the normal (if not better!) trajectory however.  No Matrix Live this week however, as we're all exhausted.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Since we created Matrix.org back in 2014, the majority of the Matrix core team has worked for the same company - originally subsidiaries of Amdocs, and then since August 2017 for New Vector; the startup we incorporated to rehire the core team and support Matrix after we parted ways from Amdocs.</p>
<p>Despite working for a for-profit company, our prime directive has <b>always</b> been the long term mission to successfully run Matrix as a non-profit initiative for the benefit of the whole internet: to create a ubiquitous secure open network which gives users control back over their communication and avoids them ever being locked into silos again.  And even though Matrix.org hasn't been a formal non-profit foundation, we've treated it as such in all respects (e.g. gathering donations to support development on Matrix)</p>
<p>Running Matrix.org as a non-profit means prioritising to neutrally support all players in the whole ecosystem without ever giving unfair advantage to any individual participant (particularly New Vector) - where that ecosystem includes end-users, client devs, testers, spec devs, server admins, companies building products on Matrix, bridge devs, bot devs, widget devs, server devs, distro maintainers, moderators, even end-users who are using Matrix indirectly via bridges.</p>
<p>That being said, having the core team work for the same startup is still a somewhat unorthodox model for an open source project building an open standard, so we'd like to explain the main reasons for doing it up to this point:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure that Matrix is fit for real-world usage and to force us to dogfood it. To ensure that it is a protocol that works well enough that you can build a commercial startup around it if you so wanted, and to motivate us to build Matrix as something more than an academic or nerdy exercise in protocol design - rather one which can be commercially viable.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To help ensure the core team is aligned and pulling towards the same goal, especially during the process of actually designing and “giving birth” to the initial protocol and getting it to an ‘r0' release across all APIs.  We strongly believe that when a project is in the design phase you get faster and better design from a bunch of people who are collaborating together towards the same goal, rather than independent factions who might pursue their own agendas at the expense of the overall project.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Because we believe the value of Matrix lies in the size of the ecosystem, and if Matrix realises its full potential (i.e. it grows as big as the web), it only makes it more useful and valuable for *everyone*. We realise that it might be a leap of faith to believe that we don't have any incentive to sabotage Matrix by privileging specific players (after all, there are so many companies out there in it just for the cash), but the fact is that this is where we stand, and we're doing our best to prove it. To spell it out: it is in New Vector's interest (and also in the interests of other Matrix-focused companies) to grow Matrix to be as big, open, unfragmented and as neutral as possible.  Matrix should be big enough for a multitude of wildly successful companies and projects to benefit from it, and everyone wins - just like the web.</li>
</ul>
<b>However</b>, this approach is not perfect and comes with some major problems:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Without clear separation of responsibilities and incentives, we have to ask the community to take it on faith that our efforts are never intended to privilege New Vector ahead of the wider ecosystem. This leaves room for doubt, especially when our reasoning is unclear or our conclusions controversial.<br />A good example of a controversial decision is the lack of investment by the core team in the Server-Server API.  For the last ~2 years (since Mar 2016) we made the judgement call to prioritise user-facing features and experience.  The rationale was that to grow Matrix we need to provide a viable alternative to Slack/Discord/WhatsApp etc, and doing that means providing a Client-Server API which lets clients do just that, and server implementations capable of running at scale. This is why the CS API has had a stable release since Dec 2015 (currently at r0.3.0) and why we've put so much effort into server scaling/perf... but the SS API itself still has bugs and has still not yet made it to a stable release.<br />This is obviously incredibly frustrating to server devs who tried to implement the SS API despite it being unstable and unreleased. In retrospect it might have been a mistake and we could probably have turned off signup on matrix.org and diverted the resources to the SS API work instead.  However, this is a case of making the judgement call to prioritising the overall ecosystem over one class of stakeholders (server devs) by focusing on providing users usable and featureful decentralised communication apps. Indeed we strongly believe that users are the main means to grow the ecosystem (others have failed without them): no one joins a network with no friends, however popular it is among devs.  Nonetheless, we are finally in a position to <a href="/blog/2018/06/15/this-week-in-matrix-2018-06-15/">hire spec maintainers and get to a stable S2S</a> as fast as we possibly can, and frankly feel relieved to be able to unblock this situation.<br />Another good example is the recent <a href="/blog/2018/06/14/security-update-synapse-0-31-2/">0.31.2 security update</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Synapse: this was a defensive patch to the protocol that we added to ensure that even if bugs occur when authing events over federation, it should be impossible for a random user to ever hijack a room again.  We specced this out as a formal proposal and are gathering feedback, but expedited implementation in Synapse to protect the overall ecosystem. However, it turns out that the change breaks a small number of highly custom rooms, and so we find ourselves accused of privileging NV.  The reality is that we made a judgement call to protect the vast majority of today's ecosystem (and hope to provide a longer-term fix in the relatively near future which /will/ be compatible with more custom room use cases).
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another problem is some companies find it a turn-off to participate in Matrix unless they have a well-defined process for influencing the direction of the protocol.  Now, sometimes this could be seen as a feature rather than a bug; the last thing the ecosystem needs is a greedy corp trying to subvert the protocol to its own competitive advantage, and we don't want to be locked in that kind of battle either.  However, there are also lots of well-meaning and constructive companies who want to participate too, and there's an argument that they want a well-defined process for doing so.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The other main problem is simply one of checks &amp; balances.  Even though NV may be a good guardian today, what if something changed in future? e.g. if NV got bought by Microsoft, or if someone on the team had some crisis and changed priorities?  Whilst one could always fork, such things are incredibly disruptive and fragmenting and it'd be good to engineer Matrix.org's governance to be resilient to such eventualities as much as is possible.
</li>
</ul>
To address these problems, in March of this year we started work on a long term proposal to establish an open governance model for Matrix which ensures the neutrality of the protocol, lets the community contribute as widely as possible, and incorporates a dedicated neutral non-profit Matrix.org Foundation separate to New Vector.
<p>As work progressed on the proposal, it became clear that actually transitioning to a new governance model would seriously slow down the sprint towards a stable r0 release. We therefore decided to put completing the governance model on hold until after the r0 release (scheduled for the end of August).</p>
<p>With the end of r0 now in sight, completing work on the governance model is back on the agenda. We obviously want to ensure that the proposed governance model is going to work for everyone, so we'd like to introduce the first draft of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vASIt2v0UwKnUKHNEjA_P3SFCM0kcIUl1LQyM--ax04/edit#">Matrix Spec Change 1318: a proposal for open governance of the Matrix.org Spec</a>. This is quite an early draft; the idea is to gather feedback over the next few months and we'll then incorporate the Foundation and deploy the new governance model to coincide with the long-awaited stable release of all APIs of the Matrix Spec (assuming the release doesn't slip).</p>
<p>The main points in the proposal are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To adopt the new governance model once all APIs have had a stable r0 release.  For S2S API, this means fixing the remaining flaws in the federation protocol and closing the spec omissions such that compliant independent implementations can be written purely based on the spec.  For the AS and IS and Push API it means just closing spec omissions (if any) and doing a final review.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To define the mission of Matrix: to return control of communication to users by building a standards-based open secure decentralised communication network.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To define the mandate of the core team to act as a neutral custodian of the Matrix Spec, prioritising the long-term success and growth of the overall network over individual commercial concerns.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To define the guiding principles of the core team, e.g. collaboration rather than competition and contrarianism.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To restructure the core team to incorporate members of the community as well as the founding core team.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To propose succession logistics for the core team
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To propose the role and governance structure of the Matrix.org Foundation legal entity.
</li>
</ul>
Feedback would be much appreciated on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vASIt2v0UwKnUKHNEjA_P3SFCM0kcIUl1LQyM--ax04/edit#">MSC1318 Google Doc</a> - or come talk about it on 
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org</a> (which we might as well use for governance too).
<p>It's exciting times as we finally move towards an initial stable release of Matrix across all APIs - we are firmly on the road to a 1.0, and improving our governance model is a massive part of that process.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the core team.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>On Monday (2018-06-11) we had an incident where #matrix:matrix.org was hijacked by a malicious user pretending to join the room immediately after its creation in 2014 and then setting an m.room.power_levels event ‘before' the correct initial power_level for the room.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances this should be impossible because the initial m.room.power_levels for a room should be set before its m.room.join_rules event, meaning users who join the room are subject to its power levels. However, back before we'd even released Synapse, the first two rooms ever created in Matrix (#test:matrix.org and #matrix:matrix.org) were manually created and set the join_rules before the power_levels event, letting users join before the room's power_levels were defined, and so were vulnerable to this attack. We've since re-created #matrix:matrix.org - please re-/join the room if you haven't already!</p>
<p>As a defensive measure, we are releasing a security update of Synapse (0.31.2) today which changes the rules used to authenticate power_level events, such that we fail-safe rather than fail-deadly if the existing auth mechanisms fail. In practice this means changing the default power level required to set state to be 50 rather than 0 if there is no power_levels event present, thus meaning that only the room creator can set the initial power_levels event.</p>
<p>We are not aware of anyone abusing this (other than the old #matrix:matrix.org room) but we'd rather be safe than sorry, so would recommend that everyone upgrade as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This of course constitutes a change to the spec, so full technical details and ongoing discussion around the Matrix Spec Change proposal can be followed over at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1304">MSC1304</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: if you are aware of your server participating in rooms whose first power_levels event is deliberately set by a different user to their creator, please let us know asap (and don't upgrade!)</p>
<p>This work is all part of a general push to finalise and harden and fully specify the Server-Server API as we push towards a long-awaited stable release of Matrix!</p>
<p>As always, you can get the new update from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.31.2">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.31.2</a> or from any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.</p>
<p>thanks, and apologies for the inconvenience.</p>
