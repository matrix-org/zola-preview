            <p>Hi all, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.0">Synapse
1.55</a> is out! Let's
see the main talking points of this new release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update: After the initial release of Synapse 1.55, the developers of a
third-party tool (Jinja, which is the tool Synapse uses to render email and
web templates) released a new version of their project which proved
incompatible with Synapse. To address this issue, we have released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.2">Synapse
1.55.2</a>.</p>
<p>Deployments of Synapse using the <code>matrixdotorg/synapse</code> Docker image or Debian
packages from <code>packages.matrix.org</code> are not affected as they are already using
a compatible version of the tool.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the work we are doing to integrate
<a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> into Synapse (more on that a bit further
in this post) will, once completed, prevent this kind of issues from
happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="removing-support-for-mjolnir-1-3-1-and-older">Removing support for Mjolnir 1.3.1 and older</h2>
<p>Administrators of large homeservers and communities will already be familiar
with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir">Mjolnir</a>, which is a tool designed
to help them moderate a large number of rooms in an efficient way. It includes a
bot as well as a Synapse module to better interface with the homeserver.</p>
<p>Due to a change in how we manage some of Synapse's internal utilities, this
release of Synapse breaks compatibility with Mjolnir versions 1.3.1 and older.
Homeserver administrators using Mjolnir and upgrading to Synapse 1.55 should
make sure they're running Mjolnir version 1.3.2 or later.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.55/upgrade#compatibility-dropped-for-mjolnir-131-and-earlier">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="moving-synctl">Moving <code>synctl</code></h2>
<p><code>synctl</code> is a tool provided as part of Synapse to run and manage your instance
and its workers (if any).</p>
<p>As part of our work to integrate <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> in Synapse
(which in turn will enable a lot of cool things, such as reproducible builds),
we have recently moved the way we package this tool. As of this release,
homeserver administrators should stop invoking it using its direct path (e.g.
<code>/path/to/synctl start</code>), but should instead call it directly, e.g. <code>synctl start</code>.</p>
<p>This means homeserver administrators using <code>synctl</code> must make sure that the tool
is in their <code>PATH</code>. This is automatically done when installing and upgrading
Synapse using the <code>matrixdotorg/synapse</code> Docker image or Debian packages from
<code>packages.matrix.org</code>. When installing from a wheel, sdist, or PyPI, an
executable is created in your Python installation's <code>bin</code> directory.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.55/upgrade#synctl-script-has-been-moved">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release also introduces new module callbacks, allowing homeserver
administrators to more efficiently review which users are able to deactivate
users and shutdown rooms. More information on that in <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.55/modules/third_party_rules_callbacks.html#check_can_shutdown_room">Synapse's
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>We have also started experimenting with using the native Python asyncio event
loop in Synapse which, if successful, would make it easier to use building
blocks from the Python ecosystem when adding new features to Synapse.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.0">full
changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.55/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1550">upgrade
notes</a>
for this version.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our
thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular
order) <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>,
<a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a>, and

<p>Things have been relatively quiet on the P2P front recently as we have been working on fixing bugs in Dendrite, but we will be releasing build 94 of the P2P demos for iOS and for Android soon, which feature new fair queuing in Pinecone.

<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone. It's been a quieter week for the Synapse team---many of us are away this week.</p>
<p>We released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.0rc1">Synapse 1.55.0rc1</a> yesterday, a little later than usual. A full release is still planned for the coming Tuesday (22nd March). Please note that this release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11700">breaks compatibility with Mjolnir 1.3.1 and earlier</a>. Administrators using Mjolnir should ensure it is upgraded before upgrading Synapse to 1.55.0rc1.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the release candidate includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12028">New tools in the module API</a> enabling modules to prevent administrators from deleting rooms and deactivating users. Half-Shot <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12026">explains the movtivation here</a>.</li>
<li>Experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12135">using Twisted's asyncio reactor</a>. If this is feasible, it might allow us to leverage tools and libraries for Python's growing <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html?highlight=asyncio#module-asyncio">asyncio</a> ecosystem.</li>
<li>A performance fix for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12132">logging in on large accounts</a>.</li>
<li>A variety of other bugfixes and internal tweaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please feel free to try it out and let us know how you get on: either in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new/choose">on GitHub</a> if you encounter any unexplained problems. As ever, many thanks to all contributors involved.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes we've been working on a few longer-term projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continued support for threading (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>) and the mechanism which supports it, relations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2674">MSC2674</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11537">Managing Synapse's dependencies</a> using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12028">poetry</a> to formally lock requirements across all our debian and docker releases.</li>
<li>Performance investigations: we're looking at getting better profiling information; and seeing if we can reclaim CPU cycles by cancelling processing when a requester terminates their request early.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully we'll see these plans come to fruition over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week brings some bugfixes to DMs, and general improvements to the way channels are synced on startup.</p>
<p>I've also written some <a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-appservice-kakaotalk/src/branch/master/SETUP.md">setup instructions</a> to assist anyone wanting to try this bridge out for themselves!</p>
<p>As for bugs, I just stumbled upon a big one just now: if a KakaoTalk channel hasn't had activity for a few days, sending a message in its Matrix portal may crash. This happens because of the KakaoTalk API's apparent eagerness in forgetting about inactive channels (IIRC content that's a few weeks old is deleted from their servers, for privacy reasons), and the likely fix is for the bridge to use the right API calls to trigger those channels back into an active state before trying to interact with them.</p>
<p>Once that's fixed, the next thing I'll get out of the way (for the sake of completeness) is the web-based login interface, which all of the other mautrix-python bridges support (and is quite nice for privacy-conscious users that would rather send their KakaoTalk passwords directly to the bridge, instead of through a Matrix homeserver).</p>
<p>After that, I'll work on contact searching &amp; inviting contacts to group chats or DMs.</p>

<p>After our release last week, of course all the bugreports came out of the woodworks. As such we fixed issues with device ids being set incorrectly after SSO, screensharing, overlapping in the reply popup and UIA flows without fallback support like https://github.com/devture/matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth showing up as UIA stages. Key backup is also now enabled by default (if it has the correct signatures and everything), various layouting fixes and more.</p>
<p>We'll probably make a bugfix release in the next few days.</p>

<p>This is still early days: you cannot scroll the room list yet and there's still many outstanding issues to fix before it can land on mainline, but it's at the stage where it's <em>almost</em> ready for people to try out. Watch this space...</p>

<p>Matrix Wrench is a web client to tweak Matrix rooms.</p>

<h2 id="v0-6-0-v0-6-1">v0.6.0 &amp; v0.6.1</h2>
<p>Want to purge a space recursively? Matrix Wrench now has a button for that. It will try to fetch a list of all sub spaces and rooms and offer you to delete them via the Synapse Admin API.</p>
<p>Also, you can now knock on rooms and the room lists allow to navigate to a room page by clicking on a room ID.</p>
<p>Next up will likely be searchable lists for rooms and users as well as other usability and layout improvements. The goal is to have a nice-looking, stable v1.0 release for its anniversary on 13th June. I'm looking for help with design and documentation.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Keeping in step with our quarterly spec releases, the release of Matrix v1.3 is expected to land sometime early Q2 2022. This release will include Threads (as defined by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>), as well as a number of other MSCs which land in the meantime.</p>
<p>Speaking of other MSCs, client developers should be aware of upcoming work to support live and static location sharing in the ecosystem. A <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!XXSJTvRPInupfUgQVb:matrix.org/$SM5oKCPu1OYu1uVhn73YMUcJ4kBaQZEp_Z9Xx4EZUgQ?via=pixie.town&amp;via=matrix.org&amp;via=element.io">notice</a> on the subject has been posted today in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-client-developers:matrix.org">Matrix Client Developers room</a>.</p>
<p>A reminder that the matrix-doc GitHub repository has been split into two new repositories: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec">matrix-spec</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals">matrix-spec-proposals</a>. Read more about this in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix#msc-status">the last edition of TWIM</a>.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2398">MSC2398: proposal to allow mxc:// in the &quot;a&quot; tag within messages</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC makes the case for allowing linking to MXC content by using of an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag in the HTML-formatted <code>formatted_body</code> field of a <code>m.room.message</code>. As MXC urls could contain HTML files, it could be rather useful to link directly to them, as you would any other webpage. Your client would then translate this to an http/s URL which can be used to view/navigate to the file.</p>

<p>We've also landed more of the ground work to improve the time it takes for new servers to join big rooms, which Rich was talking about last week. Aside from this, we're continuing the effort towards switching Synapse to use <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>, which will enable reproducible builds for Synapse. These are some very exciting projects which will be maturing in the coming weeks, so watch this space!</p>

<p>The basics of the bridge are now ready! Backfilling, message sending, and message receiving are now implemented...albeit quite buggy and untested.</p>
<p>For anyone curious to try it out, installation follows the same general steps as <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/setup/index.html">tulir's Python-based mautrix bridges</a>, plus a backend Node module that must be launched before the Python component of the bridge. I'll write a README with proper setup instructions soon!</p>
<p>Just note that for the time being, <em>updates to the bridge may invalidate its database!!</em>. I won't guarantee stable DB upgrades until the bridge's early growing pains have settled down.</p>
<p>Reminder that my KakaoTalk ID is <code>fair-mw</code> if anyone wants to help me test things out 🙂</p>

<li>This week we checked-in on our language status and updated some things; We now support Ukrainian.</li>
<li>We’re working hard at updating the activity indicators in the app. While we work on the performance and load times in general we want to enable users to go about their tasks without being blocked by the activity indicator. The new indicator sits towards the top of the screen and should be out of the way for most tasks, whilst still informative. Let us know what you think!</li>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Namaste</em>  🙏,</p>
<p>We are happy to announce that Cinny now support <strong>all the features of Spaces</strong> — <em>a way to group rooms in Matrix</em>. This means that you can now create new spaces from client, add rooms or subspaces inside them or manage the added rooms.
We have also made our unique feature of <strong>Pinning spaces</strong> to sidebar more easy and organized. With this option all the spaces and subspaces will be visible at one place and you can select the one you want to pin or remove.
One more unique feature we added with update is the <strong>Categorized subspaces</strong>, what this do is make all the subspaces inside a space appear as categories. This is helpful when there are deep nested spaces inside a space and breadcrumb is pain to navigate back and fourth. Keep in mind that this ignore the nesting of subspaces and all of them will appear under mainspace, but nice thing is that you can select which subspace you want to categorized and which not.
Another exciting update related to spaces is the <em>Drag-and-Drop</em>. Earlier there was no option to reorder pinned spaces but now with DnD you can reorder them as you like.</p>
<p>Apart from spaces this update also include option to drag and drop files, ||sending spoiler||, desktop notification and viewing event source. (Thanks to @ginnyTheCat for these amazing additions.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gatho.party/">Gatho.party</a> is a replacement for Facebook Events for small social gatherings. I've used it for a number of parties and received great feedback, and I'm seeing others are starting to use it too 🎉</p>
<p>To receive confirmations of attendance you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the included Matrix bot to automatically sync RSVP emoji reactions in a linked Matrix room (great
for your friends on Matrix or in a bridged Signal chat)</li>
<li>Send a unique one-click RSVP links to you friends without Matrix (eg. Instagram DMs, SMS)</li>
<li>And as of this week, guests can &quot;self serve&quot; and add their own RSVP via the unique event link, so you can just drop the event link in a Facebook Messenger chat or iMessage group
(without email or phone verification at the moment, so hosts will need to moderate if
their guests go rogue and add multiple fake names!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other recent improvements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to delete guests</li>
<li>Improved call to action and copy text for when a guest with a &quot;magic&quot; link is prompted to RSVP</li>
<li>Confetti animations when your guests RSVP via the Gatho website as &quot;Going&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm currently testing an experimental chat embed using Matrix Live so your guests not on Matrix can optionally see your linked Matrix room - I've found some of my friends join Matrix after seeing this so they can join the action!</p>
<p>I'm keen to eventually use Cactus Comments once I figure out a bit of Elm and have more spare time so that non-Matrix guests can post too.</p>
<p>The Gatho website and bot is <a href="https://github.com/gatho-party/gatho-website">open source (AGPL-3.0) on Github</a>, PRs and Github issues are very welcome! It's built using Next.js in Typescript.</p>

<p>hello! wanted to show a small matrix web client made with unminified js/html/css &amp; web components (wip++)

https://gitlab.com/sctlib/libli + https://gitlab.com/sctlib/matrix-room-element
looking forward feedback comments or anything,
cheers &amp; viva la matrix!</p>
<p>for now it only uses default matrix messages, and it is read only, so users have to login/register/CRUD through element (or any other client)
the idea would be to give back users control on their data, allow them to &quot;collect&quot; (individually or as group), any type of content, gathered into matrix room</p>
<p>For now, the client is making HTTP requests to matrix API, to fetch the data of a (public) room, all message &amp; state events.
it also give a &quot;clean URL&quot; <code>libli.org/room:server.tld</code> so users can access their &quot;profile&quot; (chat room) easily (just like a twitter, instagram, medium) page</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.54.0">Synapse 1.54</a> is
out! Let's see what goodness is coming your way with this new release.</p>
<h2 id="improving-url-previews">Improving URL previews</h2>
<p>As part of the Matrix specification, Matrix clients have the option to rely on
the homeserver to generate URL previews. This means the homeserver (in this case
Synapse) needs to have a look at the content at that URL and extract data to
send back to the client.</p>
<p>In the past, Synapse has had issues with generating complete URL previews, and
some metadata (e.g. image, description) would be missing from the data that
Synapse sends to clients. Synapse 1.54 includes improvements to the generation
of URL previews, and while testing it we've been able to observe improvements to
previews generated for Twitter and Reddit.</p>
<h2 id="new-module-callbacks">New module callbacks</h2>
<p>Synapse modules allow third-party developers to write extra features for
Synapse, that wouldn't necessarily be generic enough to fit within the Matrix
specification. This includes custom behaviours such as smarter event filters,
bespoke media storage providers, or spam checkers. Since we rewrote Synapse's
module system in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/30/security-update-synapse-1-37-1-released#synapse-137-release-announcement">Synapse
1.37</a>,
we have been improving it by adding new callback functions that module can
implement, allowing them to interface better with Synapse.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.54 includes three new module callbacks. One of them,
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.54/modules/password_auth_provider_callbacks.html#get_displayname_for_registration"><code>get_displayname_for_registration</code></a>,
allows modules to define the display name for newly registered users. Together
with the existing
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.54/modules/password_auth_provider_callbacks.html#get_username_for_registration"><code>get_username_for_registration</code></a>
introduced in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/08/synapse-1-52-released/">Synapse
1.52</a>, they allow
modules a better control over the user registration process.</p>
<p>The two other module callbacks introduced in Synapse 1.54,
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.54/modules/third_party_rules_callbacks.html#on_profile_update"><code>on_profile_update</code></a>
and
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.54/modules/third_party_rules_callbacks.html#on_user_deactivation_status_changed"><code>on_user_deactivation_status_changed</code></a>,
allow modules to react to profile changes, as well as the deactivation (or
reactivation) of users.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse also includes more work to make joining large Matrix
rooms faster (I was telling you about that in the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/22/synapse-1-53-released">Synapse 1.53 release
announcement</a>). While
it's still very experimental and not yet ready for show time, it's still very
exciting to see this work happening!</p>
<p>Synapse 1.54 also includes a change to the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientversions">client-side versions
endpoint</a>
to advertise Matrix 1.1 and 1.2. See the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/02/matrix-v-1-2-release">Matrix
1.2</a> release
announcement to read all about the changes this latest version of the
specification brings to the ecosystem.</p>

changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://t2bot.io">t2bot.io</a> - a public integrations network for Matrix - has passed 1 Million known rooms and 8.3 Million bridged users. 10,000 of these rooms are attributed to Voyager (a bot which actively goes out to find rooms to map Matrix, with the map currently down for maintenance), leaving the remaining ones either bridged, previously bridged, or using a different integration offered by t2bot.io for free.</p>
<p>The 8.3 Million users are mainly Discord and Telegram users which have been brought over to Matrix through bridges. The stats say &quot;excluding Twitter-bridged&quot; because there's 424,832 old accounts from back in the day when t2bot.io had a free Twitter bridge available. To further break this down, about 6.8M are Telegram users (12% of Telegram) and 1.3M are Discord (&lt;1% of Discord). </p>
<p>For perspective, t2bot.io has about 569 Million events stored in its database and sees approximately 30 thousand people bridged daily from the wider world into Matrix through its bridges. </p>
<p>This post is just a milestone update, but it also serves as a reminder that running your own server/bridges is also possible. In fact, it's even recommended to have better control over your own data and avoid latency issues that large providers, like t2bot.io, can unintentionally introduce. Synapse is relatively easy to set up with minimal sysadmin knowledge (<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/setup/installation.html">guide</a>), and there's always paid offerings like <a href="https://element.io/matrix-services">Element Matrix Services</a> (<a href="https://element.io/element-home">for home</a> and also <a href="https://element.io/element-one">for fun</a>) and <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> for a richer bridging experience than t2bot.io can feasibly provide.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that eQualitie has set-up public Matrix and Element instances for Ukrainian people who are struggling right now. If you are in Ukraine or are in touch with Ukrainian people who need secure communications, you can show them https://kyiv.dcomm.net.ua, https://odessa.dcomm.net.ua, or https://kharkiv.dcomm.net.ua depending on their location so they get instructions on how to create an account on Matrix and stay in touch</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MSC3575 Sliding Sync work is progressing, and a number of new features have been added to the MSC with implementations in the built-in web client in the proxy. A list of changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>spec/proxy: the ability to filter the room list by room name.</li>
<li>spec/proxy: An<code>initial</code> flag on the room to distinguish between updates and the initial sync for a given room. This can be used as a hint to clients to determine if they should update/replace their local data for that room.</li>
<li>proxy: more efficient algorithm for determining overlapping sets of ranges, resulting in fewer bytes over the wire when scrolling.</li>
<li>proxy: the client implementation now supports sending basic text messages as well as issuing<code>/join</code>,<code>/invite</code>,<code>/leave</code> commands.</li>
<li>proxy: the client implementation now has a developer HUD which tracks the Tx/Rx bytes as well as a visual representation of the sliding window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/blog/img/ZCFijelEVxqrDDOrzyvZcpBG.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The net result is a basic but incredibly low bandwidth syncing client: 60.79KB to download an entire initial sync on matrix.org. Further improvements will be done on the client to make sure it doesn't scale with the number of rooms on the user's account (it currently does because it naively adds a placeholder for each room in the list) to ensure it remains extremely snappy and a vision for what Sliding Sync can do in practice, right now. Please continue giving feedback on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575">MSC3575</a> or in <code>#sliding-sync:matrix.org</code> as the API is still in development and will change depending on what clients require.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Heads up! You may have noticed some changes to the matrix-org/matrix-doc github repository this week. The first major one being that it no longer exists!</p>
<p>We have separated it out into two repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec">matrix-org/matrix-spec</a> - the source text of the spec. Issues and pull requests filed here should relate to the source of the spec.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals">matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals</a> - all Matrix Spec Change proposals. New MSCs should be filed against this repository as pull requests. Issues should not be filed against this repository (and no, the issue tracker cannot be disabled, as it would cause transferred issue link redirects to 404).</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary motivation for this was to separate concerns of interacting with matrix-org/matrix-doc. Those interacting with the spec's source would have to wade through long-lived spec proposals, while those only interested in spec proposals would need to filter out spec source files and other issues and PRs related to them. This also helps writing tooling against the repo either as it no longer needs to filter MSCs via issue labels.</p>
<p>Existing links to matrix-doc should be automatically redirected by github to the right place. MSC authors and developers should update their git remote settings to point to the new repos.</p>
<p>What happened in detail to achieve this was:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>matrix-doc</code> was renamed to<code>matrix-spec-proposals</code></li>
<li><code>matrix-spec</code> was created</li>
<li>All files other than the &quot;proposals&quot; folder were transferred from<code>matrix-spec-proposals</code> to<code>matrix-spec</code></li>
<li>All open issues from<code>matrix-spec-proposals</code> were transferred to<code>matrix-spec</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Further details are available here: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues/927</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3383">MSC3383: Include destination in X-Matrix Auth Header</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC asks for the simple change of adding a &quot;destination&quot; field to the <code>Authorization</code> header of federation requests. This would have the benefit of allowing reverse proxies - potentially handling traffic for multiple homeservers - to know where requests should be sent. Or for forward proxies, which could validate outgoing requests from a homeserver before they're sent.</p>
<p>There is currently some discussion on the fundamental idea of the MSCs, which will need to be resolved first before it can move forwards.</p>

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Quite a varied bag this week! Firstly we cut a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.54.0rc1">release candidate</a> for Synapse 1.54.0, which we hope to release next week. As ever, testing and feedback is much appreciated.</p>
<p>Our switch to <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> for dependency management has come a few steps closer, by removing <a href="https://tox.wiki">tox</a> from our Continuous Integration, and converting some of our ad-hoc scripts to proper Python <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/">entry points</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we've been continuing to knock out blockers to improving room join speeds, including better exception handling and logging, and some exciting work to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3528">reduce wasted work</a> when a client disconnects while we're still processing a request.</p>
<p>We've also been taking a wider look at performance problems, such as slow <code>/sync</code> and <code>/login</code> times.</p>

<h3 id="dendrite-website">Dendrite (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">Kegan</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been asked by numerous people over months if there are any kind of graphs comparing Synapse and Dendrite. Up until now, my answer has been &quot;as far as I know, no&quot;. However, this got me thinking whether I can use <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a> to engineer some kind of performance testing infrastructure. After hacking on it for a day or two, I can now share some of the work I've done in this area. There now exists two new binaries in the Complement repo: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/tree/main/cmd/perftest">perftest</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/tree/main/cmd/perfgraph">perfgraph</a>. The former will run some tests and output a <code>.json</code> file. The latter will consume these files to generate <code>.svg</code> graphs. The tests performed include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a bunch of rooms with different users. (currently 10 users and 50 rooms)</li>
<li>Joining a bunch of rooms with different users.</li>
<li>Sending messages into rooms with different users. (currently 100 messages)</li>
<li>Doing an initial sync for all users.</li>
<li>Updating the display name of all users.</li>
<li>Doing an incremental sync for all users.</li>
</ul>
<p>The metrics are collected using <code>docker stats</code>. This means the <em>entire container</em> is measured, not just the homeserver binary (e.g any daemons or assistive processes are included in the metrics) and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU time consumed</li>
<li>Memory consumed</li>
<li>Bytes transmitted/received</li>
<li>Disk read/writes</li>
<li>Time taken</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some results:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/XqFhgSQyQMNuElZctQWoqdmx.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This was a surprising find and probably indicates that Dendrite has a memory leak somewhere when creating events. However, the fun doesn't stop there. We can also use this tool to compare different versions of the same homeserver:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/KcWIYkkVAcoHDSmWFmdEdvVF.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This allows us to quantify any performance improvements we've been working on, and you can clearly see how we're being more efficient with CPU in newer versions. But the fun doesn't stop there either. We can also compare different flavours of the same version of a homeserver:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/WwUSbKWYkIUPEOELmeJiPlYO.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>You can quantify the cost of running sqlite or postgres for your particular installation. </p>
<p>Care must be taken when interpreting results. Lower doesn't always mean better. For example, a low readout on &quot;create_users&quot; may be a cause for concern as it might indicate that the server is not hashing passwords correctly (e.g using bcrypt/scrypt which are designed to consume CPU/memory). Servers which don't implement all of the specification will also be abnormally low on CPU/memory (e.g not having to calculate unread counts or handle push notifications naturally means less work to do so less resources consumed). Furthermore, these tests do not yet test federation, so expensive remote joins are not measured (remote joins require the joining server to check signatures, hashes, etc of a lot of events which doesn't happen for local servers). That being said, I have hopefully illustrated how useful this tool can be for both server developers trying to improve their software and server admins who want to use the right server for their hardware. The graphs are still a work-in-progress and there's a lot more that can be done in this area beyond a few days work, but it's a start.</p>

<p>Today we've released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6.5">Dendrite 0.6.5</a> which contains early push notification support as well as a number of fixes and improvements. This release includes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early support for push notifications has been added, with support for push rules, pushers, HTTP push gateways and the <code>/notifications</code> endpoint (contributions by <a href="https://github.com/danpe">danpe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PiotrKozimor">PiotrKozimor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tommie">tommie</a>)</li>
<li>Spaces Summary (MSC2946) is now correctly supported (when <code>msc2946</code> is enabled in the config)</li>
<li>All media API endpoints are now available under the <code>/v3</code> namespace</li>
<li>Profile updates (display name and avatar) are now sent asynchronously so they shouldn't block the client for a very long time</li>
<li>State resolution v2 has been optimised further to considerably reduce the number of memory allocations</li>
<li>State resolution v2 will no longer duplicate events unnecessarily when calculating the auth difference</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool now has a <code>-reset-password</code> option for resetting the passwords of existing accounts</li>
<li>The <code>/sync</code> endpoint now calculates device list changes much more quickly with less RAM used</li>
<li>The <code>/messages</code> endpoint now lazy-loads members correctly</li>
<li>Read receipts now work correctly by correcting bugs in the stream positions and receipt coalescing</li>
<li>Topological sorting of state and join responses has been corrected, which should help to reduce the number of auth problems when joining new federated rooms</li>
<li>Media thumbnails should now work properly after having unnecessarily strict rate limiting removed</li>
<li>The roomserver no longer holds transactions for as long when processing input events</li>
<li>Uploading device keys and cross-signing keys will now correctly no-op if there were no changes</li>
<li>Parameters are now remembered correctly during registration</li>
<li>Devices can now only be deleted within the appropriate UIA flow</li>
<li>The <code>/context</code> endpoint now returns 404 instead of 500 if the event was not found</li>
<li>SQLite mode will no longer leak memory as a result of not closing prepared statements</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance, as measured by Sytest, currently sits at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 76%, up from 65% last time</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 95%, up from 94% last time</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, you can join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for Dendrite discussion and announcements.</p>

<li>Figma now uses MSC3440 for comment threads.</li>
</ul>
<p>But seriously go check out the release, there is way more there than I can include in this TWIM post. Happy webhookin, matrix gang!</p>
<p>In case you did not know, Hookshot can be installed via spantaleev's <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">Ansible playbook</a>. In addition to updates for this new release, the role has recently gotten some improvements and fixes by the community, so in case you had issues before, now is the time to try again!</p>
<p>P.S oh and I almost forgot, we rehomed to https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot. This doesn't change much, other than some redirects in your browsers cache.</p>

<p>Two bridge updates from matrix.org in one week? You would be forgiven for thinking it was <del>FOSDEM</del> Christmas.</p>
<p>The highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support splitting users from different homeservers into different IPv6 blocks. We used this at FOSDEM to split attendeeds into a different ILINE.</li>
<li>Added a new metric <code>clientpool_by_homeserver</code> which lists the states of IRC clients, by the top 25 homeservers. Useful to know who is using your bridge.</li>
<li>Add support for subscribing to moderation policies. This allows a bridge admin to subscribe to Matrix &quot;ban lists&quot; and filter who can use their bridge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This release also now requires Node 14.x</strong> as Node 12.x will be out of support very soon.</p>

<p>a very simple invite-accepting bot as part of <a href="https://git.pixie.town/f0x/matrix-streamchat">matrix-streamchat</a> to more easily facilitate peeking into rooms over federation.
You run one on your guest-access enabled homeserver, invite it to your remote room, and now all guest accounts from your server know they are in fact allowed to publicly read the room over federation without joining themselves. https://git.pixie.town/f0x/matrix-streamchat/src/branch/main/autojoin-bot</p>

<li>Ability to kick people was added</li>
<li>Inter font was added to improve readability</li>
<li>Work on having a setup page for the bot was added which allows to easily add the bot to your room (sets up permissions and invites the bot as required)</li>
<li>Added support for a state event which tells the widget about &quot;who is the bot?&quot; and &quot;which lists does this bot monitor?&quot; Which also allows you to use the widget without being in the banlist room yourself.

<p>Element Call has entered beta!  Head over to https://call.element.io (formerly matrixvoip.dev) to play with in-browser native Matrix voice/video calling powered by MSC3401, supporting all webrtc-capable mobile &amp; desktop browsers.  See all the details over at https://element.io/blog/introducing-native-matrix-voip-with-element-call/</p>
<ul>
<li>Offers high quality video calls with around 6 or 7 participants as a small &amp; simple, standalone app that allows anyone to drop into a video conference easily.</li>
<li>This is beta - please file bugs at https://github.com/vector-im/element-call/issues and be aware that currently all participants need good bandwidth</li>
<li>This is the first implementation of MSC3401: a spec for secure, federated voice and video conferences.</li>
<li>Integrations into other clients are coming soon, Hydrogen is working on it right now</li>
<li>We’ll also be developing a server to mix media streams so calls can scale up to much larger number of participants. The server will only ever see your encrypted media, so calls will stay secure and confidential.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org">Jonas Platte</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're back (to TWIM)! Here's some highlights from the past few months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stronger types for some things:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/773"><code>Base64</code></a> which ensures you always decode / encode with the appropriate base64 dictionary [<a href="https://github.com/jplatte">@jplatte</a>]</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/809"><code>TransactionId</code></a> which is simply a little more explicit than <code>String</code> and easier to generate a random instance of [<a href="https://github.com/jplatte">@jplatte</a>]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stable support for lots of previously-unstable functionality that got stabilized upstream as part of the Matrix specification releases v1.1 and v1.2 [<a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a>]</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/issues/842">Support for versioned endpoints</a> in the client-server API [<a href="https://github.com/ShadowJonathan">@ShadowJonathan</a>]</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/906">Rehaul of our module structure</a> to match the client-server API's new versioned endpoints (before: <code>r0::foo::get_bar</code>, after: <code>foo::get_bar::v3</code>) [<a href="https://github.com/ShadowJonathan">@ShadowJonathan</a>]</li>
<li>More fine-grained feature flags for MSC implementations (before: everything behind <code>unstable-pre-spec</code>, after: most things behind dedicated <code>unstable-mscXXXX</code> features) [<a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a>]</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/916"><code>matrix.to</code> URI parsing</a> [<a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a>]</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/926"><code>MatrixUri</code> type</a> [<a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these changes are available in version 0.5.0 which was released about two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a> recently started implementing extensible events <em>and</em> doing some pretty heavy internal refactoring that will make our release process faster and hopefully make contributing to Ruma easier as well.</p>
<p>With all these changes we're very close to supporting all of Matrix v1.1 (and Matrix v1.2 too!), with the only major omission being Secure Secret Storage and Sharing (SSSS). Some work on that was done as far back as last year's GSoC but it was blocked on a medium-sized refactoring of how we handle account data. I'm planning to get that over the finish line over the next weeks.</p>

<p>I'm working on a little hobby project, The Matrix Scribe.</p>
<p><a href="https://lab.trax.im/julianfoad/matrix-scribe">The Matrix Scribe</a> helps us re-post or transcribe messages into <a href="https://matrix.org/">matrix</a> that we received from somewhere else, posing as different ghost users to represent the original authors.</p>
<p>Scribe will post this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Ann</code> I'm Ann.</p>
<p><code>Bob</code> Hello! I'm Bob.</p>

<p>when I write this to <code>@scribe-bot</code>:</p>

<p><code>@julian</code> I'm Ann.</p>
<p><code>@julian</code> /scribe as Bob</p>

<li>I want to encourage people to experiment and play with extending Matrix in creative ways.</li>
<li>As a building block for myself towards building more usual matrix bridges. Scribe is the input half of the matrix half of a bridge, so literally one quarter of a typical matrix bridge.</li>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> continues to be the focus on much review as the proposal inches towards entering final comment period.</p>
<p>Otherwise both <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3589">MSC3589</a> (room version 9 as the default room version) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3582">MSC3582</a> (remove m.room.message.feedback) merged this week.

<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3593">MSC3593: Safety Controls through a generic Administration API</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC aims to introduce a set of generic administrative APIs for Matrix homeservers, starting with those that could potentially be useful for user moderation.</p>
<p>There has long been talk of adding administration APIs akin to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">Synapse's Admin API</a> to the spec, in part to reduce the number of tools that are specifically created for it, and thus can only be used with Synapse.</p>

<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">neilalexander</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6.4">Dendrite v0.6.4</a> which contains a significant number of improvements and fixes. It includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Client-Server API endpoints are now available under the <code>/v3</code> namespace</li>
<li>The <code>/whoami</code> response format now matches the latest Matrix spec version</li>
<li>Support added for the <code>/context</code> endpoint, which should help clients to render quote-replies correctly</li>
<li>Accounts now have an optional account type field, allowing admin accounts to be created</li>
<li>Server notices are now supported</li>
<li>Refactored the user API storage to deduplicate a significant amount of code, as well as merging both user API databases into a single database</li>
<li>Guest registration can now be separately disabled with the new <code>client_api.guests_disabled</code> configuration option</li>
<li>Outbound connections now obey proxy settings from the environment, deprecating the <code>federation_api.proxy_outbound</code> configuration options</li>
<li>The roomserver input API will now strictly consume only one database transaction per room, which should prevent situations where the roomserver can deadlock waiting for database connections to become available</li>
<li>Room joins will now fall back to federation if the local room state is insufficient to create a membership event</li>
<li>Create events are now correctly filtered from federation <code>/send</code> transactions</li>
<li>Excessive logging when federation is disabled should now be fixed</li>
<li>Dendrite will no longer panic if trying to retire an invite event that has not been seen yet</li>
<li>The device list updater will now wait for longer after a connection issue, rather than flooding the logs with errors</li>
<li>The device list updater will no longer produce unnecessary output events for federated key updates with no changes, which should help to reduce CPU usage</li>
<li>Local device name changes will now generate key change events correctly</li>
<li>The sync API will now try to share device list update notifications even if all state key NIDs cannot be fetched</li>
<li>An off-by-one error in the sync stream token handling which could result in a crash has been fixed</li>
<li>State events will no longer be re-sent unnecessary by the roomserver to other components if they have already been sent, which should help to reduce the NATS message sizes on the roomserver output topic in some cases</li>
<li>The roomserver input API now uses the process context and should handle graceful shutdowns better</li>
<li>Guest registration is now correctly disabled when the <code>client_api.registration_disabled</code> configuration option is set</li>
<li>One-time encryption keys are now cleaned up correctly when a device is logged out or removed</li>
<li>Invalid state snapshots in the state storage refactoring migration are now reset rather than causing a panic at startup</li>
</ul>
<p>Sytest compliance is up slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 67%, up from 65%</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 95%, same as before</li>
</ul>

<p>The bridge doesn't do much yet; all it can do is log in &amp; sync your list of chats (if that). But it's under rapid development &amp; decent momentum, so hopefully it will be usable soon!</p>
<p>For anyone brave enough to try it out, its setup steps are very similar to that of any of the <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/setup/index.html">Python-based mautrix bridges</a> (though Docker is currently unsupported).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We made a small release that just is compiled against the new mtxclient version to fix an issue with servers announcing support for Matrix v1.1 or higher. We strongly recommend you update before the next Synapse stable release is out.</p>
<p>Apart from that Nheko now has support for hidden read receipts (thanks to symphorien, see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2285">MSC2285</a>). ZenWalker updated our usage of deprecated gstreamer APIs. Malte has been spending a lot of effort on improving the scrolling experience on the PinePhone as well as allowing to search on mobile. Forwarding should now work properly again as well as calling on mobile and we fixed a small memory leak when opening some dialogs.</p>

<p>“Twosday” wasn’t the only exciting thing happening this week. Take a peek at everything else we had going on…</p>
<p><strong>Coming to a Poll near you…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From next week’s releases, you’ll discover two new updates on polls! First off, you’ll be able to edit a poll as long as no one has yet voted on it - which is great if you create a poll and realise you’ve made a small mistake. Even better, there’s now a new type of poll: ‘closed polls’ don’t show any results until the poll has ended, to keep the surprise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Location Sharing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Location Sharing is now available by default for users on all platforms, except desktop (where you can receive but not send locations). Check it out!</li>
<li>The next stage is live location sharing and ‘pin dropping’, expect more soon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threaded Messaging</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to make catching up on rooms easier, and to keep the main timeline as clutter free as possible, Threads are nearly here.</li>
<li>You can try Threads out on all platforms - you’ll find them in Labs. This feature is experimental; let us know your feedback, and report any bugs as we continue to improve.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community testing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will be looking at search result ordering on Web as part of the new search experience at 17:30 UTC / 18:30 CET on Tuesday, 1st of March</li>
<li>We’re also hoping to test Threads on mobile devices towards the end of the week, join the testing room to get involved!</li>
<li>Head over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#element-community-testing:matrix.org">#element-community-testing:matrix.org</a> to hear the latest on all testing sessions!</li>

<li>On the process improvement side, we are looking at test coverage and process improvements around PR submission. Don’t be surprised if our developers start a conversation around tests when you submit your next PR 🙂</li>
<li>V1.10.5 release candidate is available and release is expected to go out on Monday, 28th February.</li>
<li>And don’t forget; the new and improved search experience is available. It’s in Beta so turn it on, try it out, and send us your feedback!

<h2 id="populus-viewer">Populus-Viewer</h2>
<p>Over at <a href="https://github.com/opentower/populus-viewer">Populus-Viewer</a>, we're continuing to refine the UX, for maximum focus, efficiency and enjoyment. Since last time we've:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reworked the mobile view controls into a sidebar design.</li>
<li>Improved the generation of highlight rectangles.</li>
<li>Made sure that LaTeX and code listings are always displayed nicely</li>
<li>Made it possible to modify text selections within a PDF using the keyboard</li>
<li>Added &quot;one-click&quot; links for onboarding new users into a particular server, SSO flow and PDF collection.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've also had some bug fixes related to federation, and had some of our first ever (maybe the first on matrix - first in the history of the universe?) federated social annotation sessions.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3574">MSC3574 - marking up resources</a> got some love this week, as we added a proposal for serializing annotations on matrix that ought to be compatible with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">w3c web annotation data model</a>. This paves the way for interoperability between the matrix annotation ecosystem and services like hypothes.is, and hopefully will make matrix a compelling option even for institutions where compliance with existing web standards is a must.</p>

<p>A widget for moderating with mjolnir. Highly WIP. Use at your own risk!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev">MTRNord (they/them)</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the last 2 weeks, I increasingly had to learn how to moderate rooms properly, which brought up a lack of nice Mjölnir gui for me.
Due to that, I just started to write one.
It is at the time of writing still fairly young.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-features-are">The current features are:</h2>
<ul>
<li>An overview of the ban list data the user is in (Not for the specific Mjölnir currently. Also requires a user to have joined the list room)</li>
<li>A quick form to ban a person</li>
<li>A form to redact someone or a message</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="planned-features-are">Planned features are:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support for showing MSC1929 information if available</li>
<li>Writing a patch for Mjölnir, so the widget can know which banlist the bot watches, so only relevant lists show up.</li>
<li>Editing the banlist (aka unbanning)</li>
<li>Adding support for more advanced features like deactivation of users and removal of media on the matrix-media-repo.</li>
<li>Covering most of Mjölnir's commands</li>
<li>Redact on ban and similar utilities you might want while banning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="small-getting-started-it-is-simple-d">Small getting started (it is simple :D)</h2>
<p>To use it, you simply can add it to your Mjölnir Admin room by putting <code>/addwidget https://moderation_widget.nordgedanken.dev?room_id=$matrix_room_id</code> (the variable will get replaced automatically) in the message bar and pressing enter. The widget runs entirely client side, so this is not sending any events to my server. If you still are concerned due to the big amount of permissions asked, you can just build it yourself and host it.</p>

<p>You know what would be embarrassing? If changing the version number of something broke Nheko... Well, completely unrelated, mtxclient 0.6.2 is out now which fixes an issue where it would aggressively validate that version numbers started with an 'r'. Otherwise that release is API and ABI compatible, so if packagers could pick that up as a bugfix release into stable releases, that would be great!</p>

<h2 id="stabilisation-of-registration-tokens">Stabilisation of registration tokens</h2>
<p>Registration tokens is a feature introduced in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.42.0">Synapse 1.42.0</a>, which allows homeserver administrators to force their users to use specific tokens when registering. This is similar to Synapse's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/6f440fd859c411af8c32478b4353f7550619c3bd/docs/sample_config.yaml#L1291-L1294">registration shared secret</a> support, but with added features, such as the possibility to limit how users can be registered with the same token, or to make a token expire. See <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.53/usage/administration/admin_api/registration_tokens.html">the admin API documentation</a> for more information on how to manage registration tokens on your homeserver.</p>
<p>Registration tokens were initially proposed to the Matrix specification in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">MSC3231</a> by <a href="https://github.com/govynnus">Callum Brown</a> during their Google Summer of Code internship last summer. The MSC has since been accepted, and released in the stable Matrix specification as of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/02/matrix-v-1-2-release">Matrix v1.2</a>. As a result, its Synapse implementation has been updated to remove support for unstable identifiers. Administrators of homeservers on which the reverse proxy rules explicitly allow the unstable route for this feature need to update their configuration. Same goes for developers of Matrix clients that support this feature. See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.53/upgrade#stablisation-of-msc3231">upgrade notes</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="time-based-cache-expiry-now-enabled-by-default">Time-based cache expiry now enabled by default</h2>
<p>To avoid being overly intensive on resources by making too many queries to the database, Synapse maintains several in-memory caches to store data it needs to use frequently. However, this comes with the inconvenience that, if Synapse needs to store too much data, these caches can become fairly big and occupy too much space in the host's memory.</p>
<p>Historically, Synapse has dealt with this issue by having set sizes for each cache, either hardcoded or set in the configuration, and evicting the oldest items when exceeding this size. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.38.0">Synapse 1.38</a> introduced the possibility for homeserver administrators to configure Synapse to evict cache entries based on the time they were last accessed on. This mechanism acts on top of the aforementioned eviction policy, and allows automatically evicting entries that haven't been accessed for some time, leaving more room in the caches to store data that needs to be accessed more often.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.53 enables this behaviour by default. Without specific configuration, Synapse will automatically evict cache entries that haven't been accessed for more than 30 minutes. Server administrators that were already using this feature might need to update their configuration, as this change deprecates the <code>expiry_time</code> configuration setting, which will be removed in a future version of Synapse. See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.53/upgrade#time-based-cache-expiry-is-now-enabled-by-default">upgrade notes</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You might have heard that we're working on improving the time it takes to join big Matrix rooms with Synapse. If not, then you definitely want to have a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/yxV73TQAodE?t=1095">the demos Matrix live</a> that was published earlier this month and includes more details and a demo of the work we've been doing in this area.</p>
<p>This release of Synapse includes an implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3706">MSC3706</a>, which is part of this work. It's still very experimental and definitely not production-ready, but it's a huge stepping stone towards making room joins snappier than ever.</p>
<p>We've also been continuing our work towards enabling end-to-end encryption for application services (see the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/01/18/synapse-1-50-released">Synapse 1.50 release blogpost</a> for more context on that). Synapse 1.53 includes support for sending to-device messages to application services. This is also still very experimental, watch this space for future updates.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.53.0">full changelog</a> for a complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.53/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1530">upgrade notes</a> for this version.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular order) <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bradjones1">Brad Jones</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/a-mnich">Alexander Mnich</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we've been looking at unblocking <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440: Threads</a> so it can make a smooth journey into acceptance. This involves quite a lot of work to ensure that the features we're concerned about are addressed, but so far the FCP progress on it is looking good.</p>
<p>We're also spending a bunch of time working out what room version 10 looks like to try and fix some usability issues with join rules and general maintenance of things like power levels. The hope is that in time for Matrix 1.3 we'll have v10 out (but not made default) for folks to experiment with.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>Your random MSC is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2974">MSC2974: Widgets: Capabilities re-exchange</a>. I swear it was actually random and only after running the script exactly once. The MSC is interesting because it allows widgets (a feature working its way into the general spec, slowly) to ask for more permissions when they need them. This ensures the widget doesn't need to ask for everything at startup (which is more likely to mean that it gets rejected), and that it can maintain a clean security state during normal operation.</p>
<p>One day it'll probably make it into the spec as part of the larger widget movement, but first we need to get widgets into the spec properly.</p>

<p>Numbers only mean so much, and graphs show progress. Here's the breakdown of MSCs over time:</p>

Please report any breakage or feedback in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a></p>
<p>Apart from this we have been continuing our experimentations with <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> to better manage our dependencies in our Python projects after we switched Sydent to it last week. We're already starting to see improvements off the back of this work, such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/495">automated security PRs</a> and an opportunity to centralise our automated workflows to better reuse them in our projects (see https://github.com/matrix-org/backend-meta). We look forward to bringing all this goodness to Synapse soon!</p>
<p>See you next week! 😀</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is using Nheko a bit of a pain on your PinePhone? Do you just want bubbles in your chat app, not raw lines of text? Does Nheko waste too much space on timestamps and other metadata for messages?</p>
<p>Well, I am assuming Malte was annoyed by that or similar reasons. But in the end, they did spend a lot of effort reorganizing the way Nheko layouts messages so that people can have bubbles. This should make Nheko feel much more at home on the PinePhone and it seems like they are doing even more to make Nheko a great experience on mobile devices! But just look at it yourself:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/clBmUlpDyQUmvIfIKSRCJsIb.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you are scared now and you think: &quot;This is not the Nheko I came to love!&quot;, don't worry, all of this is optional. You can play around with the different avatar sizes as well as the bubbles themselves. You can even make Nheko look like it always looked!</p>
<p>There will be some regressions though. If you want to contribute, it would help a lot if you test those changes and report issues that you find! &lt;3</p>
<p>Apart from that, there were also a lot of other bugfixes and cleanups by various contributors. You can also hide events by type now. If you don't want to see stickers or when someone joins a room, just disable that in the room settings! Tastytea implemented that. Long usernames should now also no longer overflow the profile pages and you can reset the state for a single room using the /reset-state /command. This is helpful when updating Nheko to use widgets, but Nheko just threw those events away (or pinned messages or other state events).</p>
<p>That's all, have a wonderful bubbly day!</p>

<p>I wrote a small web app thing that can download, decrypt and display Matrix media in a browser. The goal is to use it in the Android SMS bridge for sending attachments that are too big for MMS, but it might be useful for other things too.</p>
<p>Currently it consists of the web frontend, a maubot plugin to generate links, and a small server that stores file metadata (so the URLs just contain the decryption key and a short ID to find the metadata on the server). I'll probably continue working on the exact URL format to make it shorter and to encrypt the metadata, and maybe also add an alternative mode where all info is included in the URL to make the server component optional.</p>
<p>You can try it out by sending files in an encrypted room with @media:maunium.net. It'll reply with a link like <a href="https://media.mau.chat/AGIPyjtJQAU#KHBwuZFrv1ffCd4ZUylo8MV03P9N4sz2T75zLi1Urcw">https://media.mau.chat/AGIPyjtJQAU#KHBwuZFrv1ffCd4ZUylo8MV03P9N4sz2T75zLi1Urcw</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>After a few years, <a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-room-directory-server">matrix-room-directory-server</a> has finally gotten an upgrade to modern times. Intended to eventually be a standalone directory server (making vanity aliases possible, but otherwise not functional as a homeserver), it currently only supports overriding the federation <code>/publicRooms</code> endpoint. </p>
<p>The changes made today are to replace the old, broken, appservice-backed approach with a space-backed approach. You can see this in action on t2bot.io: querying the room directory over federation will hit the room directory server, which is watching <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#directory:t2bot.io">#directory:t2bot.io</a> in the background to determine which rooms to serve.</p>

<p>Hay y'all. I created a blog post about how to host element and matrix .well-known files using cloudflare pages that I thought might be worth sharing. Have a few kinks to work out regarding CORS (might need to clean my browsers cache) though.

</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> (threading) continues to move forward with a proposed final comment period this week. As a really useful feature in Matrix, it's great to see it getting closer to landing in the spec.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3613">MSC3613</a> (combinatorial join rules) had a proposed final comment period. The intention of this is to be a simple mechanism for resolving the &quot;it's not possible to have both a restricted and knock room&quot; situation - as both introduced mutually exclusive join rules. This MSC will likely serve as the basis of a new room version whenever it lands.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3144">MSC3144: Allow Widgets By Default in Private Rooms</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC makes the case for allowing widgets to be created in private rooms by default. The actual spec for it is blocked behind having widgets in the spec (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2764">this tracking PR</a> if you're interested).</p>
<p>As noted in the PR though, this MSC could build on the existing <code>im.vector.modular.widgets</code> unstable prefix for widgets in order to create an implementation for this feature. It does not appear to have happened yet though.</p>

<p>Hello, TWIM! This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/08/synapse-1-52-released">released Synapse 1.52</a>, which includes new Admin APIs for monitoring federation status and immediately retrying failed connections, as well as for reporting on rooms shared between two homeservers. We've also fixed / improved media previews for sites <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11767">like Reddit</a>. Plus lots more fixes / refactors / improvements under the hood.</p>
<p>This is a smaller release as it's coming off of our FOSDEM sprint, but we look forward to getting back to more regularly-sized and featureful Synapses this month.</p>
<p>Notably, we've been experimenting with <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> to better manage Python dependencies in our applications (Synapse, Sygnal, and Sydent). We just <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/488">switched Sydent over</a> this week and are working out the kinks in our CI and build pipelines.

<p>Yesterday we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6.3">Dendrite 0.6.3</a> which is a primarily bug fix release. It contains the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial support for <code>m.login.token</code></li>
<li>A number of regressions from earlier v0.6.x versions should now be corrected</li>
<li>Missing state is now correctly retrieved in cases where a gap in the timeline was closed but some of those events were missing state snapshots, which should help to unstick slow or broken rooms</li>
<li>Fixed a transaction issue where inserting events into the database could deadlock, which should stop rooms from getting stuck</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where rejected events could result in rolled back database transactions</li>
<li>Avoided a potential race condition on fetching latest events by using the room updater instead</li>
<li>Processing events from <code>/get_missing_events</code> will no longer result in potential recursion</li>
<li>Federation events are now correctly generated for updated self-signing keys and signed devices</li>
<li>Rejected events can now be un-rejected if they are reprocessed and all of the correct conditions are met</li>
<li>Fetching missing auth events will no longer error as long as all needed events for auth were satisfied</li>
<li>Users can now correctly forget rooms if they were not a member of the room</li>

<p>Thanks to everyone who tested the maximised widgets feature which was recently added to Element Web. It received a sudden burst of attention as part of the FOSDEM conference. 😄 This week we've been fine tuning the feature to ensure it works for more workflows, and we've also cleaned up various associated widget bugs. In particular, in the develop version of Element Web, the pin and maximise actions are more consistent accessible, so you can toggle between pinned and maximised if e.g. you're in a conference room and temporarily want the stream widget to be larger while still having access to the chat timeline.</p>

<p>Matrix Wrench is a web client to tweak Matrix rooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@christianp:vector.modular.im">ChristianP</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new version contains two new features around the Synapse Admin API, making someone a room admin and listing all unencrypted media URLs.</p>
<p>I've had some good ideas on how to make Matrix Wrench cover more use cases while staying simple for both users and me as a developer. New components allow me to add new API endpoints in as little as 7 lines. So far this only applies to simple endpoints without parameters, like joining and leaving a room, but it can be expanded to more endpoints because of how similar all Matrix endpoints are. Props to the Spec! 🙌</p>
<p>Stay tuned for an editable UI coming soon™️.</p>

<p>Version 1.1.1 released
This was a quick bugfix release for a finding by jeffcasavant, in which joining a room with a predecessor, the bot could crash. Thanks Jeff!</p>
<p>If you missed it last week, I published a template / demo stock reporting bot you can find here: https://github.com/WesR/Halcyon-stock-bot . Short and sweet, this little bot should be a great starting point if your looking into making a bot. Make sure to also checkout the library itself for more examples, and usage information https://github.com/WesR/Halcyon.</p>
<p>I'm always looking for more feedback, and love to see what people are working on. Come hangout with us in the Halcyon room: https://matrix.to/#/#halcyon:blackline.xyz</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have been using Matrix as a chat solution for the attendees of our biannual conference (<a href="https://kif.rocks">KIF</a>) and for new students during the introduction week, as well as Pretix to register attendants. Up until now the process to invite attendees to the corresponding Matrix Rooms and Spaces involved some <code>curl</code> and <code>jq</code> magic as well as manual intervention to connect both.</p>
<p>We have now replaced said manual process with a Pretix plugin that invites registered attendees to a configurable Matrix Room or Space. This plugin is now available on the <a href="https://marketplace.pretix.eu/products/pretix-matrix-inviter/">Pretix marketplace</a> or directly from its <a href="https://gitlab.fachschaften.org/kif/pretix-matrix-inviter">repository</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm excited to share a side-project I've been working on for the last ~3 months: Gatho (http://gatho.party) - a web app for hosting small gatherings.</p>
<p>Gatho is perfect as a replacement for Facebook Events for small social gatherings. I'm a 24 year old Australian who recently deleted Facebook - I've used Gatho for a few parties now and the guests have loved it!</p>
<p>Gatho includes a Matrix bot which, when added to a room, can synchronise RSVP emoji reactions to a linked Gatho event! See <a href="https://gatho.party/getting-started">gatho.party/getting-started</a> to hear how the Matrix synchronization works.</p>
<p>You can also create one-click RSVP links to send to your friends - no matter which chat/social app they use!</p>
<p>It's fully GDPR compliant and multi-region with an EU server and database, and uses NextAuth.js for passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>The Gatho website and bot is open source (AGPL-3.0) on <a href="https://github.com/gatho-party/gatho-website">Github</a>, PRs and Github issues are very welcome! It's built using Next.js in Typescript.</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.52.0">Synapse 1.52</a> is out! Here's what's new with this week's release.</p>
<h2 id="twisted-security-release">Twisted security release</h2>
<p>The team behind <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a>, which is the main framework Synapse uses under the hood, recently released <a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/releases/tag/twisted-22.1.0">Twisted 22.1</a>. This version fixes a <a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/security/advisories/GHSA-92x2-jw7w-xvvx">security vulnerability</a> within the Twisted library.</p>
<p>While preparing the release of Synapse 1.52, we have investigated the impact of this vulnerability on Synapse. We came to the conclusion that it does not affect Synapse. We however advise server administrators to ensure they use an up-to-date version of the library as a matter of good practice.</p>
<p>For instances installed with <code>pip</code>, the library can be updated with <code>pip install --upgrade Twisted treq</code>. For instances installed with the <code>matrixdotorg/synapse</code> Docker image or Debian packages from <code>packages.matrix.org</code>, updating to Synapse 1.52.0 is sufficient, as these images and packages include up-to-date versions of all dependencies.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that a release candidate for <a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/releases/tag/twisted-22.2.0rc1">Twisted 22.2</a> has been published, with a fix for a potential denial of service vulnerability with SSH. Administrators of Synapse homeservers that have the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.52/manhole.html">manhole</a> feature enabled (which is the only feature of Synapse using SSH) are encouraged to ensure access to the manhole is correctly restricted (e.g. by preventing access from external locations).</p>
<h2 id="federation-admin-apis">Federation admin APIs</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse introduces a few admin APIs to help server administrators monitor and handle how their Synapse homeserver interacts with other federated homeservers. <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.52/usage/administration/admin_api/federation.html#destination-rooms">One of these APIs</a> offers server administrators a way to visualise which rooms are shared between the local homeserver and a given remote one.</p>
<p>Another API allows server administrators to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.52/usage/administration/admin_api/federation.html#reset-connection-timeout">reset federation timeouts</a>. If Synapse fails to connect to a remote homeserver, it will make note of the failure and will not retry the connection after a certain amount of time. This can happen if the remote homeserver goes offline or experiences connectivity issues. Synapse has a few ways of figuring out whether a remote homeserver has come back online, but this new admin API adds a way for administrators to manually tell Synapse a destination should be available.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release also improves Synapse's deactivation behaviour by deleting account data when deactivating a user. &quot;Account data&quot; refers to private arbitrary data that is specific to an account. It is used among other things for secure server-side storage (SSSS) which allows securely backing up end-to-end encryption keys.</p>
<p>Please see the Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.52.0/CHANGES.md">release notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular order) <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk Klimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/totallynotvaishnav">Vaishnav Nair</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sequentialread">SequentialRead Software</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Fizzadar">Nick Barrett from Beeper</a>.</p>
