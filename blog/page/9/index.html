            <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.59.0">Synapse 1.59</a> is
out! Let's see what's new in this version.</p>
<h2 id="generic-worker-types">Generic worker types</h2>
<p>When Synapse instances are subject to high load, it can be useful to use workers
to balance the load more effectively. Workers are separate processes that can
take some of the load off the main Synapse process, and allow the homeserver to
scale more effectively.</p>
<p>In the past, Synapse only provided a specific set of types of workers, each
capable of handling a specific set of operations. For some time now we have been
working on allowing more flexibility around worker configuration, which started
all the way back in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/03/23/synapse-1-12-0-released">Synapse
1.12.0</a> with the
introduction of a generic worker application type.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.59 furthers this work by deprecating the <code>synapse.app.appservice</code> and
<code>synapse.app.user_dir</code> worker application types. Homeserver administrators
should change the configuration of instances using these types to the generic
<code>synapse.app.generic_worker</code> application type, and use the
<code>notify_appservices_from_worker</code> and <code>update_user_directory_from_worker</code> to
delegate application service and user directory work (respectively) to a worker.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.59/upgrade.html#deprecation-of-the-synapseappappservice-and-synapseappuser_dir-worker-application-types">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information on this change.</p>
<h2 id="push-rules">Push rules</h2>
<p>Push rules allow Matrix clients to define notification rules on a homeserver.
One often reported issue with notification in Matrix is the fact that
notifications are sent out when server ACLs, which define which server(s) can
and cannot interact in a room, change. This is especially annoying during big
waves of abuse, as there might be multiple servers that need to be banned from
rooms, thus causing a lot of unneeded notifications.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.59 now supports silencing server ACL updates, by implementing the new
push rule documented in
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3786">MSC3786</a>.
However, since this MSC hasn't been incorporated into the spec yet, this
behaviour is disabled by default in Synapse: see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12601">the implementation pull
request</a> for more information
on turning it on.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.59 also allows third-party modules to validate and change the actions
associated with an existing push rule via the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/d24a1486e5c5d69a8798a9d159fd9e06dfc8c3e3/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L1360-L1420">Module
API</a>.
This is helpful for modules wishing to, for example, configuring specific
notification settings when new users register.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>As of Synapse 1.59, Synapse will not communicate the name of devices over
federation (unless configured otherwise), in order to better preserve user
privacy. See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.59/upgrade.html#device-name-lookup-over-federation-has-been-disabled-by-default">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>Also note that we have issued a patch release for 1.59 (1.59.1) which fixes a
long-standing bug that started to bite a good amount of server administrators.
Server admins that are looking into upgrading their instance to Synapse 1.59 are
recommended to upgrade to 1.59.1 rather than 1.59.0.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.59.0">full
changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.59/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1590">upgrade

        <div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>It’s been <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last">quite a while</a> since our last independent E2EE review, and so we’re incredibly proud to present an <a href="https://matrix.org/media/Least%20Authority%20-%20Matrix%20vodozemac%20Final%20Audit%20Report.pdf">entirely new independent security audit</a> of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac">vodozemac</a>, our next generation native Rust implementation of Matrix’s <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/blob/master/docs/olm.md">Olm</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/blob/master/docs/megolm.md">Megolm</a> E2EE protocols.  The audit has been conducted by <a href="https://leastauthority.com/">Least Authority</a>, who specialise in <a href="https://leastauthority.com/security-consulting/published-audits/">comprehensive audits</a> of security-sensitive decentralized technologies - and we are very grateful to <a href="https://www.gematik.de/anwendungen/ti-messenger">gematik</a>, who kindly shared the costs of funding the audit as part of their <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/21/germanys-national-healthcare-system-adopts-matrix">commitment to Matrix for healthcare in Germany</a>.</p>
<p>This audit was a bit of a whirlwind, as while we were clearly overdue an audit of Matrix’s E2EE implementations, we decided quite late in the day to focus on bringing vodozemac to auditable production quality rather than simply doing a refresh of the original <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last">libolm audit</a>.  However, we got there in time, thanks to a monumental sprint from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/graphs/contributors">Damir and Denis</a> over Christmas.  The reason we went this route is that vodozemac is an enormous step change forwards in quality over <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm">libolm</a>, and vodozemac is now the reference Matrix E2EE implementation going forward.  Just as libolm went live with NCC’s security review back in 2016, similarly we’re kicking off the first stable release of vodozemac today with Least Authority’s audit.  In fact, vodozemac just shipped as the default E2EE library in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0">matrix-rust-sdk 0.5</a>, released at the end of last week!</p>
<p>The main advantages of vodozemac over libolm include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native Rust - type, memory and thread safety is preserved both internally, and within the context of larger Rust programs (such as those building on matrix-rust-sdk).  This is particularly important given the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/14/adventures-in-fuzzing-libolm">memory bugs</a> which libolm sprouted, despite our best efforts to the contrary.</li>
<li>Performance - vodozemac benchmarks roughly 5-6x faster than libolm on typical hardware</li>
<li>Better primitives - vodozemac is built on the best practice cryptographic primitives from the Rust community, rather than the generic Brad Conte primitives used by libolm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, we’ve finally fixed one of the biggest problems with libolm - which was that the hardest bit of implementing E2EE in Matrix wasn’t necessarily the encryption protocol implementation itself, but how you glue it into your Matrix client’s SDK.  It turns out ~80% of the code and complexity needed to securely implement encryption ends up being in the SDK rather than the Olm implementation - and each client SDK ended up implementing its own independent state machine and glue for E2EE, leading to a needlessly large attack &amp; bug surface.</p>
<p>To address this problem, vodozemac is designed to plug into <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/tree/main/crates/matrix-sdk-crypto">matrix-sdk-crypto</a> - an SDK-independent Rust library which abstracts away the complexities and risks of implementing E2EE, designed to plug into existing SDKs in any language.  For instance, Element Android already <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/3209">supports</a> delegating its encryption to matrix-sdk-crypto; Element iOS got this working too last week, and we’re <a href="https://github.com/Hywan/matrix-rust-sdk/commits/feat-crypto-wasm">hard at work</a> adding it to Element Web too.  (This set of projects is codenamed Element R).  Meanwhile, <a href="https://youtu.be/chsyOWKvne4">Element X</a> (the project to switch Element iOS and Element Android to use matrix-rust-sdk entirely) obviously benefits from it too, as matrix-rust-sdk now leans on matrix-sdk-crypto for its encryption.</p>
<p>Therefore we highly recommend that developers using libolm migrate over to vodozemac - ideally by switching to matrix-sdk-crypto as a way of managing the interface between Matrix and the E2EE implementation.  Vodozemac does also provides a similar API to libolm with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac-bindings">bindings for JS and Python</a> (and C++ in progress) if you want to link directly against it - e.g. if you’re using libolm for something other than Matrix, for example XMPP, ActivityPub or Jitsi.  We’ll continue to support and maintain libolm for now though, at least until the majority of folks have switched to vodozemac.</p>
<p>In terms of the audit itself - we recommend <a href="https://matrix.org/media/Least%20Authority%20-%20Matrix%20vodozemac%20Final%20Audit%20Report.pdf">reading it yourself</a>, but the main takeaway is that Least Authority identified 10 valid concerns, of which we addressed 8 during the audit process. The remaining two are valid but lower priority, and we’ll fix them as part of our maintenance backlog.  All the issues identified are excellent valid points, and we’re very glad that Least Authority have added huge value here by highlighting some subtle gotchas which we’d missed.  (If you write Rust, you’ll particularly want to check out their zeroisation comments).</p>
<p>So: exciting times!  Vodozemac should be landing in a Matrix client near you in the near future - we’ll yell about it loudly once Element switches over.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please head over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#e2ee:matrix.org">#e2ee:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks again to gematik for helping fund the audit, and to Least Authority for doing an excellent job - and being patient and accommodating beyond the call of duty when we suddenly switched the scope from libolm to vodozemac at the last minute ;)</p>
<p>Next up: we’re going to get the Rust matrix-sdk-crypto independently audited (once <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/milestone/1">this burndown</a> is complete) so that everyone using the matrix-sdk-crypto state machine for Matrix E2EE can have some independent reassurance too - a huge step forward from the wild west of E2EE SDK implementations today!</p>
<p>– Matthew</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The Spec Core Team has decided to not include <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> (threading via <code>m.thread</code> relations) specifically in the upcoming Matrix v1.3 release. We previously stated that it would be in v1.3, but there's a few unproven MSCs (namely <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773">MSC3773</a> (notifications for threads)) which make it feel improper to put threads into the spec at this stage. We're aiming for a future (very near) spec release to contain threads, assuming we can get enough of the feature landed. This is a very similar approach to what we did with Spaces: while the core feature existed as FCP-concluded for a while, we wanted to give some other MSCs a chance to land before writing it up formally.</p>
<p>As a follow-on from this, any implementations that are currently assuming &quot;v1.3&quot; spec support translates to threading support should note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients which are pre-emptively checking for v1.3 in <code>/versions</code> should stop doing that. Look for <code>org.matrix.msc3440.stable</code> as an &quot;unstable&quot; feature flag instead.</li>
<li>Servers which offer MSC3440's behaviour should expose it on stable endpoints and expose <code>org.matrix.msc3440.stable</code> for clients to detect.</li>
<li>Optionally, clients and servers can drop support for the <code>org.matrix.msc3440</code> (truly unstable) flag, given clients &amp; servers should have already upgraded.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the spec level, we'll still be writing up MSC3440's dependencies (aggregations and friends), but will notably be missing MSC3440 specifically in v1.3. If folks can update their clients urgently, it would be massively appreciated!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2596">MSC2596: Proposal to always allow rescinding invites</a>!</p>
<p>A simple change to the auth rules to help prevent an edge case where one is able to invite a user, but not disinvite them as the latter requires a separate permission. The MSC attempts to solve this by always allowing the cancellation of invitations you've sent.</p>
<p>A small MSC, but one with some open threads still. Perhaps a good opportunity to go in and clean it up!</p>

<p>Hello everyone. This week the team cut a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.59.0rc1">release candidate for Synapse v1.59</a>, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New module API support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12406">editing push rules</a>.</li>
<li>Experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11507">MSC3266, federated room summary</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12601">MSC3786</a>.</li>
<li>Updates to support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2285">MSC2285, hidden read receipts</a>.</li>
<li>Many bug fixes and internal improvements!</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the core team has looking at caches and memory usage: Erik has been looking at ways to reduce the memory usage of small servers, Shay's been adding some exciting <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12701">new config options to limit the total memory usage of Synapse</a> and David's added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12673">reload the cache factors of a running Synapse instance via SIGHUP</a>.</p>
<p>In parallel, Olivier's been doing groundwork to reduce replication traffic for workerised Synapse deployments, Andrew (anoa) has been looking at media retention policies and work continues on faster room joins.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we've actually made two releases — <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.4">Dendrite 0.8.4</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.5">Dendrite 0.8.5</a> — which are both primarily targeting performance and bug fixes.</p>
<p>We've also released our new living documentation, which is available at https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/, which features new installation instructions and documents that will be helpful to Dendrite server administrators. We will be writing more documentation and expanding this over time.</p>
<p>Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.8.2</li>
<li>Monolith deployments will no longer panic at startup if given a config file that does not include the <code>internal_api</code> and <code>external_api</code> options</li>
<li>State resolution v2 now correctly identifies other events related to power events, which should fix some event auth issues</li>
<li>The latest events updater will no longer implicitly trust the new forward extremities when calculating the current room state, which may help to avoid some state resets</li>
<li>The one-time key count is now correctly returned in <code>/sync</code> even if the request otherwise timed out, which should reduce the chance that unnecessary one-time keys will be uploaded by clients</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool should now work properly when the database is configured using the global connection pool</li>
<li>Fixes a regression introduced in the previous version where appservices, push and phone-home statistics would not work over plain HTTP</li>
<li>Adds missing indexes to the sync API output events table, which should significantly improve <code>/sync</code> performance and reduce database CPU usage</li>
<li>Building Dendrite with the <code>bimg</code> thumbnailer should now work again (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/database64128">database64128</a>)</li>
</ul>

<li>Power-level events are displayed.</li>
<li>Grouped membership events have tooltips showing each member's individual event.</li>
<li>When usernames are colorized, message bodies may optionally be colorized in a less intense shade of the same color, so they are easily distinguished yet easy on the eyes (and, of course, the shading is customizeable).</li>
</ul>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rust Matrix team is very excited to announce the next major release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0"><strong>Matrix SDK 0.5 &quot;stores and native crypto&quot;</strong></a>, now available for everyone by adding <code>matrix-sdk  = &quot;0.5.0&quot;</code> to their dependencies in their <code>Cargo.toml</code>. This first major release in about 8 months brings significant changes many have been waiting for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better, safer, native-er crypto</strong>: matrix-sdk 0.5 ditches libolm in favor of Vodozemac, the completely fresh rust-native re-implementation of the crypto crate. It has also been audited, the report of which is scheduled to be released soon.</li>
<li><strong>Store revamp</strong>: the entire cache storage infrastructure for crypto and state has been restructured to allow for full plug-ability, with even the two default supported backends, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-sled">sled</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-indexeddb">indexeddb</a> both being separate crates now. And as a matter of fact, a community-driven <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-sql">sql implementation has already been published as beta</a> (with postgres and sqlite support) by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lotte:chir.rs">charlotte 🦝</a>.</li>
<li><strong>WebAssembly</strong>; both of these changes also allow us to finally make WASM a Tier 1 supported target for the SDK. Not only does it build and even use the browser native indexeddb for permanent storage, we also have CI tests ensuring nothing will break this support going forward.</li>
<li><strong>Features, Features and Process</strong>: there's plenty more features and bug fixes in this release, e.g. native thumbnail generation support, as well as changes on our processes going forward.</li>
</ul>

<li>Who the room members are when a new Signal user joins;</li>
<li>When a Matrix user joins or leaves, who that Matrix user was.</li>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Wowza, that's a lot of new MSCs!&quot; I hear you say. This is actually a listing of the last 3 weeks, as it was pointed out to me that the last 3 editions of TWIM have not all features an MSC status update - which means some MSCs may not have necessary made it into the limelight.</p>
<p>As such, here's those from this past week, as well as the ones that were missed!</p>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>It's that time of the year again - a new Spec release is on the horizon! Matrix v1.3 is expected to land <em>sometime this month</em>, and will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> (threads) + related MSCs</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3787">MSC3787</a> (knock+restricted join rules)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3604">MSC3604</a> (room version 10)</li>
<li>Any other MSCs which have so far been accepted, but not yet made it into the spec.</li>
</ul>
<p>MSCs which land between now and v1.3 might get incorporated if easy enough, though chances are they'll slip to v1.4 (expected next quarter).</p>
<p>On top of that, the other bit of news is that the <code>proposal-in-review</code> label has now been removed from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals">matrix-spec-proposals</a> repo and thus all MSCs. This doesn't mean your MSC is no longer in review! We simply found the label redundant along with the other labels in the process (it was attached to all MSCs which hadn't been accepted/merged yet, which means very little) and thus we decided to remove it to reduce noise.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2881">MSC2881: Message Attachments</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC has actually been potentially(?) superseded by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3382">MSC3382</a>. In short, both look to provide a solution to the problem of attaching (multiple!) images to messages, such that clients can display an album of images in a single event in the timeline.</p>
<p>Check it out if you're interested in introducing such a feature!</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io">Andrew Morgan (anoa)</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.0">v1.58.0</a> was released this week! Check out <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/05/05/synapse-1-58-released">the v1.58 blog post</a> for the full scoop, but the highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our Docker images and Debian packages are now built from a dependency lockfile courtesy of Poetry. Props to David for leading the charge on this multi-week epic.</li>
<li>An experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3383">MSC3383</a> has been contributed by @Bubu and @jcgruenhage at Famedly, which will help with proxying federation traffic, amongst other uses.</li>
<li>An experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2815">MSC2815</a> has been merged, which allows room moderators to view redact event content for the purposes of moderation. This was contributed by @tulir at Beeper.</li>
<li>Device list updates are now asynchronous thanks to Erik, leading to much faster login times for accounts in big rooms.</li>
<li>plus many other bug fixes and improvements!</li>
</ul>
<p>We also released a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.1">v1.58.1</a> patch shortly afterwards to address an issue with the Debian packages on some configurations. Server admins not using the Matrix.org Debian packages do not need to install this patch release.</p>
<p>Otherwise, ongoing work from the core team continues with Sean and Rich working on faster room join performance, Olivier pushing forwards on testing Synapse with workers in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/">Complement</a>, while Erik has been tackling general performance work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks! We're announcing our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.6.0">1.6.0 release</a> for matrix-hookshot today. More features in this release: tadzik has gotten involved and given us support for RSS feeds in this release. You can check out how to get going with those in <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/1.6.0/setup/feeds.html">our hosted documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The highlights this time around are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add RSS/Atom feed support (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/315">#315</a>)</li>
<li>Add support for GitLab in the widgets configuration UI. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/320">#320</a>)</li>
<li>Send a notice when a GitLab merge request gets some review comments. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/314">#314</a>)</li>
<li>Add new <code>!hookshot gitlab project</code> command to configure project bridges in rooms. See <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/usage/room_configuration/gitlab_project.html">the docs</a> for instructions. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/321">#321</a>)</li>
<li>New <code>hookshot_connection_event(_failed)</code> metrics for tracking successful event handling.

<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week brings another round of big improvements &amp; new features!</p>
<p>Features &amp; fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes to Docker support &amp; the documentation for setting it up</li>
<li>Changes to the login flow
<ul>
<li>The bridge can now be configured to enforce a login flow that more closely matches the official KakaoTalk desktop client's, and to better warn you when a new login will kick out another one of your KT sessions.  This will hopefully prevent the bridge from getting KT accounts banned!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Backfilling for KT-&gt;Matrix read receipts</li>
<li>Commands for adding/removing KakaoTalk friends</li>
<li>Commands to edit your KakaoTalk ID &amp; mark it as shared or hidden</li>
<li>Matrix-&gt;KT DM creation, i.e. the ability to create a new DM with a KakaoTalk user from within Matrix
<ul>
<li>This might fail on the first attempt at creating a DM.  If it does, try re-inviting the KakaoTalk puppet to the room.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many stability &amp; correctness improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>With the combination of friends list curation &amp; DM creation support, it should now be possible to connect with KT contacts entirely from Matrix!  Simply add some friends, list them, and invite a listed friend to a 1:1 room!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone on Twitter complained that no chat client works like MSN anymore, where you could have separate windows for each chat. So for MSN compatibility we added that. (It is a bit experimental still, expect some stuff to not work or crash)</p>
<p>Bulbu also went through a lot of effort to add a second set of emoji shortcodes to Nheko. Those should be more familiar to people coming from other platforms or clients while the old shortcodes are available still as well. We also saw a lot of progress on the Finnish, Chinese, Indonesian and Russian translations, animated images should work properly in the image viewer again, buttons for opening the member list are now clearly marked with a people icon next to them. The memberlist is also now search- and sortable.</p>
<p>Anyway, have a look at how important multiple windows are:

<p>Matrix client for Emacs</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alphapapa:matrix.org">alphapapa</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ement.el has received several updates since the last time it was mentioned in TWIM:</p>
<p><em>Additions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A new room list command, <code>ement-taxy-room-list</code>, shows rooms grouped &quot;smartly&quot; (and programmably).  (It will be made the default soon; until then, call the command to use it.)
<ul>
<li>The new room list shows unread-notification/highlight counts, similar to Element.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basic support for spaces:
<ul>
<li>Rooms (and spaces) can be added to and removed from spaces.</li>
<li>Rooms are listed under their spaces in <code>ement-taxy-room-list</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reactions can now be toggled off (i.e. redacted) by clicking them, like in Element.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-room-send-file</code> allows uploading non-image files to rooms, and file messages are now displayed usefully, so the files can be downloaded or viewed.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-ignore-user</code> ignores and unignores users.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-tag-room</code> adds and removes favourite, low-priority, or custom tags on rooms.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-room-occur</code> allows searching messages in a room buffer, similar to Emacs's <code>occur</code> command (i.e. it locally searches already-received messages).</li>
<li>Membership events are now coalesced by default, similar to Element (especially helpful in large public rooms, like bridged IRC rooms, where join/part spam can be overwhelming).</li>
<li>&quot;In reply to&quot; links in replies, as well as other <code>matrix.to</code> links, can be activated in a room buffer to go to the linked message.</li>
<li>Mentions in outgoing messages are HTML-linkified (aka &quot;pilled&quot;), like Element.</li>
<li>Generated avatars for rooms that have none, similar to Element.  (Only displayed in <code>ement-taxy-room-list</code> for now.)</li>
<li>Option <code>ement-shr-use-fonts</code> (disabled by default, which prevents HTML messages from being displayed in a different font).</li>
<li>Faces for favourite/low-priority rooms.</li>
<li>Redacted messages that are still known locally are now displayed with a strikethrough (after reconnecting, their content will be unknown).</li>
<li>When images are disabled, image messages are presented as clickable URLs, so they can still be viewed.</li>
<li>Some events, like membership events and images, are displayed alongside a vertical bar to help distinguish them from normal messages.</li>
<li>Even &quot;hotter&quot;-looking timestamps for rooms updated in the last hour.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Changes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Refactored notification system.  Now easier to configure (see <code>M-x customize-group RET ement-notify RET</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fixes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved error handling when looking up homeserver hostnames and <code>.well-known</code> URIs.</li>
<li>Improved error handling when processing malformed events.</li>
<li>&quot;Elemental&quot; display style (not used by many users, apparently).</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?=n78tHoCx1es">this months demos</a> (also shown off at the top of the TWIM post), Eric showed off a <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9615#issuecomment-1108992901">proof of concept to anonymize your screenshots</a> so you can easily include more context when submitting logs or bug reports without worrying where the bug occurred. The current concept will color block all of the text on the page to still maintain the structure of the app but completely hide the content itself.</p>
<p>This still has a ways to go before it's integrated in Element under the click of a button so if anyone wants to take over or give feedback, go comment on the issue, https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9615. If you want to use the anonymization now, you can manually run the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9615#issuecomment-1108992901">JavaScript snippet from the issue</a> in the browser devtools.</p>
<p>This mode could even be further extended further to include <code>event_id</code> labels in the corner of each message to easily correlate the logs to the screenshot.</p>
<p>Happy screenshotting!</p>

<p>Over the last two weeks, the theme in populus-viewer development has been permissions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The settings menu for rooms has been redesigned</li>
<li>It's now possible to assign and remove standard roles (admin and moderator) from populus viewer</li>
<li>It's now possible to set power levels for standard events and actions from populus viewer</li>
<li>It's now possible to ban and unban using the membership management modal</li>
<li>Redacting the messages of others is now exposed as an action for those with that permission.</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides that, I've been having some fun on the <code>css-overhaul</code> branch reorganizing some design elements, and centralizing the color CSS in a few variables, opening the way for things like a dark mode and user-definable themes. Here's a peek at the new milder and more welcoming default look:

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a few release candidates and weeks later, we released <a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity/">Trixnity</a> 2.0.0 today! It contains many breaking changes due to a large refactoring, which allows us to share a lot code between server and client implementations of the Matrix APIs.
This means, that Trixnity can be used to implement matrix servers in addition to application services and clients!</p>
<p>Trixnity finally has support for Kotlin/JS. You can implement a browser client or even better: multiplatform client. Support for Kotlin/Native will follow soon (e. g. for iOS clients). Right now, there is no <code>trixnity-client-store</code> implementation for JavaScript (e. g. IndexedDB), so you need to stick with <code>InMemoryStore</code> at the moment.</p>
<p>Besides notification support (push rules are evaluated), we introduced helpers to get the complete timeline as Kotlin-Flow (no more complicated loops to get the timeline). You can even subscribe to all timeline events, which is really helpful to implement bots with e2e encryption support. Speaking of e2e encryption: libolm is bundled into <code>trixnity-olm</code> jars, so you don't need to build olm by your own anymore.</p>
<p>These are the most important features. For the complete changelog, have a look at the <a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity/-/releases">release candidates</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.9.0">version 0.9.0</a> which contains new features and some refactoring as many deprecated endpoints were removed so make sure to use the new ones when doing the migration.
Support for the Element recent emoji (<code>io.element.recent_emoji</code>) was added.  A new method to get the last read marker was added.
Lastly, the timeline logic was enhanced, and it's now possible to load the timeline at a specific event. So you can load the room to the last event and then paginate through the new events. When reaching the last event, the timeline will automatically allow new events to be added in the timeline when received.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello together. I made a generic bot, named <code>Safed Sundarata</code>, or <code>Sundar</code> in short, that should make it easy to get basic special functionality working. It has a lot of different functionality so you have an example code to work off of. The main motivation for this bot was to provide an <code>!error &lt;code&gt;</code> command for the developers in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#community:reactos.org">ReactOS Matrix Rooms</a>, which translates error codes to human readable text. Then of course i added other useful or fun commands to the bot. You want to read the <a href="https://github.com/BieHDC/sundar/blob/master/README.md">Readme</a> to find out more.
This is the first time i ever wrote a bot, so feedback and corrections to the <a href="https://github.com/BieHDC/sundar">Source Code</a> are highly appreciated. It is written in Go using the mautrix-go framework (thanks tulir and everyone who worked on this making it easy!). Even easier is to run and build it with go, no insane build system with broken dependencies required, which was the reason why i made it from scratch.</p>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.0">Synapse 1.58</a> is
out! Let's dive into this new release.</p>
<h2 id="poetry">Poetry</h2>
<p>If you've been reading the past few Synapse release announcements, you might
have already heard about our efforts to integrate
<a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> into Synapse. Poetry is a tool which
manages dependencies of a Python project. Its killer feature is its lockfile,
which explicitly pins all dependencies (direct and transitive) to a fixed
version, even across multiple Python versions and platforms. See more about why
we choose Poetry <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11537">here</a>.</p>
<p>During the past few months, we've been hard at work converting Synapse and its
CI to use Poetry. The goal is to make our Docker images and Debian packages more
reproducible and to provide a fixed, known-good environment for CI. This will
help us to ensure the stability and security of Synapse installations.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.57's Docker image was the first to use Poetry; after a successful
trial, this was extended to Synapse 1.58's Debian packages. Installations from
PyPI using <code>pip</code> will <em>not</em> use the locked environment, though everyone is
welcome to install from source using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/poetry.lock">our
lockfile</a>.</p>
<p>Huge props to <a href="https://github.com/DMRobertson">David</a> from the Synapse team for
leading the work on this front.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse also includes performance improvements around sharing
device list updates, which should greatly improve login times for large Matrix
accounts.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.58 also features the implementation of two MSCs:
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3383">MSC3383</a> to
include a <code>destination</code> parameter in federation authentication headers, and
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2815">MSC2815</a> which
(if enabled) allows room moderators to see the content of a redacted event (as
long as it hasn't already been deleted by the homeserver).</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.0">full
changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.58/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1580">upgrade
notes</a>

thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular

            <p>We've released updates to matrix-appservice-irc and our forked node-irc that it depends on to patch a High security vulnerability.
It's advised to update to 0.34.0 as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate a Matrix user into executing IRC commands
by having them reply to a maliciously crafted message.</p>
<p>Incorrect handling of a CR character allowed for making part of the message be sent to the IRC server verbatim
rather than as a message to the channel.</p>
<p>If you are currently a matrix-appservice-irc user, exercise caution when replying to messages from untrusted participants
in IRC bridged rooms until your bridge instance has been upgraded.</p>
<p>The vulnerability has been patched in node-irc version 1.2.1 and matrix-appservice-irc 0.34.0.
You can get the release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.34.0">on Github</a>.</p>
<p>The bridges running on the Libera Chat, OFTC and other networks bridged by the Matrix.org Foundation have been patched.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities are tracked as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-37hr-348p-rmf4">GHSA-37hr-348p-rmf4</a> and

<blockquote>
<p>Taking my GNOME Foundation hat on for this news: the GNOME Foundation is adopting Matrix! Is this TWIM worthy? It probably wouldn't have been if it wasn't for all the great work of Gwmngilfen! We published a joint blog post (though in all fairness Greg did all the heavy lifting) to explain how the decision was taken, and transparently share the data we had at hand.</p>
<p>In practice that means after <em>years</em> of Matrix being around in the GNOME community and being the most popular platform, it's finally moving out of the grey zone of &quot;everyone is using it but some older contributors really like their current set up, so it exists but it's not officially our primary platform&quot;. For now we're keeping both our Matrix instance and the bridge to GIMPnet (the IRC network GNOME people have been using for years). The major change is that IRC is now our legacy, so if tradeoffs have to be made Matrix will keep the premium experience.</p>
<p>Again, huge shout out to Gwmngilfen who gave meaning to the data I handed to him.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Hello again everyone! Your regularly-scheduled TWIM Spec update has returned, along with graph-based media!</p>
<p>Quick news to point out this week is that a new maubot plugin has been written to simply note the details of MSCs after their IDs (&quot;msc1234&quot;) have been posted in a room. The bot supports multiple MSC IDs in a message, message edits, threads and end-to-end encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>A copy of the bot is currently running under <code>@mscbot:matrix.org</code>, so feel free to invite it to a room if you'd find that useful!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3216">MSC3216: Synchronized access control for Spaces</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC serves as an alternative to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2962">MSC2962</a>, and essentially allows for user permissions to be simultaneously enforced across a set of rooms in a Space. This would allow functionality to users of platforms like Discord, where a user can be a moderator in a guild, and thus in all of that guild's channels.</p>

<ul>
<li>Locked python dependencies for our Docker images and Debian packages, thanks to David's <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/54">poetry work</a>.</li>
<li>Some big performance fixes, including <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12365">an optimisation to login</a> from Erik and one to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12522">message backfill</a> from yours truly.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we announced <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.2">Dendrite 0.8.2</a> with a bunch of usability fixes. As always, join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for more discussion and updates.</p>
<h4 id="features">Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lazy-loading has been added to the <code>/sync</code> endpoint, which should speed up syncs considerably</li>
<li>Filtering has been added to the <code>/messages</code> endpoint</li>
<li>The room summary now contains &quot;heroes&quot; (up to 5 users in the room) for clients to display when no room name is set</li>
<li>The existing lazy-loading caches will now be used by <code>/messages</code> and <code>/context</code> so that member events will not be sent to clients more times than necessary</li>
<li>The account data stream now uses the provided filters</li>
<li>The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.8.0</li>
<li>The <code>/state</code> and <code>/state_ids</code> endpoints will now return <code>M_NOT_FOUND</code> for rejected events</li>
<li>Repeated calls to the <code>/redact</code> endpoint will now be idempotent when a transaction ID is given</li>
<li>Dendrite should now be able to run as a Windows service under Service Control Manager</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fixes">Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fictitious presence updates will no longer be created for users which have not sent us presence updates, which should speed up complete syncs considerably</li>
<li>Uploading cross-signing device signatures should now be more reliable, fixing a number of bugs with cross-signing</li>
<li>All account data should now be sent properly on a complete sync, which should eliminate problems with client settings or key backups appearing to be missing</li>
<li>Account data will now be limited correctly on incremental syncs, returning the stream position of the most recent update rather than the latest stream position</li>
<li>Account data will not be sent for parted rooms, which should reduce the number of left/forgotten rooms reappearing in clients as empty rooms</li>
<li>The TURN username hash has been fixed which should help to resolve some problems when using TURN for voice calls (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/fcwoknhenuxdfiyv">fcwoknhenuxdfiyv</a>)</li>
<li>Push rules can no longer be modified using the account data endpoints</li>
<li>Querying account availability should now work properly in polylith deployments</li>
<li>A number of bugs with sync filters have been fixed</li>
<li>A default sync filter will now be used if the request contains a filter ID that does not exist</li>
<li>The <code>pushkey_ts</code> field is now using seconds instead of milliseconds</li>
<li>A race condition when gracefully shutting down has been fixed, so JetStream should no longer cause the process to exit before other Dendrite components are finished shutting down</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Our last update included the words &quot;if things go to plan&quot;, and even though that's usually calling for trouble, not so this time!
We released Ruma 0.6.0 yesterday and apart from a tiny missing feature that was fixed and released as 0.6.1 today, everything went smooth 🙂</p>
<p>The biggest breaking changes are</p>
<ul>
<li>new owned identifier types – calling <code>.to_owned()</code> on <code>&amp;UserId</code> now gives you an <code>OwnedUserId</code> instead of <code>Box&lt;UserId&gt;</code></li>
<li>a new event enum hierarchy, where redacted events are better taken into account</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, with this release we can now claim practically 100% coverage of Matrix v1.2, that is you can send and receive requests for all specified endpoints of the various APIs, as well as send and inspect all specified event types, all with a strongly-typed Rust API.</p>

<p>Matrix Community Manager has seen some work in the features department over the past week.</p>
<p>With the new Ansible playbook I think it's possible for someone with a bit of Ansible experience to get this bot up and running in under 10 minutes. I did a fresh install in 4 minutes. That is a fresh VPS and creating a new matrix account. Instructions for the Ansible deploy can be found <a href="https://sleuth56.gitlab.io/Matrix-Community-Manager/Installation-With-Ansible/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The major features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Ansible playbook that should simplify the installation process for new users.</li>
<li>Edits to the message that triggered the bot will now be reflected in the bots message. This bot now has a feature Twitter doesn't have :laughing:.</li>
<li>Hashtags are now called filters. Filters are more customizable allowing for custom delimiters and now show the originating room.</li>
<li>The AutoJoin feature has filters to control who or from where invites will be excepted.</li>
<li>Announcements can have more than one output room. Using a comma separated list of room ids.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few bugs were fixed as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some text characters were causing messages to be classed incorrectly thus causing crashes.</li>
<li>Exotic characters specifically in links were causing crashes.</li>

<h3 id="synapse-website">Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello again everyone. This week the team <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/04/19/synapse-1-57-released">released Synapse 1.57.0</a>, followed by a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.57.1">1.57.1 patch release</a> that fixed a problem in the 1.57.0 docker image.</p>
<p>This week was a little on the quieter side again, with some of us away on holiday and others away with illness. Nevertheless, this week <code>develop</code> saw a variety of activity. Some personal highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shay's effort to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/3c758d9808ddc00ee96c5426dda3caea356c8745">document Synapse's numerous config options</a> <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html">landed</a>. This is a huge and comprehensive effort that'll help administrators to understand all the options they have to configure Synapse.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12399">Further progress from Rich on the fast room joins project</a>. In some tests we've seen a 5x speed-up over the status quo!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12496">A subtle bugfix</a> from Erik which corrects incorrect counts in one of the Admin API endpoints.</li>
<li>The remainder of <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/54">the poetry work</a> has landed. There were a few last-minute complications in CI to smooth out, but we've now finished the migration. Synapse's docker images and debian package now come with a fixed set of dependencies (even transitive ones) in a way that lets us support multiple Python versions and interpreters.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're looking forward to shipping these in Synapse 1.58, whose RC is scheduled for Tuesday the 26th of April.</p>
<p>I'm also keen to see how <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12522">PR 12522</a> from Rich and Olivier progresses. It aims to fix a nasty memory bug which can cause Synapse to get stuck in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_memory">OOM loop</a>.</p>
<p>As ever, I'd like to express thanks to our community of users, server operators and contributors. Thanks are also due to @callahad: today is his last day of managing the Synapse team. We're all going to miss him and wish him well: thank you for everything you'd done over the last year and a half.</p>

<p>A Social Annotation Tool Powered by Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gleachkr:matrix.org">gleachkr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've added two major user-facing features to populus viewer:</p>
<ol>
<li>A two-up view in the pdf viewer, allowing you to view and annotate two pages at once on a wider screen</li>
<li>An audio viewer, complete with audio annotation, so that you can annotate temporal segments of an audio recording</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm especially excited about the latter - being able to discuss audio recordings will be a great teaching tool, and I'm hoping it might also be useful for things like people who want to talk about podcasts together (for purposes of editing, or just for fun), and people who want to annotate recordings of public talks of various kinds. The last use case would also be pretty well served by <em>video</em> annotation - so that's now rising on the agenda. I've created an MSC, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3775">here</a> where I'll be filling in the details of a proposed format for interoperable audiovisual media annotations. As always, if you've got questions, want to follow development progress, or just want to talk about the future of social annotation on Matrix, come join us at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opentower:matrix.org">#opentower:matrix.org</a>.

<p><a href="https://github.com/LorenDB/nheko-krunner">nheko-krunner</a> has finally been <a href="https://github.com/LorenDB/nheko-krunner/releases/tag/v0.1.0">released</a>! Version 0.1.0 contains several handy features such as searching your rooms, joining new rooms, and starting and switching to direct chats. Furthermore, if a room has unread notifications, nheko-krunner will let you know by tacking on a notification count to the room name (e.g. <code>This Week in Matrix (TWIM) (1)</code>. Currently this feature is not disable-able, but I plan to dive into writing KCMs (KConfig Modules) soon so that I can add a toggle for this.</p>
<p>Hopefully a few people find this handy, and remember that if you don't use KDE, nheko still has a handy D-Bus API that you can use to write integrations with other software.</p>

<h3 id="matrix-dart-sdk-website">Matrix Dart SDK (<a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/company/frontend/famedlysdk">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Matrix SDK written in pure Dart.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@henri_carnot:famedly.de">Henri Carnot [famedly]</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We haven't done any regular posts about it in a while, but the SDK sees almost weekly releases. (We did release version 0.8.20 last week) If you forgot about it, the Matrix Dart SDK is the SDK FluffyChat, the Famedly clients and a few others use. Let me summarize some of the changes for those who haven't kept up:</p>
<p>One of the killer features is probably WebRTC support 🚀. It handles all the signalling for you, which makes integrating call support into your Flutter or Dart Matrix client fairly simple. Currently it supports version 1 of the call protocol, which is still an MSC and implements a few of the other MSCs. Experiments with group calls are still in progress.</p>
<p>We also switched databases a few times and tuned it more (we posted about FluffyBox last year). The database backend should now be a lot more stable and more performant, while also using less memory.</p>
<p>Continuing with stability, we worked a lot on how the timeline is stored and structured, leading to a much more robust experience. The SDK is also now completely nullsafe 🎉, which gets rid of a lot of annoying error modes. There were some fixes to E2EE here and there, but mostly the experience has been really solid and didn't need much work.</p>
<p>Some of the more recent developments include widget support as well as improving the file upload experience. The SDK now inserts a dummy event for a pending upload, images are thumbnailed and resided in a different isolate and uploads are automatically retried after a connection failure. We are also working on improving the push support, making it easier to fetch events from a push.</p>
<p>And I'm currently working on bringing fragmented timeline support. Nico told me it would be pretty (not) easy to do... and I have to say, he was right. Good first issue 🙃</p>
<p>See you next week ;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've created a NixOS module, nix-matrix-appservices, that can simplify the bootstrap and maintenance of matrix appservices on nixos. With it, appservices can be spun up easily with registration and tokens handled by the module. Most mautrix and mx-puppet bridges have been tested to work and they can be setup in a couple lines of nix code. There are plenty of options you can make use of to configure more complex appservices.

            <p>Hey everyone! Guess what? <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.57.0">Synapse
1.57</a> has just been
released! Let's see what's new in this version!</p>
<h2 id="application-services">Application services</h2>
<p>Application services are piece of software that have privileged access to some
of the homeserver's features. For example, they can create and manage multiple
users at the same time, which is especially useful for bridges.</p>
<p>This release of Synapse changes the way Synapse manually manages transaction
identifiers when talking to application services (a transaction being a group of
events the application service should know about). While this doesn't have much
impact on the everyday life of a server administrator (besides fixing a
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12209">bug</a> and paving the way for
future performance improvements), this change means server admins should take
extra care when updating Synapse.</p>
<p>More specifically, if you are running a dedicated Synapse worker for handling
traffic related to application services, this worker <strong>must</strong> be stopped when
upgrading the main Synapse process to ensure the update is performed safely. See
the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.57/upgrade#changes-to-database-schema-for-application-services">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information about this change, and instructions on recovering from an
incorrect upgrade.</p>
<p>This release of Synapse also continues work on bringing end-to-end capabilities
to application services, which I was already telling you about in the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/01/18/synapse-1-50-released">Synapse
1.50 release blog
post</a>. More
specifically, Synapse now supports sending device list updates to applications
services, as part of implementing
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3202">MSC3202</a>. This
is still very experimental and definitely not production ready, but also very
exciting!</p>
<h2 id="improvements-to-the-module-system">Improvements to the module system</h2>
<p>Modules allow third-party developers to expand Synapse with extra features that
wouldn't necessarily fit into the Matrix specification and/or ecosystem. In the
past release of Synapse, we have been improving this system to add more
functionality to it, and this one is no exception!</p>
<p>Synapse modules can now implement new callbacks to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.57/modules/account_data_callbacks.html#on_account_data_updated">react to account data
updates</a>,
as well as to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.57/modules/third_party_rules_callbacks.html#on_threepid_bind">react to new 3PID (email address, phone number)
associations</a>.
On the latter, note that this callback will only be called after a 3PID has been
validated on the homeserver, and does not trigger when the validation happens on
an identity server (e.g. when publishing a 3PID so that other users can look it
up).</p>
<p>The <code>ModuleApi</code> (which is the Python class enabling modules to interact with
Synapse) has also been updated to allow module to read and write global account
data. This can be done by using the new
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/e31d06f6f0923d001736f5e6e08616293bd4b120/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L1401-L1464"><code>AccountDataManager</code></a>
class, which can be accessed as <code>api.account_data_manager</code> (where <code>api</code> is an
instance of <code>ModuleApi</code>).</p>
<p>The module API has also been updated with a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/e31d06f6f0923d001736f5e6e08616293bd4b120/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L543-L552">new
method</a>,
to allow modules to promote an existing user to server administrator (or demote
a server administrator to a normal user). This follows up on an improvement
introduced in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/04/05/synapse-1-56-released">Synapse
1.56</a> allowing modules
to promote users to server administrators when registering them.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release also includes a performance improvement for workers handling
<code>/sync</code> requests. While this change makes starting this kind of workers slightly
more heavy performance-wise, it aims at improving the load associated with the
first <code>/sync</code> requests hitting it right after starting. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12367#issuecomment-1088574192">this
comment</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.57 also now includes bundled aggregations in message search results by
default, as
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3666">MSC3666</a> has
been accepted and has finished its final comment period.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.57.0">full
changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.57/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1570">upgrade
notes</a>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone. This week the Synapse team cut <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.57.0rc1">a release candidate for Synapse 1.57</a>. It contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12040">Continued work on the faster joins project</a>.</li>
<li>Additional Module API support for working with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12302">3PID associations</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12391">account data changes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12341">making users admins</a>. The first two in particular are vital to to merge the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse-dinsic">DINSIC fork of Synapse</a> into the mainline source tree.</li>
<li>Experimental, partial support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11881">MSC3202, Encrypted Appservices</a>; additional support for threads <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12436">via MSC3666</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12403">via MSC2675</a>.</li>
<li>Plus a number of bugfixes within Synapse and fixes for spec compliance issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>As ever, our warmest thanks to to our contributors for sharing their time, effort and expertise with the project. We look forward to seeing your work in the wild, come the 1.57 release proper on  Tuesday the 19th of April.</p>
<p>On develop, we have been powering through a number of different tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>further work on fast room joins;</li>
<li>efforts to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12368">better document Synapse's config file</a>;</li>
<li>strides towards making Synapse's requests <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12468">internally cancellable</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12365">performance improvements for device list updates</a>; and</li>
<li>another spurt of work to get complement (finally!) testing Synapse in worker mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking personally, my efforts to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11537">manage Synapse's dependencies</a> using poetry are coming to a close. As I write this, I've just submitted <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12478">my last (planned!) PR</a> for <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/54#card-80652082">this project</a>. It's been several months in progress now, and there were many moving parts; some unexpected <a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3ABug+author%3ADMRobertson">bugs in <code>poetry</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9644">even one in <code>pip</code></a>; plus a heck of a lot of CI config to change and understand. My sincere thanks to the broader Synapse team for their help in getting the last batch of changes made, reviewed and merged. Once this is all said and done I hope we'll all reap the benefits of</p>
<ul>
<li>a stabler CI pipeline,</li>
<li>reproducible virtual environments in our docker and debian images, and</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p>This week brings many new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>KT&lt;-&gt; Matrix message deletion/redaction
<ul>
<li>Note that KT doesn't allow deleting a message if it's too old, so Matrix-&gt;KT redactions will fail for old messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KT-&gt;Matrix user name/avatar live updates
<ul>
<li>As opposed to only being updated on backfill / manual sync</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KT&lt;-&gt;Matrix read receipts
<ul>
<li>Caveat: KT-&gt;Matrix read receipts are only updated live, not on backfill / manual sync</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KT-&gt;Matrix member join/leave
<ul>
<li>Only joins were tested so far, but leaves should work too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KT&lt;-&gt;Matrix admin status / power levels</li>
<li>KT-&gt;Matrix channel name, description, and cover photo</li>
<li>General stability &amp; usability improvements</li>
<li>systemd setup instructions</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also launched an instance of the bridge &amp; opened a public portal room for testing purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matrix side: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#kakaotalk-bridge-testing:miscworks.net">#kakaotalk-bridge-testing:miscworks.net</a> </li>
<li>KakaoTalk side: https://open.kakao.com/o/gjGQFuae</li>
</ul>
<p>Logging in to my bridge instance is restricted, but Matrix users can still join the room thanks to the magic of relaying!</p>
<p>At this point, I'd say the bridge is now fairly usable.  Please try self-hosting if interested!</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a long and arduous journey, LorenDB's dbus interface for Nheko got finally merged. Currently this allows you to list rooms as well as switch between them. In the future we might add simple messaging support, so that you can automatically send messages into specific rooms using scripts. The API is disabled by default, since it is not authenticated. Enable it at your own risk!</p>
<p>Another long standing PR, that finally got merged, was MTRNord (they/them)'s support for pretty power level formatting. Nheko can now tell you what changed in a power level instead of just telling you that it changed. This should make them much more accessible to users, that don't like looking at the raw event source all the time (weird, eh?).</p>
<p>The image viewer should also be more reliable now and notification counts should be correct after a restart.</p>
<p>We have also been playing around with qt6 support. At this point we have a working Qt6 branch, with a few functional regressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>No voip (gstreamer has no Qt6 support yet)</li>
<li>No drop shadows on buttons</li>
<li>No switchable color schemes</li>
</ul>
<p>So far Qt6 looks pretty great and seems to fix a lot of the minor annoyances.</p>
<p>We are also still looking for some student or interested individuum to take part in the Google Summer of Code and improve the call support in Nheko! Deadline is drawing close, so if you intend to apply, better work on your proposal quickly! If you need any feedback for your proposal, feel free to DM me and ask me to review it/questions. I'm looking forward to someone applying! &lt;3</p>
<p>Anyway, merry christmas everyone or whatever you are celebrating this weekend!</p>

<p><strong>Threaded Messaging</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exciting news this week; the Threads Beta is live on all platforms! If you haven’t seen Threads yet, head to Settings &gt; Labs and check it out. 
<ul>
<li>Please note; If your homeserver doesn’t yet support threads functionality you may not see the beta, or your experience will be degraded. If this applies to you, you’ll see a warning message before you activate Threads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The team is continuing to squash bugs and improve performance, we’ve also started working on the next improvements…</li>
<li>Notifications and badges are top of mind for us next. We need to ensure accuracy of badge counters and consistency between platforms (if you use more than one). We’re looking at this now so keep your eyes peeled for our upcoming MSCs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community testing sessions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are restarting our testing sessions! Join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#element-community-testing:matrix.org">#element-community-testing:matrix.org</a> to take part</li>
<li>We are trying out a new asynchronous format with office hours for discussion to enable more people to be involved</li>

<p>A set of Rust library crates for working with the Matrix protocol. Ruma’s approach to Matrix emphasizes correctness, security, stability and performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org">Jonas Platte</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last two weeks, we have been busy working towards the 0.6.0 crates.io release of Ruma. If things go to plan, it should be published in the coming weeks (but no promises). That means mostly finishing some large refactorings, but we also got some bug fixes in, as well as a number of convenience functions for working with certain events:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1065">Add RoomPowerLevelsEvent::power_levels</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1068">Add convenience methods</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1069">Add transaction_id accessors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1055">Add convenience constructors for threads</a></li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@oleg:fiksel.info">Oleg</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HASSkbot can be used to control an action in Home-Assistant via Matrix reactions.</p>
<p>It's an <a href="https://opsdroid.dev/">Opsdroid</a> bot, which reacts to a home-assistant entity state change (like person leaving a zone) and asks for confirmation in Matrix if it should run additional home-assistant automation.
Matrix reactions are used for confirming or canceling an action.</p>
