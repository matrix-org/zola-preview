            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We've been able to start investing more time in advancing the Matrix Specification itself over the last month or so thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">Ben</a> joining the core team (and should be able to accelerate even more with <a href="https://www.uhoreg.ca/blog/20180507-1019">uhoreg joining in a few weeks</a>!)  The first step in the new wave of work has been to provide much better infrastructure for the process of actually evolving the spec - whether that's from changes proposed by the core team or the wider Matrix Community.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, we'd like to introduce <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a> - a dashboard for all the spec change proposals we've accumulated so far (ignoring most of the ones which have already been merged), as well as a clearer workflow for how everyone can help improve the Matrix spec itself.  Part of this is introducing a formal numbering system - e.g. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1228">MSC1228</a> stands for Matrix Spec Change 1228 (where 1228 is the ID of the Github issue on the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues">github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues</a> repository that tracks the proposal).</p>
<p>Please note that these are <em>NOT</em> like XEPs or RFCs - i.e. optional proposals or add-ons to the protocol; instead they are literally proposals for changes to the Matrix Spec itself.  Once merged into the spec, they are only of historical interest.</p>
<p>We've also created a new room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> to discuss specific spec proposal changes - please join if you want to track how proposals are evolving! (Conversation is likely to fork off into per-proposal rooms or overflow into <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev:matrix.org</a> or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-architecture:matrix.org">#matrix-architecture:matrix.org</a> depending on traffic levels, however).</p>
<p>Feedback would be much appreciated on this - so please head over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> and let us know how it feels and how it could do better.</p>
<p>This is also a major step towards properly formalising Matrix.org's governance model - hopefully the changes above are sufficient to improve the health of the evolution of the Spec as we work towards an initial stable release later this year, and then you should expect to see a spec proposal for formal governance once we've (at last!) exited beta :)</p>
<p>Huge thanks to Ben for putting this together, and thanks to everyone who's contributed so far to the spec - we're looking forward to working through the backlog of proposals and turning them all into merged spec PRs!!</p>
<p>Matthew</p>

<p>The talk of the town in Strasbourg this week was the arrival of Fractal Hackfest 2018! Event is still ongoing, and I'm sure they will provide a report of the progress on <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Fractal2018">https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Fractal2018</a>, though <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre</a> kindly sent us a photo of the group in action</p>

<h1 id="homeassistants">Home Assistants</h1>
<p>Wonderful things are happening and being discovered regarding IoT and Home Automation. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg:matrix.org">uhoreg</a> was the first to point us to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tinloaf:matrix.org">tinloaf's</a> project to build a Matrix Chatbot component for <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>:</p>
<blockquote><br />  <p>This component allows you to send messages to matrix rooms, as well as to react to messages in matrix rooms. Reacting to commands is accomplished by firing an event when one of the configured commands is triggered.</p><br /></blockquote>
<p>(this is not the same as notify.matrix <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/notify.matrix/">https://www.home-assistant.io/components/notify.matrix/</a>, which is used to deliver messages from Home Assistant to a room.)</p>
<p>Enthusiasm for this work led to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jon:terracrypt.net">jfred</a> discussing his past adventures in Matrix, including a component for <a href="https://github.com/theschwa/sibyl">sibyl</a>, 'a python chatbot with a focus on XBMC' allowing Matrix communication.</p>
<p>All this excitement led to Cadair creating <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#homeautomation:cadair.com">#homeautomation:cadair.com</a>, which has started a more thorough discussion. I'm eager to see more non-chat applications of Matrix, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> came up with others with projects in progress.  </p>
<h1 id="ongdpr">On GDPR</h1>
<p>GDPR has been a <del>favourite</del> topic for a while now. If you didn't already, take a look at the latest thinking from the Matrix Core team here: <a href="/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/">https://matrix.org/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/</a></p>
<blockquote><br />  <p>It's worth noting that we feel that GDPR is an excellent piece of legislation from the perspective of forcing us to think more seriously about our privacy – it has forced us to re-prioritise all sorts of long-term deficiencies in Matrix (e.g. dependence on DNS; improving User Interactive authentication; improving logout semantics etc).  There's obviously a lot of work to be done here, but hopefully it should all be worth it!</p><br /></blockquote>
<h1 id="travisrongdpr">TravisR on GDPR</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/">TravisR</a> has also been thinking about GDPR, and how it relates to his <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-voyager-bot">Voyager bot</a>. In his words:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>TWIM: I've mostly been working on figuring out how GDPR affects t2bot.io for the last couple weeks. One of the things running on t2bot.io is Voyager - a bot that tries to join rooms it sees mentioned in people's messages, graphing them on <a href="https://voyager.t2bot.io">https://voyager.t2bot.io</a>. With the increase in talk about GDPR and more bots starting to wander the federation, the recurring topic of whether Voyager should change its approach to finding and listing rooms.</p>
<p>With the current approach, Voyager reads messages and tries to find room aliases to try and join. Individual people can opt-out of this tracking to stop Voyager from reading/parsing their messages (opting back in at a later time, if desired). The room moderators can kick or ban the bot to completely remove their room from the graph, and can invoke a 'soft kick' if they'd like to have their room remain listed, but don't want the bot in the room. Voyager will make sure to only show information for public rooms and will update the graph if the room flips between public and private.</p>
<p>If anyone has feedback on how this approach could be improved (or if it should be left as-is), please come by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#voyager:t2bot.io">#voyager:t2bot.io</a> on matrix to start the conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="translations">Translations</h1>
<p>I was surprised and excited to learn that a Russian translation of the Matrix FAQ has been produced by a group of Russian-language users. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote><br />  <p>There are a several Russian-speaking users spontaneously decided to unite and help Matrix. We created a room where translated FAQ using the embedded etherpad widget. Some of us are here: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@commagray:matrix.org">Magnolia</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@commagray:matrix.org">Fenneko is a Good Girl</a> for example. Anybody can join to us <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#perevodators:matrix.org">#perevodators:matrix.org</a> and helps. We accept any help.<br />  Preview: <a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/index.html">https://ma1uta.github.io/index.html</a></p><br /></blockquote>
<p>They've provided a PR which I will presently merge (though of course, as I don't speak Russian I will need to trust that it's really a translation of the FAQ!)</p>

        <div>
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>As the May 25th deadline looms, we've had lots and lots of questions about how GDPR (the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation legislation) applies to Matrix and to folks running Matrix servers - and so we've written this blog post to try to spell out what we're doing as part of maintaining the Matrix.org server (and bridges and hosted integrations etc), in case it helps folks running their own servers.</p>
<p>The main controversial point is how to handle Article 17 of the GDPR: ‘
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/">Right to Erasure</a>' (aka Right to be Forgotten).  The question is particularly interesting for Matrix, because as a relatively new protocol with somewhat distinctive semantics it's not always clear how the rules apply - and there's no case law to seek inspiration from.</p>
<p>The key question boils down to whether Matrix should be considered more like email (where people would be horrified if senders could erase their messages from your mail spool), or should it be considered more like Facebook (where people would be horrified if their posts were visible <em>anywhere</em> after they avail themselves of their right to erasure).</p>
<p>Solving this requires making a judgement call, which we've approached from two directions: firstly, considering what the spirit of the GDPR is actually trying to achieve (in terms of empowering users to control their data and have the right to be forgotten if they regret saying something in a public setting) - and secondly, considering the concrete legal obligations which exist.  </p>
<p>The conclusion we've ended up with is to (obviously) prioritise that Matrix can support all the core concrete legal obligations that GDPR imposes on it - whilst also having a detailed plan for the full ‘spirit of the GDPR' where the legal obligations are ambiguous.  The idea is to get as much of the longer term plan into place as soon as possible, but ensure that the core stuff is in place for May 25th.</p>
<p>Please note that we are still talking to GDPR lawyers, and we'd also very much appreciate feedback from the wider Matrix community - i.e. this plan is very much subject to change.  We're sharing it now to ensure everyone sees where our understanding stands today.</p>
<p>The current todo list breaks down into the following categories. Most of these issues have matching github IDs, which we'll track in a progress dashboard.</p>
<h3>Right to Erasure
</h3>
We're opting to follow the email model, where the act of sending an event (i.e. message) into a room shares a copy of that message to everyone who is <strong><em>currently</em></strong> in that room.  This means that in the privacy policy (see Consent below) users will have to consent to agreeing that a copy of their messages will be transferred to whoever they are addressing.  This is also the model followed by IM systems such as WhatsApp, Twitter DMs or (
<a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3029749/facebook-zuckerberg-can-delete-old-messenger-conversations-you-cant">almost</a>) Facebook Messenger.
<p>This means that if a user invokes their right to erasure, we will need to ensure that their events will only ever be visible to users who already have a copy - and must 
<b>never</b> be served to new users or the general public.  Meanwhile, data which is no longer accessible by any user must of course be deleted entirely.</p>
<p>In the email analogy: this is like saying that you cannot erase emails that you have sent other people; you cannot try to rewrite history as witnessed by others... but you can erase your emails from a public mail archive or search engine and stop them from being visible to anyone else. </p>
<p>It is important to note that GDPR Erasure is <em>completely separate</em> from the existing Matrix functionality of “redactions” which let users remove events from the room. A “redaction” today represents a request for the human-facing details of an event (message, join/leave, avatar change etc) to be removed.  Technically, there is no way to enforce a redaction over federation, but there is a “gentlemen's agreement” that this request will be honoured.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
The alternative to the ‘email-analogue' approach would have been to facilitate users' automatically applying the existing redact function to 
<i>all
</i> of the events they have ever submitted to a public room. The problem here is that defining a ‘public room' is subtle, especially to uninformed users: for instance, if a message was sent in a private room (and so didn't get erased), what happens if that room is later made public? Conversely, if right-to-erasure removed messages from 
<i>all
</i> rooms, it will end up destroying the history integrity of 1:1 conversations, which pretty much everyone agrees is abhorrent.  Hence our conclusion to protect erased users from being visible to the general public (or anyone who comes snooping around after the fact) - but preserving their history from the perspective of the people they were talking to at the time.</p>
<p>In practice, our core to-do list for Right to Erasure is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">As a first cut,  provide Article 17 right-to-erasure at a per-account granularity.  The simplest UX for this will be an option when calling the account deactivation API to request erasure as well as deactivation.  There will be a 30 day grace period, and (ideally) a 2FA confirmation (if available) to avoid the feature being abused. 
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Homeservers must delete events that nobody has access to any more (i.e. if all the users in a room have GDPR-erased themselves).  If users have deactivated their accounts without GDPR-erasure, then the data will persist in case they reactivate in future.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Homeservers must delete media that nobody has access to any more.  This is hard, as media is referenced by mxc:// URLs which may be shared across multiple events (e.g. stickers or forwarded events, including E2E encrypted events), and moreover mxc:// URLs aren't currently authorized.  As a first cut, we track which user uploaded the mxc:// content, and if they erase themselves then the content will also be erased.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Homeservers must not serve up unredacted events over federation to users who were not in the room at the time.  This poses some interesting problems in terms of the privacy implications of sharing MXIDs of erased users over federation - see “GDPR erasure of MXIDs” below.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" id="mxid_erasure">Matrix must specify a way of informing both servers and clients (especially bots and bridges) of GDPR erasures (as distinct from redactions), so that they can apply the appropriate erasure semantics.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>GDPR erasure of Matrix IDs
</h4>
One interesting edge case that comes out of GDPR erasure is that we need a way to stop GDPR-erased events from leaking out over federation - when in practice they are cryptographically signed into the event Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of a given room.  Today, we can remove the message contents (and preserve the integrity of the room's DAG) via redaction - but this still leaves personally identifying information in the form of the Matrix IDs (MXIDs) of the sender of these events.
<p>In practice, this could be quite serious: imagine that you join a public chatroom for some sensitive subject (e.g. #hiv:example.com) and then later on decide that you want to erase yourself from the room.  It would be very undesirable if any new homeserver joining that room received a copy of the DAG showing that your MXID had sent thousands of events into the room - especially if your MXID was clearly identifying (i.e. your real name).</p>
<p>Mitigating this is a hard problem, as MXIDs are baked into the DAG for a room in many places - not least to identify which servers are participating in a room.  The problem is made even worse by the fact that in Matrix, server hostnames themselves are often personally identifying (for one-person homeservers sitting on a personal domain).</p>
<p>We've spent quite a lot time reasoning through how to fix this situation, and a full technical spec proposal for removing MXIDs from events can be found at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ni4LnC_vafX4h4K4sYNpmccS7QeHEFpAcYcbLS-J21Q">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ni4LnC_vafX4h4K4sYNpmccS7QeHEFpAcYcbLS-J21Q</a>.  The high level proposal is to switch to giving each user a different ID in the form of a cryptographic public key for every room it participates in, and maintaining a mapping of today's MXIDs to these per-user-per-room keys.  In the event of a GDPR erasure, these mappings can be discarded, pseudonymising the user and avoiding correlation across different rooms. We'd also switch to using cryptographic public keys as the identifiers for Rooms, Events and Users (for cross-room APIs like presence).</p>
<p>This is obviously a significant protocol change, and we're not going to do it lightly - we're still waiting for legal confirmation on whether we need it for May 25th (it may be covered as an intrinsic technical limitation of the system).  However, the good news is that it paves the way towards many other desirable features: the ability to migrate accounts between homeservers; the ability to solve the problem of how to handle domain names being reused (or hijacked); the ability to decouple homeservers from DNS so that they can run clientside (for p2p matrix); etc.  The chances are high that this proposal will land in the relatively near future (especially if mandated by GDPR), so input is very appreciated at this point!</p>
<h3>Consent
</h3>
GDPR describes <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">six lawful bases for processing</a> personal data.  For those running Matrix servers, it seems the best route to compliance is the most explicit and active one: 
<i>consent
</i>.
<p><i>Consent
</i> requires that our users are
<b> fully informed</b> as to exactly how their data will be used, where it will be stored, and (in our case) the specific caveats associated with a decentralised, federated communication system. They are then asked to provide their explicit approval before using (or continuing to use) the service.</p>
<p>In order to gather consent in a way that doesn't break all of the assorted Matrix clients connecting to matrix.org today, we have identified both an immediate- and a long-term approach.</p>
<p>The (immediate-term) todo list for gathering consent is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Modify Synapse to serve up a simple ‘consent tool' static webapp to display the privacy notice/terms and conditions and gather consent to this API.
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Add a ‘consent API' to the CS API which lets a server track whether a given user has consented to the server's privacy policy or not.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Send emails and push notifications to advise users of the upcoming change (and link through to the consent tool)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Develop a bot that automatically connects to all users (new and existing), posting a link to the consent tool.  This bot can also be used in the future as a general ‘server notice channel' for letting server admins inform users of privacy policy changes; planned downtime; security notices etc.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Modify synapse to reject message send requests for all users who have not yet provided consent
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">return a useful error message which contains a link to the consent tool
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Making our anonymised user analytics for Riot.im ‘opt in' rather than ‘opt out' - this isn't a requirement of GDPR (since our analytics are <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-26/">fully anonymised</a>) but reflects our commitment to user data sovereignty
</li>
</ul>
Long-term:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Add a User Interactive Auth flow for the /register API to gather consent at register
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">As an alternative to the bot:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fix user authentication in general to distinguish between ‘need to reauthorize without destroying user data' and ‘destroy user data and login again', so we can use the re-authorize API to gather consent via /login without destroying user data on the client.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">port the /login API to use User Interactive Auth and also use it to gather consent for existing users when logging in
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deactivation
</h3>
Account deactivation (the ability to terminate your account on your homeserver) intersects with GDPR in a number of places.
<p>Todo list for account deactivation:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Remove deactivated users from all rooms - this finally solves the problem where deactivated users leave zombie users around on bridged networks.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Remove deactivated users from the homeserver's user directory
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Remove all 3PID bindings associated with a deactivated user from the identity servers
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Improve the account deactivation UX to make sure users understand the full consequences of account deactivation
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Portability
</h3>
GDPR states that users have a right to extract their data in a 
<i>structured, commonly used and machine-readable format
</i>.
<p>In the medium term we would like to develop this as a core feature of Matrix (i.e. an API for exporting your logs and other data, or for that matter account portability between Matrix servers), but in the immediate term we'll be meeting our obligations by providing a manual service.</p>
<p>The immediate todo list for data portability is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Expose a simple interface for people to request their data
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Implement the necessary tooling to provide full message logs (as a csv) upon request.  As a first cut this would be the result of manually running something like <code>select * from events where user=?</code>.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other
</h3>
GDPR mandates rules for all the personal data stored by a business, so there are some broader areas to bear in mind which aren't really Matrix specific, including:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Making a clear statement as to how data is processed if you apply for a job
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring you are seeking appropriate consent for cookies
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Making sure all the appropriate documentation, processes and training materials are in place to meet GDPR obligations.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion
</h3>
So, there you have it.  We'll be tracking progress in github issues and an associated dashboard over the coming weeks; for now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1941">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1941</a> (for Right to Erasure) or <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-meta/issues/149">https://github.com/vector-im/riot-meta/issues/149</a> (GDPR in general) is as good as place as any to gather feedback.  Alternatively, feel free to comment on the original text of this blog post: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JTEI6RENnOlnCwcU2hwpg3P6LmTWuNS9S-ZYDdjqgzA">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JTEI6RENnOlnCwcU2hwpg3P6LmTWuNS9S-ZYDdjqgzA</a>.
<p>It's worth noting that we feel that GDPR is an excellent piece of legislation from the perspective of forcing us to think more seriously about our privacy - it has forced us to re-prioritise all sorts of long-term deficiencies in Matrix (e.g. dependence on DNS; improving User Interactive authentication; improving logout semantics etc).  There's obviously a lot of work to be done here, but hopefully it should all be worth it!</p>

<blockquote>can generate correct buildable (and runnable) code to convert data structures used in CS API between JSON and C++ - for the entirety of CS API calls. That basically means that libqmatrixclient gains (so far low-level) C++ CS API for all calls in <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/unstable.html">The Spec</a> and will follow updates to it.</blockquote>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Many people will have noticed disruption in #matrix:matrix.org and #matrix-dev:matrix.org on Sunday, when a validation bug in Synapse was exploited which allowed a malicious event to be inserted into the room with 'depth' value that made the rooms temporarily unusable. Whilst a transient workaround was found at the time (thanks to /dev/ponies, kythyria and Po Shamil for the workaround and to Half-Shot for working on a proposed fix), we're doing an urgent release of Synapse 0.28.1 to provide a temporary solution which will mitigate the attack across all rooms in upgraded servers and un-break affected ones.  Meanwhile we have a full long-term fix on the horizon (hopefully) later this week.</p>
<p><strong>This vulnerability has already been exploited in the wild; please upgrade as soon as possible.</strong></p>
<p>Synapse 0.28.1 is available from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.28.1">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.28.1</a> as normal.</p>
<p>The 'depth' parameter is used primarily as a way for servers to signal the intended cosmetic order of their events within a room (particularly when the room's message graph has gaps in it due to the server being offline, or due to users backfilling old disconnected chunks of conversation). This means that affected rooms may experience message ordering problems until a full long-term fix is provided, which we're working on currently (and tentatively involves no longer trusting 'depth' information from servers).  For full details you can see the proposal documents for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3fi2S-XnpO45qrpCsowZv8P8dHcNZ4fsBsbOW7KABI/edit#">temporary fix in 0.28.1</a> and the options for the<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ofbjluy8ZKYL6nt7WLHG4GqSodJUWLUxHhI6xPEjr4/edit#"> imminent long-term fix</a>.</p>
<p>We'd like to acknowledge jzk for identifying the vulnerability, and Max Dor for providing feedback on the fixes.</p>
<p>As a general reminder, Synapse is still beta (as is the Matrix spec) and the federation API particularly is still being debugged and refined and is pre-r0.0.0. For the benefit of the whole community, please disclose vulnerabilities and exploits responsibly by emailing security@ or DMing someone from +matrix:matrix.org. Thanks.</p>
<h2>Changes in synapse v0.28.1 (2018-05-01)</h2>
<strong>SECURITY UPDATE</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Clamp the allowed values of event depth received over federation to be [0, 2^63 - 1]. This mitigates an attack where malicious events injected with depth = 2^63 - 1 render rooms unusable. Depth is used to determine the cosmetic ordering of events within a room, and so the ordering of events in such a room will default to using stream_ordering rather than depth (topological_ordering). This is a temporary solution to mitigate abuse in the wild, whilst a long solution is being implemented to improve how the depth parameter is used.Full details at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3fi2S-XnpO45qrpCsowZv8P8dHcNZ4fsBsbOW7KABI" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3fi2S-XnpO45qrpCsowZv8P8dHcNZ4fsBsbOW7KABI</a></li>
 	<li>Pin Twisted to &lt;18.4 until we stop using the private _OpenSSLECCurve API.</li>

            <p>Well now, today sees the release of Synapse 0.28.0!</p>
<p>This release is particularly exciting as it's a major bump mainly thanks to lots and lots of contributions from the wider community - including support for running Synapse on PyPy (thanks Valodim) and lots of progress towards official Python3 support (thanks notafile)!! However, almost all the changes are under the hood (and some are quite major), so this is more a performance, bugfix and synapse internals release rather than adding many new APIs or features</p>
<p>As always, you can get it from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.28.0">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.28.0</a> and thanks to everyone who tested the release candidates.</p>

<h4 id="riotweb">Riot/Web</h4>
<ul>
<li>We're committing to 2-weekly releases come what may, to avoid another massive gap like the one between 0.13 and 0.14.</li>
<li>RCs will get cut starting from Wednesday; actual release then happens on the Monday having given folks a chance to test the RC on /staging (and to iterate on the RCs).</li>
<li>Obviously this is flexible if we need to rush out fixes sooner.</li>
<li>On that note, 0.14.2-rc1 was cut on Wednesday!  Please test it at riot.im/staging. It's mainly bugfixes but also the full relayering between riot-web and matrix-react-sdk.</li>
<li>Dave's working on finally hooking in Jitsi as the default conferencing system</li>
<li>t3chguy's been working on Replies, which continue to look awesome</li>
<li>Next up: E2E cross-signing (at last!!!!)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="riotmobile">Riot/Mobile</h4>
<ul>
<li>New releases are out! Mainly preparing for sticker viewing and trying to fix the Android push notification situation.  PLEASE TELL US IF YOU ARE STILL HAVING ANDROID PUSH NOTIFICATION PROBLEMS!</li>
<li>Lots of review of Android by Benoit - adding in Kotlin support as of today and establishing a formal roadmap for Android work (we'll show the blog post when we have it)</li>
<li>Lots of Matrix-for-French-Government stuff.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="synapse">Synapse</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/2018/04/27/synapse-0-28-0-released/">Synapse 28.0 was released!</a> A major bump mainly thanks to lots and lots of contributions from the wider community.</li>
<li>Massive experimental work on GDPR in progress - doing the thought experiment of pseudonymising MXIDs throughout Matrix on a per-room basis so that it's possible to redact MXIDs in the event of a “right-to-erasure” GDPR event.  Rich vdH is leading the work.</li>
<li>The good news is that introducing an MXID abstraction layer like this could help us enormously with some of Matrix's longest-term architectural issues - i.e. account migration and portability; improving on PERSPECTIVEs for managing server identity; future support for P2P Matrix; solving the domain name reuse problem; etc.</li>
<li>The bad news is that it would obviously be a very significant change to the Matrix spec, although we'd be doing it in such a way which minimises impact to client implementers and keep the CS API looking as similar as possible.</li>
<li>We're not sure whether we need to rush this through or not yet; still waiting for final GDPR clarification from lawyers, but it feels like this might be a good opportunity to force us to finally tackle some of these harder problems.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Erik's Delta State Resolution algorithm work is continuing well; we're hoping to finish &amp; merge it asap in order to get back headroom on the server.</li>
<li>Thankfully the matrix.org synapse itself has been relatively stable this week, other than being completely overloaded causing Freenode to be almost unusable.</li>
<li>We've started using Ansible in production, although the playbooks need some iteration before we're fully happy to announce them &amp; recommend folks use them as an official way of running Synapse in production.</li>

            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>We're incredibly excited that the Government of France has confirmed it is in the process of deploying a huge private federation of Matrix homeservers spanning the whole government, and developing a fork of Riot.im for use as their official secure communications client! The goal is to replace usage of WhatsApp or Telegram for official purposes.</p>
<p>It's a unbelievably wonderful situation that we're living in a world where governments genuinely care about openness, open source and open-standard based communications - and Matrix's decentralisation and end-to-end encryption is a perfect fit for intra- and inter-governmental communication.  Congratulations to France for going decentralised and supporting FOSS! We understand the whole project is going to be released entirely open source (other than the operational bits) - development is well under way and an early proof of concept is already circulating within various government entities.</p>
<p>I'm sure there will be more details from their side as the project progresses, but meanwhile here's the official press release, and an English translation too. We expect this will drive a lot of effort into maturing Synapse/Dendrite, E2E encryption and matrix-{'{'}react,ios,android{'}'}-sdk, which is great news for the whole Matrix ecosystem! The deployment is going to be speaking pure Matrix and should be fully compatible with other Matrix clients and projects in addition to the official client.</p>
<p>So: exciting times for Matrix.  Needless to say, if you work on Open Government projects in other countries, please get in touch - we're seeing that Matrix really is a sweet spot for these sort of use cases and we'd love to help get other deployments up and running.  We're also hoping it's going to help iron out many of the UX kinks we have in Riot.im today as we merge stuff back. We'd like to thank DINSIC (the Department responsible for the project) for choosing Matrix, and can't wait to see how the project progresses!</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CP_messagerie_instantanee_Etat.pdf"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3082" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dinsic.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="877" /></a></p>
<p>English Translation:</p>
<h3>The French State creates its own secure instant messenger</h3>
By the summer of 2018, the French State will have its own instant messenger, an alternative to WhatsApp and Telegram.
<p>It will guarantee <b>secure, end-to-end encrypted conversations</b> without degradation of the user experience. It will be compatible with any mobile device or desktop, state or personal. In fact until now the installation of applications like WhatsApp or Telegram was not possible on professional mobile phones, which hindered easy sharing of information and documents.</p>
<p>Led by the <b>Interministerial Department of State Digital, Information and Communication Systems</b> (DINSIC), the project is receiving contributions from the <b>National Agency for Information System Security</b> (ANSSI), the IT Directorship (DSI) of the <b>Armed Forces</b> and the <b>Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs</b>.</p>
<p>The tool developed is based on <b>open source software</b> (Riot) that implements an <b>open standard</b> (Matrix). Powered by a Franco-British startup (New Vector), and benefiting from many contributions, this communication standard has already caught the attention of other states such as the <b>Netherlands</b> and <b>Canada</b>, with whom DINSIC collaborates closely.</p>
<p>The Matrix standard and its open source software are also used by private companies such as Thales, which has driven the teams to come together to ensure the interoperability of their tools and cooperate in the development of free and open source software.</p>
<p>After 3 months of development for a very limited cost, this tool is currently being tested in the State Secretary for Digital, DINSIC and in the IT departments of different ministries. It should be rolled out during the summer in administrations and cabinets.</p>
<p><b><i>&quot;With this new French solution, the state is demonstrating its ability to work in an agile manner to meet concrete needs by using open source tools and very low development costs. Sharing information in a secure way is essential not only for companies but also for a more fluid dialogue within administrations.&quot;</i> - Mounir Mahjoubi, Secretary of State to the Prime Minister, in charge of Digital.</b></p>

            <h1>Matrix Ecosystem Updates</h1>
<h4>Drupal matrix_api module</h4>
Updated the Drupal matrix_api module to pass the auth token as a header instead of as a GET param... the GET param was leaking the token if there was an http exception thrown.

<h4>Fractal</h4>
Fractal 0.1.26 was released this week, which includes an animated scroll to bottom animation, fixed MacOS compilation, and bug fixes. Since then markdown support and many other commits have been spotted...
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/">https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/</a></p>
<h4>libqmatrixclient</h4>
kitsune released 0.2 of libqmatrixclient a couple of weeks ago, which he says is "the first one more or less functional and stable"!
<p>Highlights include redactions support, files transfer (both ways), rooms creation, account data (tags, direct chat flags). Also there are a few things making libqmatrixclient clients stand out compared to, e.g., Riot: one can set per-room names/avatars, and also the best estimate for the number of unread messages can be taken from the library and shown in the client application.&quot;</p>

<h4>matrix-monitor-bot</h4>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#monitorbot:t2bot.io">#monitorbot:t2bot.io</a> is a bot to measure latency between homeservers (as perceived by users).
<p>It's able to report metrics to Prometheus and has it's own built-in dashboard (see <a href="https://lag.t2bot.io/">https://lag.t2bot.io/</a> for some horrendous times). In the coming weeks it'll become more production-ready, however in the meantime if people are looking to help iron out the scalability issues, please run an instance on your homeserver.</p>

<h4>uMatriks</h4>
thrrgilag wrote on behalf of uMatriks, to say that v0.10 was published to the openstore this last week which now includes unread counts for rooms. Those not already familiar, uMatriks is a native matrix client being developed for Ubuntu Touch.
<p><a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks</a></p>
<h4>Construct</h4>
There looks to be lots of activity on Construct (jzk's fork of the charybdis ircd which adds in a C++ homeserver implementation) based on the commit log at <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis</a>. jzk's work there has been highlighting some of synapse's nastier problems (e.g. thundering presence bugs), and it looks like the federation support is progressing steadily, including handling EDUs (presence &amp; typing data).

<h4>picard</h4>
Cadair reported that he and SolarDrew have written a bot to bridge a whole slack team into a matrix community. It basically handles all the room admin for you including:
<ul>
 	<li>Invite the slack bot to the channel</li>
 	<li>Creating matrix rooms</li>
 	<li>Setting users as admins</li>
 	<li>Setting room name and room avatar and as publicly joinable</li>
 	<li>Setting up the link with the slack AS</li>
 	<li>Creating and adding rooms to the community</li>
 	<li>Inviting all members of the communtiy to the rooms</li>
</ul>
It does these things on a 1 min cron, to pick up new channels as they are created on the slack side.

<h4>IdleRPG</h4>
remaeus wrote in to say "we (+rpg:verse.im) just launched an initial build of #idlerpg:verse.im (now also available at #idlerpg:matrix.org) — an automated RPG that rewards you for staying online (via the presence API). It's an initial test case for prototyping out a bot framework called "doorman" with multi-service support, but focused on Matrix as we are using it as a "backbone" for our p2p app framework."

<h4>URI protocol scheme</h4>
kitsune started working on a design proposal for the Matrix URI scheme, with the ultimate goal to have the scheme passed through IANA so that we're no worse than IPFS and others. The document is here (alpha quality but comments are already welcome): <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18A3ZRgGR-GLlPXF_VIHxywWiX1vpMvNfAU6JCnNMVuQ/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/18A3ZRgGR-GLlPXF_VIHxywWiX1vpMvNfAU6JCnNMVuQ/edit</a>

<p>(<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>)</p>
<h4>Riot/Web</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>The Great Relayering landed - almost all of Riot/Web's code is now gathered together in one sensible place (matrix-react-sdk). No more duplicate PRs or CSS &amp; JS living in different repos!</li>
 	<li>Folks with open PRs against the riot-web repository will need to reopen them against matrix-react-sdk (or more likely, merge them into their existing equivalents on matrix-react-sdk)</li>
 	<li>Michael (t3chguy's) Replies work has almost landed and is looking fantastic!</li>
 	<li>Next up: improving test coverage slightly; fixing regressions in 0.14; and a few other minor bits and bobs before we land 0.15.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="riotmobile">Riot/Mobile</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>New releases on the horizon for both iOS &amp; Android</li>
 	<li>Welcomed Benoit to the Android team, acting as lead android dev!</li>
 	<li>Finalising all new UX for configuring push notification permissions…</li>
 	<li>Final touches for Sticker viewing (including animated stickers!)</li>
 	<li>Fix embarrassing crash on iOS on certain shapes of Riot/Web URLs...</li>
 	<li>Supporting French Government Matrix activity</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="synapse">Synapse</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Operational firefighting continues: stopping malformed events from impacting federation; investigating thundering herds of presence EDUs; trying to keep Freenode joins from lagging;</li>
 	<li>Meanwhile, Erik has been working hard on the problem of Incremental State Resolution (the big algorithmic win which could massively improve HS performance, especially for Synapse); this is looking promising and has ended up taking the form of a formal mathematical proof that the proposed algorithm works: <a href="/_matrix/media/v1/download/jki.re/hSmkLkFGVUnrXjtYcjsCUsyS">https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/jki.re/hSmkLkFGVUnrXjtYcjsCUsyS</a> (aka <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3122">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3122</a>) is where that's happening! Warning: contains maths.</li>
 	<li>...and also wrote a Rust testjig for state resolution to help reason about it: <a href="https://github.com/erikjohnston/rust-matrix-state">https://github.com/erikjohnston/rust-matrix-state</a></li>
 	<li>Official Ansible playbook repository dev is progressing on the develop branch at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ansible">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ansible</a> thanks to massive work from Michael K. We'll blog properly about this when ready for use in earnest.</li>
 	<li>Dave has been doing an interesting experiment in syncing user profile data from HSes into ISes (useful for folks running a private federation with its own IS who want to use the IS as a global user directory); almost complete - we'll see how this goes.</li>
 	<li>GDPR work is in progress. We're seeing how far we can push the envelope on improving privacy, including a very interesting thought experiment on pseudonyimsing MXIDs to provide 'perfect' right-to-erasure. vdH is on the case. Warning: this may well require a major federation protocol bump if we go through with it.</li>
 	<li>More Python3 port PRs are landing from NotAFile - thanks! They're getting slightly lost behind everything above.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Still stuck behind Synapse work.</li>
 	<li>Barring disasters we have at least 2 new folks starting fulltime in the core team (both synapse &amp; dendrite) to help backend progress at the end of May however!</li>
 	<li>Lots of PRs coming in from APWhitehat though - thanks!!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec">Spec</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>uhoreg has been looking at the .well-known URI proposal again</li>
 	<li>Spec work on the core team is currently stuck behind Riot/Web and Synapse work, sadly, on the basis that burning implementation problems are more visible and harming to the project than burning spec problems.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Today we release Synapse 0.27.3!</p>
<p>Hot on the heels of 0.27.2, notable changes include API support for joining groups/communities as well as a major bug fix (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3082" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="312859684" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3082">#3082</a>), that is particularly important for those upgrading for the first time in a while. Also new metrics and phone home stats. Phone home stats include better visibility of system usage so we can have a better idea of how synapse's RAM and CPU is behaving in the wild. Also, recording the number of users on the server who have been using it for at least 30 days.</p>
<p>Phone home stats are entirely optional and can be enabled/disabled by setting &quot;<span class="s1">report_</span>
<span class="s2">stat</span>
<span class="s1">s&quot; in homeserver.yaml. </span>
Please consider enabling phone home stats if you currently have not done so - this data is really important to us in improving Matrix as a whole (and justifying future funding for <a class="linkified" href="http://matrix.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matrix.org</a>).</p>
<p>As always, you can get it from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.27.3">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.27.3</a> and thanks to everyone who tested the release candidates.</p>
<h3>Changes in synapse v0.27.3 (2018-04-11)</h3>
Bug fixes:
<ul>
 	<li>URL quote path segments over federation (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3082" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-id="312859684" data-permission-text="Issue title is private" data-url="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3082">#3082</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes in synapse v0.27.3-rc2 (2018-04-09)</h3>
v0.27.3-rc1 used a stale version of the develop branch so the changelog overstates
the functionality. v0.27.3-rc2 is up to date, rc1 should be ignored.
<h3>Changes in synapse v0.27.3-rc1 (2018-04-09)</h3>
Notable changes include API support for joinability of groups. Also new metrics
and phone home stats. Phone home stats include better visibility of system usage
so we can tweak synpase to work better for all users rather than our own experience
with matrix.org. Also, recording 'r30' stat which is the measure we use to track
overall growth of the Matrix ecosystem. It is defined as:-
<p>Counts the number of native 30 day retained users, defined as:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Users who have created their accounts more than 30 days</li>
<li>Where last seen at most 30 days ago</li>
<li>Where account creation and last_seen are &gt; 30 days&quot;</li>
