<p>At first when I read the headline I was scared - <em>explodes</em>? How can I protect myself from this explosion? After a <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-raises-30m-as-matrix-explodes/">moment of reading this huge news</a>, however, I was relieved - Matrix has <em>exploded in popularity</em>, and <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> have all new funding to keep driving the ecosystem forward. Let's go!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>There were no new MSCs created this week.</em></li>

</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>While a quiet week for MSC state changes (shown above), there's still plenty of work and collaboration happening!</p>
<p>Spaces work marches forward as MSC3083 has been merged - allowing for users to join a room in a space based on their membership in a space. We think this will really help with the management of Spaces that contain lots of rooms that are otherwise invite-only.</p>
<p>Otherwise <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3291">MSC3291</a> (Muting in VoIP calls) has been receiving positive feedback this week!</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289</a> (room v8) is ticking along as the implementation is tested in Synapse and Complement tests.</p>

<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/29/synapse-1-39-0-released">Synapse 1.39.0</a> is out! </p>
<p>Of all the pull requests we landed, my hat is off to MadLittleMods and his Graphviz prowess in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10250">#10250</a>, which moves us one step further down the path toward <em><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a>: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms.</em> Mmm. Graphs.</p>
<p>But back to Synapse! You should check out the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/29/synapse-1-39-0-released">release announcement</a>, but the bulk of the work this cycle went into internal cleanups. Synapse should also be slightly more performant, reliable, and should log fewer spurious errors. Of note, ShadowJonathan did a lot of work with <code>pyupgrade</code> and <code>com2ann</code> to move the entire codebase to more modern Py3.6+ conventions and inline type annotations; thanks, ShadowJonathan!</p>
<p>Synapse 1.39 also continues our march toward unifying Synapse's interface for extension modules, and we've now exposed plugin hooks for the <code>account_validity</code> option, and experimentally implemented hooks for third party event rules.</p>
<p>Lastly, special thanks to kroeckx who has submitted 17 pull requests against our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">SyTest test suite</a> in the past month, mainly arising from running SyTest against <a href="https://conduit.rs/">Conduit</a>. Thank you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello! This week, I created a <a href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/matrix-synapse-backend">matrix 1-click app</a> on the DigitalOcean marketplace. It's basically a pre-baked droplet image that is pre-configured with synapse, element-web, caddy, postgres, plus some setup and moderation tools. My intent was to make self-hosting a Matrix system as easy as pointing some DNS records and running a single script. It makes a lot of sense for smaller, more casual Matrix homeservers, and can serve as a good starting point! It also includes some small utility scripts - <code>./reset-password</code>, <code>./new-user</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Secrets like the postgres password and registration password are generated on first boot, there's no sensitive data baked into the image. Of course, it would be nice to be able to verify this - the source code used to build the image is being open sourced. I'm just waiting for some internal processes to finish. It will show up at https://github.com/digitalocean/marketplace-matrix somewhat soon!</p>

<p>Heisenbridge roundup!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/">Heisenbridge</a> is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lazy joining of IRC users (see below)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep nick feature has been added</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridge aliveness can be tracked from bridge bot presence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ident replies can be customized by the admin for all users, default to mxid hash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pillifying IRC nicks has been improved</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest impact feature this time around is configurable lazy joining IRC users which improves the experience of joining massive IRC channels by not flooding the homeserver with join events. This is now the default and can be changed globally by the bridge admin or overridden per room by users.</p>
<p>Many fixes here and there. Still a few issues left before 1.0 and a lot of testing.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h3 id="announcing-matrix-client-cinny-1-0-0">Announcing Matrix client <a href="https://cinny.in/">Cinny</a> 1.0.0</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ajbura:matrix.org">ajbura</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cinny is a web-based matrix client focusing primarily on simple, elegant and secure interface.</p>
<p>The story started when a friend of mine introduced me to matrix and even after his help it was too difficult for me to get around with Element. I guess it was because Element is too different from other popular chat apps. Then I tried to find a good alternative for web but no success.</p>
<p>That's when me and my friend thought about creating Cinny. For the few weeks we were doing it for fun but when we shared a screenshot of the prototype, the response from people was surprising and that's when things got interesting. We got to know that a lot of people out there are looking for a simple and modern client and so we started building it.</p>
<p>Screenshot on Chrome desktop (see below)</p>
<h4 id="features">Features</h4>
<p>Cinny support the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Login/logout and registration of accounts</p>

<p>This summer's gone by so fast it feels like it's only been a week! Here's a summary of what's happened with Ruma the past few weeks:</p>
<p>We have had a productive summer with our two Google Summer of Code students, Adam Blanchet and Devin Ragotzy. Adam finished implementing the last of our Identity Service API endpoints, bringing us to 100% implementation of all the Matrix API endpoints! (And we promise there are no bugs because &quot;Rust,&quot; right?)</p>
<p>Besides improving the Matrix ecosystem, Devin has been helping the Rust ecosystem at large by writing some Clippy lints to improve our codebase and upstreaming his additions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I made <a href="https://github.com/davidmehren/maubot-ldap-inviter">maubot-ldap-inviter</a>, a maubot plugin that (surprisingly) invites users into Matrix rooms, according to their membership in LDAP groups.</p>
<p>We are switching from RocketChat to Matrix in the next round of a software engineering course where students work on software projects in small groups.</p>
<p>RocketChat has a LDAP sync, which we previously used to auto-add students and tutors to the chatrooms they need to be in (global announcement room, helpdesk, chat for their group etc.).
As there was no such feature for Matrix, I built the bot over the last few days.</p>
<p>It's still somewhat specific to our LDAP setup, but if anyone wants to use the bot and has questions, just open an issue in the repo!</p>

<p>No more suffering! Because now the <a href="https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/miounne">Mother Miounne</a> exists and it does 2 things (for now): handles of web/html forms (sends it to matrix room) and handles invite tokens (integrates with <a href="https://github.com/ZerataX/matrix-registration">matrix-registration</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a personal project I started a couple of weeks ago. I was dreaming of a good open source solution for OneNote or GoodNotes far a long time. There are already great projects, like<a href="https://xournalpp.github.io/">Xournal++</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lovasoa/whitebophir">Whitebophir</a>. But, they do not include the extent of possibilities to flexible host, collaborate and structuring the notes I have wished for.</p>
<p>Recently, I was thinking about the exact requirements I wanted for such a whiteboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Real time synchronization (cloud storage)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authentication/account infrastructure (to invite and collaborate on one whiteboard)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding/Removing ppl to a whiteboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliable hosting (when having cloud storage, I don't want to trust a one-man project to continue hosting. And a lot of ppl won‚Äôt self-host.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structuring whiteboards in categories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Viewing history and display which part has been drawn by which person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annotating other whiteboards with new layers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hosting for media like PDF's and images</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at this list, Matrix was such an obvious choice. I could comment every point but basically with: &quot;A whiteboard should be a Matrix room&quot; everything is said.</p>
<p><strong>TheBoard (probably not the final name) is exactly that.</strong> The frontend is not done yet, but already in an okay looking and usable state.</p>
<p><strong>Before trying it out:</strong> It takes really long to log in with an account with lots of rooms. So, I highly recommend to NOT use your main Matrix account.
Additionally, it is necessary to tag rooms as whiteboards. (really un-intuitive UX that will be improved) But for now the + button needs to be pressed and a (empty (not necessary but recommended) AND UNENCRYPTED) room needs to be selected.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I just (on Friday) finished initial spaces support to categorize the whiteboard in notebooks (aka spaces). They can only be create within a matrix client that supports spaces. But they will be displayed properly in TheBoard. (see screenshot)</p>
<p>Any problems, ideas and feedback is highly welcome as a github issue or in the matrix channel #TheBoard:matrix.org.</p>
<h4 id="tldr">TLDR:</h4>
<p>This project is whiteboard (similar to OneNote) which is</p>
<p>using Matrix as its backend. All your drawings are stored in matrix rooms
on your matrix server and are accessible to anyone who is invited.</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.39.0 is now available!</p>
<p>We've done quite a bit of work this release on Synapse's new interface for extension modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synapse's <code>account_validity</code> option has been extracted into a built-in <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.39/modules.html#account-validity-callbacks">extension module</a>. If your configuration previously enabled <code>account_validity</code>, it will continue working as before, but it is now easier to override and customize.</li>
<li>The third party event rules callbacks have also been <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.39/modules.html#third-party-rules-callbacks">experimentally ported</a> to the new module interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also improved the Space Summary API to list all rooms which a user could join (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10298">#10298</a>). This is especially important with the pending standardization of Room Version 8, which includes <em><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083</a>: Restricting room membership based on membership in other rooms.</em></p>
<p>MadLittleMods landed several pull requests on the path to implementing <em><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a>: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms</em> (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10250">#10250</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10276">#10276</a>).</p>
<p>More than anything else, this release contains an absolutely enormous load of internal cleanup. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>ShadowJonathan ran <code>pyupgrade</code> on the entire codebase, bringing it up to modern Py3.6+ conventions, then separately used <code>com2ann</code> to move us from legacy <code># type: foo</code> type hints to more modern inline annotations.</li>
<li>We finished converting several integer columns in our database to bigint as a precautionary measure.</li>
<li>We've made innumerable improvements to our CI configuration; including moving completely to GitHub Actions.</li>
<li>Countless small improvements to performance, reliability, and error logging.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that's not all! Synapse 1.39 also allows for setting credentials for HTTP proxy connections thanks to work by dklimpel; previously, Synapse was only able to provide authentication for HTTPS proxies.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.39/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1390">Upgrade Notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.39.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this rele ase.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/andir">andir</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ilmari">ilmari</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LukeWalsh">LukeWalsh</a>, <a href="https://github.com/moritzdietz">moritzdietz</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ShadowJonathan">ShadowJonathan</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/xmunoz">xmunoz</a>.</p>

            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Big news today: Element, the startup founded by the team who created Matrix,
just raised $30M of Series B funding in order to further accelerate Matrix
development and improve Element, the flagship Matrix app. The round is led by
our friends at <a href="https://protocol.ai">Protocol Labs</a> and <a href="https://metaplanet.com">Metaplanet</a>,
the fund established by Jaan Tallinn (co-founder of
Skype and Kazaa).  Both Protocol Labs and Metaplanet are spectacularly on
board our decentralised communication quest, and you couldn't really ask for
a better source of funding to help take Matrix to the next level.  Thank you
for believing in Matrix and leading Element's latest funding!</p>
<p>You can read all about it from the Element perspective over at the
<a href="https://element.io/blog/element-raises-30m-as-matrix-explodes">Element Blog</a>,
but suffice it to say that this is enormous news for the Matrix ecosystem as a
whole.  In addition to transforming the Element app, on the Matrix side this
means that there is now concrete funding secured to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>finish building out <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/06/introducing-the-pinecone-overlay-network">P2P Matrix</a>
and get it live (including finishing Dendrite, given our P2P work builds on Dendrite!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1419820122143961093">native decentralised E2EE voip/video conferencing</a> for Matrix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fully build out our
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">relative decentralised reputation system</a>
in order to combat abuse in Matrix.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously this is in addition to all the normal business-as-usual work going
on in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting <a href="https://element.io/blog/spaces-the-next-frontier/">Spaces</a> out of beta</li>
<li>adding Threading to Element (yes, it's finally happening!)</li>
<li>speeding up room joins over federation</li>
<li>creating 'sync v3' to lazy-load all content and make the API super-snappy</li>
<li>lots of little long-overdue fun bits and pieces (yes, custom emoji, we're looking at you).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're wondering whether Protocol Labs' investment means that we'll be
seeing more overlap between <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> and Matrix, then yes -
where it makes tech sense to do so, we're hoping to work more closely
together; for instance collaborating with the libp2p team on our P2P work
(we still need to experiment properly with gossipsub!), or perhaps giving
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/travis/msc/ipfs/proposals/2706-IPFS.md">MSC2706</a>
some attention.  However, there are no plans to use cryptocurrency incentives
in Matrix or Element any time soon.</p>
<p>So, exciting times ahead!  We'd like to inordinately thank everyone who has
supported Matrix over the years - especially our Patreon supporters, whose
donations pay for all the matrix.org infrastructure while inspiring others to
open their cheque books; the existing investors at Element (especially <a href="https://notion.vc">Notion</a>
and <a href="https://automattic.com">Automattic</a>, who have come in again on this round); all the large scale
Matrix deployments out there which are effectively turning Matrix into an
industry (hello <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/21/germanys-national-healthcare-system-adopts-matrix">gematik!</a>) -
and everyone who has ever run a Matrix server, contributed code, used the
spec to make their own Matrix-powered creation, or simply chatted on Matrix.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Matrix wouldn't exist without you: the protocol and network
would have fizzled out long ago were it not for all the people supporting it
(the matrix.org server can now see over 35.5M addressable users on the
network!) - and meanwhile the ever-increasing energy of the community and the
core team combines to keep the protocol advancing forwards faster than ever.</p>
<p>We will do everything we possibly can to succeed in creating the long-awaited
secure communication layer of the open Web, and we look forward to large
amounts of Element's new funding being directed directly into core Matrix
development :)</p>
<p>thanks for flying Matrix,</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix core team.</p>

            <p>It's only been two weeks since Dendrite 0.4 landed, but there's already a
significant new release with Dendrite 0.4.1 (it's amazing how much work we
can do on Dendrite when not off chasing low-bandwidth and P2P Matrix!)</p>
<p>This release further improves memory performance and radically improves
state resolution performance (rumour has it that it's a 10x speed-up).
Meanwhile, SS API sytest coverage is up to 91%(!!) and CS API is now at 63%.</p>
<p>We're going to try to keep the pressure up over the coming weeks - and once
sytest is at 100% coverage (and we're not missing any big features which sytest
doesn't cover yet) we'll be declaring a 1.0 :)</p>
<p>If you're running Dendrite, please upgrade.  If not, perhaps this would be a
good version to give it a try?  You can get it, as always from,
https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.1.  The changelog
follows:</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for room version 7 has been added</li>
<li>Key notary support is now more complete, allowing Dendrite to be used as a notary server for looking up signing keys</li>
<li>State resolution v2 performance has been optimised further by caching the create event, power levels and join rules in memory instead of parsing them repeatedly</li>
<li>The media API now handles cases where the maximum file size is configured to be less than 0 for unlimited size</li>
<li>The <code>initial_state</code> in a <code>/createRoom</code> request is now respected when creating a room</li>
<li>Code paths for checking if servers are joined to rooms have been optimised significantly</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>A bug resulting in <code>cannot xref null state block with snapshot</code> during the new state storage migration has been fixed</li>
<li>Invites are now retired correctly when rejecting an invite from a remote server which is no longer reachable</li>
<li>The DNS cache <code>cache_lifetime</code> option is now handled correctly (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a>)</li>
<li>Invalid events in a room join response are now dropped correctly, rather than failing the entire join</li>
<li>The <code>prev_state</code> of an event will no longer be populated incorrectly to the state of the current event</li>
<li>Receiving an invite to an unsupported room version will now correctly return the <code>M_UNSUPPORTED_ROOM_VERSION</code> error code instead of <code>M_BAD_JSON</code> (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/meenal06">meenal06</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<hr />
<p>This week brings plenty of usability improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is now the <code>list-contacts</code> bot command to--you guessed it!--list the Matrix puppets of all of your contacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's now possible to sync a chat with a LINE user by inviting their Matrix puppet to a DM, instead of having to wait for someone to send you a message in LINE for the bridge to auto-sync it. This is especially useful with <code>list-contacts</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LINE group chats that haven't been used recently are now included in the set of chats that get bridged on a <code>sync</code> operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of chats to sync at startup time &amp; on-demand is now configurable, as a bridge config setting &amp; a parameter to the <code>sync</code> command, respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes make it possible to sync LINE chats/groups that previously may not have gotten synced, due to the intricacies of how LINE on Chrome handles chat history (especially on first use of the bridge).</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LorenDB has rewritten the invite dialog as well as the memberlist in Qml. This means they work now much more reliably and show the users in appropriate colors and a few other small improvements.</p>
<p>Apart from that, Nheko now has support for sending stickers! This is based on Sorunome's awesome <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2545">MSC2545</a>, so no integration manager is needed and it is trivially easy to share your sticker packs (just invite someone into the same room!). You can use stickers from your account data or upload stickers into a room so every room member can use it. If you found a sticker pack you like, you can enable a pack from a room globally by going into Nheko's room settings. You can check my current preferred set of stickers here: matrix:r/nico's-stickers:neko.dev</p>
<p>Currently you can't edit a sticker pack yet from Nheko. Support for that will come in the near future. Until then you can use either FluffyChat, Element's DevTools or <a href="https://github.com/deepbluev7/stickerpicker">my hack to import Telegram sticker packs into a room</a>. Note that Nheko's sticker pack support is incompatible with integration server based sticker packs like the one Element uses. On the other hand, you don't need an integration manager to use them! Custom emote support based in the image packs MSC is coming in the future to Nheko too.</p>
<p>Furthermore we fixed some bugs to move E2EE in Nheko out of Beta. We are close now and we have a plan!</p>
<p>That's all, don't get your hands too sticky!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/02/this-week-in-matrix-2021-07-02">three weeks already since our last update</a> and we have a fair amount of new things to report.</p>
<p>As I write this, our interns Alejandro and Kai are at GUADEC, the annual GNOME conference, presenting during the interns lightning talk. The former has submitted a couple of merge requests (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/793">!793</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/794">!794</a>) that were necessary for the UI to accommodate his upcoming multi-account work. The latter has provided <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/788">a view for when no room is selected</a>. As for their mentor, Julian, he changed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/795">member loading so it only happens once a room is opened</a>, to improve performances. He also changed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/796">Matrix event handling to use <code>SyncRoomEvent</code></a>, which paves the way for display of various message types in the timeline of a room.</p>
<p>Giuseppe offered two nice additions to the login view:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in the form, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/783">one can now type enter to login</a> (it previously required to click on the button in the headerbar)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/791">errors are now displayed</a>, providing useful feedback on why the login may have failed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And to conclude this summary, we welcome üéâ newcomer Veli Tasalƒ± who fixed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/issues/802">a papercut I reported</a>: <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/787">when typing long messages, buttons next to the message entry were expanding along with the entry and now they keep nicely aligned</a>.</p>

<p>We've integrated the LinkedIn bridge into Beeper. The bridge is in beta and is generally ready for use. Since the last update, we moved it to <a href="https://gitlab.com/beeper/linkedin">GitLab</a>, added a Docker image, and implemented reaction and redaction handling in both directions! We also fixed a bunch of bugs across the board to improve reliability.</p>
<h4 id="android-sms">Android SMS</h4>
<p>The Android SMS bridge mentioned in the last update is progressing. It should be ready for self-hosted use in a few weeks, so our next update will probably include that.</p>
<p>Related to the SMS bridge, I've made <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-syncproxy">mautrix-syncproxy</a>, which is a microservice to do the <code>/sync</code>ing required for end-to-bridge encryption (to-device events and such) in the cloud and forwarding the data to the normal appservice transaction endpoint. When combined with <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-wsproxy">mautrix-wsproxy</a>, it allows the SMS bridge to only have a websocket connection, which uses significantly less battery than a HTTP request every 30 seconds. The sync proxy partially implements <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3202">MSC3202</a> and the to-device part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> (partially because it only does individual users rather than all appservice-owned users).</p>

<p>Several GNOME contributors and I have been following TWIM and really enjoyed the concept. Since open source is about <del>stealing</del> sharing ideas, we wanted to deploy something similar for GNOME.</p>
<p>I gave this room's beloved <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/twim-o-matic">twim-o-matic</a> a try and fiddled a bit with the code. But I soon found that it is too specialised for matrix.org.

<p>Here is <a href="https://thisweek.gnome.org/posts/2021/07/twig-1/">how it looks in practice with a companion website for GNOME</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>This week I have developed a new plugin for <a href="https://octoprint.org/">OctoPrint</a> which is a tool for controlling and monitoring 3D printers, which sends notifications about your prints and status of your 3D printer to matrix. The existing OctoSlack plugin also has Matrix support but fell foul of the /sync response changes in Synapse 1.38, and also sent the images from the camera to Matrix as inline images rather than m.image events, so they didn't render on some clients.</p>
<p>My new plugin can send messages on most events supported by OctoPrint, but the core events which are configurable through the OctoPrint web UI are print started, paused, completed and failed as well as print progress notifications. If you want Matrix notifications for your 3D prints, you can install the plugin through the official <a href="https://octoprint.org/">OctoPrint plugin repository</a> or by installing from the <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/octoprint-matrix-notifier-plugin">GitHub repository</a>. If you have any feature requests or pull requests, contributions to the plugin are very welcome.</p>

            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>We‚Äôre incredibly excited to officially announce that the national agency for
the digitalisation of the healthcare system in Germany (<a href="http://gematik.de">gematik</a>)
has selected Matrix as the open standard on which to base all its
interoperable instant messaging standard - the TI-Messenger.</p>
<p>gematik has released a <a href="https://fachportal.gematik.de/anwendungen/ti-messenger">concept paper</a>
that explains the initiative in full.</p>
<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>With the TI-Messenger, gematik is creating a nationwide decentralised private
communication network - based on Matrix - to support potentially more than
<strong>150,000</strong> healthcare organisations within Germany‚Äôs national healthcare system.
It will provide end-to-end encrypted VoIP/Video and messaging for the whole
healthcare system, as well as the ability to share healthcare based data,
images and files.</p>
<p>Initially every healthcare provider (HCP) with an HBA (HPC ID card) will be
able to choose their own TI-Messenger provider. The homesever for HCP
accounts will be hosted by the provider‚Äôs datacentre. The homeserver for
institutions can be hosted by TI-Messenger providers, or on-premise.</p>
<p>Each organisation and individual will therefore retain complete ownership and
control of their communication data - while being able to share it securely
within the healthcare system with end-to-end encryption by default. All
servers in the Matrix-based private federation will be hosted within
Germany.</p>
<p>Needless to say, security is key when underpinning the entire nation‚Äôs
healthcare infrastructure and safeguarding sensitive patient data. As such,
the entire implementation will be <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html">accredited by BSI</a>
(Federal Office for Information Security) and <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html">BfDI</a>
(Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information).</p>
<h2 id="the-full-context">The full context...</h2>
<p>Germany‚Äôs digital care modernisation law (‚ÄúDigitale Versorgung und Pflege
Modernisierungs Gesetz‚Äù or DVPMG), which came into force in June 2021, spells
out  the need for an instant messaging solution.</p>
<p>The urgency has increased by a significant rise in the use of instant
messaging and video conferencing within the healthcare system - for instance,
the amount of medical practices using messenger services doubled in 2020
compared to 2018 (much of this using insecure messaging solutions).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gematik.de/">gematik</a>, majority-owned by Germany‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/english-version.html">Federal Ministry of Health</a>,
is responsible for the standardised digital transformation of Germany‚Äôs
healthcare sector. It focuses on improving efficiency and introducing new
ways of working by setting, testing and certifying healthcare technology
including electronic health cards, electronic patient records and
e-prescriptions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gematik.de/anwendungen/ti-messenger/">TI-Messenger</a> is gematik‚Äôs
technical specification for an interoperable secure instant messaging
standard. The healthcare industry will be able to build a wide range of apps
based on TI-Messenger specifications knowing that, being built on Matrix, all
those apps will interoperate.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 organisations - ranging from local doctors to clinics,
hospitals, and insurance companies - can potentially standardise on instant
messaging thanks to gematik‚Äôs TI-Messenger initiative.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-interoperability">The road to interoperability</h2>
<p>By 1 October 2021, TI-Messenger will initially specify how communication
should work in practice between healthcare professionals (HCPs). Physicians
will be able to find and communicate with each other via TI-Messenger
approved apps - specifications include secure authentication mechanisms with
electronic health professional cards (eHBAs), electronic institution cards
(SMC-B) and a central <a href="https://hl7.org/FHIR/">FHIR</a> directory. The first
compliant apps for HCPs are expected to be licensed by Q2 2022.</p>
<p>Eric Grey (product manager for TI-Messenger at gematik), reckons there will
initially be around 10-15 TI-Messenger compliant Matrix-based apps for HCP
communications available from different vendors. </p>
<p>Healthcare professionals will be able to choose a TI-Messenger provider, who
will be hosting their personal accounts and provide the messenger-client. </p>
<p>Healthcare organisations will choose a TI-Messenger provider to build the
dedicated homeserver infrastructure (on prem or in a data center), provide
the client and ongoing support.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-the-matrix-community">What does this mean for the Matrix community?</h2>
<p>Matrix is already integral to huge parts of the public sector; from the French
government‚Äôs Tchap platform, to Bundeswehr‚Äôs use of BwMessenger and adoption
by universities and schools across Europe. </p>
<p>Germany‚Äôs healthcare system standardising on Matrix takes this to entirely the
next level - and we can‚Äôt wait to see the rest of Europe (and the world!)
converge on Matrix for healthcare!</p>
<p>We'll have more info about TI-Messenger on this week's Matrix Live, out on
Friday - stay tuned!</p>

<p>Several members of the Spec Core Team reviewed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> (Event relationships) this week in order to help push along the efforts to finally ship aggregations in the spec. Otherwise <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3245">MSC3245</a> (voice messages via extensible events) is moving along with final comment period proposed this week. The implementation in Element Web in reportedly working well, helping to prove the spec in practice. And finally, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3277">MSC3277</a> (scheduled messages) which appeared over the weekend to try and allow for scheduling events to send later in Matrix (and all the fun edge cases that come with it).</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who submitted, read and reviewed MSCs this week. It takes people to move this stuff forward!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, we <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.0">released Dendrite 0.4.0 on Monday</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/12/dendrite-0-4-0-released">wrote a blog post about it</a>! It's taken us a little while to get to this release, but it includes a number of quality-of-life improvements and changes that will significantly reduce the amount of resources needed to run a Dendrite server. The full changelog is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.0">available on GitHub</a> and many juicy details in the aforementioned blog post, but at a high level this release includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All-new state storage, designed to reduce the amount of disk space that the roomserver takes up to store room state by aggressively deduplicating state blocks and snapshots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved appservice support, with a number of bridges now working with Dendrite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared secret registration (using the same API shape as Synapse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimisations in the federation API <code>/send</code> and <code>/get_missing_events</code> endpoints to reduce memory usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved state resolution v2 performance when dealing with power level events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per-room queuing to reduce head-of-line blocking on the roomserver input API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of bug fixes around invites, registration, sync and media, and 5 panics fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the release, we've been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Completing key notary support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing <code>state_default</code> for power levels in gomatrixserverlib</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolving some issues around rejecting invites, particularly when the remote server is not available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the cost of checking if the local server is in a given room</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since our last update, our Sytest compliance numbers have been on the rise again, taking us ever closer to our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 61%, up from 60% last time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 92%, up from 80% last time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appservice APIs: 52%</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The big news of the week is the release of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/13/synapse-1-38-0-released">Synapse 1.38</a>, which converts several integer columns to <code>bigint</code>, allowing Synapse to process more than 2 billion (231) events.

<blockquote>
<p>But that's not the only thing new in Synapse 1.38. We also landed the ability to set an expiry time on cache entries, allowing you to reclaim memory from infrequently accessed caches. Configuring this to &quot;1h&quot; on matrix.org has already yielded a noticeable reduction in overall memory use üìâ:</p>

This will allow messaging LINE contacts that the bridge didn't yet create a portal for.</p>
<p>And please, <em>feel free to try out this bridge!</em> It should be serviceable for day-to-day usage now. I still won't be able to host a public instance of it for a while, though (as it is fairly hefty due to having to run Chrome), so you'll have to self-host if you want to try it.</p>

<p>Inline images sometimes wouldn't show, but now inline emotes and images should render once they are loaded! (This took me a year to figure out)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now send edits in encryted rooms again, if they are a reply to an event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No more reply fallback in the room list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At some point timed out verification requests started showing up on startup. That regression is fixed now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix rooms not showing up after login because we were off by one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix some cases where the loading spinner wouldn't stop animating and as such consistently use CPU, when a room is open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cache db transactions to reduce allocations and memory zeroing when loading a room or scrolling.</p>

There is also a possibility to log out. So this part is on the same level as in Quotient.</p>
<p>Also, a small video with the client in action.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nik:matrix.teckids.org">Nik</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the first weeks of July, <a href="https://teckids.org">Teckids e.V.</a> held their annual summer camp for kids between 9 and 15 years. This year, after we started introducing Matrix and Element as a chat platform from September 2020 onwards, the camp was heavily relying on the platform for various parts.</p>
<p>Before the camp started, we invited all 90 participants to a chat room to get together, share a bit about what they expect, already did with coding and technical stuff, talk about what food they'd like to have for the barbecue, and stuff like that. Many of them engaged in the discussion, and started exploring Element (before you ask, yes, we hat a lot of snow and party poppers üòõ!). Some got really excited that they could even change or add features to Element, or ask for such changes ‚Äì we had to promise to hold a session where we find out how to add one new animation to Element. Unfortunately, Element is developed on GitHub, so the potential young contributors are locked out by the exclusive Terms of Use there. We are trying to reach out to Element HQ to find a solution.</p>
<p>During the camp, verifying crypto sessions using emojis again made for a good party game to get to know each other (like, find the kid a nickname belongs to on the camp site, start verification, and compare emojis ‚Äì a lot of fun that we, again, did not even have to start, because someone always finds out about it and asks what it is about).</p>
<p>Now that everyone got to know Matrix for chatting, in one of our workshops, the participants discovered that not only people, but also devices can send messages, and react to replies ‚Äì in that workshop, the kids built a chat-ops IoT door beel (for their tent on site, or room at home). They soldered a circuit board to fit an ESP (MicroPython) micro controller on, and coded a small program (using templates with differing complexity levels), defining what the door bell should send when a button is pressed, on what messages to react, and the like. We produced a fun video about the project (German audio, English subtitles): https://eduvid.org/videos/watch/20a50c25-ecb4-48c0-9b13-de2548f290d4?subtitle=en . The (minimal and somewhat buggy) MicroPython client library is published as <a href="https://edugit.org/hacknfun/thema-mechatronik/mytrix">¬µtrix</a>.</p>
<p>Now, sadly, the event is over, and we slowly see (as expected, only a part of the) participants moving over to our long-term project chatrooms; we will start clearing the virtual camp site chatroom during the weekend to make room for a new group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asked about the regularity of these events, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nik:matrix.teckids.org">Nik</a> replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are still experimenting with our new camp formats. As bad as it all is, COVID caused a lot of innovation here because we were forced to leave the known roads we normally travelled, and now we are starting to integrate all that new stuff (like really embracing Matrix) into outdoor and presence events. I think we are on a really good way with it, and surely I will keep posting updates that might be of interest for the greater community.</p>

            <p>Synapse 1.38.0 is out now!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We released Synapse 1.38.1 on Thursday, July 22nd. It <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10456">mitigates</a> a client bug with Synapse 1.38.0's smaller sync responses which prevented new Element Android sessions from successfully participating in encrypted conversations. Server administrators are strongly encouraged to upgrade.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="big-integers">(Big) Integers</h2>
<p>Synapse's database schema used <code>integer</code> columns in a few places where values could potentially overflow a maximum value of 2<sup>31</sup>. One such column is <code>events.stream_ordering</code>, which surpassed 2<sup>31</sup> on matrix.org last week.</p>
<p>To prevent overflows, Synapse 1.38 will automatically convert several <code>integer</code> columns to <code>bigint</code> as a background update. While homeservers will function normally during this task, it could result in increased disk I/O for several hours or days. Note that <strong>homeservers may need several gigabytes of free space</strong> to successfully rebuild associated database indexes and complete the upgrade.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.38/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1380">upgrade notes</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="expiring-caches">Expiring Caches</h2>
<p>Synapse has a new configuration option, <code>caches.expiry_time</code>, which can be set to enable evicting items from caches if they go too long without being accessed. This helps servers reclaim memory used by large yet infrequently used caches.</p>
<h2 id="smaller-sync-responses">Smaller Sync Responses</h2>
<p>The response to <code>/sync</code> now omits optional keys when they would otherwise be empty. This can significantly reduce the size of incremental syncs, as demonstrated in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/6579">#6579</a>. Thanks to deepbluev7 for  initially submitting this in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9919">#9919</a>, which made it into this release via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10214">#10214</a>.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p>A few other items worth calling out:</p>
<ul>
<li>This release includes an experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a>, which adds initial support for complementary access / refresh tokens in line with OAuth best practices (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9450">#9450</a>).</li>
<li>Synapse now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10290">ships a script</a> to review recently registered accounts, which can be useful in cleaning up servers in the wake of malicious, automated registrations like we witnessed during last month's <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/30/security-update-synapse-1-37-1-released">spam attack</a>.</li>
<li>We've also fixed a few rough edges (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10263">#10263</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10303">#10303</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10336">#10336</a>) in the spam mitigations from 1.37.1, and would encourage you to update.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.38/admin_api/user_admin_api.html">Admin API for querying user information</a> now includes information about a user's SSO identities in its response.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just the highlights; please see the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.38/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1380">Upgrade Notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.38.0/CHANGES.md">Release Notes</a> for a complete list of changes in this release.</p>

            <p>After quite a significant gap between releases ‚Äî version 0.3.11 was released at the beginning of March ‚Äî we're happy to finally announce the release of Dendrite 0.4.0 today!</p>
<p>The full changelog for the release is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.0">available on GitHub</a>, but we wanted to take the opportunity to talk a little about some of the changes that have gone into this release.</p>
<p>Recently our release cadence for Dendrite has slowed as we have spent more time within the team working on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone">Pinecone</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/lb">Low Bandwidth Matrix</a>. These are major areas of research for us which we hope will unlock a number of new opportunities within the Matrix ecosystem, allowing us to <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/06/introducing-the-pinecone-overlay-network">build on Matrix anywhere</a> and to <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/10/low-bandwidth-matrix-an-implementation-guide">reduce the protocol-level footprint</a>. However, Dendrite has not been forgotten amidst the excitement and we will be spending more time working on Dendrite again in the coming months.</p>
<h3 id="state-storage">State storage</h3>
<p>One of the major features in v0.4.0 is that we've introduced newly-refactored state storage in the roomserver database. The goal here is to make state storage significantly more efficient by ensuring that we deduplicate state  blocks and snapshots wherever we can. By ensuring that all state blocks and snapshots are ordered strictly, and by enforcing uniqueness constraints on the hashes of the blocks/snapshots, we've been able to achieve this.</p>
<p>This was largely spurred on by watching <code>dendrite.matrix.org</code> consuming a rather alarming amount of disk space on a daily basis. In this particular instance, moving to the new state storage resulted in a 15x improvement on disk utilisation for state blocks and a further 2x improvement for state snapshot references immediately after the migration, and the growth rate of the database has slowed substantially since. </p>
<p>Ensuring that we don't waste disk space is one of the most important factors in ensuring that Dendrite operates well at any scale ‚Äî future datacentre deployments supporting many users will find storage overheads decreased and small/embedded single-user deployments (such as P2P, on mobile devices or in the browser) will fit much more effectively onto resource-constrained targets.</p>
<p>After upgrading to v0.4.0, Dendrite will run an automatic migration to update your homeserver to the new state storage format. This might take a while on larger databases so please expect some downtime. </p>
<h3 id="optimisations">Optimisations</h3>
<p>We've continued to squeeze further optimisations into the federation and state resolution code, aiming to reduce the amount of CPU burn and memory utilisation. Some of the feedback that we receive most often from those that have been experimenting with the Dendrite betas is around the sudden spikes in resource usage, especially when joined to large rooms.</p>
<p>The bulk of this resource usage comes either from attempting to reconcile missing events or running state resolution in rooms with lots of members, as potentially large state sets of events need to be brought into memory in order to do so. We've introduced some transaction-level caches for dealing with missing auth/prev events to reduce the memory pressure and we've also tweaked the caching around around <code>/get_missing_events</code> to ensure we don't duplicate any state events in memory.</p>
<p>Resource spikes aren't completely eliminated but this should smooth out CPU and memory utilisation significantly. In the case of <code>dendrite.matrix.org</code>,  which is joined to some 6500 rooms at present, memory utilisation of the Dendrite process typically sits around 1.5GB at present. </p>
<p>State Resolution v2 has also seen further optimisations in the power-level checking, which should reduce CPU usage even more.</p>
<h3 id="bridges">Bridges</h3>
<p>Thanks to Half-Shot's perseverance and contributions, we've merged a couple PRs and worked on some further fixes for getting Application Services working correctly in Dendrite. Whilst not entirely feature-complete and with a number of features still to go, enough support is now present to support basic bridging functionality.</p>
<p>We've done quite a bit of preliminary testing with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">matrix-appservice-irc</a> and have also heard a number of success stories from the community with <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>. Others may work too ‚Äî let us know what you find!</p>
<h3 id="bug-hunting">Bug-hunting</h3>
<p>A number of bugs in various places (including the roomserver, federation API and media API) which could cause Dendrite to crash have also been fixed.  Some of these have been contributed by the community in pull requests, so we extend our thanks to anyone who has submitted a fix to the project.</p>
<p>A special mention also goes to Jakob Varmose Bentzen for reporting a security issue to us around the legacy <code>/v1/register</code> endpoint, where a flaw in the legacy shared secret registration allowed malicious users to create accounts. We've since removed this legacy endpoint and the vulnerability is now fixed. </p>
<h3 id="what-s-next">What's next</h3>
<p>There are still a number of missing user-facing features which we will be working on over the coming months, as well as some architectural issues that we will look to address.</p>
<p>A notable area of work involves attempting to remove the dependency on Kafka for polylith deployments. Kafka is very resource-heavy in operation and somewhat limits us to the types of interactions that we can perform between components. It's also very difficult to manage retention correctly, in the interests of not endlessly consuming disk space here either.</p>
<p>As usual, Dendrite is still considered beta so you may not want to rely on it for production systems, although it should be stable enough to experiment with. If you find any bugs or anything that doesn't look right, please let us know:</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big(int) news! This week Matrix.org processed its 2^31st event, exceeding the range of a PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-numeric.html">integer column</a> for the first time. This caused a bit of a scramble in the aftermath of last week's spam attack, as we had a few <code>integer</code> columns in our schema which we needed to convert to <code>bigint</code>. Fortunately, we were able to complete the change sufficiently in advance (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8255">#8255</a>), and also took the opportunity to audit other columns and sequences in the database which could conceivably overflow. Synapse 1.38, due out next week, will automatically migrate homeservers when they upgrade. We run the migration as a background task, so homeservers should continue functioning as normal throughout, though they may use a bit more disk and memory, especially when rebuilding indexes for the new <code>bigint</code> column.</p>
<p>We're also starting to hone in on our team's goals for this quarter, and it's looking like our primary focus will be on improving room join speeds. Wish us luck!</p>
<p>Lastly, we're overjoyed to announce that <a href="https://github.com/reivilibre">@reivilibre</a>, a former intern on the backend team, joined Element this week! We can't wait to see where he helps us take Synapse!</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spaces work is making progress. Some rooms can now be previewed. To improve that situation, I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3266">MSC to preview specific rooms</a>. Alternatively we will try to get the previews for the few rooms you aren't joined to from the space summary API, currently we are just fetching the existing state. You can also now join previewed rooms and the design of joining invites was adapted to match it.</p>
<p>red_sky‚òÑÔ∏è went through the pain of fixing the Windows builds after we changed our http backend last week. So if you want to try it out, you can test it on Windows. We also replaced the old, boring spinner with an animated Nheko logo. If you see that a lot and think it is Nheko's fault, don't hesitate to open an issue! But in most cases it will probably be your server. Sadly no screenshot of how the spinner looks like, my server is too fast and taking a proper screenshot is too much effort because of that. ;p</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue with updating device lists in the develop version of Nheko. If you were using the nightlies, now is a good time to update! In more E2EE news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3270">symmetric megolm backup</a> fixes the issues I had with the online key backup, so looking forward to implementing that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The latest release of opsdroid is out with various fixes which can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/releases/tag/v0.23.0">the changelog</a>. The main point to note for matrix users is that older versions of matrix-nio (the matrix client library used by opsdroid) did not support the synapse change to omit <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10214">optional fields from sync</a>. Therefore if you are using our docker images you will need to update to 0.23 to get a container with the newest matrix-nio included.</p>
<p>The other change which is relevant to matrix users is that Oleg has added support for version 2 of the <a href="https://rasa.com/">Rasa NLU</a> framework, so you can once again do open source, self hosted natural language bots.</p>
