<blockquote>
<p>Some of you might have heard of it, but we're about to launch a (long overdue) update of the matrix.org website! The current one has served us well, but it grew organically as exciting projects and features were added to it. It became a little impractical to navigate and sometimes confusing.</p>
<p>The new matrix.org website, nicknamed &quot;Zola&quot; <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">after the static site generator it uses</a>, is not just a fresh coat of paint on the website: it's a complete rewrite to address three kind of people who would browse the website. Sorted by time they're willing to spend on a web page:</p>
<ul>
<li>The general public, who is not tech savvy and doesn't want to understand how things work, but who wants to get an easy onboarding</li>
<li>Community managers, who are not <em>too</em> tech savvy but are willing to spend a bit of time to understand more advanced use cases</li>
<li>Developers who want to understand how matrix works, and who want to build &amp; break things!</li>
</ul>
<p>We're in the final stages of developing the website, and <em>we need you</em> to help us making it ready! Head to <a href="https://matrix.turbo.fish/">the preview of the website</a>, use the website, and give is feedback by opening <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues">an issue on the website tracker</a>. Please make sure the issue doesn't <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Azola">already exist before opening it</a>.</p>
<p>Reporting the following is particularly helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something looks off, misplaced, is not aligned well or behaves oddly</li>
<li>Something is missing (the doc is incomplete? Some informationg is missing somewhere?)</li>
<li>There's an accessibility issue</li>
<li>Something doesn't work on your browser</li>
<li>It's not clear how to get to a particular information (you're looking for a client or a SDK, and after visiting the website you still don't know which one to use or how to get it?)</li>
</ul>
<p>We still need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish up the Bots page (which will likely be replaced by an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues/1539#issuecomment-1444180681">Integrations</a> page)</li>
<li>Flesh out the support page to highlight more of the work of the Matrix.org Foundation</li>
<li>Import the historical projects that are no longer maintained (clients, servers, bots, bridges, sdks)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to follow along, you can join the #matrix.org-website:matrix.org room.</p>
<p>Help us make the website look as neat as possible for launch!</p>

<p>Lots of MSCs moving through the process this week.

That's a really impactful, user-facing feature!</p>
<p>The other MSCs on the list, especially <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2246">MSC2246: Asynchronous media uploads</a>, bring quality-of-life improvements and unlock future functionality in Matrix. Check them out!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3189">MSC3189: Per-room/per-space profiles</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3189">MSC3189</a> proposes a concept of per-room/per-space profiles within Matrix, allowing users to have different display names and avatars across their various rooms and spaces. To do so, an optional query parameter scope is added to all profile-related endpoints. When specified, the scope defines the profile that should be used to complete that action.</p>
<p>That way you can represent yourself in a business context in one space, and a less serious context in another space. Short of profile-rooms, this would get us a fair way towards having multiple public profiles in Matrix!</p>
<p>Check out the MSC if you're interested. Reviews are always welcome!</p>

<p>üîí This week some follow-up work further improving <strong>End-to-End Encryption</strong> took place. Compatibility between Nheko and Element devices through Construct have been fixed. About two weeks ago my quality assessment of <strong>e2ee</strong> through Construct was about 30%. Last week saw <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix#construct-website">major progress</a> but we were still maxing out around 70%. This week is closer to 90%; a few UISI's are still happening in some places such as a user's first message to an encrypted room. We'll have that worked out soon enough.</p>
<p>üôã I'd like to thank Giovanni Bottaro for fixing some compatibility issues with the Dart Matrix SDK (Fluffychat) by replacing some HTTP 201 (Created) codes returned by Construct with HTTP 200's instead.</p>

<p>This handy tool bridges Meshtastic channels and Matrix rooms 1:1, and is built using matrix-nio.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Meshtastic, it's a project enabling encrypted long-distance messaging via decentralized LoRa meshnets, using affordable devices. LoRa is license-free and certification-free in most of the world, making it accessible for everyone. Radios automatically rebroadcast messages, creating a mesh network for group communication‚Äîeven from the furthest member. The Meshtastic mesh can sustain up to 80 device nodes, depending on settings.</p>
<p>Naturally, we wanted to integrate this incredible tech with Matrix.</p>
<p><strong>M&lt;&gt;M Relay's Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bidirectional message relay between Meshtastic meshnets and Matrix chat rooms, supporting multiple meshnets</li>
<li>Serial and network connections to Meshtastic devices</li>
<li>Truncation of long messages to fit within Meshtastic's payload size</li>
<li>Extended features via plugins, such as meshnet health plugin analyzing telemetry data and providing network stats</li>
<li>E2EE support is planned, but not yet implemented (we appreciate any help!)</li>
</ul>
<p>We're excited about extending our meshnets' range using existing Matrix bridges. Learn more and download the files <a href="https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay">here</a>.</p>
<p>Join our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#meshtastic-relay-1:matrix.org">#meshtastic-relay-1:matrix.org</a>  where we currently have 3 meshnets connected. If you have Meshtastic devices, we'd love help with testing, but all users are welcome.</p>

<h3 id="hookshot-4-0-0-makes-its-debut">Hookshot 4.0.0 makes its debut</h3>
<p>Greetings all; Hookshot latest release is out, along with some exciting news!</p>
<p>You may recall the TWIM post for 2.6.0 from back in January having announced <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/encryption.html">Encrypted Room Support</a>, though not without warnings of it being experimental &amp; not quite ready for prime time.  Well, the latest release changes all that: <strong>encrypted room support is much more stable now,</strong> as we've collaborated with the fine folks behind the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@matrix-org/matrix-sdk-crypto-nodejs">matrix-sdk-crypto Rust library</a> to squash some of the biggest bugs that had been plaguing Hookshot.  Encryption support even works for <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/service_bots.html">Service Bots</a>!</p>
<p>Other than enabling encryption in your Hookshot's config file, there is no migration necessary to enable these fixes, even if you've already enabled Hookshot's encryption from before this release.  Please give it a try and let us know how it goes!</p>
<p>This release also brings some useful features for RSS feeds: <strong>the ability to customize the format of feed messages</strong>, and <strong>the option to toggle posting messages for feed failures.</strong>  This provides much more control &amp; peace of mind over your feed messages, so give them a try &amp; enjoy!</p>
<p>Finally, to align with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v20-release-announce">the recent release of Node 20</a>, this latest Hookshot release <strong>adds support for Node 20, and drops support for Node 16.</strong>  The latter is due to Hookshot's policy of supporting only LTS &amp; Active releases of Node.  So, please ensure to update your Node versions if needed.</p>
<p>The release is available at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/4.0.0, or by doing <code>docker pull halfshot/matrix-hookshot:4.0.0</code>.  And as usual, feel free to direct any questions about Hookshot in our Matrix room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#hookshot:half-shot.uk">#hookshot:half-shot.uk</a></p>

<p>Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix</p>

<h3 id="major-new-1-0-0-rc1-for-the-irc-bridge">Major new 1.0.0-rc1 for the IRC bridge</h3>
<p>Friday's greetings TWIM. On June 15th, 2018 I submitted my first pull request to matrix-appservice-irc. Little did I know then, that nearly 5 years later I would now be announcing the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc1">1.0.0</a> release candidate of the IRC bridge. This release brings a major new component, which is the ability to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VKBD_6PTvs">restart the bridge <em>in place</em></a>. This allows us to effectively do noise-less restarts of our larger bridges (in nearly all cases). This should also give us quite a bit more headroom on the bridge, so performance should improve.</p>
<p>The feature is currently marked as experimental but has been tested by the bridge crew fairly extensively, so the major wrinkles should have been ironed out by now. We'd really appreciate feedback, so please <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-appservice-irc/latest/connection_pooling.html">try it out</a>.</p>
<p>We've also bumped the minimum required version of the bridge to Node 18 to slightly get ahead of the curve, as Node 16 is due to lose support later this year.</p>
<p>Notable changes for this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>IRC connections can now be run via an external process using &quot;connection pooling&quot;, allowing the bridge to be restarted without IRC connection loss. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1669">#1669</a>)</li>
<li>Bridge logging can now be hot-reloaded. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1704">#1704</a>)</li>
<li>Fix not handling thread fallbacks as replies. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1697">#1697</a>)</li>
<li>Show a helpful error for !link/!unlink admin failures, rather than &quot;Check the logs for details&quot;, in more cases. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1702">#1702</a>)</li>
<li>Fix documentation not being built and uploaded to GitHub pages on release. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1703">#1703</a>)</li>
<li>Fix linking rooms from setup widget when a <code>networkId</code> is configured. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1706">#1706</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fheese:element.io">Florian Heese</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello from the VoIP team, </p>
<p>We have shipped Element Call release 0.3.8 today -- still in beta. In order to get a data driven approach towards getting out of beta we added a bunch of telemetry to Element Call in our previous release using the Open Telemetry framework. And in the meantime we gathered together with submitted rage-shakes  (also now backed by Open Telemetry) meaningful insights which enabled us to identify and fix two major split-brain issues. You will find the full list of changes in the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-call/releases/tag/v0.3.8">release notes</a>.</p>

<p>We released another breaking change this week :p bump to v0.19.0, the main features/changes from last time include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrading to matrix api 1.6</li>
<li>Private read receipts support</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where loading archive returned a stale version. Since different sync timeouts bust through the cache, we make use of that to be able to load the new archive immediately.</li>
<li>There's also a way for clients to provide media streams when starting a call, which should make setting up calls with audio/video mute toggles much easier</li>
<li>Stopping media streams properly for calls
and several other fixes!</li>
</ul>
<p>Until next time :D</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Long time no see! A few new shiny things have landed recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trinity now supports reading the wasm commands from multiple, custom directories. Of course, all of these are watched by Trinity so any module in there will be instantaneously hot-loaded as usual.</li>
<li>Trinity has been <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bnjbvr/trinity">dockerized</a>! It's now possible to start Trinity in a Docker environment, provided <a href="https://github.com/bnjbvr/trinity#deploy-with-docker">a few environment variables and configuration options</a>. In particular, thanks to the previous change, it's also possible to hack <em>only</em> on the commands, and not have to compile the host runtime on your machine yourself.</li>
<li>We've also started experimenting with higher-level Rust traits to simplify even more the <a href="https://github.com/bnjbvr/trinity/blob/main/modules/pun/src/lib.rs#L35-L57">implementation of commands</a>. If you have any feedback about this, or opinions about developer ergonomics for implementing Matrix bots in general, come over the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#trinity:delire.party">#trinity:delire.party</a> channel and let's chat about that!</li>

<p>I'm trying to get to senses and make releases a bit more often than before - so here's libQuotient 0.7.2, with massive internal code cleanup work carried out by Volker (@vkrause:kde.org) and a few functional fixes. The release notes are at <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.7.2">the usual place</a>.</p>
<p>This is likely the last 0.7.x release of libQuotient - after discussions within the team we agreed to prioritise a release of libQuotient 0.8 to fix a few API shortcomings in the current codebase (around E2EE but not only). This means that the final Quaternion 0.0.96 is unlikely to be released for another month or so, as it will be done on libQuotient 0.8 as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on refactoring one of my older projects, <a href="https://git.pixie.town/f0x/synapse-media-proxy">synapse-media-proxy</a>, which separates the media repository from Synapse (similar to <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a>), but instead only acting as a caching proxy layer. This keeps the media in long-term storage at the homeserver (which is literally at home in my case, behind a slower residential line), but serves requests as fast as possible from a cheap VPS which keeps a minimal in-memory cache.</p>
<p>The refactor includes a lot of general cleanup/rework, but also moves the caching from in-process caches to a separate Redis database, as my previous implementation had some memory leakage. While not quite finished yet (no uploads, url previews), preliminary benchmarks for downloads and thumbnailing are very promising, way faster than both the original implementation and normal synapse. Benchmarks were done with <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a>, all against localhost on the same machine for a fair comparison.</p>

<p>An open source Matrix homeserver implementation written from scratch in ANSI C and designed to be lightweight and simple, yet functional</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jordan:bancino.net">Jordan Bancino</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Telodendria, the very-much-a-work-in-progress Matrix homeserver written in C,  has undergone some major architecture changes that make it more robust, more maintainable, and more feature-complete. Of note are these new features that came about as a result of the changes, though there are many more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TLS:</strong> We now have full TLS support for both the client and the server. Take your pick of OpenSSL or LibreSSL, or easily add support for another TLS implementation using our simple I/O API.</li>
<li><strong>Admin API:</strong> Work on the administrator API has begun. This includes implementing user privileges, and moving the program configuration to the database so it can be managed with a simple JSON API.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also done a little work on the Matrix specification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Management:</strong> Users can now change their passwords, set display names and avatars, and get information about their account.</li>
<li><strong>User Interactive Authentication (UIA):</strong> UIA is basically complete, I'm just working on wrapping up the web fallback pages. You can now use registration tokens to register for accounts on a Telodendria server as well, though as of the time of my writing this, these tokens can't be created through the Admin API quite yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost all of Client Authentication is complete and we are almost ready to move on to the core of the Matrix specification‚Äîrooms and events.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria-newsletter:bancino.net">#telodendria-newsletter:bancino.net</a> for more details, and feel free to join the discussion at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria-general:bancino.net">#telodendria-general:bancino.net</a> if you're interested in the project.</p>

<li>Add some validation to <code>instance_map</code> configuration loading</li>
<li>Delete server-side backup keys when deactivating an account</li>
<li>Fix and document untold assumption that <code>on_logged_out</code> module hooks will be called before the deletion of pushers</li>
<li>Remove the broken, unspecced registration fallback. Note that the <em>login</em> fallback is unaffected by this change.</li>

<p>üîì <strong>End-to-End Encryption</strong> is significantly more reliable in Construct this week. <strong>E2EE</strong> had always been flaky, but it was never clear before where it was going wrong.</p>
<p>‚õèÔ∏è The ice broke earlier this week when I noticed in a small corner of an Element dialogue that my <code>device_id</code> was being cut off at its <code>:</code> character. After <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/commit/15cb6bfdcaedc8e34db14affa6b56dee26c27ff5">simplifying</a> the <code>device_id</code> grammar things started to light up green again. I was then able to work through a standard list of <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/commit/0a151a3a9092dcee4eb37af85f8f217b22a62926">bugs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/commit/080748f0af172045fb0402492c945cf1595cac70">ancient</a> <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/commit/336026dde675e3266e93e98329049612dabef423">code-rot</a>, and a couple of <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/commit/1e42fa16a72ce339b14e72d2e5a7a5615d52f04f">incomplete</a> <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/commit/321ea3d6417250f2848d04397b9feffcf15e4158">endpoints</a>.</p>
<p>üîê All of this results in robust encryption sessions that survive clear-cache and reload, proper key backups without old sessions hanging around, and interactive verification without random cancellations. At the time of this writing, there is still one remaining hold-up with device verification for cross-signing so this week's <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jevolk/construct/tags">dockers</a> might not finish building until mid-Saturday.</p>
<p>üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'd like to thank Giovanni Bottaro for tracking down an issue leading one of the patches above.
üôã I'd like to thank qg for tracking down a rocksdb-related bug late last week right after TWIM. This fix has already been shipped in the latest Construct.</p>

<p>Messaging Layer Security (MLS) is an IETF standard for end-to-end encryption in messaging systems.  We've been working on adapting it to work with Matrix, and implementing a proof-of-concept in Element web.  You can view an demo of some of the early progress at https://scitech.video/w/sfMitVx1Zej4Yvvu3fAK5B, which shows creation of an MLS group and exchange of encrypted messages.  But things are progressing, and this demo is already out of date.  Keep an eye out for more demos.</p>

<p>Matrix SDK implemented in Elm. </p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bram:noordstar.me">Bram</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After having received feedback from the Matrix and Elm community on the <a href="https://chess.noordstar.me/">Chess client</a>, it is now time for the final development phase: making the SDK developer-friendly so that a version <code>v1.0.0</code> can be published.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk">Elm SDK</a> has received a large refactor, which includes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more <code>Task</code> types! Everything is now packaged in a <code>Cmd</code> type from a <code>Task Never VaultUpdate</code> type, which means that the <code>Vault</code> type handles all potential complaints for you.</li>
<li>When a <code>Cmd</code> fails and the <code>Vault</code> thinks it is wise to try again, it will sneak that one along with the next <code>Cmd</code> you're planning on giving to the API. Feedback on this behaviour is welcome, this might still change before version <code>1.0.0</code>.</li>
<li>Greatly improved documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>The current plan is to implement filters so that the SDK will be butter smooth sailing through that endless initial sync. There's still a few ambiguities left in the Matrix spec that are holding the SDK back as a pure and immutable language, but we're slowly getting there.</p>
<p>For demo purposes, here's a demonstration of how to get all named Matrix rooms from your client:</p>
<pre data-lang="elm" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-elm "><code class="language-elm" data-lang="elm"><span>rooms </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">: List String

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The concept of Linearized Matrix (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3995">MSC3995</a>) is moving forwards as a potential answer to the European Union's, Digital Markets Act. The fully-decentralised Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) model of Matrix is well-known, yet complex to implement and thus a potential blocker to gatekeepers who are looking for an interoperable messaging protocol to link their chat service to. Enter Linearized Matrix, a concept of a Matrix room that uses a linked-list to store events in a room, rather than a DAG. Crucially, while being simpler to implement, our aim is to be forward-compatible with the DAG version of Matrix, such that gatekeepers may switch over to DAG-style Matrix in the future if they so chose.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3995">MSC3995</a> for more information, and a reminder that this is all still very much in flux!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2943">MSC2943: Return an event ID for membership endpoints</a>!</p>
<p>Currently, when you send a (state) event manually via <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#put_matrixclientv3roomsroomidsendeventtypetxnid">PUT /_matrix/client/v3/rooms/{roomId}/send/{eventType}/{txnId}</a>, you'll receive an event ID in the response. While you can send membership events this way, it's often a bit nicer to use the various <code>POST /_matrix/client/v3/rooms/{roomId}/join,leave,kick</code> endpoints instead. However, these do not return an event ID in their response. For clients that don't use <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3sync"><code>/sync</code></a>, this would force them to use the former, generic endpoint in order to retrieve the event ID of the membership event.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2943">MSC2943</a> attempts to rectify that by specifying that membership-related endpoints should return an event ID, similar to the generic event send endpoint. Currently this MSC is just waiting on an implementation in a homeserver (and possible a client) in order to move forward. If you feel strongly about this change being included in the Matrix spec, why not get your hands dirty with some homeserver dev?</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org">Shay</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another week has gone by and we here at Synapse have another release for you, v1.81.0, filled with features and bugfixes. But first some announcements:</p>
<p>Synapse now attempts the versioned appservice paths before falling back to the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/application-service-api/#legacy-routes">legacy paths</a>. Usage of the legacy routes should be considered deprecated.</p>
<p>Additionally, Synapse has supported sending the application service access token via <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/application-service-api/#authorization">the <code>Authorization</code> header</a> since v1.70.0. For backwards compatibility it is <em>also</em> sent as the <code>access_token</code> query parameter. This is insecure and should be considered deprecated.</p>
<p>A future version of Synapse (v1.88.0 or later) will remove support for legacy application service routes and query parameter authorization.</p>
<p>And now the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to enable/disable registrations when in the OIDC flow.</li>
<li>Added a primitive helper script for listing worker endpoints. </li>
<li>Built Debian packages for Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar Lobster)</li>
<li>Fixed a long-standing bug preventing users from rejoining rooms after being banned and unbanned over federation. Contributed by Nico.</li>
<li>Fixed a long-standing bug where edits of non-<code>m.room.message</code> events would not be correctly bundled. </li>
<li>Fixed a bug introduced in Synapse v1.55.0 which could delay remote homeservers being able to decrypt encrypted messages sent by local users.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so much more! To read about everything in the release, take a look at the release notes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.81.0">here</a> and otherwise have a great week.</p>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You probably know about the client command-line that pops up when a message starts with <code>/</code>. Construct has its own server-side command-line when a message starts with <code>\</code>. Unlike commands sent to the <code>!control</code> room, the server-side command-line is available to all users and not just administrators. In fact, the <code>!control</code> room is quite pass√© as I find myself always using the <code>control</code> server-side command, since the results can be echoed to the room I'm in and others can see it too.</p>
<p>This week Construct's server-side command-line gained the <code>watch</code> command. This is similar to <code>watch(1)</code> in unix environments. You type <code>watch &lt;interval&gt; &lt;command&gt;</code> to repeat your command at a set interval. Previously the <code>watch</code> command was only available at the terminal <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/wiki/Useful-console-command-examples#accessing-the-console">console</a>. The <code>watch</code> command will run until you click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button, or redact the command itself.</p>

<h3 id="nheko-website">Nheko (<a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I found some time to step away from the 3d printer (damn, those things are addiciting), let me give you an update of some of the changes happening recently in Nheko!</p>
<p>A very fundamental change from LorenDB is that Nheko now renders messages it doesn't understand. For various reasons Nheko always tried to hide those from you, but LorenDB convinced me, that showing them has more benefits than downsides and also did all the changes and wrote plenty of tests, even when I was especially picky! And at the same time Nheko can now render the rainfall chat effect. üåßÔ∏è</p>
<p>Similarly I reworked how our message variant/enum type works. This made the debug build of Nheko shrink from 450MB to 350MB for me, which is quite significant, even if it probably has no visible impact on any users, since the compressed debug size as well as the stripped binary are basically the same size. (The flatpaks were at 5MB download size and still are at 5MB download size.) It does make some of our error messages nicer and allows us to implement some further improvements for devs down the line. It does mean Nheko now won't compile on GCC10 anymore though, which is included in the current debian stable release. But the next Debian release is just around the corner, so hopefully the impact from that is limited.</p>
<p>We also had a nice contribution from Sateallia: You can now order rooms alphabetically. While I never saw any use for that feature, some people can't live without it and I appreciate that someone stepped up to implement it.</p>
<p>And the last interesting change, we teaked our threads UI a bit again. Because it was easy to miss, that a message is in a thread, we added a thread indicator on the left as well. We are still experimenting if that should replace the old indicator or it should complement it, so lease give feedback if it is an improvement or not.

<li>Also the room creation flow is progressing well. User will be able to create room and DM with Element Android X.</li>
<li>Next, work will start on integrating OIDC (OpenID Connect) into Element X Android app. This will enable users to authenticate with third-party identity providers, giving them seamless access to their account. </li>
<li>In the Element Android app, the issue that was preventing some users from making video calls using Jitsi has been fixed on WebRTC. We will integrate the next Jitsi release as soon as it is available. With Jitsi back up and running, users can once again connect face-to-face with their friends and colleagues.</li>

<p>This last week the core team has been working on Linearized Matrix, which now exists in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3995">MSC form</a>. The idea is still very much in flux, but the MSC covers a large part of the backing context for the overall approach. More detail about IETF116, Linearized Matrix, and the overall mission can be found in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/03/31/this-week-in-matrix-2023-03-31#spec-updates">last week's TWIM</a>, and we're happy to answer any questions in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> on Matrix.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Spec Core Team (SCT) has been focusing on Matrix 2.0 MSCs for OIDC, VoIP, etc alongside quite a few other smaller MSCs. You can follow along with the SCT's weekly priorities in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> room on Matrix.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>Today's random proposal is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3860">MSC3860: Media Download Redirects</a>! Quite a few medium-large servers use a CDN of some kind to host media shared in rooms, and currently the usefulness of that CDN is diminished by servers not necessarily being able to tell clients that the media is actually found on another URL. This proposal formalizes HTTP 307 redirects, and the SCT is interested to hear if this will break any clients - check it out, leave some comments, and let us know :)</p>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct features a Github webhook bot built into the server as a loadable module. This is something which existed from the very first days of the project and something I've worked on intermittently. For those that don't remember shortly after reactions were released in Riot, Construct was the first to make use of them as status indicators for continuous integration by reacting with üü° and üü¢. Sometime later we were one-upped by the creativity of the folks over at #nheko whose bot sends a very baroque set of reactions for individual Gitlab jobs.</p>
<p>Last week Construct added a rather large Docker image matrix both for release consumption and to replace the the Appveyor CI. I'm sad to see Appveyor go since only a couple weeks ago they were very helpful with a support ticket of mine, but our needs now have exceeded that and I prefer to do things myself.</p>
<p>This week I'd like to present Construct's live-action continuous-integration status bar. Each box is actually a clickable hyperlink to the Github actions page, so when something turns red you can find the error.</p>
<p>If you're interested in a demonstration, I would have some screencasts but nothing I've tried yet seems to work in wayland. As always, feel free to check out <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> for a live demonstration of the real thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2 id="quaternion-0-0-96-beta">Quaternion 0.0.96 beta</h2>
<p>The first beta of Quaternion's new version has been published earlier this week, with (still work-in-progress and incomplete at the moment) E2EE support as the main highlight. The release notes can be found at <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/tree/0.0.96-beta1">the usual place at GitHub</a>. Most of the changes are actually due to using libQuotient 0.7 under the hood so it's a short read this time; but make sure to check <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.7.0#user-content-e2ee">the E2EE section in the library release notes</a> (two key things: don't use encryption if it's the only device you're logged in from, and don't expect Quaternion to decrypt historical messages). Translators are welcome to update the strings at <a href="https://app.lokalise.com/project/730769035bbc328c31e863.62506391">the usual place</a> (you only need strings tagged <code>dev</code>).</p>
<p>For this beta, both the pre-built packages at GitHub and the Flatpak (NB: you have to use the Flathub <a href="https://discourse.flathub.org/t/how-to-use-flathub-beta/2111">beta channel</a> to get it) have E2EE switched on and you <em>cannot</em> turn it off; so please don't use this version for anything serious (I know you waited for so long; it's still the first beta, okay?). The work on <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/issues/603">making E2EE opt-in on a per-account basis</a> is ongoing, and there's still a <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/projects/2#column-5799377">laundry list</a> of things to do before the final 0.0.96 is released, with a lot of quick and easy fixes - so please help with closing them off to make the release come sooner!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As by <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/help/design-guidelines#design-for-a-concrete-use-case">Elm's guidelines</a>, packages and SDK's in Elm aren't just published as they're being developed - they're published when they're finished and can be used widely.</p>
<p>For this reason, the final phase of developing <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk">the Elm SDK</a> is to test, make examples, and ask the community for feedback. For this reason, I've built <a href="https://github.com/BramvdnHeuvel/Matrix-Chess">a chess client as a demo version</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully,</p>
<ul>
<li>This shows the performance optimization of Elm to the Matrix community. The entire client fits in a 57,22kB JavaScript file, which is quite small when considering that Hydrogen's JavaScript file is 13 times as large.</li>
<li>This shows the potential of using Matrix to the Elm community as a simple back-end for the purpose of <em>&quot;and now you can do this with other Elm clients&quot;</em>.</li>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Last week we mentioned that we'd have more to share this week about an easier API for accessing rooms in Matrix, and while it was our intention to have an MSC out by now, our priorities shifted slightly after the MIMI working group session at IETF 116. Some exciting news on that front though: our proposed easier API, called Linearized Matrix (apologies to all the mathematicians), is very much in line with what the working group is thinking about. So much so that we're going through the effort of writing up Matrix as a series of proper Internet-Draft specifications.</p>
<p>We don't currently have an up-to-date document which covers Linearized Matrix completely, but the short version is it allows a server to support individual rooms being linear arrays instead of DAGs. This doesn't prevent a DAG-capable server from joining the room and speaking full-blown DAG either, which is particularly important for compatibility with the existing Matrix network. Currently our efforts on Linearized Matrix are in implementation rather than documentation, though once things are slightly more stable we'll be getting an MSC out there for everyone to review more easily. Watch this space for news.</p>
<p>Following IETF 116, we have an immense amount of work ahead of us to define Matrix as the standard for interoperable chat, but we're well on our way on getting through it all. Namely, we're going around and mapping Matrix's functionality onto MIMI's concepts, defining Matrix as a proper IETF standard along the way. The expected outcome of this for the implementation authors of Matrix is a spec that is significantly easier to follow, finally.</p>
<p>For an idea of what's ahead, here's what the SCT will be looking at over the next several months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linearized Matrix (implementation &amp; MSC)</li>
<li>Extensible Events (at least the core types) - this will serve as the basis for an interoperable messaging format in our IETF drafts</li>
<li>Decentralized MLS &amp; interoperability of crypto</li>
<li>Clarification gaps and bugs in the current spec</li>
<li>Pseudonymous user IDs and account portability</li>
<li>Almost certainly something that was missed when writing this list</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering the above list, the Matrix 2.0 objectives (sliding sync, OIDC, native VoIP conferencing, and faster room joins), and the core team's work around mentions, abuse reporting, and more, the SCT will be a bit busy. That said, if you have MSCs you think we should be looking at, let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> room. We've recently started doing our weekly planning in that room too, which should help give an idea for what the SCT is expecting to look at each week.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2966">[WIP] MSC2966: Usage of OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration in Matrix</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC provides a mechanism for implementing Dynamic Client Registration (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591">RFC 7591</a>) for OAuth 2.0 between Matrix clients and homeservers. Without this, homeserver admins would need to manually configure OAuth metadata (Redirect URIs, application names, client secrets, <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/oauth-parameters/oauth-parameters.xhtml#client-metadata">and more</a>) for every Matrix client that wanted to connect to the homeserver. Since that doesn't really scale in an environment that allows anyone to use any client they like, dynamic registration is critical! Dynamic registration allows clients to communicate this metadata to the homeserver at the login/registration step.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2966">MSC2966</a> is part of a series of MSCs that add first-class OpenID Connect (OIDC) support to Matrix. You can see an overview of the related MSCs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861">here</a>) and https://areweoidcyet.com/ for the latest progress on integrating OIDC into the Matrix spec!</p>

This aligns Synapse's implementation with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2249">MSC2249</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.75.0rc1 where the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/postgres.html#porting-from-sqlite">SQLite port_db script</a>would fail to open the SQLite database</li>
<li>Stabilized support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3966">MSC3966</a>: <code>event_property_contains</code> push condition</li>
<li>Fixed a long-standing bug in which the user directory would assume any remote membership state events represent a profile change</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been quiet for a while, but mostly because I was busy or I felt like there was nothing worth talking about. But this time I fixed a bug, that I am actually so proud of, that I need to share it!</p>
<p>I regularly ban users in my rooms temporarily, if they are behaving like an asshole and I want to show them, that such a behaviour is not accepted, even if they usually contribute useful stuff. This tactic has in general worked pretty well and led to a noticeable improvement in the conversation culture in those rooms.</p>
<p>HOWEVER one bug has plagued us for ages and made this method way more destructive, than it should be. Everytime you banned someone on a single user homeserver or even just if they were the only user in the room from that server, you couldn't unban them. That is because there is no member in the room anymore to send the unban event to, so the other server never received an unban. Now, you might think, why is that a problem, you can join the room initially as well. And that was my thought as well, but considering that this bug was transferred to Github in 2016 and several people looked at it, I thought it was just way more complicated to fix. But since I hit this a few times a year and sometimes even multiple times a month, I spent a lot of time looking at the issue on Github. And I did see a few times, that there was a Complement test for it and every server passed that test, but only Synapse got blocklisted. So it couldn't be a fundamental problem...</p>
<p>So I thought, okay, this is annoying me regularly now, I will just get my hands dirty this time and fix it. Even if it takes me weeks or months. So I set up Complement, allowed the test to run on Synapse and watched it fail. Sadly, the complement logs were so long, that I couldn't find the actual error, but a few tries (and hours of runtime) later I got useful output, searched for the error message in synapse and looked at the code. It looked more complicated than Dendrite, all of the membership transitions were in 1 function instead of different ones. But apart from that, the obvious thing that jumped out was that Synapse verified against the room state if the user was allowed to join before checking if it was in the room and then attempting a remote join. Now usually it makes sense to verify the state locally, but not if you are not in the room, so I just moved the in room check up a bit and moved the local verification behind that check, so that the local state is only used for verification, if we are in the room. And it worked! So apart from indentation changes, this was a 1 line change in Complement, a 1 line change in Sytest (to make it fail on the right error) and a 3 line change in synapse (+ 50 lines or so of indentation changes...). This bug has been bothering me for ages and that was all it took to fix!</p>
<p>Now, bugs often look easy in hindsight, so don't use this to judge the Synapse devs or anyone. I just had the right motivation and a bit of luck finding the problem quickly (and help from Synapse devs). Possibly that change broke something else deep down in Synapse and we get to deal with demons soon. But I am happy for now!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we focused on build system improvements. First, a huge thank you to Giovanni Bottaro for digging into the Ubuntu docker image
and slimming it down to nearly half its size. It's still not as compact as our Alpine image, which is the smallest of any of the Matrix
servers, but it's the one I would say is the most stable at this time. On the heels of this, I decided to overhaul the docker image matrix.
Construct now offers several dozen combination docker images from Ubuntu 22.04, 22.10, Alpine 3.16, 3.17, gcc-10, 11, 12,
clang 14, 15, and on arm64 with neon, amd64 with avx, avx2, and avx512.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While I was mostly spelunking in CI land, some people did some really cool stuff!</p>
<p>Dtelsing implemented screenshare support on Wayland. This requires a proper pipewire + xdg-desktop-portal ScreenCast interface setup, but it means Nheko will properly ask your OS for a screenshare and your OS then gets to decide, what screen or window you are allowed to share. Especially considering how little documentation there is for this, I am pretty impressed how quickly they got this working and it seems to work quite nicely on the platforms I have tested, but feel free to test it yourself and report issues you find!</p>
<p>LorenDB tweaked the design of our switches, because they bothered him. Now, I have no eye for that, so I can't tell you what changed, but I assume people who can tell if something is pretty will be happy! Ryandesign also fixed the macOS build on case sensitive filesystems, a pseudonymous contributor added querying your own status message to the dbus interface and Nheko now linkifies improperly encoded matrix.to links again.</p>
<p>I think that is all, thank you all for the cool contributions!</p>

            <p>Today we are issuing security releases of matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk to
patch a pair of High severity vulnerabilities
(<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2023-28427">CVE-2023-28427</a>
/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-mwq8-fjpf-c2gr">GHSA-mwq8-fjpf-c2gr</a>
for matrix-js-sdk and
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2023-28103">CVE-2023-28103</a>
/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-6g43-88cp-w5gv">GHSA-6g43-88cp-w5gv</a>
for matrix-react-sdk).</p>
<p>Affected clients include those which depend on the affected libraries, such as
Element Web/Desktop and Cinny. Releases of the affected clients should follow
shortly. We advise users of those clients to upgrade at their earliest
convenience.</p>
<p>The issues involve prototype pollution via events containing special strings in
key locations, which can temporarily disrupt normal functioning of
matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk, potentially impacting the consumer's
ability to process data safely.</p>
<p>Although we have only demonstrated a denial-of-service-style impact, we cannot
completely rule out the possibility of a more severe impact due to the
relatively extensive attack surface. We have therefore classified this as High
severity and strongly recommend upgrading as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>We found these issues during a codebase audit that we had <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/08/31/security-releases-matrix-js-sdk-19-4-0-and-matrix-react-sdk-3-53-0">previously
announced</a>
in an earlier security release of matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk. The
earlier release had already addressed a set of similar vulnerabilities that
were assigned
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE%2D2022%2D36059">CVE-2022-36059</a>
/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32">GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32</a>
and

/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-2x9c-qwgf-94xr">GHSA-2x9c-qwgf-94xr</a>,
which we had initially decided not to disclose until the completion of the
audit. Now that the audit is finished, we are disclosing those previous
advisories as well.</p>

<p>The Matrix.org Foundation (mostly Travis) are beavering away preparing for the MIMI meeting at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/116/">IETF 116</a> this weekend! This is part of our continual work to contribute to a IETF standard that can be used for interoperable messaging between gatekeepers (large companies in the chat world) under the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220315IPR25504/deal-on-digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-competition-and-more-choice-for-users">EU's Digital Markets Act</a>. See <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/29/how-do-you-implement-interoperability-in-a-dma-world">our earlier blogpost</a> for more context on this topic.</p>
<p>In terms of our previous proposals on this subject; it turns out that implementing full-scale DAGs is a bit difficult, particularly when aiming to achieve interoperability on a short timeline. So we've been working on building an API surface for Matrix which makes rooms easier to access/implement in chat settings. We unfortunately don't have much to share today, but keep an eye on next week's TWIM for details üëÄ</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3480">MSC3480: Make device names private</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC proposes hiding device names from <em>any</em> other user, while still allowing your own devices to see the names of the others.</p>
<p>You may question why device names being shown to other users was considered a good idea at all in Matrix. Initially these being public was really useful for verifying the devices of other users! Back in the days before <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#cross-signing">cross-signing</a> (where you only need to verify another user once), you had to verify every one of your friend's devices from every one of your own devices. It was an n * m problem, whereas if you had 4 devices, and your friend had 5, you'd need to do 20 verifications! And 4 more if your friend got a new phone!</p>
<p>So having device names back then were handy, but today any justification is moot and they're just a metadata leak. So we should get rid of them!</p>
<p>This MSC is blocked on a proven implementation. I actually <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/anoa/msc3480">wrote one up</a> for Synapse a little while ago, and I plan to polish and merge it soon. Anyone else is free to do so in the meantime as well (just let me know first if you plan to do so in Synapse :).</p>
<p>Here's to improved privacy by default in Matrix!</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix a bug introduced in Synapse 1.75.0rc1 where the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/postgres.html#porting-from-sqlite">SQLite port_db script</a><br />
would fail to open the SQLite database</li>
<li>Fix a long-standing bug in which the user directory would assume any remote membership state events represent a profile change.</li>
<li>Mirror images to the GitHub Container Registry (<code>ghcr.io/matrix-org/synapse</code>)</li>
<li>Allow loading <code>/register/available</code> endpoint on workers</li>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week Construct introduced Peristalith Mode in an effort to fill the void left by last week's unfortunate demise of Dendrite's Polylith mode. Peristalith allows multiple instances of Construct to scale together in a hub-and-spoke configuration. This is a single-writer/multiple-reader strategy which uses the filesystem to share data between instances. In the long run, we're still working on Construct Cluster which is a homogeneous multiple-reader/multiple-writer design using Matrix itself for communication. For now, this is an improvement over simply not having any solution in case your deployment really needs to shed some load quickly. I'd like to thank Yan Minari for coming up with some Traefik configs for this and we're going to be spending the weekend playing around with it.</p>

<h3 id="nheko-website">Nheko (<a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0xDEADCADE fixed a few dialog windows, that would get a width of 0 on some window managers. Meanwhile tastytea made the scroll down button automatically refocus the message input.</p>
<p>The other work (apart from some cool work in progress stuff, was mostly minor improvements to communities. LcsTen made unjoinable and unpreviewable rooms in a community now hidden by default. This matches what the /hierarchy API does and as such what other clients show and since you have no way to fix it, why bother you with it? Admins of a community can still see those rooms and are suggested to remove them, since nobody will be able to join them. While the upsides generally outweigh them, there are a few downsides to this approach. Some users will never see some rooms in a community now and will have no way of telling you about the room not being joinable. Note that this only affects rooms added using a m.space.child event. The correct way to add a hidden room to a community, is by only setting a parent in that room. But many clients don't do that or rooms just naturally become unjoinable because of membership changes.</p>
<p>The last one is now properly handled in Nheko. Nheko will regularly update the join information for community rooms now. Each space child or parent event usually includes some routing information to figure out, what servers are in the room. If that server list is outdated, you will not be able to join the room, because none of the servers in the list know about the room anymore. Nheko now checks every 20 minutes if any of your space relation events haven't been updated in more than a week and if that is the case (and you have space edit permissions), it verifies that the routing information would still be the same if Nheko updated it. If it isn't, Nheko will write the new routing information into the state event. This is a bit of a compromise, since you might have more member changes in 7 days and the room can still become unroutable, but this is done to prevent to frequent updates if clients come to different results for the routing information. This should improve the long term experience of communities by a lot, since you won't have them randomly break anymore.</p>
<p>I talked a lot about routing information now. The spec actually has a section for how to calculate that: https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/appendices/#routing. Nheko now implements that algorithm slightly more correctly, but we still don't implement everything. This should make room links look more reasonable and prevents some of the problems talked about in the previous section. Some parts I haven't implemented yet though. Nheko does not ignore ip address only servers (for now). And we also decided to ignore the powerlevel &gt;= 50 requirement and changed it to users that have a <code>powerlevel &gt;= max(events_default, state_default)</code>. This is done, because the spec handwaves away concerns, that rooms might have non-default powerlevels, but I am in a lot of those and it would be annoying to me.</p>
<p>I guess this was a bit of a more technical update this time, but maybe it had some interesting bits. I spent a lot of time the last weeks fixing stuff in Qt, profiling memory usage as well as code size and others are working on cool stuff as well, so stay tuned for next week. :3</p>

<p>(with a familiar bridge backing it!)</p>
<p>I am once again happy to report on our latest integrations work at Element.
<a href="https://youtu.be/HlsMMzTFZ_A">A couple of weeks ago</a> you heard from me and Justin on the new Integration manager
that we've been working away on and we're pleased to announce it's now LIVE
and has replaced our old IM, Scalar.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/20230324-im.png" alt="New integration manager screenshot" /></p>
<p>Alongside the new IM, we've replaced the old Go-NEB powered bots with their
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot</a> equivalents. This means you can now <a href="https://ems-docs.element.io/books/element-cloud-documentation/page/migrate-to-the-new-github-and-feeds-bots#If-you-have-issues">press buttons</a> to migrate yourselves off the old bots.  As an aside, all the changes we've made to hookshot to scale up for the big release are of course landing in the open source project, should you wish to spin up your own bots instead. We're hoping that the ability to now embed our all-powerful config widgets directly into the integration manager will make it easier to add new features to these already-powerful bots.</p>
<p>If you encounter any issues, please post an issue in https://github.com/vector-im/element-integration-manager/issues where we will be happy to assist!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3980">MSC3980: Dotted Field Consistency</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3979">MSC3979: Revised feature profiles</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3977">MSC3977: Matrix as a Messaging Framework (IETF/MIMI)</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1796">MSC1796: improved e2e notifications</a> (close)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accepted MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Closed MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3978">MSC3978: Deprecate room tagging</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The Spec Core Team has started to publish their weekly list of MSCs to focus on reviewing in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">Office of the Spec Core Team</a> room. The list consists of the MSCs that are ready for immediate review, and would most help advance the Matrix protocol on any given week. This used to happen internally (they started out as weekly ping by a bot, and then slowly became curated by our resident human, Travis). But the idea to publish the list both allows people to easily follow along with what they're doing on a weekly basis (much like these posts, but in real time!), as well as helps push subsequent discussion to public channels.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Travis continues to be hard at work integrating Matrix into the IETF process. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3923">MSC3923</a> - initially published in November 2022 - was proposed for FCP this week (and has nearly passed!). Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3977">MSC3977</a> was published this week and talks about how Matrix is a great fit for the goals of the IETF's MIMI working group.</p>
<p>This is all ahead of the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/116/">IETF 116</a> event which starts on March 26th. The Matrix.org Foundation will be attending remotely.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3735">MSC3735: Add device information to m.room_key.withheld message</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC proposes adding a new field, <code>from_device</code>, to <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#mroom_keywithheld"><code>m.room_key.withheld</code></a> messages. This to-device message type is used to inform devices why a megolm session was not sent to them after they requested it.</p>
<p>Devices can request megolm sessions from multiple devices at once, but upon receiving a <code>m.room_key.withheld</code> message from one of them is currently unable to tell <em>which</em> of the devices responded with that message.</p>
<p>The proposed <code>from_device</code> field should not be added to <code>m.room_key.withheld</code> messages that are sent outside of key request flows.</p>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct is inching closer toward public-registration safety for its upcoming 1.0 release. This week I'd like to thank tiix for helping me fix a bug in the registration availability checker, and @dynfox for dropping some documentation for how to launch Construct dockers with certbot.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank @qg:schildi.chat and @bgiovanni for helping me hunt down an elusive auth-rules divergence between Synapse and Construct. This bug affects Synapse users who have been kicked from a room before the summer of 2022 by an admin who runs Construct. After Synapse 1.62, those users are not able to rejoin that room -- ever. This was due to a bug which added unnecessary <code>m.room.join_rules</code> to the <code>auth_events</code> which is no longer accepted by Synapse after that version. This is now fixed on our end going forward, but fixing this retroactively is something I'll be working on over the weekend. I'd like to send my regards to Philantrop üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà who first brought this to my attention and is still trying to get back into <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> even at this very moment. Don't worry, we haven't forgotten you! üòÅ</p>
<p>Construct has over five years of battle-tested experience federating at scale from the very first days of Matrix. If you're looking for an alternative to Synapse to run on a cheap host: less than or equal to 100% CPU usage is our guarantee or your money back. I use it every day at</p>

<p>Howdy folks, another big release for you coming up. So you remember how last week Justin and Myself came onto <a href="https://youtu.be/HlsMMzTFZ_A">Matrix Live</a> to talk about the new
bridge widgets and show off how sleek and snappy they are? Well, Hookshot is <strong>also</strong> getting some updates of a similar flavor. The more observant of you may be starting to notice a pattern
of us tarting up our public integrations. Something might well be on the horizon very, very soon :)</p>
<p>In the meantime, here are the latest changes for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/3.0.0">Hookshot 3.0.0</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add support from migrating go-neb services to Hookshot (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/647">#647</a>)</li>
<li>Implement grant system to internally record all approved connections in hookshot. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/655">#655</a>)</li>
<li>Add support for logging into GitHub via OAuth from bridge widgets. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/661">#661</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>and a bunch of other changes too!</p>
<p>You'll notice we're migrating to a grant system for approving connections, which is why this is considered a breaking major release. <strong>Please check the
notes before updating</strong> and give us a quick message if you have any issues or concerns.</p>
<p>And with that, I wish you all a great weekend!</p>

<p>As predicted 3 weeks ago, Fractal 4.4.2 has been released and is available on Flathub.</p>
<p>As a reminder, there are no new features, but it makes Fractal compatible with newer versions of our dependencies. Big thanks to everyone who tested the beta version and feel free to uninstall it.</p>
<p>In another news, let's talk a bit about Fractal 5‚Ä¶</p>
<p>We have finally implemented one of the most annoying missing features: sending read receipts and updating the fully-read marker. What is doubly great about this, is that we are now only one feature away from being regression-free compared to our stable release (and a merge request is opened for the last one)!</p>
<p>This means that a beta release is around the corner, but we also have serious performance issues to resolve first. We hope that switching to the new store backend currently developed in the Matrix Rust SDK will fix some of it, but we still need to investigate properly how we can improve the situation.</p>

<p>The Elm SDK has reached an unofficial alpha version! It can be downloaded and used for testing purposes.
Now that the core has been finished, the exposed modules <code>Matrix</code>, <code>Matrix.Room</code> and <code>Matrix.RoomInvite</code> are available with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated login &amp; sync</li>
<li>Joining / leaving rooms</li>
<li>Accepting / rejecting invites</li>
<li>Receiving the latest events of a room</li>
</ul>
<p>Before publishing a version 1.0.0, I aim to implement the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated login &amp; sync for spec version <code>v1.1</code> and legacy versions <code>r.0.0.0</code> - <code>r0.6.1</code> using sync v1</li>
<li>Room membership manipulation <em>(invite, kick, ban, knock users/rooms)</em></li>
<li>A few QOL functions to explore a room's state</li>
</ul>
<p>You may expect these in the next few weeks. On to a version 1.0.0!</p>

<p>In the past two weeks, there have been a bunch of small improvements. The <a href="https://friendlylinuxplayers.org/events">events page</a> of the community website now lists upcoming events, and the event pages themselves have received some polish. As a result, links to event web pages are now included in the output of several commands. This makes it easier to see the event time in your local time and to share the event with people who are not in the Matrix room.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, improving these web pages brings us a step closer to integrating with <a href="https://gitlab.com/FriendlyLinuxPlayers/flip-matrix-bot/-/issues/23">Steam</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/FriendlyLinuxPlayers/flip-matrix-bot/-/issues/16">Mastodon</a>. I've started to investigate these further, but there isn't much to report yet.</p>
<p>Besides website-related improvements, I took some time to add unit tests for the lowest-hanging fruit parts of the code. There are more tests to be added, and further testing improvements may be possible in the future after some refactoring, but this is not a high priority for me right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Searching for people to hand over a business idea of paid bridges for Matrix users to other messengers, for free!</strong></p>
<p>I have a business idea to make a paid service for bridging Matrix (<a href="http://matrix.org/">matrix.org</a>) with other messengers using the Bridges feature (https://matrix.org/bridges/). It's like <a href="http://beeper.com/">beeper.com</a>, but which works with any MXID on any homeserver. And like <a href="http://t2bot.io/">t2bot.io</a>, but commercial one and with more bridges available. Yes, t2bot.io is a great project, but free services usually got occupied by a lot of accounts, especially by spammers, and managing all of them for free sounds not so perspective to me. But <a href="http://bridged.to/">bridged.to</a> could also provide some free services for the community.</p>
<p>For that purposes I‚Äôve bought a <a href="http://bridged.to/">bridged.to</a> domain several years ago, to make cool identifiers of bridges like <code>@telegram:bridged.to</code>, <code>@whatsapp:bridged.to</code>, etc.</p>
<p>But I still can‚Äôt find time to implement this idea at all. So, I‚Äôve decided to stop paying for this domain and want to hand over this domain and the whole idea to someone else, who has the time and energy to implement this project.</p>
<p>The idea was to make the payments flexible, per-bridge, for example, $1 per month for each bridge. So, if a user will use bridges to Telegram + FaceBook + Instagram + WhatsApp, they will pay $4 per month, if they stop using some bridges - they pay less. And give a free trial period of 2 weeks for new users, to give it a try.</p>
<p>From the technical point of view, this should look like a standard Synapse server with a custom python module that just block-unblocks sending of messages by the user‚Äôs account balance, and also can gather some usage statistics (number of bridged messages per user, etc), and bridges instances, connected via appservices. And some admin panel with UI to manage and administrate this.</p>
<p>All this sounds easy to implement, but I have a lot of tasks at my main job, so have no time to accomplish this, and have decided to hand over this idea to someone else, who might be interested in it, for free.</p>
<p>So, if you‚Äôre interested in this idea or want to know more, or even just want to grab the cool <a href="http://bridged.to/">bridged.to</a> domain for free - please feel free to contact me via Matrix - @murz:ru-matrix.org.</p>
<p>The domain annual cost is $41.98, it's on namecheap.com, expires at Mar 28, 2023.</p>

            <p>A few weeks ago we found ourselves in Brussels to participate in the second <a href="https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/dma/dma-workshops_en">stakeholder workshop for the Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">DMA</a> is new antitrust/competition regulation from Europe which came into force in November, whose objective is to make digital markets more competitive by forcing gatekeepers (i.e. large tech companies) to reconsider some of their anti-competitive or self-preferencing practices. Gatekeepers are defined as companies which have a clear position of influence in a given market (based on revenue / market cap / number of users thresholds), and ‚Äúan entrenched and durable position‚Äù. The process for designating which companies count as gatekeepers will start in May 2023.</p>
<p>The DMA touches upon different key topics, from self-preferencing behaviour to app store management practices - but most importantly includes interoperability for ‚Äúnumber-independent interpersonal communication services‚Äù (NIICS), otherwise known as chat and voice/video calling and conferencing services (social media was left out for now). </p>
<p><a href="https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/dma/dma-workshops/interoperability-workshop_en">This particular workshop</a> was focused on the latter: interoperability between messaging services, with the aim of getting the different stakeholders of the industry in the same place to discuss how the legislation could be implemented.  The whole idea is to figure out a practical way in which WhatsApp could interoperate with iMessage, Google Messages and others, creating an interoperable communication network where users are no longer locked into communication silos and pick their preferred service provider without compromising on who they can talk to. </p>
<p>About 900 people participated online, and around 80 people were present in person: the maximum the room could hold. It was particularly fun to see representatives from the whole industry turning up in person, including folks from XMPP, MIMI (the new IETF working group on messaging interoperability), MLS, us from Matrix obviously (alongside Matrix ecosystem representatives from Beeper and NeoChat!) - all together with the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (<a href="https://www.berec.europa.eu/en/berec/what-is-berec">BEREC</a>), civil society representatives (like the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (<a href="https://VZBV.de">VZBV</a>) and European Digital Rights (<a href="https://edri.org">EDRi</a>)), mobile network operators, local network agencies, and obviously some of those who are likely to be designated as gatekeepers, such as Meta, Apple and Google.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-was-discussed">So what was discussed?</h2>
<p>All of the workshop proceeds were livestreamed and archived by European Commission‚Äôs <a href="https://webcast.ec.europa.eu/dma-workshop-2023-02-27">webcasting service</a> and <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice_en#copyright-notice">released</a> under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence, so we‚Äôve taken the liberty of republishing them split up into chapters so that folks can quickly refer to the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="panel-1-introduction-to-horizontal-interoperability-between-messaging-services-goals-challenges-and-potential-solutions">Panel 1: Introduction to horizontal interoperability between messaging services: goals, challenges and potential solutions</h3>
<p>The first panel focused on setting up the scene and highlighting the challenges expected during the implementation phase, featuring <a href="https://www.soi.unitn.it/staff/simonetta-vezzoso/">Simonetta Vezzoso</a> (Professor of Economics at The University of Trento), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiaracaccinelli">Chiara Caccinelli</a> (Co-chair - Digital Markets WG at <a href="https://www.berec.europa.eu/">BEREC</a>), <a href="https://www.vzbv.de/en/policy-work/experts">Suzanne Blohm</a> (Policy officer at <a href="https://www.vzbv.de/">Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverbands (VZBV)</a>) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-penfrat">Jan Penfrat</a> (Senior Policy Advisor at <a href="https://edri.org/">EDRi</a>). There was a lot of emphasis around the risks of gatekeepers dragging their feet, or choosing the solution which makes it harder for SMEs or self-hosters to interoperate, as well as the challenge of introducing the new paradigm of interoperability for messaging without losing the usability aspect - see below for the full scope:</p>

<h3 id="panel-2-exploring-the-technical-aspects-of-interoperability-part-1-end-to-end-encryption-security-of-the-service">Panel 2: Exploring the technical aspects of interoperability (Part 1): end-to-end encryption, security of the service</h3>
<p>Then, after a quick lunch, the second panel went into the nitty gritty of how end-to-end encrypted interoperable messaging (1:1 messaging is the first milestone to be delivered, hence the focus) could actually be implemented by the gatekeepers. The panel starred <a href="https://www.roeslpa.de/">Paul R√∂sler</a> from <a href="https://fau.de/">FAU Erlangen-N√ºrnberg</a>, who gave a great overview of end-to-end encryption in general, <a href="https://alissacooper.com/">Alissa Cooper</a> from Cisco who explained the merits of open interoperable protocols, <a href="https://educatedguesswork.org/about/">Eric Rescorla</a> from Mozilla explaining the merits of standardisation, yours truly from Matrix explaining and demonstrating how one can actually use a standardised open protocol to interoperate without sacrificing privacy (effectively fleshing out our <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/29/how-do-you-implement-interoperability-in-a-dma-world">blog</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/25/interoperability-without-sacrificing-privacy-matrix-and-the-dma">posts</a> from last year) and then finally <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-hurley-24424231">Stephen Hurley</a> from Meta to explain how they are thinking about DMA obligations.</p>
<p>The panel ended up being a relatively exciting tour through the landscape of DMA practicalities, and it was a lot of fun to actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDnUJXzVn3s&amp;t=3715s">demonstrate a minimum viable prototype of client-side bridging</a> thanks to Travis‚Äôs work packaging up standalone client-side bridges for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dma-demo-app-bridge-whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dma-demo-app-bridge-googlechat">Google Chat</a> (strictly for demonstration illustrative purposes only). The slides (and demo) were sadly a bit fuzzy on the recording, but you can see our slides below and grab everyone‚Äôs presentations from the <a href="https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/document/download/c59e04bc-f96c-49d9-b161-ad9c24d82367_en?filename=20230227_dma_stakeholders_workshop_panelists_material_0.zip">European Commission website</a>:</p>
<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="/blog/img/matrix-dma-slides.pdf"></iframe>
<br/>
<p>When DMA first became headline news last year, there was a lot of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/28/23000148/eu-dma-damage-whatsapp-encryption-privacy">very vocal concern</a> that it would somehow end up undermining end-to-end encryption (despite the legislation explicitly requiring that E2EE must be preserved when interoperating). Hopefully this session demonstrated that both the European Commission and the various panellists are dead serious about achieving interoperability without sacrificing privacy - whether that‚Äôs via the brute-force approach of client-side bridges, or the more sophisticated approach of client-side bridges which bridge to client-side APIs, or by incrementally or entirely adopting a true open standard protocol like Matrix, XMPP, or whatever MIMI comes up with.</p>

<p>Finally, we launched into the third and final session of the day - a second technical panel to dig into questions of identity, usability, data privacy, consent and anti-abuse in a DMA world.  Relative to the second panel, there were more questions than answers here, as the panellists discussed whether users would need to consent or opt-in/opt-out of interoperability, and debated the various data privacy implications of DMA.  The panel starred Stephen Hurley from Meta again, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-verney">Lucas Verney</a> from <a href="https://www.peren.gouv.fr">PEReN</a>, Markus Klein from <a href="https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/">Bundesnetzagentur</a> and <a href="https://rohan.com/">Rohan Mahy</a> from <a href="https://wire.com">Wire</a> introducing the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/mimi">MIMI working group</a> at IETF.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was a fascinating opportunity to have a front-row seat at history being made, as the various key players finally got down to business on the practical implications of DMA interoperability.</p>
<p>We saw the full spectrum of options on the table, from Meta‚Äôs implications that they would simply open their existing API complete with the existing Double Ratchet Encryption, to the pragmatic approach of Matrix (‚Äúat first we‚Äôll bridge, and then the players should gradually converge on an open standard‚Äù) to the more idealistic approach of MIMI (‚Äúeveryone should natively adopt an entirely new open standard built on MLS‚Äù).  The next step is to establish a reference implementation and approach, and in the end it seems likely that the approach that works will be the one which the gatekeepers can actually practically adopt within the punchy timeframes built into the legislation:</p>

<p>You can also check out <a href="https://carlschwan.eu/2023/03/02/digital-market-act-workshop-in-brussels/">Carl Schwan‚Äôs writeup</a> (from NeoChat), as well as Eric Rescorla‚Äôs braindump on <a href="https://educatedguesswork.org/posts/dma-interop/">DMA interoperability</a> that accompanies his talk.</p>
<p>We live in interesting times, and it‚Äôs fascinating to see Matrix‚Äôs vision of interoperable communication being cemented into regulation by the EU.  Our view is that as long as the gatekeepers open their APIs and add support to model remote users in their systems, then at least the wider world can implement client-side bridges to crack the door of the gatekeepers open - and then as gatekeepers refresh their stacks and new players emerge, they‚Äôll likely implement the common protocol (if it‚Äôs fit for purpose) rather than burn time reinventing the wheel on proprietary solutions.  Meanwhile, the DMA provides welcome encouragement to ensure that open protocols like Matrix can rise to the challenge and fill the gap - whether that‚Äôs <a href="https://spec.matrix.org">independently</a> or as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ralston-mimi-matrix-framework/">part of IETF‚Äôs MIMI</a> initiative. May the best solution win!</p>

<p>Review this week from the SCT focused on the future of OIDC and logging in via a QR code (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3906">MSC3906</a>) - a feature other platforms have and one I would love immensely. Fixing notifications (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3966">MSC3966</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3873">MSC3873</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3758">MSC3758</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3952">MSC3952</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3958">MSC3958</a>) as per last week, as well as trying to finally get <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2677">MSC2677</a> (spec'ing the current state of Annotations and Reactions) into FCP.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3972">MSC3972</a>: Lexicographical strings as an ordering mechanism!</p>
<p>While there already is an MSC for a top-level ordering of Spaces in use across some client implementations today (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3230">MSC3230</a>), the algorithm recommended for clients to implement apparently has some consistency flaws, leading to edge cases. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3972">MSC3972</a> attempts to address this by providing a different algorithm that does not have these flaws. A real-world implementation of the algorithm is also available today in Kotlin at https://github.com/Dominaezzz/MatrixSort.</p>
<p>Neither of these algorithms have been merged to the spec yet, but this new MSC may finally push this conversation forwards! I recommend client developers give it a read and leave their feedback as Pull Request Review comments on the MSC.</p>

<p>An open source Matrix homeserver implementation written from scratch in ANSI C and designed to be lightweight and simple, yet functional</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jordan:bancino.net">Jordan Bancino</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey everyone, it's been a while since I've posted an update here, but I'm pleased to report that progress on <strong>Telodendria</strong> is still steady. Here's a small glimpse into what's happening with the project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>v0.2.1:</strong> The second major release of <strong>Telodendria</strong> was published earlier this week. <strong>Telodendria</strong> still isn't much yet, but the user authentication section of the client-server specification is just about complete. This means you can register for accounts, log in and get access tokens, and then log out. All the stuff that goes with that, including the static login fallback page, and user interactive authentication is in place.</li>
<li><strong>What's Next:</strong> I'm hoping to start working on the account management endpoints next. I also want to start building out an HTTP client for federation, and I want to move the configuration file into the database, so that <strong>Telodendria</strong> is configured via an admin API endpoint instead of a file. The thinking here is that this enables <strong>Telodendria</strong> to be configured at runtime, without having to restart the process to apply configuration changes.</li>
<li><strong>Help Wanted:</strong> As always, I could use your help. This is a huge project, and I am very busy so I can't dedicate as much time as I'd like to it. If you find <strong>Telodendria</strong> interesting and want it to continue, feel free to join us over in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria-general:bancino.net">#telodendria-general:bancino.net</a>, write some code and documentation, donate to the project, or any and all of the above!</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/farooqkz/chooj">chooj</a>, the Matrix client for KaiOS feature phones, has seen many changes in the last few weeks. Many bugs were fixed and many others are probably added. We now support many other events other than message events which you can view in the rooms plus an experimental image viewer to better investigate the received images. Other than that, by removing the files KaiOS doesn't use, the production bundle size is half now. A big internal change also happened and still is not finished yet. With the assist of Simon Laux, a big portion of chooj is now <a href="https://github.com/farooqkz/KaiUIng">a separate library</a> which makes maintenance easier and also lets other KaiOS apps use them. I have written my plans for chooj in <a href="https://blog.bananahackers.net/farooqkz/chooj-is-back-into-the-game">my last post</a> in the BananaHackers blog. If you like to see Matrix chat on the KaiOS feature phones, you can donate an amount to help with the development of the project. Or you can donate me a debug enabled KaiOS phone with the mentioned features.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lorendb:nheko.im">LorenDB</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've had some fun and useful things happening in the past two weeks!</p>
<ul>
<li>red_sky (nheko.im) worked on automating the release process to automatically create a release when a tag is pushed. This might not sound like much, but it makes life easier for maintainers who would otherwise have to waste time manually creating releases. After all, why would you want to write release notes when you could be writing code?</li>
<li>Nico tweaked styling for HTML tables to increase the padding. Thanks to Cadair for the suggestion!</li>
<li>Nico also fixed a bug that showed avatar changes as somebody joining a room. I seem to recall this also happening when users changed their display names, but I can't reproduce that behavior. Either way, it is nice to have this fix in place!</li>
<li>I worked on closing some of our issues, and I'm happy to report that there are fewer ways to be unpleasantly surprised by the UI. For example, if you have turned on the setting to make emoji-only messages larger, all other emojis will also get a bit of a size boost to make them easier to read.</li>
<li>On that note, I recently went through the issue list and closed a number of outdated issues that had already been fixed, because 260+ issues is obviously too many for any self-respecting project... right? ;)</li>
<li>I also overhauled nheko's behavior when you attempt to use an invalid /command. Originally, nheko would eat any invalid commands (e.g. sending <code>/foo</code> would clear the input box but would not send a message). Now, if you type <code>/foo</code>, you will see a warning informing you that you are about to send a message that says <code>/foo</code> into the chat instead of running a command <code>/foo</code>. If you choose to disregard the warnings and hit Enter, nheko will indeed send a message saying <code>/foo</code>!</li>
</ul>
<p>But that's not all: this week, mtxclient gained the ability to properly handle <code>m.room.message</code> events that have an unknown <code>msgtype</code>. With that in place, I'm working on implementing that on the nheko side. Once this work is done, you will be able to read messages that others send from Element with fireworks! Furthermore, I'm adding a bonus feature to nheko: as a proof-of-concept for fully implementing this unknown message handling, I've got a working implementation of Element's rainfall effect for those of you who like fancy effects! (All the rest of you can just turn those off in the settings, I guess.)</p>
<p>A note for our Mac users: somebody opened <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/1401">an issue</a> last week notifying us that nheko couldn't be installed on OS X 11.1. Nico has fixed this, but you will need to either wait for the next release or install one of our nightly builds (#nheko-nightlies:neko.dev).</p>

<p><em>Changes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve display of room tombstones (displayed at top and bottom of buffer, and new room ID is linked to join).</li>
<li>Use descriptive prompts in <code>ement-leave-room</code> and <code>ement-forget-room</code> commands.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fixes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Command <code>ement-view-space</code> when called from a room buffer.  (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MagicRB">Richard Bre≈æ√°k</a> for reporting.)</li>
<li>Don't call <code>display-buffer</code> when reverting room list buffer.  (Fixes <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/121">#121</a>.  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mekeor">mekeor</a> for reporting.)</li>
<li>Retry sync for network timeouts. (Accidentally broken in v0.6.) </li>

<li>A new output mode <code>minified</code> was added and the original <code>json</code> mode was improved to now produce nicely human readable json.</li>
<li>We finally have <a href="https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">a contributing documentation</a> and hope it'll make collaboration with our contributors even better.</li>

<p>Shortly after releasing <a href="https://effektio.org/whitepaper/">our whitepaper</a> end of last year, Effektio was approached by another organization, who has been building a NGO communication platform for a few years called <a href="https://acter.global">Acter</a>. Acter wanted to move away from their current centralized stack and had found Matrix.org 's Federated Model to be their preferred ideal. Very quickly within the talks that followed it became clear that both organization have the same goals and visions for the future and are perfectly matching in terms of what they already bring and what each lacks: Effektio has the technological stack, expertise and ability to build the product while Acter has existing a network of organizations, partners and even existing users, who are happy to provide feedback. Long story short, we decided to merge both into a newly funded <strong>Acter Association</strong>, which we established Jan 1st, developing the next (third) generation of the Acter Platform (&quot;A3&quot;) on top of the existing effektio tech stack. Since then a major part of our work has been merging all the admin and tech stuff, up to moving the github repo over to <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3">acterglobal/a3</a>, where you will find it from now on.</p>
<p>Next to that, we still have continued working on the product itself. Among other things we have <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/505">merged the first implementation of the Adaptive Layout in A3</a> this week, implemented the next acter object, <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/503">Pins</a>, added <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/522">Rageshake Bug Reporting</a> to the nightly builds, started out with the new <a href="https://docs.acter.global/docs/architecture/templates/">Templates</a> infrastructure and improved our quality assurance by  reactivate rust integration tests, add widget unit tests and a new cucumber desktop tests infrastructure.</p>

<p>Hello hello,</p>
<p>today is a big day for MinesTRIX because it's finally possible to test it as we are now in Flathub!
https://flathub.org/apps/details/fr.henri2h.minestrix</p>
<p>In parallel, I have been quite a lot of work in the background. And in last version (v1.6.5), we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switched to Material3 and redesigned the app navigation. Removed black theme for more simplicity.</li>
<li>It is now possible to set permissions (room visibility and powers levels) for groups and feeds.</li>
<li>Role &amp; permissions view for room settings is now more intuitive.</li>
<li>fine tuned the new feed indexing systems. Should be more stable now.</li>
<li>The settings page got some love and now display all the sessions and their status (verified or not). It is also possible to logout all 90+ days sessions.</li>
<li>new message search view for not encrypted conversations.</li>
<li>fixed notifications count for rooms</li>
<li>better experience for searching user or rooms.</li>
<li>new page to list feeds and groups</li>
<li>it is now possible to unfollow someone</li>
<li>fixed SSO login on web</li>
<li>It's now possible to switch account from home page for easier multi account usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>In master:</p>
<ul>
<li>support for video messages</li>
<li>speed up room media loading for the not encrypted rooms by requesting events directly from server</li>
<li>allow resizing the settings and chat view</li>
</ul>
