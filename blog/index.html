<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>

<li><em>No MSCs were closed/rejected this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>On the Spec Core Team (SCT), we've started converting the list of MSCs we received into a roadmap for the next 8-ish weeks. This is all to prepare for Matrix 1.8, and we're already starting to think a bit about what Matrix 1.9 looks like too. You can see what the team plans to look at <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/88">here</a> - each column is ordered in relative priority, where the top is more likely to receive attention first. Not everything is actionable at the moment, but that's the point üòÑ As we work through the next month or so, the remaining MSCs should be unblocked or near-unblocked enough to allow the SCT to make progress on them. </p>
<p>Most of the MSCs on the roadmap have a target state of acceptance (and merge, if we can make that happen), though some do have a simple task of reviewing the MSC ahead of implementation effort. We're aiming to test this process over the next few releases, where the SCT unblocks progress by providing review ahead of review actually being needed, but to do that we need to know what people plan to work on. If you have something which could do with review (not just acceptance) in the August-November window of time, let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">SCT Office</a>. </p>
<p>As always, if you have questions about a particular MSC's state or what this process actually means, let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">SCT Office</a>. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the SCT is continuing its IETF/MIMI adventures by pushing Linearized Matrix towards working group adoption. The current stages involve updating the Internet-Draft (I-D, or MSC in IETF terms) to cover the MIMI-specific bits of the room model and working on multiple implementations of the proposal. We'll be updating <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3995">the MSC</a> at a later stage to account for the DAG interop components, though how to get a DAG to work with the linear, append-only, MIMI variant is very much top of mind. You can see the current rapidly-changing I-D <a href="https://turt2live.github.io/ietf-mimi-linearized-matrix/draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned, to further adoption of Linearized Matrix within MIMI we're looking for independent implementations. &quot;Independent&quot; here means not written by the Matrix Core Team and not written by Element given the potential for conflict of interest, though the Matrix team is working on proving the I-D through <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/eigen-server">eigen-server</a> and possibly a dual-stack Synapse (watch this space). We have a line on ~2 completely independent (but undisclosed üòá) Linearized Matrix implementations already, but more is often better for these things: if you work for a messaging service provider and are interested in writing an implementation, <a href="mailto:draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix@ietf.org?subject=Mail%20regarding%20draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix">get in touch</a> with us so we can coordinate some interop testing. You don't already have to be using Matrix to write an implementation, and in fact it's probably better if you aren't already using Matrix, awkwardly. </p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>The script of fate has decided to put forward <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3060">MSC3060: Room Labels</a> this week. This is a relatively small MSC, but one which provides a ton of value to discovering rooms. The labels/topics your room covers are listed in a state event and can inform users of what to expect beyond the room name/avatar. For example, if your room has primarily NSFW/18+ content, you can disclose that in the labels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What would Friday be without TWIM? This week the backend team released Synapse v1.85.2. Notably this version fixed a regression where using TLS for HTTP replication between workers did not work and fixed a bug in the schema delta that broke upgrades for some deployments - both introduced in v1.85.0.</p>
<p>In addition, please note the security advisory that the following issues are fixed in 1.85.0 (and RCs):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-26c5-ppr8-f33p">GHSA-26c5-ppr8-f33p</a> / <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32682">CVE-2023-32682</a> ‚Äî Low Severity</li>

</ul>
<p>A discovered oEmbed or image URL can bypass the <code>url_preview_url_blacklist</code> setting potentially allowing server side request forgery or bypassing network policies. Impact is limited to IP addresses allowed by the <code>url_preview_ip_range_blacklist</code> setting (by default this only allows public IPs).</p>
<p>See the advisories for more details. If you have any questions, email <a href="mailto:security@matrix.org">security@matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a deprecation to call out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling the <code>/register</code> endpoint with an unspecced <code>user</code> property for application services is now deprecated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally a few more highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a new <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.85/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin API</a> to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.85/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#create-a-device">create a new device for a user</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/15611">#15611</a>)</li>
<li>Add Unix socket support for Redis connections.</li>
<li>Fix a long-standing bug where filters with multiple backslashes were rejected.</li>
<li>Remove the old version of the R30 (30-day retained users) phone-home metric</li>

<p>Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="matrix-appservice-irc-1-0-0-is-finally-here">Matrix-appservice-irc 1.0.0 is finally here</h3>
<p>Afternoon all! We've had a pretty hectic time here at matrix.org bridge towers. Ever since we announced the first preview of the new connection pooling
feature way back in <del>May</del> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc1">April</a>, we've been busily working away
to try and make the bridge stable. The work put into the bridge is nothing short of a total refactor to our connection logic, and thankfully it's starting to bear fruit.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/1.0.0">1.0.0</a> is now ready for the masses!</p>
<p>The major highlights of this release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>üî• IRC connections can now be run via an external process using &quot;connection pooling&quot;, allowing the bridge to be restarted without IRC connection loss.</li>
<li>This release drops support for Node 16. The minimum required version is now 18+.</li>
<li>Bridge logging / bridge info state event configuration is now fully hot-reloadable.</li>
<li>Show a helpful error for !link/!unlink admin failures, rather than &quot;Check the logs for details&quot;, in more cases.</li>
<li>Sort the list of channels in !listrooms output</li>
<li>Fixes cases where powerlevel changes may not be correctly applied upon mode change</li>
<li>Allow usernames to include more characters when using the !username command</li>
</ul>
<p>I know a lot of you will be eager to go and enable connection pooling, but please bear in mind it is still a very new feature. Please test away
and follow our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-appservice-irc/latest/connection_pooling.html">wiki instructions</a>, but be careful when running it in production!</p>
<h4 id="a-final-note-to-our-libera-chat-users">A final note to our libera.chat users</h4>
<p>Many of these changes have been incrementally deployed to our biggest deployment, the libera.chat bridge. We know that the bridge has suffered some reliability issues
recently, but we hope that the incremental changes have started to be noticed. We're now in a position where we can react to issues with the bridge, and make changes
without making so much as a whisper of noise to the IRC network. Over the coming weeks we expect to continue to do what we can to improve reliability and performance,
and overall grow the confidence in the bridge.</p>
<p>To that end, we've redesigned our support model for the bridge and we'd encourage you to take a look at our brand new tracker over at https://github.com/matrix-org/libera-chat.</p>
<p>For folks bridging to <em>other</em> networks, the old https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/ repository is still the best place to go for now.</p>

<h3 id="nheko-website">Nheko (<a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now shows you custom reactions in your recent reactions (and renders them). Sateallia also made it easier to jump to search results, which makes searching for things a lot more useful! Similarly Sateallia made the last selected space or other filter sticky, which means if you had your DMs open, Nheko will open those again after a restart. Thanks to LcsTen notifications after you have been absent for a while are reduced to a single summary notification, which should make network outages or coming back to Nheko much less annoying!</p>
<p>But the big news is probably that the Nheko master branch is now using Qt6. This means anyone brave enough to venture into the nightlies, you will get a lot of fun new bugs. This is not for the weak of heart and I can just recommend you to stay away, if you are not ready to fight those bugs yet! It however allowed us to close about 20 issues at once, so it is not like some bugs aren't squashed. But it is a big change and big changes come with noise and regressions. However it does set us up much better for the future.</p>
<p>Speaking of future, we also changed the flatpak id. The old one didn't allow us to verify our domain ownership. This will mean you might need to sign in again, once the Qt6 Nheko is out and if you had been using the flatpak. However since this is a rather major change anyway, I hope you can forgive that and we might figure out a migration path until then.</p>
<p>Now back to those bugs. They are eating my assembly machine again!!!</p>

<ul>
<li>The Room List API is making huge progress, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1953">a first version</a> has landed! This API attempts to make it easy to write clients using sliding sync by loading and subscribing to rooms in a fast, efficient and opinionated way.</li>
<li>A new high-level Notification API (<em>naming in progress</em>) <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2023">has been revealed</a>, in charge of creating a sliding sync instance focused on handling the bare minimum required to handle and decrypt push notifications.</li>
<li>And bugfixes, as usual: notably, the room name will now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2032">properly be taken into account</a> when using sliding sync.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And the recurring dose of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2011">sweet</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2033">refactorings</a> and CI <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2029">chores</a>.</li>

<p>Do you use Home Assistant? Have you tried using the default <code>matrix</code> integration and been frustrated due to its lack of maintenance, features, and compatibility with non-Synapse homeservers?</p>
<p>Well, I'm happy to announce that there's now a solution: <a href="https://github.com/PaarthShah/matrix-nio-hacs">Matrix Nio - HACS</a> is a HACS custom repository (making use of <code>matrix-nio</code>, of course!) that anyone can install onto their Home Assistant instance, immediately using their existing configurations, automations, and whatever else was set up for the default integration, with no further effort.</p>
<p>Over time, based on popular demand (and my own whims and desires for my own setup, otherwise), I'll be adding new features on top of what's already available, including e2ee, video attachments, polls, reactions, location messages, and hopefully more!</p>
<p>Suggestions are always welcome! Feel free to ask/get support on the github issues page, or in Matrix Nio - HACS!</p>

<h3 id="technicals-acteravatar-riverpods-ui-flows-matrix-sdk-update">Technicals: ActerAvatar, Riverpods, UI flows, matrix-sdk update</h3>
<p>The technical team is chugging away implementing the screens for the upcoming Alpha of Acter3, like the new <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/609">navigation bar</a>, <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/620">login flow</a> and its accompanying pages. As it will be an alpha, an Element-App-insipired <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/618">labs settings system</a> has been implemented, too, allowing users to opt-in into still experimental features while they are being developed.</p>
<p>But also under the hood a lot is changing: we are switching more and more things to <a href="https://riverpod.dev/">riverpod</a>, trying to replace GetX entirely before the alpha - most notably, the internal routing is using that already, while chat and tasks are rewritten at the moment. Secondly, we have started extracting simple UI components into reusable packages, starting with <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/acter-avatar/">ActerAvatar</a> (yet to be published) our take on showing avatars with fallback and alike. Unfortunately, our attempt to implementing a dart backend for uniffy now that async support landed, had to be put on hold and won't be in the first alpha. We are in the process of <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/631">upgrading to the latest matrix-rust-sdk to add sqlite support</a> in the alpha though.</p>
<h3 id="nightly-builds-system-status-reporting">Nightly builds, system status reporting</h3>
<p>We have also been busy on the infrastructure side of things: Our nightly builds are now available for all target platforms (Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android &amp; iOS) and the newly created nightly reporting channel https://matrix.to/#/#nightly:acter.global has a convenient link to install the latest version on mobile devices, too. (Note: Because of Apple the iOS version is only working on pre-registered devices - get in contact if you want to use that).</p>
<p>Further more, a second channel now contains updates by our infrastructure monitoring system. Join https://matrix.to/#/#status:acter.global to stay up to date on that.</p>
<h3 id="tech-ama-on-june-15th">Tech AMA on June 15th</h3>
<p>With the alpha release on the horizon, some people are still having question regarding what we are building and the tech (stack), how we are building it and how to best contribute. Thus, we are hosting our first</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Back in September 2022 we launched the very <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/27/announcing-third-room-tech-preview-1">first public technology preview</a> of <a href="https://thirdroom.io">Third Room</a> - our entirely open source, open standards-based platform for creating decentralised multiparty spatial apps and virtual worlds on top of Matrix.</p>
<p>The mission of Third Room is to ensure that a truly open and equitable platform exists for powering shared 3D environments - providing an alternative to the closed walled gardens of the bigger vendors, and generally safeguard against a repeat of the fragmented dystopia that has plagued instant messaging and VoIP systems.  In short, just as Matrix aims to be the missing secure communication layer of the open Web, Third Room aims to be the spatial collaboration layer.</p>
<p>Today, we‚Äôre incredibly excited to announce <strong>Third Room Technology Preview 2: The Creator Update</strong>.  As more and more 3D hardware enters the market, the race is on to provide tools to developers and creators so they can build on an open, vendor-agnostic platform - and in this update we‚Äôve focused on building out the <strong>scripting</strong>, <strong>editing</strong> and <strong>authoring</strong> capabilities of Third Room to provide a solid platform for building and running collaborative 3D apps of any kind. Check out the new release at <a href="https://thirdroom.io">https://thirdroom.io</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
As a reminder: the Third Room team is a tiny band formed by Robert, Nate and Ajay and operates outside of all the rest of our work on Matrix: the other 97% of our effort goes into making the core of Matrix amazing (particularly the underpinnings for Element X and the next generation of Matrix clients). However, Matrix is about more than just chat and VoIP, and Third Room provides an excellent showcase of Matrix‚Äôs abilities as a general purpose communication fabric.

<h3 id="introducing-web-scene-graph">Introducing Web Scene Graph</h3>
<div style="text-align: center">
<a href="https://thirdroom.io/docs/guides/websg/"><img src="/blog/img/2023-06-07-websg.jpg" width="480" alt="WebSG"/></a>
</div>
<p>At the heart of Third Room TP2 is <a href="https://thirdroom.io/docs/guides/websg/">Web Scene Graph (WebSG)</a> - our new API to let developers create their own spatial multiparty apps and experiences in Third Room. WebSG does to glTF what JavaScript and the DOM did to HTML - it makes it come alive. With WebSG, we‚Äôre building the first implementation of an open standard for interoperable programming of virtual worlds, with the hope of submitting it to the W3C as a general purpose building block of the Web.</p>
<p>All content in Third Room is described using the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/gltf/">glTF 2.0</a> open standard, and so to let developers write their own functionality within Third Room we needed to provide an API that lets you dive into the glTF and manipulate it - much as the DOM API lets web developers edit the HTML DOM.  For whatever reason, an open standard API doesn‚Äôt exist for manipulating glTF‚Ä¶ so we created Web Scene Graph (WebSG) to fill the void. Just like the DOM, it provides an incredibly powerful generic toolkit for manipulating 3D assets irrespective of the engine being used to render them.</p>
<p>WebSG isn‚Äôt just for manipulating scene graphs though - it also provides a whole in-world UI framework for creating 3D user interfaces in glTF; it provides an Action Bar API to let apps modify the controls available in Third Room‚Äôs overlay UI; you also get the Collision Listener API to get callbacks from the physics engine; ECS API to interact directly with the Entity Component System that tracks the world state; and Networking APIs to send and receive messages directly between clients via Matrix-negotiated WebRTC DataChannels.</p>
<p>As a quick taster - a WebSG app to pulse a light in your scene can be as simple as this:</p>
<pre data-lang="js" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-js "><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span>world.onload = () </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">=&gt; </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">const </span><span>directionalLight = world.findLightByName(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;DirectionalLight&quot;</span><span>); 
</span><span>
</span><span>    world.onupdate = (dt, time) </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">=&gt; </span><span>{
</span><span>        directionalLight.color[</span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">0</span><span>] = (</span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">Math</span><span>.sin(time) + </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">1</span><span>) / </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">2</span><span>;
</span><span>    };
</span><span>};
</span></code></pre>
<p>Third Room takes the JS and compiles it down to WASM using <a href="https://bellard.org/quickjs/">QuickJS</a>, and then executes it within a WASM sandbox - isolating it entirely from your other conversations and the rest of the Third Room. (In future, we‚Äôll look to provide quota limits to ensure scripts don‚Äôt get greedy with resources).</p>
<p>We also support a low-level C API for WebSG, letting you compile your own native code down to WASM - in C the same script looks like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="c" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-c "><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">#include </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&lt;math.h&gt;
</span><span style="color:#9b9b9b;">#include </span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;websg.h&quot;
</span><span>
</span><span>Light </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">*</span><span>directionalLight;
</span><span>
</span><span>export </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">void </span><span>websg_load() {
</span><span>    directionalLight =
</span><span>        websg_world_find_light_by_name(</span><span style="color:#d69d85;">&quot;DirectionalLight&quot;</span><span>);
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>export </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">void </span><span>websg_update(float_t dt, float_t time) {
</span><span>    websg_light_set_color_element(
</span><span>        directionalLight, </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">0</span><span>, (sin(time) + </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">1.0</span><span>) / </span><span style="color:#b5cea8;">2.0
</span><span>    );
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>But don‚Äôt worry - we‚Äôre not expecting folks to be writing C as a matter of course; the reason to provide the low-level C API is so that in future we can easily provide Rust and Zig (or more!) bindings so folks can use their favourite native language to compile optimised WASM rather than using interpreted JavaScript.  That said, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/thirdroom/blob/main/examples/procgen/c/src/procgen.c">procgen</a> is a fun C example of a procedurally generated Perlin noise blob which pulsates in response to local audio, as an idea of what you can do today if you‚Äôre willing to write some C!  There‚Äôs also a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/thirdroom/blob/main/examples/procgen/js">JS version</a> of it too.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also bundled basic Matrix widget API support alongside WebSG, so WASM scripts in Third Room can send and receive Matrix events in the underlying chatroom (as well as directly sending messages between clients over WebRTC datachannels).  For instance, one of the commercial WebSG apps which Element has written on top of Third Room is a real-time air traffic simulator, which consumes location-share beacons from the underlying Matrix room (bridged from ADS-B data sources) and procedurally renders them in 3D or AR over a map of the region in question:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2023-06-07-sfo.jpg" alt="SFO" /></p>
<p>We‚Äôve also added a native orbit viewer into Third Room, so from WebSG you can simply call <code>node.startOrbit()</code> on any node to temporarily switch into focusing on a given object (WASD to move; mousewheel to zoom; escape to exit).</p>
<p>Finally, to really show off WebSG at its best, we‚Äôve gone and written a simple game of basketball in precisely <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/thirdroom/blob/main/examples/basketball/js/basketball.js">100 lines of code</a>, and published a step-by-step tutorial (<a href="https://thirdroom.io/docs/guides/websg/basketball/part-1.html">Part 1</a> covering Interactables, <a href="https://thirdroom.io/docs/guides/websg/basketball/part-2.html">Part 2</a> covering Collisions and <a href="https://thirdroom.io/docs/guides/websg/basketball/part-3.html">Part 3</a> covering Networking) so you can follow along at home.</p>

<br/>
<p>Or if you‚Äôre impatient you can jump ahead and play with the game <a href="https://thirdroom.io/world/#basketball-court:thirdroom.io">here</a>.</p>
<p>WebSG has gone through quite a few major iterations since announcing it at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG8qJ4on00Y">FOSDEM</a>, but we‚Äôre feeling happy with the current result and have formalised this initial public release with formal API docs as well as the various tutorials.  That said, we‚Äôd love to hear feedback via <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#thirdroom-dev:matrix.org">#thirdroom-dev:matrix.org</a> - so please let us know if you‚Äôre missing anything or if there are any rough edges we haven‚Äôt spotted!</p>

<h3 id="introducing-the-in-world-editor">Introducing the In-World Editor</h3>
<p>Aside from all the WebSG API excitement, another key area in this release is the ability to visualise and manipulate the glTF scene graph in real-time via the in-world editor.  At any time while using Third Room, you can now hit the backtick key ``` and bring up an overlay showing the current scene graph of the world - and go clicking through the nodes to inspect their current state, and experiment with editing them a bit.  Currently this requires you to be an admin in the room.  For instance, you can go in and mess around with the scene‚Äôs materials via the Resources tab of the scene graph panel and the Inspector panel on the right hand side:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2023-06-07-editor-1.png" alt="Editor 1" /></p>
<p>‚Ä¶or you could go and move the geometry outright:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2023-06-07-editor-2.png" alt="Editor 2" /></p>
<p>‚Ä¶or even bring up a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/">Monaco</a> editor to directly edit the script controlling the world (if it‚Äôs JavaScript):</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2023-06-07-editor-3.png" alt="Editor 3" /></p>
<p>‚Ä¶and hit Save &amp; Run and see your changes instantly take effect:</p>
<iframe width="1280" height="751" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TWC6MpUh6KY" title="Third Room WebSG demo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br/>
<p>If it wasn‚Äôt obvious, this is Third Room‚Äôs equivalent of your browser‚Äôs developer tools: letting you jump straight into the scene and see precisely what‚Äôs going on, and directly manipulate it in real-time.</p>
<p>Now, there‚Äôs a bit remaining on this: the inspector needs to expose more UI for manipulating the scene (e.g. gizmos for picking objects in-world and translating/rotating them, etc); we need better error feedback in the inspector (or even a debugger); we can‚Äôt yet create/copy/delete nodes in the scenegraph, etc.  However, it‚Äôs already super-useful for seeing what‚Äôs going on and helping debug your WebSG scripts.</p>
<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>
<p>Another area which has seen a lot of work in this update is Third Room‚Äôs networking - i.e. how you synchronise world state between clients as efficiently and rapidly as possible, and (critically) how you make that work deterministically now that we have WebSG.</p>
<p>At the lower levels, all the networking in Third Room operates over WebRTC data channels negotiated via Matrix (aka MatrixRTC), which establish a full mesh between all the peers active in the room. (In future this will be scaled up using <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/cascaded_selective_forwarding_units/">Selective Forwarding Units</a>, but this work is still in progress).</p>
<p>However, at the higher levels, things are in flux. In the first Tech Preview of Third Room, we synchronised worlds using so-called peer-to-peer networking. In practice, this means that every client runs its own physics simulation of the world, and each client owns the objects which it creates - and each client sends updates about the state of its objects (position, rotation, etc) to the other members in the room, which overrides with the local view of their objects, with some smoothing, thus keeping everyone roughly in sync.  This worked well for early Third Room before we sprouted WebSG, but it has the problem that there is no single point of control when executing scripts - the world is not deterministic, and if every client executes the world‚Äôs script in parallel, they‚Äôd race badly as soon the script needs to handle users interacting with one another.</p>
<p>So, we‚Äôve written a new networking engine called Authoritative Networking - which picks a given client in the room to be the authoritative simulation for the room, and executes any WebSG scripts on that client in order to get consistent results across all participants in the room.  The authoritative client is picked based on the user with the highest power level - you can think of it almost as being a bot (hosted inside someone‚Äôs browser) which executes the simulation and scripts for that world.  If that user goes offline, then the baton would be picked up by another user in the scene.  (Obviously, in an ideal world we‚Äôd have a way to execute the scripts and simulations in a byzantine-fault tolerant manner, in parallel, with minimal latency, and without any centralisation‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôre focusing on walking before we can run :)</p>
<p>The current Authoritative Networking engine has some problems: we decided to synchronise simulator inputs from the scene participants to the authoritative client, rather than synchronising the physics properties of their owned objects - and this has proved difficult to script and author content around.  Therefore we‚Äôre experimenting with an alternative implementation inspired by Godot‚Äôs networking, where we synchronise object properties rather than inputs instead.</p>
<p>This means that right now networking is still somewhat up in the air: WebSG can execute on both the original p2p networking engine (but will be racy if user interactions collide), or the new authoritative engine (but interpolation is jumpy).  This doesn‚Äôt stop you from experimenting with networking in WebSG however - and local behaviour isn‚Äôt affected at all.  You can turn on Authoritative Networking in user settings under View Profile if you want to try.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre working away on sorting this out one way or another - if it was working perfectly it wouldn‚Äôt be a Tech Preview, after all ;)</p>
<h3 id="introducing-the-discover-page">Introducing the Discover page</h3>
<p>In keeping with the focus on creators in this release, we‚Äôve also added a new Discover view to Third Room, making it easier to find existing scenes and worlds.  A directory of curated content is published in a repository room (<a href="https://github.com/ajbura/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/respository-room/proposals/3948-repository-room.md">MSC3948</a>) - by default #repository-room:thirdroom.io, and then hitting the compass icon in the side menu will let you create your own worlds based on existing scenes, or indeed discover and jump into existing worlds:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2023-06-07-discover.png" alt="Discover" /></p>
<p>Meanwhile the Creator tab makes it even easier to get up and running creating new worlds. The Discover view now becomes the default view for new users, to help them onboard when they enter the app for the first time.</p>
<h3 id="webxr-support">WebXR support</h3>
<p>Finally, just one more thing‚Ä¶ Ready for your fancy new VR/AR headset, we‚Äôre happy to announce that this update of Third Room includes WebXR support - and while it‚Äôs pretty basic (no UI overlays in XR) it actually works incredibly well, at excellent frame rates even on complex scenes.  To use it, load Third Room in the browser in your headset; enable WebXR in your profile settings, and then click the WebXR button in the bottom right group of buttons to be teleported into XR mode.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs me &amp; Amandine playing with it using two Quest Pros - on the left you can see my view of her in XR taken as a screenshot from my Quest Pro, showing her interacting with the air traffic simulator (with her headset, controllers and lasers superimposed as well as the map &amp; plane data).  On the right you can see the same scene in plain old 3D Third Room, showing disembodied headset/controllers (and my controller laser pointers) given we don‚Äôt have custom avatars yet.</p>
<p>WebXR <em>should</em> work out of the box on any good VR/AR headset, without having to install any additional software or being locked into any vendor‚Äôs app store. We even expect it to work with Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro headset, based on the <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/14205/news-from-wwdc23-webkit-features-in-safari-17-beta/">Safari 17 release notes</a>. This is the whole promise of the open Web, and we hope Third Room will provide an amazing open environment to create XR apps and experiences in future.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2023-06-07-webxr.jpg" alt="WebXR" /></p>
<h3 id="what-remains">What remains?</h3>
<p>While we‚Äôve made extraordinary progress since the last release, there‚Äôs still a bunch of things remaining which is keeping Third Room as a Technology Preview.  Most important first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking
<ul>
<li>As per the Networking section above, we need to rework Authoritative Networking so we have the final networking model in place, such that WebSG scripts execute deterministically in a single place with smooth but accurate interpolation on the participating clients. We also need to iterate a bit more on the final networking API so that anyone can build multi-user apps with ease.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Persistence
<ul>
<li>While we can now edit and script scenes, the edits are only stored in the RAM of the connected clients: when all the clients from a world disconnect, the state is lost and the world resets back to its original state. Instead, we need to store the glTF changes back to the Matrix content repository on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Firefox performance
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôve seen a nasty regression in the last month or two on Firefox, where SpiderMonkey (Firefox‚Äôs JavaScript engine) starts frantically garbage-collecting, despite us allocating an extremely tiny amount of memory, killing your framerate. We haven‚Äôt figured out yet whether this is our fault or Firefox‚Äôs (if someone wants to bisect old Firefox releases over the last few months we‚Äôd be very grateful!), but for now FF performance is dire in TP2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Custom Avatars
<ul>
<li>Whilst there‚Äôs been some work on this in the community, it‚Äôs not landed yet.  There‚Äôs nothing especially hard here though (other than IK) - it‚Äôs just a matter of bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shadows
<ul>
<li>We have some cascaded shadow map experiments already, but we need to get it stable and on by default for scenes which would benefit (e.g. the basketball tutorial!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mobile web
<ul>
<li>Similarly, support for mobile web would be really nice for those dipping their toe in the water - and given the performance we‚Äôre seeing on Android-based XR headsets like the Quest, the performance on mobile web should be sensational.  Again, it‚Äôs just a matter of time to sort it out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fully-fledged editor
<ul>
<li>The current editor is effectively just an inspector; it‚Äôs great for visualising the glTF scene, but you can‚Äôt really go and start changing the fabric of reality yet. An editor isn‚Äôt an editor without some fancy 3D gizmos to help you grab and manipulate the world - so for all our in-world direct manipulation Inception dreams to come true, the devtools need a bit more work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Content!
<ul>
<li>Finally, last but not least, we need to start populating these worlds with some fun, beautiful, amazing apps and games.  The whole point of this release is to give creators the tools they need to start properly playing around, building on top of Third Room, and we really hope you‚Äôll give it a go and get involved (not least as our bandwidth to do so within the core team is sorely limited).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully the next release will be both the final tech preview and the first beta of the complete Third Room experience - but to get there, we need your feedback: please head over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#thirdroom-dev:matrix.org">#thirdroom-dev:matrix.org</a> and tell us what you think!</p>
<h3 id="funding-third-room">Funding Third Room</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôve read this far, you must surely be pretty interested in Third Room, and hopefully agree that having an open platform for building spatial apps and virtual worlds is absolutely critical for the health and future of the Internet - especially as the VR/AR/3D space slowly but surely gathers momentum as new players and hardware materialise.</p>
<p>However, funding the team to work full-time on Third Room is increasingly challenging - the macroeconomic environment does not lend itself to moonshot R&amp;D projects, and Matrix as a whole continues to suffer from <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-update-2022">insufficient financial support</a> (quite aside from Third Room).  This is particularly frustrating given the massive range of obvious commercial applications for Third Room - whether that‚Äôs for building digital twins, situational awareness, telepresence, gaming, providing an open platform to glue together real-time 3D data from other existing data feeds, etc.</p>
<p>To try to spell out the opportunities and why it clearly makes sense for commercial players to invest in supporting Third Room development, we recently put together a quick enterprise demo reel (which also serves to demo everything mentioned above, albeit in a more businessy manner than normal). <strong>If this resonates and your organisation is interested in funding Third Room - please contact <a href="mailto:funding@matrix.org">funding@matrix.org</a> asap.</strong></p>

<br/>
<p>Otherwise, we hope you enjoy the new update - and please let us know how you get on with it!</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Part of the SCT's goals with Matrix 1.8 is to pre-plan the majority of our review attention, which means we need to be told what folks are working on to plan accordingly. We'll still have some room for random/surprise MSC work, but this is expected to be harder to acquire going forward (and so should not be relied upon).</p>
<p>Please let us know if you're working on something which affects the spec! We want to hear about:</p>
<ul>
<li>things that aren't MSCs (yet)</li>
<li>things that are MSCs but aren't planned to be merged in 1.8</li>
<li>MSCs which are expected to be ready in time for Matrix 1.8 (in ~2 months)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you aren't sure if your project affects the spec, talk to us about it. We do not want to be the bottleneck in your development cycle, instead preferring to know ahead of time that something will need attention from us.</p>
<p>All we need is for you to mention your project/MSC and timeline in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> - DMs and private rooms with SCT members are not enough to get something on the roadmap. This is to ensure there is full transparency in why the SCT is looking at something, and to ensure that the MSC moves through the process in an efficient manner. If your project has a sensitive context (commercial or otherwise), then we ask that you reference that here and someone from the team will contact you to get more information, relaying as much (non-sensitive) detail as possible back to the room here.</p>
<p>Our expected outcome for this system is to not only be a more effective team, but also to give you a faster/more reasonable turnaround on MSC review (at all stages), more rapid deployment of stable features (dropping unstable prefixes), and overall fewer review iterations as the SCT can think about problems ahead of you actually needing a review. We seriously do not want to be a blocker, but we need to know what we could end up blocking by accident.</p>
<p>Starting approximately August 1st, we will be starting to plan out what Matrix 1.9's release cycle will look like. A similar call to action will be raised at that point. Note that Matrix 1.8 is set to be released in late August, meaning we're aiming to have Matrix 1.9 thought out before Matrix 1.8 is released, which is a deliberately accelerated timeline than the current Matrix 1.8 release cycle planning.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions about this, please let us know in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3869">MSC3869: Read event relations with the Widget API</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC would allow Matrix Widgets, knowing an event ID, to request any and all other events that relate to it. Thus, if you had a <code>m.room.message</code> event, you could ask the client whether any edits have been made to that event, via asking for <code>m.room.message</code> events with <code>m.replace</code> relations.</p>
<p>This would be useful for Widgets to traverse any data structure that used relations to tie together events - which could model all sorts of use cases!</p>
<p>As always, leave your feedback on the MSC if this is something you're interested in or want to push forwards :)</p>

<p>We released version 1.7 of the Matrix Spec on Thursday.  This release features media repository improvements and reactions.  Thank you to all who contributed to this release, whether through writing or reviewing MSCs, writing spec PRs, or finding spec bugs.  And congratulations to those who had their first MSC make it to the release.  Read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/05/25/matrix-v-1-7-release">blog post</a> for the full details.</p>
<p>We're in the process of working out what Matrix 1.8 looks like and need to hear what people are working on. If you have an MSC or idea you're planning on looking at in the next 2 months, let us know in #sct-office:matrix.org so we can prioritize it accordingly.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happy Friday, everyone. This week we disclosed three security advisories for Synapse. The TL;DR is that you should upgrade to at least Synapse 1.74.0 or newer. Please see <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/05/24/disclosing-synapse-security-advisories">the Matrix.org blogpost</a> for links to the advisories.</p>
<p>Also of note is the release of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.84.0">Synapse 1.84.0</a> this Tuesday. New in this release is</p>
<ul>
<li>an option to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/15197">prevent downloading media from specified domains</a>;</li>
<li>a new set of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/15312">redis TLS configuration options</a> (Roel ter Maat); and</li>
<li>addition support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4009">new</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2659">stabilised</a> MSCs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside this are a batch of bugfixes and internal improvements. We are aware of one regression in v1.84.0‚Äîexpect a minor release with a fix to that sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>We've also begun an effort to profile and improve the performance of the <code>/messages</code> endpoint. That should benefit everyone, but in particular we hope to improve the UX of the <a href="https://archive.matrix.org/">Matrix Public Archive</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you as ever to our contributors, testers, and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">community of server operators</a>.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey, it's been a while. Which means we were busy, just not with developing Nheko! However, we did do some stuff now:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sticker and emoji pickers now have sections and include both normal emojis and custom emojis in the emoji picker. This means your search results are also sectioned and you don't need to use ~ for custom emoji anymore. You can also now edit your custom emoji right from the picker (or rather open the settings menu from there). This should make going crazy with custom emoji much easier and I hope you have fun with it!</li>
<li>LorenDB also finally fixed that pressing a key would focus the input bar but eat the first key. This was pretty annoying, but it should now behave much nicer!</li>
<li>Sateallia meanwhile fixed a similar bug with the focus in the search menu on some platforms, implemented selecting multiple files to upload in the filepicker (before you only could drop a group of files into Nheko at once).</li>
<li>You can now copy images from the image viewer to the clipboard.</li>
<li>And lastly your rooms in the search are now ordered by recency of the last message. This should make rooms with the same name have always the right room appear on top. Additionally upgraded rooms are now in italics, which should make it still possible to jump to them, but also distinguish them in the search.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a nice day and try custom stickers and emojis some time!

<p>Here's what's happened in NeoChat in the last weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>I (Tobias) implemented support for sending stickers, based on MSC2545. You can now send them from the emoji picker, which has also been improved visually.</li>
<li>I also implemented support for editing your account's stickers in NeoChat's settings. Other parts of the MSC (room stickers, etc.) are coming soon.</li>
<li>James improved read markers and state changed, limiting the number of the that are shown at the same time.</li>
<li>Aleix and I improved the notifications by grouping multiple messages from the same room into a single notification.</li>
<li>James added caching for the last event in a room, meaning that on startup, NeoChat will now sort all rooms in a correct order.</li>
<li>We fixed a bug where the user/room/emoji completion menu randomly did not open.</li>
<li>James finished documenting all of NeoChat's codebase.</li>
<li>I improved NeoChat's space support by replacing the existing space view with a new sidebar in style similar to many other clients.</li>
<li>I also improved logging, which will hopefully help us debug many problems, especially around encryption issues. In the future, if you notice such problems, make a copy of <code>~/.local/share/KDE/neochat.log</code> (on Linux; for other platforms, talk to us to figure out where the log file is) and possible also <code>neochat.log.old</code> immediately, to help with debugging.</li>
<li>Rooms with only two users (i.e., DMs) will now show a more useful sidebar, omitting irrelevant details like the normal room member list.</li>
<li>James also improved NeoChat's developer tools, now showing more useful information.</li>

<p>This week, new projects have started!</p>
<ul>
<li>A new crate has been created, <code>matrix-sdk-ui</code>, which is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1931">the new home for the UI API</a> the Matrix SDK provides, like <code>Timeline</code>, and <code>RoomList</code>. Developing this kind of UI API inside the Matrix SDK instead of the client side (e.g. ElementX iOS or Android or even Gnome Fractal) means it improves testability and quality greatly, as we can tweak the network layer more easily, and in depth. It also means that it boosts the productivity of developers that create new Matrix clients: no need to deal with synchronisation, room presentation, timeline, pagination etc., everything is managed automatically.
<ul>
<li><code>RoomList</code> is a layer on top of <code>SlidingSync</code>. The work has started, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1911">the progress can be tracked in this meta issue</a>. To make it real, some improvements were necessary on the <code>SlidingSync</code> side, esp. being able <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1942">to change the sync-mode of an existing <code>SlidingSyncList</code></a>, which led to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1955">a nice revamping of the ranges API</a>. We are not mentioning many small clean ups (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1950">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1947">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1919">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1963">4</a> and so on).</li>
<li>Work has started to support <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1948">Sliding Sync sticky parameters properly</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1975">Ruma has been upgraded</a>, notably to support the latest Matrix 1.7 features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the Crypto land:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1970">User/device pairs who have invalid one-time keys are now timed out</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1939"><code>VerificationRequest</code> has a new state when a request transitions</a>. <code>VerificationRequest</code> is used to control the flow of the verification but only up to a certain point. Once different specific verification flows are handled (i.e. SAS or QR Code), the <code>VerificationRequest</code> object creates a child object of the <code>Verification</code> type. The idea behind this patch is to add a new <code>VerificationRequestState</code> variant called <code>Transitioned</code> which holds the child verification object as associated data. This makes it much simpler to go through the whole verification flow by allowing users to just listen to the <code>VerificationRequest::changes()</code> method,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/281">The return of OTK fetching failures</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1944">Replace the <code>libolm</code> backup encryption code with a native Rust version</a>, which allow Wasm targets to use the <code>backups_v1</code> feature of <code>matrix-sdk-crypto</code>,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1945">Disable automatic-key-forwarding for the <code>matrix-sdk-ffi</code> bindings</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1974">Better logs</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the Notification land, we need two sync loops instead of one (that controls them all), everything is described in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1928">The Two Sync Loops</a>, with sub-issues <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1961">1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1962">2</a>,</li>
<li>In the Media land, we are starting to support <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1968">media uploading progress</a>,</li>
<li>In the Bindings land:
<ul>
<li>We are starting to deploy <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1661">UniFFI async support</a>, which was partly reverted for particular cases, but it works in general,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1954">Stop unconditionally enabling <code>native-tls</code> from <code>matrix-sdk-ffi</code></a>, which led to compilation issue on Android architectures.</li>

            <p>Hey all,</p>
<p><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.7/">Matrix 1.7</a> has just been released! The last spec release was <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/02/14/matrix-v-1-6-release">about 3 months ago</a>, keeping us on track for regular quarterly releases. Unlike Matrix 1.6 though, today‚Äôs release is packed with plenty of features, some of which we‚Äôd like to call out here. Not all implementations will have support for these features yet though, and that‚Äôs okay (expected, even).</p>
<p>Adding support for a spec release can be a significant body of work. Instead of implementations having everything ready for spec release day, the idea is that they gain support over the next few months. If you‚Äôre able, please help those projects get v1.7‚Äôs features.</p>
<p>Today, we see 15 MSCs achieve their formally adopted status. All of them bring forward some much-needed features to Matrix, and a few highlights are below. Read on to the full changelog for a complete overview, and for a sneak peak at what the Spec Core Team (SCT) is planning to look at for v1.8 üëÄ</p>
<h2 id="finally-improvements-to-media-in-matrix">üñºÔ∏è Finally, improvements to media in Matrix</h2>
<p>The media repo has been largely unchanged since it was first released in 2015 as <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/historical/r0.0.0/client_server.html#id25">r0.0.0</a> - the only change being the addition of URL previews in <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/historical/client_server/r0.3.0.html#id67">r0.3.0</a> (released in 2017). Thankfully, the folks over at <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> have been busy changing this situation!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3860">MSC3860</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2246">MSC2246</a> are both available as of today in the spec, improving how much bandwidth media repos need to offer and fixing a long-standing issue where uploading large files can be a challenge. MSC3860, specified <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.7/client-server-api/#get_matrixmediav3downloadservernamemediaid">here</a> as <code>allow_redirect</code>, allows clients to opt-in to HTTP redirects on downloads, avoiding slowdowns from the server having to proxy and move the media twice. It‚Äôs particularly useful if your server uses a CDN like S3 to host media - just tell clients to go grab media directly from S3 instead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, MSC2246 (largely specified <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.7/client-server-api/#post_matrixmediav1create">here</a>) gives clients an ability to upload their media after sending the associated event. The MSC was originally designed with bridges in mind, where message order and delays are very perceivable problems for users, however clients like Element X are thinking about using the feature to improve local echo on uploads as well. We‚Äôre excited to see uploads finally be reliable, and non-blocking for the conversation flow!</p>
<p>History would indicate that we‚Äôve got several years to go before the next major improvement to media, but we‚Äôre looking to change that: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3916">MSC3916: Authentication for media</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4016">MSC4016: Streaming E2EE file transfers</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3870">MSC3870: Upload direct to URL</a> are all fairly promising MSCs we‚Äôre planning to take a look at in the next year or so.</p>
<h2 id="sparkling-heart-reactions-are-here">üíñ Reactions are here</h2>
<p>Reactions have actually been in use for quite some time already, but the MSC struggled to make it into the spec formally. With Matrix 1.7 though, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2677">MSC2677</a> is <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.7/client-server-api/#event-annotations-and-reactions">merged</a>.</p>
<p>MSC2677 was the last part of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1849">MSC1849</a> saga, with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> (relationships) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (server-side aggregation) landing in Matrix 1.3, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676</a> (edits) landing in Matrix 1.4 back in September 2022. There‚Äôs still some work to be done in this area though, and certainly some quality of life improvements asking to be written up as MSCs - watch this space for progress on those fronts.</p>
<h2 id="tada-achievement-first-msc-merged">üéâ Achievement: First MSC merged</h2>
<p>One of the best parts about writing an MSC is eventually seeing it released in the spec, and these folks saw their MSCs reach this milestone for the first time. Congratulations everyone, and please keep them coming!</p>

If you have an idea (or bugfix), check out the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals#matrix-specification-proposals">guidelines</a> and let us know if you run into any questions in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> on Matrix - we‚Äôre always happy to help.</p>
<h2 id="soon-early-considerations-for-matrix-1-8">üîú Early considerations for Matrix 1.8</h2>
<p>The SCT aims to cut a release in the middle of each calendar quarter, largely to avoid most conflicts with regional holidays, and since Matrix 1.1 the releases have been getting less and less organic. Instead of looking at MSCs whenever they‚Äôre raised, the SCT has been aiming to hear about which MSCs will need looking at. This is a very subtle difference, but one that dramatically changes how the quarterly releases are structured.</p>
<p>With each spec release, the SCT has slowly been working towards a place where the majority of MSC work is thought about in advance, and Matrix 1.8 is another milestone along this journey. Over the next couple weeks we‚Äôll be working on a roadmap based on the MSCs that are raised to us in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">SCT Office room</a> on Matrix, starting with the ideas we raised ourselves earlier in the year.</p>
<p>As of writing, our current plan for Matrix 1.8 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Further work on adopting OIDC (namely progress on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3824">MSC3824</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2965">MSC2965</a>, and other similar proposals).</li>
<li>Pushing the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3995">MSC3995</a> suite of MSCs towards acceptance/merge status.</li>
<li>Continuing the improvements of VoIP (MatrixRTC) as we work towards <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/matrix20/">Matrix 2.0</a>.</li>
<li>Various improvements to event relationships, such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3981">MSC3981</a>, and push in general, such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3958">MSC3958</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3391">MSC3391</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While this doesn‚Äôt represent a commitment to have these MSCs merged, these are the areas that the SCT is likely to be thinking about for the next 3ish months. If you have MSCs that might be possible to merge before roughly August, let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">SCT Office room</a> (even if those MSCs aren‚Äôt on-theme with the above - we still want to hear about them!).</p>
<p>Critically, our release planning does not just include MSCs that are on track for being merged. We are also aiming to track that a given MSC needs technical review (for example), or that it might be receiving attention external to the SCT (such as implementation). We‚Äôd love to hear what you‚Äôre working on so we can start bringing those MSCs to the top of the list - let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">SCT Office room</a>.</p>
<p>As is the theme for this section, if you have any questions about what the release process looks like (or where a given MSC currently sits in the roadmap), let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">SCT Office room</a>.</p>

            <p>Today we are retroactively publishing advisories for security bugs in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">Synapse</a>. From oldest to most recent, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-p9qp-c452-f9r7">GHSA-p9qp-c452-f9r7</a> (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2022-39374">CVE-2022-39374</a>), fixed in Synapse 1.68.0 and affecting all prior versions since Synapse 1.62.0;</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-f3wc-3vxv-xmvr">GHSA-f3wc-3vxv-xmvr</a> (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2023-32323">CVE-2023-32323</a>), fixed in Synapse 1.74.0 and affecting all prior versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly advise Synapse operators who are still on earlier Synapse versions to upgrade to the latest version (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.84.0">v1.84.0</a>) or at the very least v1.74.0 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.74.0">released Dec 2022</a>), to prevent attacks based on these vulnerabilities. Please see the advisories for the full details, including a description of</p>
<ul>
<li>the vulnerability and potential attacks,</li>
<li>exactly which deployments are vulnerable, and</li>
<li>workarounds and mitigations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because these bugs are either related to or exploitable over Matrix federation, we have delayed publishing these advisories until now out of caution. This allowed us to ensure that the majority of Synapse homeservers across the public federation have upgraded to a sufficiently patched version, based on the (opt-in) <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/monitoring/reporting_homeserver_usage_statistics.html">stats reporting</a> to the Matrix.org foundation.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this announcement or any of the advisories, e-mail us at <a href="mailto:security@matrix.org">security@matrix.org</a>.</p>

<p>Matrix v1.7 has been given a release date of <strong>May 25th</strong>, right before the next TWIM! Expect a matrix.org blog post with all the details on the day.</p>
<p>Leading up to the release we've seen a number of great spec PRs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+">appearing and being merged</a>! Thank you to everyone for writing them (saving the SCT some time!) and to other reviewing on commenting. It's a huge help and the spec feels like it's chugging along at a blistering pace!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2213">MSC2213: Rejoinability of private/invite-only rooms</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC adds the ability for users who have previously joined a room to rejoin again. Typically this isn't desired in a public room setting, but it does specifically make sense in the case of a DM that you've left and want to return to without the other user needing to invite you. This case has specific implications for cases where there could be only ever one room between two users. Being able to rejoin it if the other user has disappeared is key!</p>
<p>Outside of the DM use case, this functionality can mostly already be achieved by using <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms">restricted rooms</a>, where users of a given space/another room can always join your room. However, it would be nice to have the flexibility of allowing certain users to rejoin a room without needing another room to serve as proof of membership.</p>
<p>Is this something you're interested in? Do you have additional use cases? Feel free to check out the MSC and comment with your thoughts!</p>

<p>Fractal 5.beta1 is out!</p>
<p>Fractal 5.beta1 is the first beta release since the rewrite of Fractal to take advantage of GTK 4 and the Matrix Rust SDK. It is the result of over two years of work.</p>
<p>New features since Fractal 5.alpha1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joining room by ID, by alias or with a Matrix URI</li>
<li>Creation of direct chats</li>
<li>Sending and displaying read receipts, read markers and typing notifications</li>
<li>Notifications on new messages</li>
<li>Highlight messages with mentions</li>
<li>Added media file history viewers in the room details, thanks to our GSoC intern Marco Melorio</li>
<li>Displaying the other user's avatar as a room avatar for direct chats</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are a also a lot of less visible changes, fixes and translations thanks to all our contributors, and our upstream projects.</p>
<p>As the version implies, this is still considered beta stage and might trigger crashes or other bugs but overall should be pretty stable. It is available to install via Flathub Beta, see the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal#beta-version">instructions in our README</a>.</p>
<p><em>The GNOME 44 runtime used by the beta version Flatpak was shipped with a GTK version that has a regression which messes with room order in the sidebar: some rooms can appear twice and some rooms are missing. This is a known issue so there is no need to report it, there is nothing for us to do but wait until the fix is backported and shipped in an update of the GNOME runtime. In the meantime, the nightly version is unaffected by that.</em></p>
<p>A list of blocking issues for the release of version 5 can be found in the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/milestones/18">Fractal 5 milestone</a> on GitLab. All contributions are welcome !

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el">Ement.el</a>, a Matrix client for the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> Lisp machine and text editor, has been released at <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/releases/tag/v0.9">version 0.9</a>.  Changes since the last release include:</p>
<p><em>Additions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Option <code>ement-room-timestamp-header-align</code> controls how timestamp headers are aligned in room buffers.</li>
<li>Option <code>ement-room-view-hook</code> runs functions when <code>ement-room-view</code> is called.  (By default, it refreshes the room list buffer.)</li>
<li>In the room list, middle-clicking a room which has a buffer closes its buffer.</li>
<li>Basic support for video events.  (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/viiru-">Arto Jantunen</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Changes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Using new option <code>ement-room-timestamp-header-align</code>, timestamp headers default to right-aligned.  (With default settings, this keeps them near message timestamps and makes for a cleaner appearance.)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fixes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Recognition of certain MXID or displayname forms in outgoing messages when linkifying (aka &quot;pilling&quot;) them.</li>
<li>Unreadable room avatar images no longer cause errors.  (Fixes <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/147">#147</a>.  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jgarte">@jgarte</a> for reporting.)</li>
<li>Don't error in ~ement-room-list~ when no rooms are joined.  (Fixes <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/123">#123</a>.  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Kabouik">@Kabouik</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oantolin">Omar Antol√≠n Camarena</a> for reporting.)</li>

<p>Sometimes, development isn't about writing code, it's about looking ahead and planning!
In the past three weeks, I've tried to figure out how filters work combined with endpoints like <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3sync"><code>/sync</code></a>, <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3roomsroomidmessages"><code>/messages</code></a> and <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3roomsroomidcontexteventid"><code>/context</code></a> - and it turns out I couldn't find any straight answers!</p>
<p>So I wrote <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk/blob/main/development/issues/Filters.md">a whitepaper</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk/tree/main">Elm SDK repository</a> on the inconsistencies and where the spec is unclear (to me, at least). I hope you're willing to look into it as I might open up an MSC soon where I request to be more specific about filters and the endpoints.</p>

<p>I've developed a rudimentary Matrix-Library for Scala for akka, for distributed async systems.
The underlying code is actually automatically generated from the specification, with strong typing, automatic JSON (de-) serializiation and a rudimentary client provided.
It features the entirety of the client-server API. This is achieved via a custom code-generator.
This library provides <em>just enough</em> stuff to easily build a fully fletched client.
A more high-level client is in development right now. Encryption will be hard, but will hopefully be implemented via JNI in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>This is part of Germany's effort to move hospitals messaging systems to the Matrix protocol.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@eric:beeper.com">Eric Migicovsky</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I announced a little side project yesterday: Beepberry - a portable e-paper computer for hackers, designed for chatting on Beeper (universal messaging app built on top of Matrix). My day job is running <a href="https://beeper.com/">Beeper</a>, but I will always have a soft spot for building hardware (I was the founder of Pebble).</p>
<p>I wanted to create a ‚Äòweekend‚Äô device that would let me stay in touch with friends and family, without the distractions of a full smartphone. I imagined a tiny, hackable e-paper screen with a physical keyboard, powered by a Raspberry Pi, that I could use to chat around my home‚Ä¶and do pretty much nothing else.</p>
<p>Before Matrix, the idea probably would not have gone anywhere. Most chat apps do not have an API, making it¬†practically impossible to hack something like this together.</p>
<p>I partnered with <a href="https://twitter.com/sqfmi">sqmfi</a> and they‚Äôre starting to take pre-orders at https://beepberry.sqfmi.com for the first batch. It‚Äôs $79 (or $99 including a Pi Zero). Specs: Sharp Memory LCD (same display tech as in Pebble!), Pi Zero (BT/WIFI), physical keyboard, 2000mAh lipo.</p>
<p>On top of being an amazing chat device, it‚Äôs basically an e-paper Cyberdeck that fits in your pocket. It‚Äôs a ton of fun to hack on. Keep in mind - THIS IS NOT A REAL FINISHED PRODUCT. It‚Äôs basically a devkit.</p>
<p>More info in the blog post: https://blog.beeper.com/p/beeper-x-sqmfi-beepberry, or join <code>#beeper-general:beeper.com</code></p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-neoboard">NeoBoard</a> ‚Äî an open-source collaborative whiteboard widget for Matrix! The NeoBoard is an ideal tool for creating and sharing content, conducting presentations, and collaborating with colleagues or friends. All data is stored as Matrix events within the Matrix room, leveraging Matrix's native end-to-end encryption, decentralization, and data privacy features.</p>
<p>The widget uses CRDT documents (conflict-free replicated data type) and WebRTC to provide a seamless and fast editing experience. It is used in the German public sector and is now available to anyone looking for a powerful and secure way to collaborate.</p>
<p>The NeoBoard is the latest widget from <a href="https://github.com/nordeck">Nordeck</a>, which we have been developing behind the scenes in the past months, and we're excited to finally share it with the Matrix community. If you have any questions, reach out to us at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nordeck:matrix.org">#nordeck:matrix.org</a>.</p>

<p>The release of Matrix 1.7 is expected in the next 1-2 weeks! Keep an eye out for announcement blog post specifically for it. We'll call it out in the following TWIM as well of course :)</p>
<p>Matrix 1.8 is currently scheduled for around August 2023.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3914">MSC3914: Matrix native group call push rule</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC adds a new push rule that causes your Matrix client to emit a notification if a group call (as defined by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401">MSC3401</a> is started in a Matrix room. This MSC (obviously) depends on MSC3041, so that MSC will need to be accepted before this one can be.</p>
<p>There is currently a client-side implementation for this MSC, but it is missing a homeserver side one (for adding the push rule).</p>
<p>Check out the MSC if you're interested, or perhaps take a look at adding that server-side implementation?</p>

<p>A Matrix Client written for MTRNord</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:midnightthoughts.space">MTRNord</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone :)</p>
<p>I recently started to work on my own personal Matrix client. It's still early in the progress, but I wanted to share it.</p>
<p>It mostly is based around some core concepts of element-web UI, however deviates from it quite quickly.
Notable changes are that it merges the space and roomviews into a single list, it has a richtext editor, and it renders things slightly different but close to element-web.</p>
<p>Additionally, the client is using the matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-js bindings as underlying e2ee and sliding-sync as it's /sync implementation.</p>
<p>This week it's just a preview, but I hope to improve upon it and make it more usable for people. You will find plenty of bugs like e2ee not decrypting past messages, no upscroll, no verification. But for very basic chatting it should work already.</p>
<p>Feel free to peek into <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#cetirizine:midnightthoughts.space">#cetirizine:midnightthoughts.space</a> or have a look at the repo https://github.com/MTRNord/cetirizine or try it for yourself at https://mtrnord.github.io/cetirizine (Or just view the storyboard at https://mtrnord.github.io/cetirizine/storybook )</p>
<p>Note that since this is meant to be a personal client there is no support given, and it's purely &quot;free and source available&quot; but neither includes community support nor any form of professional support. This is to prevent mental exhaustion for myself. Also note that this is still very early into the process. So many things are missing or buggy. If you try it, be careful.

<p><a href="https://radicale.org">Radicale</a> is dead simple CalDAV/CardDAV server, it's not fancy, but does the job. The only caveat with Radicale we had at <a href="https://etke.cc/?utm_source=twim">etke.cc</a> is manual htpasswd-based user management which is painful both for us and our customers.</p>
<p>So, we did that thing, called <code>radicale-auth-matrix</code> and you can use it authenticate from radicale against your matrix server, delegating user management on matrix side, where you have proper API and even UI for that.</p>
<p>How it works?
You enter your matrix account's credentials when login to your Radicale server, that's it! It even has simple hash-based cache to avoid unnecessary requests to matrix API once you logged in.</p>
<p>Pretty niche thing, but it pain caused by manual user management is gone üòÑ </p>

<p>Hi TWIM! It's been 3 months since a good chunk of the Matrix community gathered at FOSDEM. We had lots of fun meeting people at FOSDEM itself and on top an overwhelming response to the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org">#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org</a> we hosted on Friday in advance.</p>
<p>One of the next hacker events has now appeared on the horizon, namely <strong>Chaos Communication Camp 2023</strong> happening August 15-19. Find all the info about it in several posts on https://events.ccc.de/category/camp-2023/ and in the rooms contained within the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#camp2023:events.ccc.de">#camp2023:events.ccc.de</a> space. Note that this event, while happening close to Berlin, Germany, and some of the presented content might be in German, the Camp still targets an international audience.</p>
<p>Some of us have already gotten together to organize a Matrix village at the CCCamp. If you are interested in attending or - even better - have any ideas to share, we invite you to join us in that room. In particular, we will meet next Monday (May 15) in a video conference in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#chaosevents:matrix.org">#chaosevents:matrix.org</a> for planning, exchanging info, etc.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Lots of MSCs moving through the pipeline this week! Plus a myriad of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">spec changes</a> too! The spec seems to be gently humming along.</p>
<p>In other news, the next release of the spec, v1.7, is coming up in the not-too-distant future. In keeping with our roughly quarterly release schedule - the release of v1.6 was on February 14th, 2023 - a new release of the spec should come some time in next few weeks.</p>
<p>We haven't set a date yet, but expect to do so soon. So watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3741">MSC3741: Revealing the useful login flows to clients after a soft logout</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC fixes an edge case in the spec. Imagine the following scenario. You're logged into your homeserver via an SSO flow (let's say by signing into GitLab), and then you try to change your password on GitLab. Doing so may cause a &quot;soft logout&quot; to occur for your Matrix client. A soft logout, by the way, happens when your access token is invalidated, but your client is told explicitly not to wipe its local state (including encryption keys).</p>
<p>Your Matrix client is telling you to log back in again, and in doing so calls out to the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3login"><code>GET /_matrix/client/v3/login</code></a> endpoint to see what login methods are available. Your homeserver supports both password-based and SSO-based login, so that's what you get back. Your client happily presents you both options. You try to type your GitLab password, but it's incorrect. And you've just given your GitLab password to this Matrix homeserver in plaintext - oh no!</p>
<p>The problem here stems from the fact that <code>GET /login</code> is unauthenticated. The homeserver doesn't know who you are when you attempt to log in again, and thus can't tailor the available login methods to those that make sense for you. This MSC aims to fix this by having your Matrix client, upon trying to learn how to log in again after a soft logout, provide your expired access token in an <code>Authorization</code> request header. The homeserver can then check and see that 1) you were just soft logout'd and 2) you are an account that is authorised via SSO - so it doesn't make sense to suggest you log in again via a password specific to your Matrix homeserver!</p>
<p>While this MSC discusses a valuable solution, it is worth considering that the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api">User-Interactive Authentication system</a> as a whole is going to be completely replaced by OpenID Connect instead, which will make this problem (and solution) moot. Still, that day is not here yet, so if you suffer from this problem today, this may be one method to deal with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Version 1.6.5 of Quadrix (Matrix client for mobiles and desktops) has been released and is available in the respective app stores.</p>
<p>The latest changes include the replacement of the Jitsi Meet videoconferencing functionality with an embedded version of Element Call, using matrix-widget-api. Quadrix loads the Element Call web app located at https://element-call.netlify.app, which is the continually updated dev version. The Quadrix implementation is not quite compatible with Element Web, since it uses non-encrypted WebRTC signalling, but that's something I'll be working on in the next weeks.</p>
<p>Please go test-drive Element Call in Quadrix and leave feedback/comments at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#quadrix:matrix.org">#quadrix:matrix.org</a> or in the issues at https://github.com/alariej/quadrix (stars welcome :-)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>libolm is an implementation of the Olm and Megolm cryptographic ratchets used for end-to-end encryption in Matrix.  libolm 3.2.15 has been released.  This is mainly a maintenance release that improves the Python packaging and fixes a TypeScript issue.  The biggest change is that the Python package can now be installed from pypi.org, the default repository for Python packages.  The source package includes the libolm sources, so you do not need libolm to be installed separately any more.  All you need is cmake (or possibly GNU make) and a C/C++ compiler, and run <code>pip install python-olm</code>.  It unfortunately does not yet work on Windows, but should work on UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux and *BSD, and even macOS.</p>
<p>In other news: with Element iOS and Element Android switching to the rust crypto SDK, and hence using vodozemac, I'm considering deprecating the iOS and Android bindings for libolm.  If you still need those bindings, please let me know.</p>

<p>Some of you might have heard of it, but we're about to launch a (long overdue) update of the matrix.org website! The current one has served us well, but it grew organically as exciting projects and features were added to it. It became a little impractical to navigate and sometimes confusing.</p>
<p>The new matrix.org website, nicknamed &quot;Zola&quot; <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">after the static site generator it uses</a>, is not just a fresh coat of paint on the website: it's a complete rewrite to address three kind of people who would browse the website. Sorted by time they're willing to spend on a web page:</p>
<ul>
<li>The general public, who is not tech savvy and doesn't want to understand how things work, but who wants to get an easy onboarding</li>
<li>Community managers, who are not <em>too</em> tech savvy but are willing to spend a bit of time to understand more advanced use cases</li>
<li>Developers who want to understand how matrix works, and who want to build &amp; break things!</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK's online safety bill is a catastrophe in the making, and as currently written empowers the UK telecoms industry regulator (OFCOM) to obligate end-to-end encrypted messaging apps to embed proprietary 3rd party scanning software which attempts to identify and flag abusive content and report it to the authorities. <strong>If you are in the UK, please sign this petition https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/634725 to try to force the government to reconsider</strong>.

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3189">MSC3189</a> proposes a concept of per-room/per-space profiles within Matrix, allowing users to have different display names and avatars across their various rooms and spaces. To do so, an optional query parameter scope is added to all profile-related endpoints. When specified, the scope defines the profile that should be used to complete that action.</p>
<p>That way you can represent yourself in a business context in one space, and a less serious context in another space. Short of profile-rooms, this would get us a fair way towards having multiple public profiles in Matrix!</p>

<p>This handy tool bridges Meshtastic channels and Matrix rooms 1:1, and is built using matrix-nio.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Meshtastic, it's a project enabling encrypted long-distance messaging via decentralized LoRa meshnets, using affordable devices. LoRa is license-free and certification-free in most of the world, making it accessible for everyone. Radios automatically rebroadcast messages, creating a mesh network for group communication‚Äîeven from the furthest member. The Meshtastic mesh can sustain up to 80 device nodes, depending on settings.</p>

<li>Serial and network connections to Meshtastic devices</li>
<li>Truncation of long messages to fit within Meshtastic's payload size</li>
<li>Extended features via plugins, such as meshnet health plugin analyzing telemetry data and providing network stats</li>
<li>E2EE support is planned, but not yet implemented (we appreciate any help!)</li>

<h3 id="hookshot-4-0-0-makes-its-debut">Hookshot 4.0.0 makes its debut</h3>
<p>Greetings all; Hookshot latest release is out, along with some exciting news!</p>
<p>You may recall the TWIM post for 2.6.0 from back in January having announced <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/encryption.html">Encrypted Room Support</a>, though not without warnings of it being experimental &amp; not quite ready for prime time.  Well, the latest release changes all that: <strong>encrypted room support is much more stable now,</strong> as we've collaborated with the fine folks behind the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@matrix-org/matrix-sdk-crypto-nodejs">matrix-sdk-crypto Rust library</a> to squash some of the biggest bugs that had been plaguing Hookshot.  Encryption support even works for <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/service_bots.html">Service Bots</a>!</p>
<p>Other than enabling encryption in your Hookshot's config file, there is no migration necessary to enable these fixes, even if you've already enabled Hookshot's encryption from before this release.  Please give it a try and let us know how it goes!</p>
<p>This release also brings some useful features for RSS feeds: <strong>the ability to customize the format of feed messages</strong>, and <strong>the option to toggle posting messages for feed failures.</strong>  This provides much more control &amp; peace of mind over your feed messages, so give them a try &amp; enjoy!</p>
<p>Finally, to align with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v20-release-announce">the recent release of Node 20</a>, this latest Hookshot release <strong>adds support for Node 20, and drops support for Node 16.</strong>  The latter is due to Hookshot's policy of supporting only LTS &amp; Active releases of Node.  So, please ensure to update your Node versions if needed.</p>
<p>The release is available at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/4.0.0, or by doing <code>docker pull halfshot/matrix-hookshot:4.0.0</code>.

<p>Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix</p>

<h3 id="major-new-1-0-0-rc1-for-the-irc-bridge">Major new 1.0.0-rc1 for the IRC bridge</h3>
<p>Friday's greetings TWIM. On June 15th, 2018 I submitted my first pull request to matrix-appservice-irc. Little did I know then, that nearly 5 years later I would now be announcing the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc1">1.0.0</a> release candidate of the IRC bridge. This release brings a major new component, which is the ability to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VKBD_6PTvs">restart the bridge <em>in place</em></a>. This allows us to effectively do noise-less restarts of our larger bridges (in nearly all cases). This should also give us quite a bit more headroom on the bridge, so performance should improve.</p>
<p>The feature is currently marked as experimental but has been tested by the bridge crew fairly extensively, so the major wrinkles should have been ironed out by now. We'd really appreciate feedback, so please <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-appservice-irc/latest/connection_pooling.html">try it out</a>.</p>
<p>We've also bumped the minimum required version of the bridge to Node 18 to slightly get ahead of the curve, as Node 16 is due to lose support later this year.</p>
<p>Notable changes for this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>IRC connections can now be run via an external process using &quot;connection pooling&quot;, allowing the bridge to be restarted without IRC connection loss. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1669">#1669</a>)</li>
<li>Bridge logging can now be hot-reloaded. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1704">#1704</a>)</li>
<li>Fix not handling thread fallbacks as replies. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1697">#1697</a>)</li>
<li>Show a helpful error for !link/!unlink admin failures, rather than &quot;Check the logs for details&quot;, in more cases. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1702">#1702</a>)</li>
<li>Fix documentation not being built and uploaded to GitHub pages on release. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1703">#1703</a>)</li>
<li>Fix linking rooms from setup widget when a <code>networkId</code> is configured. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1706">#1706</a>)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on refactoring one of my older projects, <a href="https://git.pixie.town/f0x/synapse-media-proxy">synapse-media-proxy</a>, which separates the media repository from Synapse (similar to <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a>), but instead only acting as a caching proxy layer. This keeps the media in long-term storage at the homeserver (which is literally at home in my case, behind a slower residential line), but serves requests as fast as possible from a cheap VPS which keeps a minimal in-memory cache.</p>
<p>The refactor includes a lot of general cleanup/rework, but also moves the caching from in-process caches to a separate Redis database, as my previous implementation had some memory leakage. While not quite finished yet (no uploads, url previews), preliminary benchmarks for downloads and thumbnailing are very promising, way faster than both the original implementation and normal synapse. Benchmarks were done with <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a>, all against localhost on the same machine for a fair comparison.</p>

<p>Lack of rooms discovery for new users is one of the issues we noticed while installing and hosting hundreds of Matrix servers on <a href="https://etke.cc/?utm_source=twim">etke.cc</a>
Today, we welcome you to <a href="https://matrixrooms.info/">MatrixRooms.info</a>, a search engine built for matrix rooms discovery.</p>
<p>The current index contains over 230,000 rooms across 19,000 servers, and we're constantly tweaking it to provide more relevant search results.
Even non-English users may find it useful because it does automatic language detection in room names and topics.</p>
<p>We plan the following future improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searching by language</li>
<li>Searching by specific field</li>
<li>Providing a browsable catalog of rooms by server/language/etc</li>
<li>Implementing a subset of the Matrix Server-Server API to request (and provide!) a Matrix-native rooms directory</li>
</ul>

<p>As with anything else we do at <a href="https://etke.cc/?utm_source=twim">etke.cc</a>, the website, its API backend and all related tools are free software (A/GPL).</p>

<p>I've started writing a Matrix client tutorial, explaining how to use the Matrix Client-Server API.  It's still in the very early stages, but I've gotten to the point of being able to write a simple echo bot.  I'll be tackling end-to-end encryption next.  Feedback is welcome.  Client authors, if you have any tips and tricks, or potential pitfalls, that you think that every client author should know, feel free to share.  The document can be read at https://uhoreg.gitlab.io/matrix-tutorial/ and the sources are at https://gitlab.com/uhoreg/matrix-tutorial.</p>
