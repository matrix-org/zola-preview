<blockquote>
<p>Some of you might have heard of it, but we're about to launch a (long overdue) update of the matrix.org website! The current one has served us well, but it grew organically as exciting projects and features were added to it. It became a little impractical to navigate and sometimes confusing.</p>
<p>The new matrix.org website, nicknamed &quot;Zola&quot; <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">after the static site generator it uses</a>, is not just a fresh coat of paint on the website: it's a complete rewrite to address three kind of people who would browse the website. Sorted by time they're willing to spend on a web page:</p>
<ul>
<li>The general public, who is not tech savvy and doesn't want to understand how things work, but who wants to get an easy onboarding</li>
<li>Community managers, who are not <em>too</em> tech savvy but are willing to spend a bit of time to understand more advanced use cases</li>
<li>Developers who want to understand how matrix works, and who want to build &amp; break things!</li>
</ul>
<p>We're in the final stages of developing the website, and <em>we need you</em> to help us making it ready! Head to <a href="https://matrix.turbo.fish/">the preview of the website</a>, use the website, and give is feedback by opening <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues">an issue on the website tracker</a>. Please make sure the issue doesn't <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Azola">already exist before opening it</a>.</p>
<p>Reporting the following is particularly helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something looks off, misplaced, is not aligned well or behaves oddly</li>
<li>Something is missing (the doc is incomplete? Some informationg is missing somewhere?)</li>
<li>There's an accessibility issue</li>
<li>Something doesn't work on your browser</li>
<li>It's not clear how to get to a particular information (you're looking for a client or a SDK, and after visiting the website you still don't know which one to use or how to get it?)</li>
</ul>
<p>We still need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish up the Bots page (which will likely be replaced by an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues/1539#issuecomment-1444180681">Integrations</a> page)</li>
<li>Flesh out the support page to highlight more of the work of the Matrix.org Foundation</li>
<li>Import the historical projects that are no longer maintained (clients, servers, bots, bridges, sdks)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to follow along, you can join the #matrix.org-website:matrix.org room.</p>
<p>Help us make the website look as neat as possible for launch!</p>

<p>The UK's online safety bill is a catastrophe in the making, and as currently written empowers the UK telecoms industry regulator (OFCOM) to obligate end-to-end encrypted messaging apps to embed proprietary 3rd party scanning software which attempts to identify and flag abusive content and report it to the authorities. <strong>If you are in the UK, please sign this petition https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/634725 to try to force the government to reconsider</strong>.

<p>Lots of MSCs moving through the process this week.

That's a really impactful, user-facing feature!</p>
<p>The other MSCs on the list, especially <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2246">MSC2246: Asynchronous media uploads</a>, bring quality-of-life improvements and unlock future functionality in Matrix. Check them out!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3189">MSC3189: Per-room/per-space profiles</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3189">MSC3189</a> proposes a concept of per-room/per-space profiles within Matrix, allowing users to have different display names and avatars across their various rooms and spaces. To do so, an optional query parameter scope is added to all profile-related endpoints. When specified, the scope defines the profile that should be used to complete that action.</p>
<p>That way you can represent yourself in a business context in one space, and a less serious context in another space. Short of profile-rooms, this would get us a fair way towards having multiple public profiles in Matrix!</p>
<p>Check out the MSC if you're interested. Reviews are always welcome!</p>

<p>üîí This week some follow-up work further improving <strong>End-to-End Encryption</strong> took place. Compatibility between Nheko and Element devices through Construct have been fixed. About two weeks ago my quality assessment of <strong>e2ee</strong> through Construct was about 30%. Last week saw <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix#construct-website">major progress</a> but we were still maxing out around 70%. This week is closer to 90%; a few UISI's are still happening in some places such as a user's first message to an encrypted room. We'll have that worked out soon enough.</p>
<p>üôã I'd like to thank Giovanni Bottaro for fixing some compatibility issues with the Dart Matrix SDK (Fluffychat) by replacing some HTTP 201 (Created) codes returned by Construct with HTTP 200's instead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This handy tool bridges Meshtastic channels and Matrix rooms 1:1, and is built using matrix-nio.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Meshtastic, it's a project enabling encrypted long-distance messaging via decentralized LoRa meshnets, using affordable devices. LoRa is license-free and certification-free in most of the world, making it accessible for everyone. Radios automatically rebroadcast messages, creating a mesh network for group communication‚Äîeven from the furthest member. The Meshtastic mesh can sustain up to 80 device nodes, depending on settings.</p>
<p>Naturally, we wanted to integrate this incredible tech with Matrix.</p>
<p><strong>M&lt;&lt;&gt;M Relay's Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bidirectional message relay between Meshtastic meshnets and Matrix chat rooms, supporting multiple meshnets</li>
<li>Serial and network connections to Meshtastic devices</li>
<li>Truncation of long messages to fit within Meshtastic's payload size</li>
<li>Extended features via plugins, such as meshnet health plugin analyzing telemetry data and providing network stats</li>
<li>E2EE support is planned, but not yet implemented (we appreciate any help!)</li>
</ul>
<p>We're excited about extending our meshnets' range using existing Matrix bridges. Learn more and download the files <a href="https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay">here</a>.</p>
<p>Join our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#meshtastic-relay-1:matrix.org">#meshtastic-relay-1:matrix.org</a>  where we currently have 3 meshnets connected. If you have Meshtastic devices, we'd love help with testing, but all users are welcome.</p>

<h3 id="hookshot-4-0-0-makes-its-debut">Hookshot 4.0.0 makes its debut</h3>
<p>Greetings all; Hookshot latest release is out, along with some exciting news!</p>
<p>You may recall the TWIM post for 2.6.0 from back in January having announced <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/encryption.html">Encrypted Room Support</a>, though not without warnings of it being experimental &amp; not quite ready for prime time.  Well, the latest release changes all that: <strong>encrypted room support is much more stable now,</strong> as we've collaborated with the fine folks behind the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@matrix-org/matrix-sdk-crypto-nodejs">matrix-sdk-crypto Rust library</a> to squash some of the biggest bugs that had been plaguing Hookshot.  Encryption support even works for <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/service_bots.html">Service Bots</a>!</p>
<p>Other than enabling encryption in your Hookshot's config file, there is no migration necessary to enable these fixes, even if you've already enabled Hookshot's encryption from before this release.  Please give it a try and let us know how it goes!</p>
<p>This release also brings some useful features for RSS feeds: <strong>the ability to customize the format of feed messages</strong>, and <strong>the option to toggle posting messages for feed failures.</strong>  This provides much more control &amp; peace of mind over your feed messages, so give them a try &amp; enjoy!</p>
<p>Finally, to align with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v20-release-announce">the recent release of Node 20</a>, this latest Hookshot release <strong>adds support for Node 20, and drops support for Node 16.</strong>  The latter is due to Hookshot's policy of supporting only LTS &amp; Active releases of Node.  So, please ensure to update your Node versions if needed.</p>
<p>The release is available at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/4.0.0, or by doing <code>docker pull halfshot/matrix-hookshot:4.0.0</code>.  And as usual, feel free to direct any questions about Hookshot in our Matrix room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#hookshot:half-shot.uk">#hookshot:half-shot.uk</a></p>

<p>Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="major-new-1-0-0-rc1-for-the-irc-bridge">Major new 1.0.0-rc1 for the IRC bridge</h3>
<p>Friday's greetings TWIM. On June 15th, 2018 I submitted my first pull request to matrix-appservice-irc. Little did I know then, that nearly 5 years later I would now be announcing the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc1">1.0.0</a> release candidate of the IRC bridge. This release brings a major new component, which is the ability to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VKBD_6PTvs">restart the bridge <em>in place</em></a>. This allows us to effectively do noise-less restarts of our larger bridges (in nearly all cases). This should also give us quite a bit more headroom on the bridge, so performance should improve.</p>
<p>The feature is currently marked as experimental but has been tested by the bridge crew fairly extensively, so the major wrinkles should have been ironed out by now. We'd really appreciate feedback, so please <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-appservice-irc/latest/connection_pooling.html">try it out</a>.</p>
<p>We've also bumped the minimum required version of the bridge to Node 18 to slightly get ahead of the curve, as Node 16 is due to lose support later this year.</p>
<p>Notable changes for this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>IRC connections can now be run via an external process using &quot;connection pooling&quot;, allowing the bridge to be restarted without IRC connection loss. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1669">#1669</a>)</li>
<li>Bridge logging can now be hot-reloaded. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1704">#1704</a>)</li>
<li>Fix not handling thread fallbacks as replies. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1697">#1697</a>)</li>
<li>Show a helpful error for !link/!unlink admin failures, rather than &quot;Check the logs for details&quot;, in more cases. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1702">#1702</a>)</li>
<li>Fix documentation not being built and uploaded to GitHub pages on release. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1703">#1703</a>)</li>
<li>Fix linking rooms from setup widget when a <code>networkId</code> is configured. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1706">#1706</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fheese:element.io">Florian Heese</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello from the VoIP team, </p>
<p>We have shipped Element Call release 0.3.8 today -- still in beta. In order to get a data driven approach towards getting out of beta we added a bunch of telemetry to Element Call in our previous release using the Open Telemetry framework. And in the meantime we gathered together with submitted rage-shakes  (also now backed by Open Telemetry) meaningful insights which enabled us to identify and fix two major split-brain issues. You will find the full list of changes in the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-call/releases/tag/v0.3.8">release notes</a>.</p>

<p>We released another breaking change this week :p bump to v0.19.0, the main features/changes from last time include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrading to matrix api 1.6</li>
<li>Private read receipts support</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where loading archive returned a stale version. Since different sync timeouts bust through the cache, we make use of that to be able to load the new archive immediately.</li>
<li>There's also a way for clients to provide media streams when starting a call, which should make setting up calls with audio/video mute toggles much easier</li>
<li>Stopping media streams properly for calls
and several other fixes!</li>
</ul>
<p>Until next time :D</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Long time no see! A few new shiny things have landed recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trinity now supports reading the wasm commands from multiple, custom directories. Of course, all of these are watched by Trinity so any module in there will be instantaneously hot-loaded as usual.</li>
<li>Trinity has been <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bnjbvr/trinity">dockerized</a>! It's now possible to start Trinity in a Docker environment, provided <a href="https://github.com/bnjbvr/trinity#deploy-with-docker">a few environment variables and configuration options</a>. In particular, thanks to the previous change, it's also possible to hack <em>only</em> on the commands, and not have to compile the host runtime on your machine yourself.</li>
<li>We've also started experimenting with higher-level Rust traits to simplify even more the <a href="https://github.com/bnjbvr/trinity/blob/main/modules/pun/src/lib.rs#L35-L57">implementation of commands</a>. If you have any feedback about this, or opinions about developer ergonomics for implementing Matrix bots in general, come over the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#trinity:delire.party">#trinity:delire.party</a> channel and let's chat about that!</li>

<h2 id="libquotient-0-7-2">libQuotient 0.7.2</h2>
<p>I'm trying to get to senses and make releases a bit more often than before - so here's libQuotient 0.7.2, with massive internal code cleanup work carried out by Volker (@vkrause:kde.org) and a few functional fixes. The release notes are at <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.7.2">the usual place</a>.</p>
<p>This is likely the last 0.7.x release of libQuotient - after discussions within the team we agreed to prioritise a release of libQuotient 0.8 to fix a few API shortcomings in the current codebase (around E2EE but not only). This means that the final Quaternion 0.0.96 is unlikely to be released for another month or so, as it will be done on libQuotient 0.8 as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on refactoring one of my older projects, <a href="https://git.pixie.town/f0x/synapse-media-proxy">synapse-media-proxy</a>, which separates the media repository from Synapse (similar to <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a>), but instead only acting as a caching proxy layer. This keeps the media in long-term storage at the homeserver (which is literally at home in my case, behind a slower residential line), but serves requests as fast as possible from a cheap VPS which keeps a minimal in-memory cache.</p>
<p>The refactor includes a lot of general cleanup/rework, but also moves the caching from in-process caches to a separate Redis database, as my previous implementation had some memory leakage. While not quite finished yet (no uploads, url previews), preliminary benchmarks for downloads and thumbnailing are very promising, way faster than both the orginal implementation and normal synapse. Benchmarks were done with <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a>, all against localhost on the same machine for a fair comparison.</p>
<p>You can see the progress by comparing branches <a href="https://git.pixie.town/f0x/synapse-media-proxy/compare/main...refactor-redis">here</a></p>

Today, we welcome you to <a href="https://matrixrooms.info/">MatrixRooms.info</a>, a search engine built for matrix rooms discovery.</p>
<p>The current index contains over 230,000 rooms across 19,000 servers, and we're constantly tweaking it to provide more relevant search results.
Even non-English users may find it useful because it does automatic language detection in room names and topics.</p>
<p>We plan the following future improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searching by language</li>
<li>Searching by specific field</li>
<li>Providing a browsable catalog of rooms by server/language/etc</li>
<li>Implementing a subset of the Matrix Server-Server API to request (and provide!) a Matrix-native rooms directory</li>
