<h2 id="synapse-the-road-to-1-0">Synapse, the road to 1.0</h2>
<p>Neil, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">Synapse</a> overlord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week we carried on with Synapse 1.0 work, in particular <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4364">server key signing validity</a>, a config option to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4967">verify federation certificates</a> to support MSC1711 and support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4982">3PID unbinding APIs</a> (MSC1915). Outside of that we've been thinking about how to improve room upgrades for private rooms and landed the preparatory work for a refactor of the room directory.</p>
<p>Coming up next, we'll continue to bash out 1.0 blockers, Hawkowl has started work on optimising for small hosted homeservers, and anoa will be working on the new super fast room directory. Finally Erik has started work on aggregations support so clients will be able to offer things like edits and reactions ?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com/">https://www.arewereadyyet.com/</a> is now just shy of 64%, keep going.</p>

<h2 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/pull/541">Dockerfile for sytest</a> running against Dendrite approved. Close to being able to run Dendrite against sytest. Also using sytest's new test white/blacklist functionality to include a list of tests that Dendrite is known to pass in the repo. When people make new PRs that allow Dendrite to pass new tests, they can also append the names of the tests to the testfile to help automatically track Dendrite's improving progress. Look forward to seeing further progress post Synapse 1.0.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> 0.5.1 is out! This is a minor release with bugfixes and small improvements, a base for Quaternion 0.0.9.4, RC of which is coming this weekend. <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient/releases/tag/0.5.1">Full release notes here</a></p>

<p>and to follow up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> 0.0.9.4 Release Candidate is available for all those who don't need a &quot;release&quot; seal of approval to use applications. Get out, grab it, report bugs that could still sneak in: <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.9.4-rc">https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.9.4-rc</a>. A separate call out to translators - it's a great moment to teach Quaternion a few more phrases in your language!</p>

<h2 id="net-core-synchrotron">.NET Core Synchrotron</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This weekend I took a brief pause from doing matrix work, and then went back into it by finishing the feature set for the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/synapse-netcore-workers/pull/48">.NET Core Synchrotron</a>. It's &quot;feature complete&quot; meaning all specced features of sync are in this branch, excluding legacy endpoints. There are a few bugs logged against it and it's really only useful as a super early test, while I fix some of the p1 bugs.</p>
<p>The federation sender continues to be reliable and stable, and we are prepping for the release of synapse 0.99.3 which made a few changes to the replication stream. For more info, please see <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/synapse-netcore-workers">https://github.com/turt2live/synapse-netcore-workers</a></p>

<h2 id="pattle-has-now-moved-to-flutter">Pattle has now moved to Flutter</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a> has officially discontinued the previous version of Pattle, and is focused on their Flutter SDK and new version of Pattle based on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After some silence here but a lot of development, Pattle has now moved to Flutter. The new app is available in the same F-droid repository, you can just update. Note that you will have to log in again. If there are issues with updating, try removing the old app and installing the new one.</p>
<p>Also note that this version is still very basic and does not have all features of the old Pattle unfortunately. The reason that I chose to already replace it on the repo is that the old app will not receive updates anymore.</p>
<p>The current features are logging in and an overview of all chats. What <em>is</em> new is that data is now stored locally, so you won't have to do an initial sync everytime you open the app (which was the case with old app). What's also new is that I've decided to use more red, because.. I like red.</p>
<p>There is still a lot to do! Please notify me of anything that you think is missing, even though some things may be obvious (sorting chats based on date, chat avatars), some may not be as obvious to me!</p>
<p>If you'd like to contribute, the new repo is <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app">here</a>. Note that many contributions will probably start at the SDK level. Pattle uses my own Dart SDK, which you can find <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/library/matrix-dart-sdk">here</a>.</p>
<p>There is at the moment a very specific bug in Flutter, where on Android 7.1 with release builds, the app crashes when building a list widget. If you use Android 7.1 (like me) and you crash after logging in, that's the reason. It seems I can't do anything about it, sorry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aqueous now comes with room categories and history messages support.
Also, a lot of code refactoring is going on to change the backend store from plain json file to sqlite, which should improve the performance a lot.
The room is at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libaqueous:encom.eu.org">#libaqueous:encom.eu.org</a></p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aaron:raim.ist">Aaron Raimist</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few bounties have been added to Synapse and Riot recently to encourage community members to work on those projects. Although they aren't large enough to actually pay for development, I believe they can serve as a small push to help an already interested developer justify spending some time working on these projects.</p>
