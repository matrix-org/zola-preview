<p>Open Tech Will Save Us is a virtual meetup, taking the form of a monthly live 
video stream broadcasting on the last Wednesday of every month at 6pm Paris 
time.</p>
<p>We discuss issues relating to technology, especially the importance of Open, 
Interoperable standards, and how they can enable decentralised tech to keep our 
data private while still enabling communication.</p>

        <p><p>People start to be familiar with password managers, which are a good way to 
mitigate the proliferation of accounts ruling our digital lives. On the
enterprise side, past a certain size for the company the proliferation of
accounts is solved by SSO.</p>
<p>Let's talk about everything identity, the state of the art, the impact is has on
users, on administrators, why companies decide to deploy such projects, whether
it can make sense for smaller scale deployments, and much more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jens from <a href="https://goauthentik.io">Authentik</a>, the supercharged all-in-one
identity system will tell us about everything identity: why not just letting
services have their base of accounts, what is the state of the art, is this
just a systems administrators thing or does it benefit users as well? </li>
<li>Quentin who works on a deeper integration of OpenID Connect in Matrix will
reveal the not so secret plans he has to take advantage of what OpenID Connect
has to offer so Matrix users get the best experience in the long run.</li>

        <p><p>A massive episode of Open Tech Will Save Us on the very broad topic of 
platforms! What makes a platform? Are there different levels of platforms? Who
uses them? What are they useful for? What can be expected from a platform? And
the controversial topics: are Linux or the Web a platform?</p>
<p>To answer those questions, who other than the Linux desktop most advanced 
projects GNOME and KDE, and people working on Matrix, the protocol that wants to

<li><strong>Muhammad Radwan</strong>, on behalf of <strong>Tactical Tech</strong>, will present their work 
on <strong><a href="https://theglassroom.org/misinformation/">The Glass Room Misinformation Edition</a></strong>.<br />
<em>What happens when we increasingly rely on social media and the web for nearly
all our information? What information do we see, and what do we miss? How do
we know if a picture or a tweet is genuine or truthful? And what can we do if
we can’t be sure?</em></li>
<li><strong>Popi</strong> from <strong>CHATONS</strong> will present the work done by CHATONS (&quot;Collective
of Alternative, Transparent, Open, Neutral and United Hosters&quot;)
<em>CHATONS has been initiated by Framasoft, in the wake of the success of its
campaign &quot;De-google-ify Internet&quot;. A CHATONS member pledges to propose fully
FLOSS-based online services, in an ethical and united spirit.</em></li>
<li><strong>Hubert|Uhoreg Chathi</strong> will present on the state of encryption in Matrix,
and more broadly <em>Why the PGP model is insufficient, what properties we want
from encryption (e.g. why we want perfect forward secrecy), how the newer
protocols (OTR, double-ratchet, megolm) give us some of the properties we
want, and then what's coming in the future (MLS, and what that gives us)</em></li>
