                <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two critical severity vulnerabilities in end-to-end encryption were found in
the SDKs which power Element, Beeper, Cinny, SchildiChat, Circuli, Synod.im
and any other clients based on matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk or
matrix-android-sdk2.</li>
<li>These have now been fixed, and we have not seen evidence of them being
exploited in the wild. All of the critical vulnerabilities require
cooperation from a malicious homeserver to be exploited.</li>
<li><strong>Please upgrade immediately in order to be protected against these
vulnerabilities.</strong></li>
<li>Clients with other encryption implementations (including Hydrogen, ElementX,
Nheko, FluffyChat, Syphon, Timmy, Gomuks and Pantalaimon) are not affected;
<strong>this is not a protocol bug</strong>.</li>
<li>We take the security of our end-to-end encryption extremely seriously, and we
have an ongoing series of public independent audits booked to help guard
against future vulnerabilities.  We will also be making some protocol changes
in the future to provide additional layers of protection.</li>
<li>This resolves the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/23/pre-disclosure-upcoming-critical-security-release-of-matrix-sd-ks-and-clients">pre-disclosure</a> issued on September 23rd.</li>

                <p>We will be releasing a security update to matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk2 and clients which implement end-to-end encryption with these libraries, to patch <strong>critical</strong> security issues, on <strong>Wed, Sept 28th</strong>. The releases will be published in the afternoon, followed by the disclosure blog post around 16:00 UTC. The affected clients include Element Web, Desktop, iOS and Android.  We will also be working with downstream packagers and forks over the coming days to ensure a synchronised release to address affected clients.</p>
<p>Clients using matrix-rust-sdk, hydrogen-sdk and matrix-nio are not affected by these critical issues.  We are also auditing third-party client SDKs and clients in advance of the release, and will work with the projects if action is needed. So far we've confirmed that other popular SDK/clients including mtxclient (nheko), Matrix Dart SDK (FluffyChat), Trixnity (Timmy), Syphon, mautrix-go (Gomuks) and mautrix-python are not affected by the issues in question.</p>
<p>If you maintain or package a (potentially) affected E2EE-capable Matrix client and need to coordinate on the release, please contact <a href="mailto:security@matrix.org">security@matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We advise to upgrade as soon as possible after the patched versions are released.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your patience while we work to resolve this issue.</p>

                <p>Today we are issuing security releases of matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk to
patch a couple of High severity vulnerabilities (reserved as
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE%2D2022%2D36059">CVE-2022-36059</a>
for the matrix-js-sdk and
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE%2D2022%2D36060">CVE-2022-36060</a>
for the matrix-react-sdk).</p>
<p>Affected clients include those which depend on the affected libraries, such as
Element Web/Desktop and Cinny. Releases of the affected clients will follow
shortly. We advise users of those clients to upgrade at their earliest
convenience.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities give an adversary who you share a room with the ability to
carry out a denial-of-service attack against the affected clients, making it
not show all of a user's rooms or spaces and/or causing minor temporary
corruption.</p>
<p>The full vulnerability details will be disclosed at a later date, to give
people time to upgrade and us to perform a more thorough audit of the codebase.</p>
<p>Note that while the vulnerability was to our knowledge never exploited
maliciously, some unintentional public testing has left some people affected by
the bug. We made a best effort to sanitize this to stop the breakage. If you
are affected, you may still need to clear the cache and reload your Matrix
client for it to take effect.</p>
<p>We thank <a href="https://valentin-lorentz.fr/">Val Lorentz</a> who discovered and
reported the vulnerability over the weekend.</p>

                <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Today we're exceptionally releasing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.61.1">Synapse
1.61.1</a>, which comes
as a security release. <strong>Server administrators are encouraged to update as soon as
possible.</strong></p>
<p>This release fixes a vulnerability with Synapse's URL preview feature. URL
previews of some web pages can lead to unbounded recursion, causing the request
to either fail, or in some cases crash the running Synapse process.</p>
<p>Homeservers with the <code>url_preview_enabled</code> configuration option set to <code>false</code>
(the default value) are unaffected. Instances with the <code>enable_media_repo</code>
configuration option set to <code>false</code> are also unaffected, as this also disables
the URL preview functionality.</p>
<p>Server administrators who are unable to update Synapse should disable URL
previews by setting <code>url_preview_enabled: false</code> in their configuration file.
They can also delegate URL preview to a separate, dedicated worker to ensure the
process crashing does not impact other functionality of Synapse.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-22p3-qrh9-cx32">this security
advisory</a>

                <p>We've released updates to matrix-appservice-irc and our forked node-irc that it depends on to patch a High security vulnerability.
It's advised to update to 0.34.0 as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate a Matrix user into executing IRC commands
by having them reply to a maliciously crafted message.</p>
<p>Incorrect handling of a CR character allowed for making part of the message be sent to the IRC server verbatim
rather than as a message to the channel.</p>
<p>If you are currently a matrix-appservice-irc user, exercise caution when replying to messages from untrusted participants
in IRC bridged rooms until your bridge instance has been upgraded.</p>
<p>The vulnerability has been patched in node-irc version 1.2.1 and matrix-appservice-irc 0.34.0.
You can get the release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.34.0">on Github</a>.</p>

                <p>Element Desktop 1.9.6 and earlier depend on a vulnerable version of Electron, leading to a <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-desktop/security/advisories/GHSA-mjrg-9f8r-h3m7">High severity vulnerability</a> in Element Desktop, relating to its functionality for opening downloaded files. If successfully exploited, the vulnerability allows an attacker to open an arbitrary file path on the user's machine using the platform's standard mechanisms, but without the ability to pass additional arguments or data to the program being executed.</p>
<p>However in certain platform configurations, the same vulnerability could allow an attacker to open an arbitrary URL with an arbitrary scheme instead of a file path, again using the platform's standard mechanisms. There <a href="https://positive.security/blog/url-open-rce">has been research demonstrating</a> that the ability to open arbitrary URLs can sometimes lead to arbitrary code execution.</p>
<p>The attack requires user interaction and the exploit is complex. To the best of our knowledge, the vulnerability has never been exploited in the wild.</p>
<p>Patched in 1.9.7 with further hardening done in 1.9.9 to ensure it's harder to exploit even in light of new Electron vulnerabilities. Please upgrade to 1.9.9 as soon as possible. The vulnerability has been assigned <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23597">CVE-2022-23597</a>.</p>
<p>Discovered and reported by <a href="https://github.com/msrkp">Sirius</a> and <a href="https://github.com/TheGrandPew">TheGrandPew</a>.</p>

                <p>There is currently a lot of buzz and uncertainty around a number of vulnerabilities discovered in the log4j library in the Java ecosystem. These vulnerabilities are collectively known as &quot;Log4Shell&quot; and currently encompass CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.</p>
<p>First and foremost, there are to our knowledge no Matrix homeservers written in Java. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">Synapse</a>, the canonical implementation developed by the Matrix Foundation and the implementation that is backing matrix.org, is written in Python and thus unaffected. P2P Matrix relies on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>, our next-gen homeserver which is written in Go and is unaffected. <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit/">Conduit</a>, a community homeserver, is written in Rust and also unaffected. Supporting components like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent">Sydent</a> are written in Python and unaffected.</p>
<p>There are two components that are commonly used in the Matrix ecosystem that do rely on Java. These are Jitsi, specifically the <a href="https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-videobridge">Jitsi Videobridge</a> for VoIP, and <a href="https://gitlab.com/signald/signald">signald</a> used by the Signal bridge. Both components pull in log4j as part of their (transitive) dependencies. We're not aware of other bridges that are dependent on Java-based components.</p>
<p>For both of these projects updates have been published that integrate log4j 2.15.0 covering the initial CVE and we're currently waiting for additional updates to be published that integrate log4j 2.16.0 to cover the second. In the meantime, we've put all mitigations we are aware of in place on our systems and we strongly recommend everyone do the same.</p>
<p>For what mitigations to put in place, we recommend following the <a href="https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day-mitigation-guide/">recommendations provided by LunaSec</a>. They also provide a lot of background information on the vulnerabilities and how to audit for them.</p>
<p>Please keep an eye out for releases from the Jitsi and signald projects and follow their upgrade instructions to update your own deployments as soon as possible.</p>

                <p>Today we are releasing security updates to libolm, matrix-js-sdk, and several clients including Element Web / Desktop. Users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. This resolves the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/03/pre-disclosure-upcoming-security-release-of-libolm-and-matrix-js-sdk">pre-disclosure</a> issued on December 3rd.</p>
<p>Fixed library versions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>libolm: <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/-/tree/3.2.8">3.2.8</a></li>
<li>matrix-js-sdk: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/releases/tag/v15.2.1">15.2.1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Client versions incorporating the fixes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Element Web / Desktop: <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/releases/tag/v1.9.7">1.9.7</a></li>
<li>SchildiChat Web / Desktop: <a href="https://github.com/SchildiChat/schildichat-desktop/releases/tag/v1.9.7-sc.1">1.9.7-sc.1</a></li>
<li>Cinny: <a href="https://github.com/ajbura/cinny/releases/tag/v1.6.0">1.6.0</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These releases mitigate a buffer overflow in <code>olm_session_describe</code>, a libolm debugging function used by matrix-js-sdk in its end-to-end encryption (E2EE) implementation. If you rely on matrix-js-sdk for E2EE, you are affected. This vulnerability has been assigned <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44538">CVE-2021-44538</a>.</p>
<p>Clients which do <em>not</em> use matrix-js-sdk for E2EE, like FluffyChat or Element Android / iOS, are <em>not</em> affected.</p>
<p>This issue has been present since the introduction of the <code>olm_session_describe</code> function in October 2019 (commits: <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/-/commit/39a1ee0b18f0fced6d7bc293cc9a46ea70ec9e96">libolm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/commit/e6699c5424a856a639baa6d6f78d44594baaf404">matrix-js-sdk</a>).</p>
<p>We do not believe it is practical to successfully exploit this issue. However, upgrading remains important as the overflow <em>can</em> be triggered remotely.</p>
<p>Separately from the above vulnerability, we noticed during an internal audit that the libolm bindings in matrix-js-sdk were not zeroing out certain arrays containing entropy for cryptographic operations. This causes the entropy to remain resident in memory longer than necessary. As a defense-in-depth measure, this release of libolm now proactively overwrites those arrays when it is safe to do so.</p>
<p>Lastly, we are also taking this opportunity to update the version of Electron bundled with Element Desktop, pulling in the latest backported security fixes there.</p>
<p>The buffer overflow was found and reported by GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/brevilo">@brevilo</a> in the course of developing <a href="https://github.com/brevilo/jolm/">jOlm</a>, a library of Java bindings to libolm; thank you.

                <p>On <strong>Monday, 13th December</strong> we plan to publish a security release of libolm at 15:00 UTC to address a single high severity issue. To the best of our knowledge, only matrix-js-sdk and clients relying on it for E2EE are affected by this issue. This includes Element Web/Desktop and their forks (like SchildiChat). The release of libolm will be immediately followed by a security release of matrix-js-sdk and the affected clients. Users of these clients are encouraged to <strong>upgrade as soon as the patched versions are released</strong>.</p>
<p>We will be reaching out to downstream packagers to ensure they can prepare patched versions of the affected packages at the time of the release. The details of the vulnerability will be disclosed in a blog post on the day of the release. There is so far no evidence of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild.</p>
<p>The patched version numbers will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>libolm 3.2.8</li>
<li>matrix-js-sdk 15.2.1</li>
<li>Element Web/Desktop 1.9.7</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your patience while we work to resolve this issue.</p>
<p><em>Edit, 2021-12-13: Added patched release numbers.</em></p>
