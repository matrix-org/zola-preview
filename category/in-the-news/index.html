                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Heads up that yesterday at 12:00 ET, the Mozilla IRC network was switched off
after over 22 years of valiant service, and the <a href="http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2020/02/20/synchronous-messaging-were-live/">mozilla.org Matrix instance is
now in full production</a>.
You can get at it via the Riot instance at
https://chat.mozilla.org, by pointing your client at
https://mozilla.modular.im, or by joining rooms on the mozilla.org server over
federation via its room directory.</p>
<p>We'd like to thank Mozilla again for putting their faith in Matrix, and are
determined to do everything we can to ensure we're a more than worthy
successor to IRC; we have big boots to fill :)</p>
<p>We've been gathering a huge amount of invaluable FTUE (first time user experience)
feedback from the commentary in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synchronicity:mozilla.org">#synchronicity:mozilla.org</a> - and we're in the process
of implementing it over the coming weeks.  In particular, we've already implemented
alphabetic room ordering, custom theming support, and done a bunch more SSO work.</p>
<p>The immediate priorities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixing a regression in jumps/jank when scrolling (fix PRed to develop today)</li>
<li>Enabling Mozilla IAM SSO authentication on remaining &quot;interactive user auth&quot; flows (e.g. managing devices)</li>
<li>Fixing the UX around selecting server when browsing the room directory.</li>
<li>Fixing notification defaults, behaviour and settings UX</li>
<li>Better educating users to connect to the mozilla.modular.im if using a random app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, it's worth noting that the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd">matrix-ircd</a> project is
seeing some commits again, many thanks to jplatte from the <a href="https://ruma.io">Ruma</a> project - so if you are
currently despairing the demise of moznet, never fear: you may yet be able to connect to the Mozilla matrix
server <a href="https://xkcd.com/1782/">via IRC</a> (authing via Mozilla IAM, of course) and pretend that none of this newfangled Matrix stuff
exists :D</p>
<p>Please keep the feedback coming in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synchronicity:mozilla.org">#synchronicity:mozilla.org</a> - we're gathering it all up into Github (under the mozilla label) as well as a high level <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yG3pqAWN4JLL_omC1E9W7Gc-jAOqFD0OAr5gig1Yilg/edit?usp=drive_web&amp;ouid=106410341666574529833">Google Doc</a> to help collate everything.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>- The Matrix Core Team.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We’re incredibly excited that <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/synchronous-messaging-at-mozilla-the-decision/50620">Mozilla just announced</a> that they’ve selected Matrix as the successor to IRC as the communication platform for the public Mozilla community!!  This comes off the back of a <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/synchronous-messaging-at-mozilla-trial-servers-feedback/44871">formal 1-month trial</a> in September to evaluate various options side by side, and now New Vector will be helping Mozilla get their homeserver up and running on the <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a> hosting platform over the coming weeks - and federating openly with the rest of the open global Matrix network! :)</p>
<p>We have always been massive fans of Mozilla: they have been an excellent role model as champions of the open web, open standards, not to mention open source - and it’s fair to say that Mozilla has been a major inspiration to how Matrix has evolved (Riot aspires to be to Matrix what Firefox is to the Web: a flagship open source app which provides an accessible friendly interface into an open standard network).  It’s very reassuring to see that Mozillians from the trial recognise the alignment and have converged on Matrix as the way forward - it’s a massive win for the open web and standards-based communication in general.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that we’ve also always been massive fans of IRC, and Matrix is unashamedly derivative of IRC in capabilities and culture, while broadening the scope to decentralised synchronisation and relaying of any kind of data.  For context, the genesis of the team which eventually spawned Matrix was on a student IRC server ~20 years ago - and subsequently everything we’ve worked on (up to Matrix) was coordinated exclusively through IRC.  We even used to give conference talks on how to run your project/company off IRC.  I can’t really overstate how fundamental IRC is to our history - and we still keep our private IRC network online for old time’s sake (albeit bridged to Matrix). The very first protocol bridge we built for Matrix back in 2015 was for IRC - and Moznet and Freenode were the first public bridges we turned on. As of right now, <code>/stats u</code> on Moznet says that there are 4950 connected users, of which 1724 (so 35%) are actually Matrix users connected via the Moznet bridge - effectively using Matrix as a big decentralised IRC bouncer in the sky.</p>
<p>All of this is to say is that we deeply understand how dependent Mozilla has been on IRC over the years, and that we built Matrix to be a worthy successor which tries to capture all the best bits of IRC while providing much richer primitives (E2E encryption, openly federated decentralised chatrooms, arbitrary data sync, HTTP API, VoIP, etc).  It’s also worth noting that even though Moznet is being turned off, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd">matrix-ircd</a> exists as a very promising project that exposes <em>any</em> Matrix homeserver as an ircd - so for all you IRC die-hards, Moznet can absolutely live on in the afterlife!  (matrix-ircd is still alpha right now, but it’s a relatively modest amount of Rust and PRs are <em>very</em> welcome - if you grok IRC it should be a really really fun project to contribute to).</p>
<p>In other news, the trial in September was an amazing opportunity to gather feedback first-hand from a wide range of Mozillians as they gave Riot and Matrix a spin, often for the first time - and it was a lot of fun to take that feedback and rapidly act on it to improve the app.  For instance, having direct expert feedback on our screenreader support meant that we were able to <a href="https://blog.riot.im/riot-web-1-5/">radically improve our accessibility</a>, and we’ve kept up the momentum on this since the trial (regardless of the outcome) with Mozilla &amp; Riot devs hacking together with the aim of making Riot the most accessible communication app out there without exception.  Huge thanks to Marco Zehe for all his guidance (and PRs), as well as the rest of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#a11y:matrix.org">#a11y:matrix.org</a>!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Riot’s UX continues to mature in general. One of our two primary projects right now is to improve First Time User Experience (<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aproject%3AFtue+">FTUE</a>) - i.e. making our UX as smooth and polished and predictable as possible, especially as seen by new users.  This project had just kicked off in September as the Mozilla trial began, and some of the major improvements to the Room Directory and Room Creation flow which subsequently landed in Riot/Web 1.5 were prioritised directly based on Mozillian feedback.  Since the trial we’ve been focusing more on our other primary project (getting E2E Encryption enabled by default), but we will be back on FTUE asap - particularly to incorporate all the feedback we anticipate as Mozilla goes live!  We are absolutely determined for Riot to have as good if not better UX than the likes of Slack or Discord.  New Vector is also <a href="https://apply.workable.com/new-vector/j/6CB817C79E/">actively hiring more designers</a> to come work fulltime on Riot’s UI and UX as we shift Riot’s focus from being developer-led to design-led - if this sounds interesting, please get in touch!  And finally, everything is of course open source and PRs are genuinely appreciated to keep Riot heading in the right direction (please just check first if they change the UI/UX).</p>
<p>Finally, in case you’re dreading having to use a graphical chat client like Riot, the Mozilla instance will of course be accessible to any <a href="https://matrix.org/clients/">Matrix client</a> that floats your boat - for instance, <a href="https://github.com/poljar/weechat-matrix">weechat-matrix</a> also got a spurt of development to support Mozilla IAM single-sign-on so that commandline junkies can get their fix too. (It’s worth noting that weechat-matrix really is an incredibly fully featured and usable client - complete with full end-to-end encryption support.  If you haven’t tried it, you’re missing out).</p>
<p>So, to conclude: it has been indescribably valuable to have the expertise and enthusiasm of the Mozilla community in contributing feedback and fixes to Riot (and even <a href="https://github.com/bnjbvr/botzilla">building new Matrix bots</a>!).  Huge thanks to everyone who invested their time and energy participating in the trial and for their trust in concluding that Matrix was the way forward.  We see this as a massive responsibility and honour to help power the wider Mozilla community, and we will do everything we can to make it as successful as conceivably possible :)</p>
<p>To the future of an open web, with even more open communications!</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix &amp; Riot team :)</p>
<p>P.S. we’ve come a long way since <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/matrix-and-irc-mozillians-custom-client/2911/7">Matrix was first proposed</a> for Mozilla :D</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Massive news for the Matrix ecosystem today: <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a> (the
startup which the Matrix core team formed to fund development in 2017) has
raised an additional $8.5M of funding in order to speed up Riot/Matrix
development and expand Matrix hosting via <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a>!</p>
<p>The new funding comes in the form of a Series-A equity investment in New
Vector from three of the top venture capital funds in London.  The round is
led by <a href="https://notion.vc">Notion</a> - a fund set up by the founders of
MessageLabs, who many will know as one of the leaders in secure hosted email
services.  Notion's long history with email means they immediately clocked the
potential of Matrix's mission to build a new open global communication network -
after all, Matrix aims to provide a worthy replacement to email (and the
phone network, for that matter!).  Joining Notion in the round is <a href="https://firstminute.capital">First
Minute</a> - a fund set up by the founders of
Lastminute.com (arguably the UK's most famous original dotcom), and
<a href="http://dawncapital.com/">Dawn</a> - one of the largest SaaS tech specialist
funds in Europe (famous for backing iZettle, Mimecast, Neo4J and many more).</p>
<p>The last funding round in Jan 2017 from Status was instrumental in stabilising
the big 1.0 release of Matrix and exiting beta in June; creating the
Matrix.org Foundation as a neutral custodian for the standard; stabilising and
optimising Synapse; redesigning Riot’s user interface; bringing in a full-time
professional UI/UX designer to the team; supporting the huge amount of
encryption work required to turn on E2EE by default (cross-signing, key
backups, device verification, e2e search, the pantalaimon e2e daemon etc);
creating RiotX/Android; and launching the Modular.im hosting platform.</p>
<p>With today’s new funding, the priorities for Matrix will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Turning on end-to-end encryption by default for DMs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much better support for grouping rooms into Communities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More anti-abuse/anti-spam mechanisms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shrinking Synapse (and/or finishing Dendrite)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Canonical DMs (having one DM per user, and have them feel clearly distinct from ‘rooms’)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extensible Profiles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decentralised accounts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Threading</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...and furthering development on P2P Matrix, so users can have full control of their communications without having to run or trust a server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the New Vector side, this funding will support: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A whole new wave of UX improvements to Riot (particularly around onboarding and first time user experience).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making Modular hosting as polished and powerful as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a whole new set of next-generation Modular integrations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While New Vector’s contributions to the Matrix ecosystem can’t be ignored,
it’s important to remember that the Matrix protocol and specification itself
is governed and controlled by the independent and neutral <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">Matrix.org
Foundation</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/proposals/1779-open-governance.md">extensive governance
processes</a>.
We set up the Foundation <em>very</em> deliberately to enforce the protocol's
neutrality, formalise the project's mission, goals and values and hold true to
them no matter what - specifically to protect the project from conflicts of
interest with commercial Matrix endeavours, including New Vector.</p>
<p>That said, New Vector would not be taking money from any investors if they did
not believe their goals are aligned with Matrix's. To clarify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matrix exists to create an open secure decentralised communication network and protocol for the benefit of all.</li>
<li>New Vector exists to help grow Matrix and be one of many successful companies in the Matrix ecosystem. </li>
<li>Tech VCs exist to invest their money in growing companies in order to get a return when the company IPOs or gets bought.</li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out that these goals are not incompatible if one understands that the
potential of the Matrix ecosystem is directly linked to its openness and size
(hint: funding sources who didn’t understand this self-selected out ;). By
funding Matrix development and helping the open ecosystem and public network
grow, New Vector can go provide more Matrix hosting via
<a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a> and more Government &amp; Enterprise deployments
via <a href="https://vector.im">Vector.im</a>.  Critically, other companies can and do
build on top of Matrix too - and frankly the more players there are, the more
valuable the network, and the more value to be shared for everyone (including
New Vector).  This model worked relatively well for the Web, and we believe
it'll work for Matrix too.</p>
<p><strong>Update: the best way to gauge the investment in New Vector is to hear it
first hand from the investors.  Jos from Notion is leading the round, and has
a <a href="https://notion.vc/resources/new-vector-series-a/">fascinating blog post</a>
(written with zero input from Matrix or New Vector folks) to explain where the
investors are coming from.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update 2: More excellend <a href="https://medium.com/dawn-capital/communications-of-the-future-will-be-open-and-secure-why-we-invested-in-new-vector-2bd8a060faf7">first-hand analysis</a> from Dan at Dawn Capital, who does a really deep dive into how they see Matrix and New Vector. Another must read.</strong></p>
<p>In this case, all of New Vector's new investors have a background as respected
tech entrepreneurs, and everyone involved categorically understands that
Matrix itself is a neutral open source project, and the mission is to help
build up the whole network to be as successful as possible rather than
sabotage it by constraining it in any way.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s great news for the ecosystem: Matrix is 5 years old now, and
while the project is growing faster than ever (over 300% more active users in
the last year!) - it's fair to say that we haven't moved as fast as our
mainstream competition - for instance, Slack is only a year older, and Discord
is a year younger(!)  Obviously much of this is due to Matrix being a
completely different proposition: we've been creating an open spec; multiple
client codebases; multiple server codebases; the bridges; a fault tolerant
decentralised network - not to mention the complexities of decentralised E2E
encryption.  Based on comparing with our endeavours prior to Matrix, we
estimate building this stuff in an open and decentralised manner takes roughly
6 times longer.</p>
<p>But the project is now in a position where the foundations are solid: the
protocol is out of beta, reference servers and clients are production ready,
and it’s more than time to make all of this mainstream. We have to redouble
our focus on user experience and ensure that we compare favourably to today’s
established alternatives while staying true to Matrix’s principles.  Making
sure there are Matrix apps out there which provide a credible alternative to
with the likes of Slack and WhatsApp (until they eventually join Matrix, of
course) is what will make the difference between Matrix being a cliquey FOSS
curiosity versus really being the natural successor to today’s instant
messaging, email and phone networks.</p>
<p>In the end; Matrix needs full-time contributors in order to continue to grow,
and keeping New Vector funded is a very good way to achieve that (<a href="https://vector.im/careers">New Vector
is hiring!</a>).  (That said, if any philanthropic
billionaires are reading this, the Matrix.org Foundation is actively
soliciting donations to improve Matrix independently of New Vector's efforts -
particularly around the areas of countering online abuse and disinformation).</p>
<p>In the meantime, huge thanks to Jos at Notion for believing in Matrix and
leading this funding round in New Vector - and huge thanks to the other
investors who saw the potential!  And most of all, thank you to all those
supporting Matrix, whether by donating to the Foundation, promoting and using
the protocol, or contributing code to the ecosystem.  You are the ones keeping
the dream alive :)</p>
<p>You can read things from the NV angle over at https://blog.vector.im/8-5m-to-accelerate-matrix/.
We hope you’re as excited as we are to open a whole new chapter as Matrix
picks up yet more momentum :D</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>If you’ve been looking for a way to have you own Matrix homeserver without having to run it yourself, you may be interested to hear that <a href="https://modular.im">Modular</a> (the Matrix hosting provider run by <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a>, the startup which hires many of the Matrix core team) is now offering a personal-sized small homeserver hosting service, supporting a minimum size of 5 user servers.</p>
<p>A lot of recent performance work on Synapse has been driven by the need to make smaller dedicated servers more efficient to run - and so if you run your own homeserver you’ll be benefiting from all this work too :)  Meanwhile, if you choose to outsource your server hosting to Modular, you’ll be indirectly supporting core Matrix and Synapse development, given most of the core Matrix team work for New Vector - it’s through buying services like this which lets us keep folks able to hack on Matrix as their day job.</p>
<p>See more details <a href="https://modular.im/personal-hosted-homeservers">over at the Modular blog post</a>!</p>

                <p>Well here it is: Synapse 1.0.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.0 is the reference implementation of the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec">Matrix 1.0 spec</a>. The goal of the release overall has been to focus on security and stability, such that we can officially declare Synapse (and Matrix) out of beta and recommended for production use. This means changing the default room protocol version used for new rooms to be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/37871106c6fc6013c17b5711fb93853fff140267/proposals/2002-rooms-v4.md">v4</a>, which includes the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/f714aaadd011ac736d779f8460202a8d95799123/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">state resolution algorithm</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/event_id_hashes/proposals/1659-event-id-as-hashes.md">collision-resistant event IDs</a>, which are now formatted to be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/proposal/no_slash_in_event_id/proposals/1884-replace-slashes-in-event_ids.md">URL safe</a>.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.0 also ships with support for the upcoming <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/rooms/v5.html">v5 room protocol</a> (which enforces honouring server key validity periods), but this will not be used as the default for new rooms until a sufficient number of servers support it.</p>
<p>Please note that Synapse 1.0 does <strong>not</strong> include significant performance work or new features - our focus has been almost exclusively on providing a reference implementation of the Matrix 1.0 protocol. But having cleared our backlog on security/stability issues we will finally be now unblocked to pursue work around reducing RAM footprint, eliminating forward-extremity build up, and shipping new features like Edits, Reactions &amp; E2E cross-signing support.</p>
<p>As part of the security work, Synapse 1.0 contains a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md#it-used-to-work-just-fine-why-are-you-breaking-everything">breaking change</a> that requires a valid TLS certificate on the federation API endpoint. <strong>Servers that do not configure their certificate will no longer be able to federate post 1.0.</strong></p>
<p>It is also worth noting that Synapse 1.0.0 is the last release that will support Python 2.x and Postgres 9.4. For more information see <a href="/blog/2019/04/08/synapse-deprecating-postgres-9-4-and-python-2-x">here</a> but the TL;DR is that you should upgrade asap.</p>
<p>This release has been a long time coming. Many thanks indeed to everyone who helped test the release candidates and provided feedback along the way.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.0 is just one component of a larger Matrix 1.0 release, which you can <a href="/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation">read all about here</a>.</p>
<p>As ever, you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.0.0">here</a> or any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Last month at FOSDEM 2019 we gave a <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/matrix/">talk</a> about a new experimental ultra-low-bandwidth transport for Matrix which swaps our baseline HTTPS+JSON transport for a custom one built on <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252">CoAP</a>+<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049">CBOR</a>+<a href="https://noiseprotocol.org">Noise</a>+<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/compress/flate/">Flate</a>+<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc768.txt">UDP</a>.  (CoAP is the RPC protocol; CBOR is the encoding; Noise powers the transport layer encryption; Flate compresses everything uses predefined compression maps).</p>
<p>The challenge here was to see if we could demonstrate Matrix working usably over networks running at around 100 bits per second of throughput (where it'd take 2 minutes to send a typical 1500 byte ethernet packet!!) and very high latencies.  You can see the original FOSDEM talk below, or <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-03-FOSDEM-Low-Bandwidth.pdf">check out the slides here.</a></p>

<p>Now, it's taken us a little while to find time to tidy up the stuff we demo'd in the talk to be (relatively) suitable for public consumption, but we're happy to finally release the four projects which powered the demo:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/meshsim">https://github.com/matrix-org/meshsim</a> - meshsim is the network simulator which provides an interactive web interface to draw a network topology and let you spin up dockerized homeservers on a simulated network with whatever preferred latency, jitter, packet loss etc.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/meshsim-docker">https://github.com/matrix-org/meshsim-docker</a> - meshsim-docker is the custom synapse + coap-proxy Dockerfile used to define the containers which meshsim instantiates</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/coap-proxy">https://github.com/matrix-org/coap-proxy</a> - coap-proxy is the golang proxy which converts HTTPS+JSON into CoAP+CBOR+Noise+Flate and vice versa, letting you squish Matrix CS API and SS API traffic in & out of CoAP.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-coap">https://github.com/matrix-org/go-coap</a> - go-coap is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/Kistler-Group">Kistler-Group</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/go-ocf/go-coap">go-ocf/go-coap</a> (in turn originally a fork of <a href="https://github.com/dustin/go-coap">dustin/go-coap</a>) which adds encryption using <a href="https://noiseprotocol.org">Noise</a>, retries, and hooks for compression.</li>
</ul>
In order to get up and running, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/meshsim/blob/master/README.md">meshsim README</a> has all the details.
<p>It's important to understand that this is very much a proof of concept, and shouldn't be used in production yet, and almost certainly has some glaring bugs.  In fact, it currently assumes you are running on a trusted private network rather than the public Matrix network in order to get away with some of the bandwidth optimisations performed - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/coap-proxy#limitations">coap-proxy's Limitations section</a> for details.  Particularly, please note that the encryption is homemade and not audited or fully reviewed or tested yet.  Also, we've released the code for the low-bandwidth transport, but we haven't released the &quot;fan-out routing&quot; implementation for Synapse as it needs a <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/">rethink</a> to be applicable to the public Matrix network.  You'll also want to run Riot/Web in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/2598">low-bandwidth mode</a> if you really wind down the bandwidth (suppressing avatars, read receipts, typing notifs and presence to avoid wasting precious bandwidth).</p>
<p>We also don't have an MSC for the CoAP-based transport yet, mainly due to lack of time whilst wanting to ensure the limitations are addressed first before we propose it as a formal alternative Matrix transport.  (We also first need to define negotiation mechanisms for entirely alternative CS &amp; SS transports!).  However, the quick overview is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>JSON is converted directly into CBOR (with a few substitutions made to shrink common patterns down)</li>
 	<li>HTTP is converted directly into CoAP (mapping the verbose API endpoints down to single-byte endpoints)</li>
 	<li>TLS is swapped out for <a href="https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html#noise-pipes">Noise Pipes</a> (XX + IK noise handshakes).  This gives us 1RTT setup (XX) for the first connection to a host, and 0RTT (IK) for all subsequent connections, and provides trust-on-first-use semantics when connecting to a server.  You can see the Noise state machine we maintain in go-coap's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-coap/blob/master/noise.go">noise.go</a>.</li>
 	<li>The CoAP headers are hoisted up above the Noise payload, letting us use them for framing the noise pipes without having duplicated framing headers at the CoAP & Noise layers.  We also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-coap/blob/e156f6bb5d3c728040ceffd09685610128d3c63c/conn.go#L340-L371">frame the Noise handshake packets as CoAP</a> with custom message types (250, 251 and 252).  We might be better off using <a href="https://github.com/core-wg/oscoap">OSCORE</a> for this, however, rather than hand-wrapping a custom encrypted transport...</li>
 	<li>The CoAP payload is compressed via <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/compress/flate/">Flate</a> using preshared compression tables derived from compressing large chunks of representative Matrix traffic. This could be significantly improved in future with streaming compression and dynamic tables (albeit seeded from a common set of tables).</li>
</ul>
The end result is that you end up taking about 90 bytes (including ethernet headers!) to send a typical Matrix message (and about 70 bytes to receive the acknowledgement).  This breaks down as as:
<ul>
 	<li>14 bytes of Ethernet headers</li>
 	<li>20 bytes of IP headers</li>
 	<li>8 bytes of UDP headers</li>
 	<li>16 bytes of Noise AEAD</li>
 	<li>6 bytes of CoAP headers</li>
 	<li>~26 bytes of compressed and encrypted CBOR</li>
</ul>
The Noise handshake on connection setup would take an additional 128 bytes (4x 32 byte Curve25519 DH values), either spread over 1RTT for initial setup or 0RTT for subsequent setups.
<p>At 100bps, 90 bytes takes 90*8/100 = 7.2s to send... which is just about usable in an extreme life and death situation where you can only get 100bps of connectivity (e.g. someone at the bottom of a ravine trying to trickle data over one bar of GPRS to the emergency services).  In practice, on a custom network, you could ditch the Ethernet and UDP/IP headers if on a point-to-point link for CS API, and ditch the encryption if the network physical layer was trusted - at which point we're talking ~32 bytes per request (2.5s to send at 100bps).  Then, there's still a whole wave of additional work that could be investigated, including...</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Smarter streaming compression (so that if a user says 'Hello?' three times in a row, the 2nd and 3rd messages are just references to the first pattern)</li>
 	<li>Hoisting Matrix transaction IDs up to the CoAP layer (reusing the CoAP msgId+token rather than passing around new Matrix transaction IDs, at the expense of requiring one Matrix txn per request)</li>
 	<li>Switching to CoAP OBSERVE for receiving data from the server (currently we long-poll /sync to receive data)</li>
 	<li>Switching access_tokens for PSKs or similar</li>
</ul>
...all of which could shrink the payload down even further.  That said, even in its current state, it's a massive improvement - roughly ~65x better than the equivalent HTTPS+JSON traffic.
<p>In practice, <strong>further work on low-bandwidth Matrix is dependent on finding a sponsor who's willing to fund the team to focus on this</strong>, as otherwise it's hard to justify spending time here in addition to all the less exotic business-as-usual Matrix work that we need to keep the core of Matrix evolving (finishing 1.0, finishing E2E encryption, speeding up Synapse, finishing Dendrite, rewriting Riot/Android etc).  However, the benefits here should be pretty obvious: massively reduced bandwidth and battery-life; resilience to catastrophic network conditions; faster sync times; and even a protocol suitable for push notifications (Matrix as e2e encrypted, decentralised, push!).  If you're interested in supporting this work, please contact <code>support at matrix.org</code>.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Heads up that<a href="https://modular.im"> Modular.im</a> (the paid hosting Matrix service provided by <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a>, the company who employs much of the Matrix core team) launched a pilot today for paid Matrix integrations in the form of paid sticker packs.  Yes kids, it's true - for only $0.50 you can slap Matrix and Riot hex stickers all over your chatrooms. It's a toy example to test the payments infrastructure and demonstrate the concept - the proceeds go towards funding development work on Matrix.org :)  
You can read more about over on <a href="https://www.modular.im/stickers">Modular's blog</a>.</p>
<p>We wanted to elaborate on this a bit from the Matrix.org perspective, specifically:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">We are categorically <strong>not</strong> baking payments or financial incentives as a first class citizen into Matrix, and we're not going to start moving stuff behind paywalls or similar.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">This demo is a proof-of-concept to illustrate how folks could do this sort of thing in general in Matrix - it's not a serious product in and of itself.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">What it shows is that an Integration Manager like Modular can be used as a way to charge for services in Matrix - whether that's digital content within an integration, or bots/bridges/etc. 
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">While Modular today gathers payments via credit-card (Stripe), it could certainly support other mechanisms (e.g. cryptocurrencies) in future.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The idea in future is for Modular to provide this as a mechanism that <em>anyone</em> can use to charge for content on Matrix - e.g. if you have your own sticker pack and want to sell it to people, you'll be able to upload it and charge people for it.
</li>
</ul>
Meanwhile, there's a lot of interesting stuff on the horizon with integration managers in general - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1236">MSC1236</a> and an upcoming MSC from TravisR (based around <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1286">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1286</a>) proposing new integration capabilities.  We're also hoping to implement inline widgets soon (e.g. chatbot buttons for voting and other semantic behaviour) which should make widgets even more interesting!
<p>So, feel free to go stick some hex stickers on your rooms if you like and help test this out.  In future there should be more useful things available :)</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We just got back from braving the snow in Brussels at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/">FOSDEM 2019</a> - Europe's biggest Open Source conference. I think it's fair to say we had an amazing time, with more people than ever before wanting to hang out and talk Matrix and discuss their favourite features (and bugs)!</p>
<p>The big news is that <strong>we released <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.0.html">r0.1 of Matrix's Server-Server API</a> </strong>late on Friday night - our first ever formal stable release of Matrix's Federation API, having addressed the core of the issues which have kept Federation in beta thus far. We'll go into more detail on this in a dedicated blog post, but this marks the first ever time that <strong>all</strong> of Matrix's APIs have had an official stable release.  All that remains before we declare Matrix out of beta is to release updates of the CS API (0.5) and possibly the IS API (0.2) and then we can formally declare the overall combination as Matrix 1.0 :D</p>
<p>We spoke about SS API r0.1 at length in <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/matrix_french_state/">our main stage FOSDEM talk </a>on Saturday - as well as showing off the Riot Redesign, the E2E Encryption Endgame and giving an update on the French Government deployment of Matrix and the focus it's given us on finally shipping Matrix 1.0! For those who weren't there or missed the livestream, here's the talk!  <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-01-FOSDEM-Matrix-1.0.pdf">Slides are available here</a>.</p>

<p>Then, on Sunday we had the opportunity to have a quick <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/matrix/">20 minute talk in the Real Time Comms dev room</a>, where we gave a tour of some of the work we've been doing recently to scale Matrix down to working on incredibly low bandwidth networks (100bps or less).  It's literally the opposite of the Matrix 1.0 / France talk in that it's a quick deep dive into a very specific problem area in Matrix - so, if you've been looking forward to Matrix finally having a better transport than HTTPS+JSON, here goes!  <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-03-FOSDEM-Low-Bandwidth.pdf">Slides are available here.</a></p>

<p>Huge thanks to everyone who came to the talks, and everyone who came to the stand or grabbed us for a chat! FOSDEM is an amazing way to be reminded in person that folks care about Matrix, and we've come away feeling more determined than ever to make Matrix as great as possible and provide a protocol+network which will replace the increasingly threatened proprietary communication silos. :)</p>
<p>Next up: Matrix 1.0...</p>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Today is one of those pivotal days for the Matrix ecosystem: we're incredibly excited to announce that the world's first ever dedicated homeserver hosting service is now fully available over at <a href="https://modular.im">https://modular.im</a>!  This really is a massive step for Matrix towards being a mature ecosystem, and we look forward to Modular being the first of many hosting providers in the years to come :D</p>
<p>Modular lets anyone spin up a dedicated homeserver and Riot via a super-simple web interface, rather than having to run and admin their own server.  It's built by New Vector (the startup who makes Riot and hires many of the Matrix core team), and comes from taking the various custom homeserver deployments for people like Status and TADHack and turning them into a paid service available to everyone.  You can even point your own DNS at it to get a fully branded dedicated homeserver for your own domain!</p>
<p><a href="https://modular.im"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3662 size-full" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/181022-Modular-featured.png" alt="" width="800" height="241" /></a></p>
<p>Anyway, for full details, check out the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/introducing-modular-awesome-hosting-for-riot-matrix-665a7a0c616">announcement over at the Riot blog</a>.  We're particularly excited that Modular helps increase Matrix's decentralisation, and is really forcing us to ensure that the Federation API is getting the attention it deserves.  Hopefully it'll also reduce some load from the Matrix.org homeserver! Modular will also help Matrix by directly funding Matrix development by the folks working at New Vector, which should in turn of course benefit the whole ecosystem.</p>
<p>Many people reading this likely already run their own servers, and obviously they aren't the target audience for Modular.  But for organisations who don't have a sysadmin or don't want to spend the time to run their own server, hopefully Modular gives a very cost-effective way of running your own dedicated reliable Matrix server without having to pay for a sysadmin :)</p>
<p>We're looking forward to see more of these kind of services popping up in the future from everywhere in the ecosystem, and have started a <a href="/hosting/">Matrix Hosting page</a> on the Matrix website so that everyone can advertise their own: don't hesitate to get in touch if you have a service to be featured!</p>
<p>If you're interested, please swing by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#modular:matrix.org">#modular:matrix.org</a> or feel free to shoot questions to <a href="mailto:support@modular.im">support@modular.im</a>.</p>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>We're incredibly excited that the Government of France has confirmed it is in the process of deploying a huge private federation of Matrix homeservers spanning the whole government, and developing a fork of Riot.im for use as their official secure communications client! The goal is to replace usage of WhatsApp or Telegram for official purposes.</p>
<p>It's a unbelievably wonderful situation that we're living in a world where governments genuinely care about openness, open source and open-standard based communications - and Matrix's decentralisation and end-to-end encryption is a perfect fit for intra- and inter-governmental communication.  Congratulations to France for going decentralised and supporting FOSS! We understand the whole project is going to be released entirely open source (other than the operational bits) - development is well under way and an early proof of concept is already circulating within various government entities.</p>
<p>I'm sure there will be more details from their side as the project progresses, but meanwhile here's the official press release, and an English translation too. We expect this will drive a lot of effort into maturing Synapse/Dendrite, E2E encryption and matrix-{'{'}react,ios,android{'}'}-sdk, which is great news for the whole Matrix ecosystem! The deployment is going to be speaking pure Matrix and should be fully compatible with other Matrix clients and projects in addition to the official client.</p>
<p>So: exciting times for Matrix.  Needless to say, if you work on Open Government projects in other countries, please get in touch - we're seeing that Matrix really is a sweet spot for these sort of use cases and we'd love to help get other deployments up and running.  We're also hoping it's going to help iron out many of the UX kinks we have in Riot.im today as we merge stuff back. We'd like to thank DINSIC (the Department responsible for the project) for choosing Matrix, and can't wait to see how the project progresses!</p>

<p>English Translation:</p>
<h3 id="the-french-state-creates-its-own-secure-instant-messenger">The French State creates its own secure instant messenger</h3>
<p>By the summer of 2018, the French State will have its own instant messenger, an alternative to WhatsApp and Telegram.</p>
<p>It will guarantee <b>secure, end-to-end encrypted conversations</b> without degradation of the user experience. It will be compatible with any mobile device or desktop, state or personal. In fact until now the installation of applications like WhatsApp or Telegram was not possible on professional mobile phones, which hindered easy sharing of information and documents.</p>
<p>Led by the <b>Interministerial Department of State Digital, Information and Communication Systems</b> (DINSIC), the project is receiving contributions from the <b>National Agency for Information System Security</b> (ANSSI), the IT Directorship (DSI) of the <b>Armed Forces</b> and the <b>Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs</b>.</p>
<p>The tool developed is based on <b>open source software</b> (Riot) that implements an <b>open standard</b> (Matrix). Powered by a Franco-British startup (New Vector), and benefiting from many contributions, this communication standard has already caught the attention of other states such as the <b>Netherlands</b> and <b>Canada</b>, with whom DINSIC collaborates closely.</p>
<p>The Matrix standard and its open source software are also used by private companies such as Thales, which has driven the teams to come together to ensure the interoperability of their tools and cooperate in the development of free and open source software.</p>
<p>After 3 months of development for a very limited cost, this tool is currently being tested in the State Secretary for Digital, DINSIC and in the IT departments of different ministries. It should be rolled out during the summer in administrations and cabinets.</p>
<p><b><i>&quot;With this new French solution, the state is demonstrating its ability to work in an agile manner to meet concrete needs by using open source tools and very low development costs. Sharing information in a secure way is essential not only for companies but also for a more fluid dialogue within administrations.&quot;</i> - Mounir Mahjoubi, Secretary of State to the Prime Minister, in charge of Digital.</b></p>
