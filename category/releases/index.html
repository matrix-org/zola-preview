                <p>Today we are issuing security releases of matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk to
patch a pair of High severity vulnerabilities
(<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2023-28427">CVE-2023-28427</a>
/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-mwq8-fjpf-c2gr">GHSA-mwq8-fjpf-c2gr</a>
for matrix-js-sdk and
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2023-28103">CVE-2023-28103</a>
/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-6g43-88cp-w5gv">GHSA-6g43-88cp-w5gv</a>
for matrix-react-sdk).</p>
<p>Affected clients include those which depend on the affected libraries, such as
Element Web/Desktop and Cinny. Releases of the affected clients should follow
shortly. We advise users of those clients to upgrade at their earliest
convenience.</p>
<p>The issues involve prototype pollution via events containing special strings in
key locations, which can temporarily disrupt normal functioning of
matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk, potentially impacting the consumer's
ability to process data safely.</p>
<p>Although we have only demonstrated a denial-of-service-style impact, we cannot
completely rule out the possibility of a more severe impact due to the
relatively extensive attack surface. We have therefore classified this as High
severity and strongly recommend upgrading as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>We found these issues during a codebase audit that we had <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/08/31/security-releases-matrix-js-sdk-19-4-0-and-matrix-react-sdk-3-53-0">previously
announced</a>
in an earlier security release of matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk. The
earlier release had already addressed a set of similar vulnerabilities that
were assigned
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE%2D2022%2D36059">CVE-2022-36059</a>
/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32">GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32</a>
and
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE%2D2022%2D36060">CVE-2022-36060</a>
/ <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-2x9c-qwgf-94xr">GHSA-2x9c-qwgf-94xr</a>,
which we had initially decided not to disclose until the completion of the
audit. Now that the audit is finished, we are disclosing those previous
advisories as well.</p>

                <p>Greetings Matrix fans! We've published Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.78.0">version 1.78</a>
as the new stable release this week. Synapse admins are encouraged to upgrade
to it at their convenience. Please take a look at the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.78/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1780">upgrade notes</a>
for any important information about upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="announcements">Announcements</h2>
<p>Please note that Synapse 1.78.0 replaces the <code>/_synapse/admin/v1/media/&lt;server_name&gt;/delete</code> admin API with an identical
endpoint at <code>/_synapse/admin/v1/media/delete</code>. Please update your tooling to use the new endpoint. The deprecated version
will be removed in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-stuff">The new stuff</h2>
<p>In case you were unaware, Synapse has a command line export data command which allows administrators to export data for
a specific user (you can read more about this command <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_faq.html#how-can-i-export-user-data">here</a>).
Synapse 1.78.0 updates this command adding account data to the user information that is returned by the export data command.</p>
<p>This version of Synapse also features a few changes to push rules, with implementations for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758">MSC3758</a>:
Add <code>event_property_is push</code> rule condition kind,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3966">MSC3966</a>: <code>event_property_contains</code> push rule condition, and the removal of the spurious <code>dont_notify</code>
action from the defaults for the <code>.m.rule.reaction</code> pushrule. These changes empower end users to more fully customise their
notification rules - MSC3758 allows users to ask to be notified when a field in an event contains any type of value, rather
than only matching on strings, and MSC3966 provides crucial scaffolding for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3952">MSC3952</a>: Intentional Mentions,
which aims to eliminate unintentional mentions and improve the experience of mentions in general.</p>
<p>Synapse v1.78.0 includes some fixes for faster-joins related bugs as we work out the kinks. Some of these include a fix
for a bug introduced in Synapse 1.76.0 where partially-joined rooms could not be deleted using the
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#delete-room-api">purge room API</a>, and
a fix for a bug introduced in Synapse 1.75 where the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/postgres.html#porting-from-sqlite">portdb script</a>
would fail to run after a room had been faster-joined. We continue to work to polish faster joins, and thank everyone who
filed an issue.</p>
<p>Finally, for those deployments using workers, v1.78.0 fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.76 where 5s delays would
occasionally occur.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>See the full <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.78.0">changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in the release. Also please have a look at the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.78/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1780">upgrade
notes</a>.</p>

as the new stable release this week. Synapse admins are encouraged to upgrade
to it at their convenience.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-stuff">The new stuff</h2>
<h3 id="experimental-support-for-intentional-mentions-msc3952">Experimental support for intentional mentions (MSC3952)</h3>
<p>Mentioning other users on Matrix is difficult: it is not possible to know if mentioning a user
by display name or Matrix ID will count as a mention, but is also too easy to mistakenly mention a user.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3952">MSC3952</a> proposes a solution. Its idea is to make the mentioning explicit in the protocol using a dedicated event property,
instead of relying on searching the body of the message as before.</p>
<p>Synapse now implements this as an experimental feature.</p>
<h3 id="experimental-support-to-suppress-notifications-from-message-edits-msc3958">Experimental support to suppress notifications from message edits (MSC3958)</h3>
<p>Have you ever been annoyed by a noisy notification that keep coming back, but you can't pinpoint
where it's coming from?
This is usually because edits to a message where you are mentioned (or that mention <code>@room</code>) will
retrigger a noisy notification. That can be pretty annoying when the message is edited 10 times!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3958">MSC3958</a>
is here to solve that, and Synapse now implements it as an experimental feature.</p>
<h3 id="the-quest-for-speed-continues">The quest for speed continues!</h3>
<p>Some iterative optimizations have been implemented that should make <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14971">joining or leaving</a>
large rooms even faster, and should also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14962">improve sending message</a>.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>

                <p>Hey all,</p>
<p><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/">Matrix 1.6</a> is out there! Like Matrix 1.5 <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/11/17/matrix-v-1-5-release">back in November</a>, this release is largely a maintenance update. Matrix 1.1 through 1.4 have been relatively major upgrades, so a little time between features doesn’t feel like a bad idea :)</p>
<p>As with all spec releases, we encourage implementations to gradually update over the next few months rather than have support for everything on release day - please be kind to the projects you use, and help them gain support if able.</p>
<p>Matrix 1.6 sees just 7 MSCs get merged, though this is to be expected from a maintenance release. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPJ9zFV5IE">Matthew’s Matrix 2.0 talk</a> at FOSDEM for an idea of what’s expected over the next few releases.</p>
<p>We’ve covered a couple of the MSCs below, but read on to the full changelog for the full picture.</p>
<h2 id="msc3030-jump-to-date-api">MSC3030: Jump to date API</h2>
<p>_It’s here! The time machine we’ve been waiting for! _</p>
<p>Primarily part of the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Gitter feature parity project</a> (congratulations to the team <a href="https://blog.gitter.im/2023/02/13/gitter-has-fully-migrated-to-matrix/">going all-in on Matrix</a>, by the way) to drive the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive">Matrix Public Archive</a>, the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1roomsroomidtimestamp_to_event">new API</a> gives clients the ability to jump back in time to a nearby event. Being able to find something that was posted on a given day/week, but not being sure of which keywords to look for is a major usability improvement - many thanks to the Gitter team for making Matrix better!</p>
<h2 id="msc3706-faster-joins-part-1">MSC3706: Faster joins (part 1)</h2>
<p><em>Matrix is going voom</em></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/01/31/synapse-1-76-released">Synapse 1.76</a> enabled faster joins by default, and while there’s a lot of Python going into making joins as fast as possible, the specification side is a relatively small change at the moment: <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/server-server-api/#put_matrixfederationv2send_joinroomideventid">just don’t send as many events during joins</a> (<code>omit_members</code>).</p>
<p>There’s potentially more work on the horizon for making faster joins even faster and more robust, and some of that might involve spec work: keep an eye on Synapse releases and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix">TWIM</a> for updates as we make our way to faster joins in Matrix 2.0 :)</p>
<h2 id="the-full-changelog">The full changelog</h2>
<p>MSCs are how the spec changes in the way it does - adding, fixing, and maintaining features for the whole ecosystem to use. Check out the full changelog below, and the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/proposals/">Spec Change Proposals</a> page for more information on how these MSCs got merged (hint: they submitted a proposal, which anyone can do - take a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkZz60RRfc">Matrix Live episode</a> where Matthew covers the proposal process).</p>

                <p>Greetings Matrix fans! We've published Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.76.0">version 1.76</a>
as the new stable release this week. Synapse admins are encouraged to upgrade
to it at their convenience. Please take a look at the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.76/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1760">upgrade notes</a>
for any important information about upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="announcements">Announcements</h2>
<p>The big news is that faster joins for all has arrived! When joining a room for the first time,
Synapse 1.76.0 will request a partial join from the other server by default. Previously, server admins
had to opt-in to this using an experimental config flag.</p>
<p>Server admins can opt out of this feature for the time being by setting</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>experimental:
</span><span>    faster_joins: false
</span></code></pre>
<p>in their server config.</p>
<p>For everyone else, after a faster join Synapse considers that room &quot;partially joined&quot;. In this state, you should be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>read incoming messages (on clients which support lazy-loaded members in /sync);</li>
<li>see incoming state changes, e.g. room topic changes; and</li>
<li>send messages, if the room is unencrypted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Synapse has to spend more effort to complete the join in the background. Once this finishes, you will be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>send messages, if the room is encrypted;</li>
<li>retrieve room history from before your join, if permitted by the room settings; and</li>
<li>access the full list of room members.</li>
</ul>
<p>Practically, this means that the experience of joining a large room over federation should be greatly improved. In past
versions of Synapse, joining a large room such as Matrix HQ over federation could take up to 30 mins. This time has been
cut to ~20-30 seconds to partially join in the new release. Those of you who have been watching this know this has been
a huge undertaking, big shout out to the team for getting it over the line! We're excited the community to try it, as
always if you encounter any problems you are encouraged to file an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=BUG_REPORT.yml">issue</a>.</p>
<h3 id="changes-to-the-account-data-replication-streams">Changes to the account data replication streams</h3>
<p>Please note that Synapse has changed the format of the account data and devices replication streams (between workers).
This is a forwards- and backwards-incompatible change: v1.75 workers cannot process account data replicated by v1.76
workers, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Once all workers are upgraded to v1.76 (or downgraded to v1.75), account data and device replication will resume as normal.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-stuff">The new stuff</h2>
<h3 id="the-default-room-version-has-now-been-updated-to-v10">The default room version has now been updated to <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/rooms/v10/">v10</a></h3>
<p>Room version 10 is now the default room version in Synapse 1.76.0. This room version builds on v9 to introduce a new
<code>knock_restricted</code> join rule, allowing prospective members to more easily join such a room. The <code>knock_restricted</code> join
rule allows for prospective members of a room to join either through knocking or through <code>join_restrictions</code>, which allows
prospective members to join a restricted room based on whether they are a joined member of another room. You can read more
about restricted rooms <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms">here</a>.</p>

<p>Synapse has added some new, default push rules for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3381">MSC3881</a>-esque event types.</p>
<p>This allows for notifications from polls, ie when a poll starts or ends.</p>

as the new stable release this week. Synapse admins are encouraged to upgrade

was eaten by Santa's reindeer, so this post will also cover changes from it.</p>
<h2 id="announcements">Announcements</h2>
<p>There were no special announcements for the 1.75 release.</p>
<h3 id="synapse-1-74-icu-dependency-for-improved-user-search">Synapse 1.74: ICU dependency for improved user search</h3>
<p>Synapse's search functionality has long been poor when searching for non-English
terms. Synapse 1.74 <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14464">introduced</a>
support for an optional improved user search experience which has a better
awareness of Unicode. To do so, we use the <a href="https://icu.unicode.org/">ICU library</a>
when Synapse is installed alongside the binding library <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyICU/">PyICU</a>.</p>
<p>Synapse installations using Matrix.org docker images or debian packages will
automatically have the new search mode enabled.</p>
<p>From-source installations will need to include the <code>user-search</code> extra when
<code>pip install</code> Synapse, e.g. <code>pip install matrix-synapse[user-search]</code>.
<strong>NB:</strong> because PyICU is not distributed as source-only on PyPI, you will need
to ensure the ICU development headers are available on your system. See the
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.75/upgrade.html#unicode-support-in-user-search">upgrade notes</a>
for more info.</p>
<p>Please try out the new search mode and let us know how you find it in practice.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-stuff">The new stuff</h2>
<h3 id="support-rfc7636-proof-key-for-code-exchange-for-oauth-single-sign-on">Support <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636">RFC7636</a> Proof Key for Code Exchange for OAuth single sign-on</h3>
<p>Synapse 1.75 adds support for RFC7636 code challenges in the OAuth 2.0 flow.</p>
<p>This is required by Twitter SSO and enabling it can protect against the
&quot;authorization code interception attack&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="experimental-support-for-removing-account-data-msc3391">Experimental support for removing account data (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3391">MSC3391</a>)</h3>
<p>Experimental support for removing account data has landed in Synapse.
It was previously possible to create or update account data but not remove them, this is now possible.</p>
<p>The support is experimental and needs to be enabled with a configuration flag since the MSC hasn't landed yet.</p>
<h3 id="more-faster-remote-room-joins-fixes-and-improvements">More faster remote room joins fixes and improvements</h3>
<p>In case you missed it we are working on dramatically improve performance of remote room joins, you can refer
to <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/18/testing-faster-remote-room-joins">this blog post</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The last two Synapse releases brings that a lot closer to a proper release; in
particular they contain a lot of work to support faster joins in deployments
with multiple workers. The project continues in earnest; we hope to have more to
show off in the coming weeks.</p>

                <p>And here is another update to your beloved Matrix homeserver implementation, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.73.0">Synapse
1.73</a>.</p>
<h2 id="announcements">Announcements</h2>
<h3 id="legacy-prometheus-metric-names-removed">Legacy Prometheus metric names removed</h3>
<p>When releasing <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/17/synapse-1-69-released#upcoming-removal-of-deprecated-prometheus-metric-names">Synapse 1.69</a>
a couple of months ago, we also announced the removal of old Prometheus metrics that have been replaced by more aptly named ones. 
he list of these metrics can be found <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.73/metrics-howto.html#renaming-of-metrics--deprecation-of-old-names-in-12">here</a>.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.73 implements the final phase of this plan and entirely removes support for those metrics. As a result,
the <code>enable_legacy_metrics</code> configuration option, which was introduced in
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/11/22/synapse-1-72-released#announcements">Synapse 1.71</a>, has also been removed.</p>
<p>Server administrators who are still relying on these legacy metric names are encouraged to update their dashboards at their earliest convenience.
For more information, please refer to the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.73/upgrade#legacy-prometheus-metric-names-have-now-been-removed">upgrade notes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-stuff">The new stuff</h2>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>A bunch of performance improvements have been included in this release, specifically around
the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3roomsroomidmessages"><code>/messages</code></a> endpoint.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14527">Improvements to event filtering on the client-server API</a> gave the matrix.org homeserver a first nice bump as visible on this graph:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-12-07-apdex-filter-events-improvement.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Various optimizations around <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14491">fetching</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14508">bundled</a>
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14510">aggregations</a> resulted in yet another nice improvement:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/img/2022-12-07-bundled-aggregations-improvement.png"><img src="/blog/img/2022-12-07-bundled-aggregations-improvement.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Note that the graph from the first image, and the second graph from the second image are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">apdexes</a>, which
is a measure that shows improvement when it goes up (as opposed to e.g. response times, which improve
when they go down).</p>
<h3 id="extensible-events-experimental-support">Extensible Events experimental support</h3>
<p>Experimental support for Extensible Events has landed in Synapse.</p>
<p>This is exciting since this global rework of events presentation has been in talks
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">for a while</a>, and
having an implementation to experiment with greatly helps bringing the feature
closer to completion.</p>
<p>Note that this support is still very much experimental as the related MSCs are still
under review and could change at any time, and therefore not recommended for use
in production.</p>

                <p>It's not Christmas yet, but it's time for a new release! Say hello to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.72.0">Synapse
1.72</a>.</p>
<p>It seems like this blog didn't self update through AI for the 2 preceding
updates so this post will cover 1.70 to 1.72, sorry if this is a bit long but
it's been a while :)</p>
<h2 id="announcements">Announcements</h2>
<h3 id="dropping-support-for-postgresql-10">Dropping support for PostgreSQL 10</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL 10 has reached End Of Life: Synapse will no longer support it
beginning with version 1.72 so please upgrade your database if you have not
already done so.</p>
<h3 id="legacy-prometheus-metric-names-disabled-and-to-be-removed">Legacy Prometheus metric names disabled and to be removed</h3>
<p>In previous versions of Synapse, some Prometheus metrics were emitted under two
different names, an older name that was non-compliant with OpenMetrics and
Prometheus conventions and a new compliant name.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.71 and later have the old metric names switched off by default.</p>
<p>For now it's still possible to get them by using <code>enable_legacy_metrics: true</code>,
however server administrators still using legacy metric names are highly
encouraged to migrate, as they will be removed in 1.73.</p>
<p>You can find the full list of renamed metrics
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.72/metrics-howto.html#renaming-of-metrics--deprecation-of-old-names-in-12">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="changes-to-the-events-received-by-application-services-interest">Changes to the events received by application services (interest)</h3>
<p>Following the implementation of
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3905">MSC3905</a>,
Synapse now only considers local users to be interesting to application
services. In other words, the users namespace regex in an app service's
registration file is only applied against local users of the homeserver.</p>
<p>Please note, this probably doesn't affect the expected behavior of your
application service, since an interesting local user in a room still means all
messages in the room (from local or remote users) will still be considered
interesting.</p>
<p>You can find a bit more info in the MSC and in the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.71/upgrade.html#changes-to-the-events-received-by-application-services-interest">upgrade
notes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-stuff">The new stuff</h2>
<h3 id="threads-threads-threads">Threads, threads, threads!</h3>
<p>Several MSCs related to threads got implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3856">MSC3856</a>
provide an API to fetch threads and related metadata.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3771">MSC3771</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773">MSC3773</a>
implementing per thread read receipts and per thread notification counts.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3874">MSC3874</a>
allows to filter out messages belonging to threads from the main timeline
(still considered experimental). Along with MSC3856, this should noticeably
improve performance of rooms that use threads heavily.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should significantly improve user experience related to threads, being
through behavior or performance impact.</p>
<h3 id="linking-events-together">Linking events together</h3>
<p>Relationships are great, even more between events than humans!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3664">MSC3664</a> allows
Matrix clients to be notified in real time of related events, so you can now be
made quickly aware of this cat emoji reaction that your cat photo clearly
deserved.</p>
<p>Additionally, Synapse 1.72 includes an implementation of
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3912">MSC3912</a>,
allowing users to redact the relations of a message alongside the message
itself. This is particularly helpful in cases like edits, where users usually
want to see their edits redacted at the same time as the original message. Note
that this implementation is currently incomplete and still experimental, though,
so watch this space!</p>
<h3 id="faster-joins-continued">Faster joins, continued</h3>
<p>We continue our journey to get everything going as transparently as possible
when doing fast remote room joins.</p>
<p>If you missed it you can refer to this previous <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/18/testing-faster-remote-room-joins">blog
post</a> to
get a lot more infos, and feel free to grep Synapse changelog and the numerous

                <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>We’ve just released <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5">Matrix 1.5</a>, a largely maintenance update for the spec. We intentionally haven’t landed any major features in this release as Matrix 1.4, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/29/matrix-v-1-4-release">just shy of 2 months ago</a>, had introduced fairly large features for clients and servers to consider. As with all spec releases, we encourage implementations to gradually update over the next few months rather than expect them to have support for everything on release day.</p>
<p>Matrix 1.5 sees just 2 MSCs get merged, though this is to be expected from a maintenance release. We expect that the next release (in Q1 2023) will have a few more exciting features to it :)</p>
<p>We’ve covered both MSCs below, but read on to the full changelog for the full picture.</p>
<h2 id="msc3267-reference-relations">MSC3267: Reference relations</h2>
<p>Already supported implicitly by the spec up until now, <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#reference-relations">reference relations</a> are a way to simply reference another event. Usually these sorts of relations are used for events which need to be related to each other, but a dedicated relationship type doesn’t make a lot of sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#key-verification-framework">In-room verification</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3381">MSC3381: Polls</a> are examples of how these relations get used.</p>
<h2 id="msc3905-clarify-appservice-interest-in-user-ids">MSC3905: Clarify appservice interest in user IDs</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3905">MSC3905</a> fixes an issue in the specification where appservices (usually bridges) specifying a users regex without homeserver domain would end up receiving far more event traffic than they would have intended. With the MSC, appservices are now only considered interested in “local” users, regardless of how vague their users namespace is.</p>
<p>Overall this should have no effect on most bridges/appservices, however if an appservice in the wild really does need to listen to all users on all homeservers, it can specify a non-exclusive namespace on all rooms instead.</p>
<p>While writing this MSC into the spec we took some time to clarify the appservice registration requirements more generally: check them out <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/application-service-api/#registration">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-full-changelog">The full changelog</h2>
<p>MSCs are how the spec changes in the way it does - adding, fixing, and maintaining features for the whole ecosystem to use. Check out the full changelog below, and the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/proposals/">Spec Change Proposals</a> page for more information on how these MSCs got merged (hint: they submitted a proposal, which anyone can do - take a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkZz60RRfc">Matrix Live episode</a> where Matthew covers the proposal process).</p>

                <p>Hey everyone, it's time for a new Synapse release! <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.69.0">Synapse
1.69</a> is out, fresh
out of the oven. But before we take a look at it, here's a quick announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have recently disclosed a moderate severity security vulnerability, which
was fixed in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/07/06/synapse-1-62-released/">Synapse
1.62</a> (released on
July 5th 2022). This issue affects all homeservers running a version of
Synapse older than 1.62 with open federation. If this is the case for your
deployment, please update to a more recent version of Synapse at your earliest
convenience.</p>
<p>See advisory
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-jhjh-776m-4765">GHSA-jhjh-776m-4765</a>
