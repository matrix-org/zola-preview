                <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>It’s another quarter and therefore <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/">another spec release</a>! Matrix 1.2 was <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/02/matrix-v-1-2-release">released</a> back in February, and while a bit late in the quarter this time around we’ve still got some exciting additions coming to you in this release.</p>
<p>Like last time, the speed of these releases might feel a bit quick for developers: fret not if you’re still working on v1.1 or v1.2 implementations. We’re not expecting that implementations update as soon as a new spec release is published, but rather that the ecosystem gradually update over the course of the next few months. Implementations should be aiming for as close to realtime as they can get though, particularly considering v1.4 is expected to have some large features (more on that later on).</p>
<p>Matrix 1.3 sees 14 MSCs get merged, but we can’t possibly go into detail on them all here. We’ve picked some notable highlights and recommend the full changelog at the bottom for a complete idea of what’s been going on.</p>
<h2 id="aggregations-and-the-relationships-made-along-the-way">Aggregations and the relationships made along the way</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1849">MSC1849</a>-style server-side aggregation of related messages have been in the review backlog for a while. We ended up splitting <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1849">MSC1849</a> down into more reviewable chunks like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2675">MSC2675</a>, allowing us to finally land the first pieces into Matrix 1.3 today.</p>
<p>In the spec there aren’t currently any defined relationships which make use of aggregations or even the <code>rel_type</code> described by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2674">MSC2674</a>, but we do expect that v1.4 of the spec will have support for at least threads (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>) and edits (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676</a>), filling the gap. For now, we’ve decided that holding aggregations back until v1.4 doesn’t make a lot of sense, so we have launched them into the world as-is for custom relations or for clients &amp; servers to prepare for what’s expected to be coming in v1.4 of the spec.</p>
<p>To further prepare for threads, we’ve also removed some restrictions of rich replies through <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3676">MSC3676</a>, thus allowing replies to be constructed with non-text messages like images. Check out the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#rich-replies">new rich replies module</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="join-if-you-can-or-just-knock">Join if you can, or just knock</h2>
<p>When we launched restricted rooms in Matrix 1.2 we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/02/matrix-v-1-2-release#public-but-not-too-public-join-rules">noted</a> that we forgot to handle a case where someone might want to support <em>both</em> knocking and restricted rooms at the same time. We’ve fixed that with a stop-gap join rule from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3787">MSC3787</a> in <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/rooms/v10/">room version 10</a>.</p>
<p>The new <code>knock_restricted</code> join rule allows the room to keep its desire to be restricted whilst also allowing members who do not meet the criteria to knock on the room instead. We’ll likely expand on this sort of mixing of join rules in proposals like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3386">MSC3386</a> down the line, however for now this should cover the gap in support. Next up: figuring out how to make encrypted room history available to these new joiners in a safe way.</p>
<h2 id="a-thread-for-next-time">A thread for next time</h2>
<p>Originally planned for this release, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>-style threads are anticipated to be ready for v1.4 (next quarter) with support for notifications and, of course, a whole new way to communicate in a room.</p>
<p>Threads are one of the more complicated features we’ve tried to land in recent history as it has a large impact on a wide variety of the spec: everything from event relationships (fixed in this release) to read receipts to push notifications needs to be worked out to build a system that not only users can understand, but also the developers trying to build it. With this massive surface area we just weren’t comfortable with adding threads to v1.3 as-is, given problems like notifications aren’t yet fully solved.</p>
<p>Alongside threads, we also anticipate that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676</a>-style message editing will be landing in v1.4, finally specifying how to update an event’s contents without having to redact &amp; re-send. Although message editing has been supported for a long time in some clients, we're excited that it will finally become part of the official specification, meaning it can be implemented more widely. Messaging clients are encouraged to give the proposal an early read and possibly even attempt implementation if not already done to help us ensure the system is in a reasonable state for inclusion in the spec, though we do note that feature requests for edits will likely be deferred to a future MSC.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix">This Week In Matrix</a> for updates on what v1.4 is expected to include, and how things are progressing.</p>
<h2 id="the-full-changelog">The full changelog</h2>
<p>MSCs are how the spec changes in the way it does - adding, fixing, and maintaining features for the whole ecosystem to use. The blog post can’t cover them all, but that doesn’t make them any less important! Check out the full changelog below, and the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals/">Spec Change Proposals</a> page for more information on how these MSCs got merged (hint: they submitted a proposal, which anyone can do - take a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkZz60RRfc">Matrix Live episode</a> where Matthew covers the proposal process).</p>

                <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.59.0">Synapse 1.59</a> is
out! Let's see what's new in this version.</p>
<h2 id="generic-worker-types">Generic worker types</h2>
<p>When Synapse instances are subject to high load, it can be useful to use workers
to balance the load more effectively. Workers are separate processes that can
take some of the load off the main Synapse process, and allow the homeserver to
scale more effectively.</p>
<p>In the past, Synapse only provided a specific set of types of workers, each
capable of handling a specific set of operations. For some time now we have been
working on allowing more flexibility around worker configuration, which started
all the way back in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/03/23/synapse-1-12-0-released">Synapse
1.12.0</a> with the
introduction of a generic worker application type.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.59 furthers this work by deprecating the <code>synapse.app.appservice</code> and
<code>synapse.app.user_dir</code> worker application types. Homeserver administrators
should change the configuration of instances using these types to the generic
<code>synapse.app.generic_worker</code> application type, and use the
<code>notify_appservices_from_worker</code> and <code>update_user_directory_from_worker</code> to
delegate application service and user directory work (respectively) to a worker.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.59/upgrade.html#deprecation-of-the-synapseappappservice-and-synapseappuser_dir-worker-application-types">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information on this change.</p>
<h2 id="push-rules">Push rules</h2>
<p>Push rules allow Matrix clients to define notification rules on a homeserver.
One often reported issue with notification in Matrix is the fact that
notifications are sent out when server ACLs, which define which server(s) can
and cannot interact in a room, change. This is especially annoying during big
waves of abuse, as there might be multiple servers that need to be banned from
rooms, thus causing a lot of unneeded notifications.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.59 now supports silencing server ACL updates, by implementing the new
push rule documented in
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3786">MSC3786</a>.
However, since this MSC hasn't been incorporated into the spec yet, this
behaviour is disabled by default in Synapse: see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12601">the implementation pull
request</a> for more information
on turning it on.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.59 also allows third-party modules to validate and change the actions
associated with an existing push rule via the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/d24a1486e5c5d69a8798a9d159fd9e06dfc8c3e3/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L1360-L1420">Module
API</a>.
This is helpful for modules wishing to, for example, configuring specific
notification settings when new users register.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>As of Synapse 1.59, Synapse will not communicate the name of devices over
federation (unless configured otherwise), in order to better preserve user
privacy. See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.59/upgrade.html#device-name-lookup-over-federation-has-been-disabled-by-default">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>Also note that we have issued a patch release for 1.59 (1.59.1) which fixes a
long-standing bug that started to bite a good amount of server administrators.
Server admins that are looking into upgrading their instance to Synapse 1.59 are
recommended to upgrade to 1.59.1 rather than 1.59.0.</p>

out! Let's dive into this new release.</p>
<h2 id="poetry">Poetry</h2>
<p>If you've been reading the past few Synapse release announcements, you might
have already heard about our efforts to integrate
<a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> into Synapse. Poetry is a tool which
manages dependencies of a Python project. Its killer feature is its lockfile,
which explicitly pins all dependencies (direct and transitive) to a fixed
version, even across multiple Python versions and platforms. See more about why
we choose Poetry <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11537">here</a>.</p>
<p>During the past few months, we've been hard at work converting Synapse and its
CI to use Poetry. The goal is to make our Docker images and Debian packages more
reproducible and to provide a fixed, known-good environment for CI. This will
help us to ensure the stability and security of Synapse installations.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.57's Docker image was the first to use Poetry; after a successful
trial, this was extended to Synapse 1.58's Debian packages. Installations from
PyPI using <code>pip</code> will <em>not</em> use the locked environment, though everyone is
welcome to install from source using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/poetry.lock">our
lockfile</a>.</p>
<p>Huge props to <a href="https://github.com/DMRobertson">David</a> from the Synapse team for
leading the work on this front.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse also includes performance improvements around sharing
device list updates, which should greatly improve login times for large Matrix
accounts.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.58 also features the implementation of two MSCs:
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3383">MSC3383</a> to
include a <code>destination</code> parameter in federation authentication headers, and
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2815">MSC2815</a> which
(if enabled) allows room moderators to see the content of a redacted event (as
long as it hasn't already been deleted by the homeserver).</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.0">full
changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the

                <p>We've released updates to matrix-appservice-irc and our forked node-irc that it depends on to patch a High security vulnerability.
It's advised to update to 0.34.0 as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate a Matrix user into executing IRC commands
by having them reply to a maliciously crafted message.</p>
<p>Incorrect handling of a CR character allowed for making part of the message be sent to the IRC server verbatim
rather than as a message to the channel.</p>
<p>If you are currently a matrix-appservice-irc user, exercise caution when replying to messages from untrusted participants
in IRC bridged rooms until your bridge instance has been upgraded.</p>
<p>The vulnerability has been patched in node-irc version 1.2.1 and matrix-appservice-irc 0.34.0.
You can get the release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.34.0">on Github</a>.</p>
<p>The bridges running on the Libera Chat, OFTC and other networks bridged by the Matrix.org Foundation have been patched.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities are tracked as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-37hr-348p-rmf4">GHSA-37hr-348p-rmf4</a> and

                <p>Hey everyone! Guess what? <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.57.0">Synapse
1.57</a> has just been
released! Let's see what's new in this version!</p>
<h2 id="application-services">Application services</h2>
<p>Application services are piece of software that have privileged access to some
of the homeserver's features. For example, they can create and manage multiple
users at the same time, which is especially useful for bridges.</p>
<p>This release of Synapse changes the way Synapse manually manages transaction
identifiers when talking to application services (a transaction being a group of
events the application service should know about). While this doesn't have much
impact on the everyday life of a server administrator (besides fixing a
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12209">bug</a> and paving the way for
future performance improvements), this change means server admins should take
extra care when updating Synapse.</p>
<p>More specifically, if you are running a dedicated Synapse worker for handling
traffic related to application services, this worker <strong>must</strong> be stopped when
upgrading the main Synapse process to ensure the update is performed safely. See
the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.57/upgrade#changes-to-database-schema-for-application-services">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information about this change, and instructions on recovering from an
incorrect upgrade.</p>
<p>This release of Synapse also continues work on bringing end-to-end capabilities
to application services, which I was already telling you about in the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/01/18/synapse-1-50-released">Synapse
1.50 release blog
post</a>. More
specifically, Synapse now supports sending device list updates to applications
services, as part of implementing
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3202">MSC3202</a>. This
is still very experimental and definitely not production ready, but also very
exciting!</p>
<h2 id="improvements-to-the-module-system">Improvements to the module system</h2>
<p>Modules allow third-party developers to expand Synapse with extra features that
wouldn't necessarily fit into the Matrix specification and/or ecosystem. In the
past release of Synapse, we have been improving this system to add more
functionality to it, and this one is no exception!</p>
<p>Synapse modules can now implement new callbacks to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.57/modules/account_data_callbacks.html#on_account_data_updated">react to account data
updates</a>,
as well as to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.57/modules/third_party_rules_callbacks.html#on_threepid_bind">react to new 3PID (email address, phone number)
associations</a>.
On the latter, note that this callback will only be called after a 3PID has been
validated on the homeserver, and does not trigger when the validation happens on
an identity server (e.g. when publishing a 3PID so that other users can look it
up).</p>
<p>The <code>ModuleApi</code> (which is the Python class enabling modules to interact with
Synapse) has also been updated to allow module to read and write global account
data. This can be done by using the new
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/e31d06f6f0923d001736f5e6e08616293bd4b120/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L1401-L1464"><code>AccountDataManager</code></a>
class, which can be accessed as <code>api.account_data_manager</code> (where <code>api</code> is an
instance of <code>ModuleApi</code>).</p>
<p>The module API has also been updated with a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/e31d06f6f0923d001736f5e6e08616293bd4b120/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L543-L552">new
method</a>,
to allow modules to promote an existing user to server administrator (or demote
a server administrator to a normal user). This follows up on an improvement
introduced in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/04/05/synapse-1-56-released">Synapse
1.56</a> allowing modules
to promote users to server administrators when registering them.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release also includes a performance improvement for workers handling
<code>/sync</code> requests. While this change makes starting this kind of workers slightly
more heavy performance-wise, it aims at improving the load associated with the
first <code>/sync</code> requests hitting it right after starting. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12367#issuecomment-1088574192">this
comment</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.57 also now includes bundled aggregations in message search results by
default, as
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3666">MSC3666</a> has
been accepted and has finished its final comment period.</p>

1.56</a> is out! Let's
have a look at what's new in this release.</p>
<h2 id="additional-restrictions-around-registration">Additional restrictions around registration</h2>
<p>One common abuse scenario we have seen on Matrix over the years is attackers
making use of public homeservers with open registration to automatically create
multiple accounts in order to evade sanctions. Sometimes, this can lead to these
public homeservers being banned across multiple public rooms despite their
administrator(s) not being directly at fault.</p>
<p>In order to mitigate this, starting from this release, Synapse will refuse to
start by default if it is configured with open registration with no additional
verification. This means users wishing to register on these homeservers will
need to authenticate themselves, either via
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/8a519f8abc6de772167c2cca101d22ee2052fafc/docs/sample_config.yaml#L1285">email</a>,
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.56/CAPTCHA_SETUP.html">recaptcha</a> or

<h2 id="so-long-groups-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish">So long groups, and thanks for all the fish</h2>
<p>Long-time users of Matrix might remember when, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2017/10/24/synapse-0-24-is-here">way back in
2017</a>, we introduced
groups (also known as communities in some clients). Groups would let users
define a curated set of users and rooms to represent a given community that
others could refer to. We even used to have <code>+matrix:matrix.org</code> which was
the official group for the Matrix team and community.</p>
<p>If this sounds a bit familiar to you (and remind you of a certain other feature
of Matrix), that's no coincidence. Some time ago, we had already identified a
good amount of shortcomings with groups, and decided to redesign the feature
entirely and release it under the name &quot;spaces&quot;. If you're curious about this,
then you may wish to read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/17/the-matrix-space-beta">spaces announcement
blogpost</a> we released
at the time.</p>
<p>Now that spaces have been out of beta for some time, and have shown to be a very
useful feature to the ecosystem, we decided it was time to retire support for
groups from Synapse, after more than 4 years of good and loyal service. This
release of Synapse deprecates the feature, with a plan to disable it by default
in Synapse 1.58 (which is expected to be released next month).</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>As of this version, Synapse will also refuse to start the if the Postgres
database it is running against has a non-<code>C</code> locale, in order to prevent
accidental database corruption. See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.56/upgrade.html#change-in-behaviour-for-postgresql-databases-with-unsafe-locale">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>This release also includes the ability for modules to register server
administrators through the <code>register_user</code> method, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.56.0/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L1290-L1312">new
method</a>
to allow modules to store external 3PID associations into Synapse's database.</p>

                <p>Hi all, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.0">Synapse
1.55</a> is out! Let's
see the main talking points of this new release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update: After the initial release of Synapse 1.55, the developers of a
third-party tool (Jinja, which is the tool Synapse uses to render email and
web templates) released a new version of their project which proved
incompatible with Synapse. To address this issue, we have released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.2">Synapse
1.55.2</a>.</p>
<p>Deployments of Synapse using the <code>matrixdotorg/synapse</code> Docker image or Debian
packages from <code>packages.matrix.org</code> are not affected as they are already using
a compatible version of the tool.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the work we are doing to integrate
<a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> into Synapse (more on that a bit further
in this post) will, once completed, prevent this kind of issues from
happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="removing-support-for-mjolnir-1-3-1-and-older">Removing support for Mjolnir 1.3.1 and older</h2>
<p>Administrators of large homeservers and communities will already be familiar
with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir">Mjolnir</a>, which is a tool designed
to help them moderate a large number of rooms in an efficient way. It includes a
bot as well as a Synapse module to better interface with the homeserver.</p>
<p>Due to a change in how we manage some of Synapse's internal utilities, this
release of Synapse breaks compatibility with Mjolnir versions 1.3.1 and older.
Homeserver administrators using Mjolnir and upgrading to Synapse 1.55 should
make sure they're running Mjolnir version 1.3.2 or later.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.55/upgrade#compatibility-dropped-for-mjolnir-131-and-earlier">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="moving-synctl">Moving <code>synctl</code></h2>
<p><code>synctl</code> is a tool provided as part of Synapse to run and manage your instance
and its workers (if any).</p>
<p>As part of our work to integrate <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> in Synapse
(which in turn will enable a lot of cool things, such as reproducible builds),
we have recently moved the way we package this tool. As of this release,
homeserver administrators should stop invoking it using its direct path (e.g.
<code>/path/to/synctl start</code>), but should instead call it directly, e.g. <code>synctl start</code>.</p>
<p>This means homeserver administrators using <code>synctl</code> must make sure that the tool
is in their <code>PATH</code>. This is automatically done when installing and upgrading
Synapse using the <code>matrixdotorg/synapse</code> Docker image or Debian packages from
<code>packages.matrix.org</code>. When installing from a wheel, sdist, or PyPI, an
executable is created in your Python installation's <code>bin</code> directory.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.55/upgrade#synctl-script-has-been-moved">upgrade
notes</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release also introduces new module callbacks, allowing homeserver
administrators to more efficiently review which users are able to deactivate
users and shutdown rooms. More information on that in <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.55/modules/third_party_rules_callbacks.html#check_can_shutdown_room">Synapse's
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>We have also started experimenting with using the native Python asyncio event
loop in Synapse which, if successful, would make it easier to use building
blocks from the Python ecosystem when adding new features to Synapse.</p>

                <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.54.0">Synapse 1.54</a> is
out! Let's see what goodness is coming your way with this new release.</p>
<h2 id="improving-url-previews">Improving URL previews</h2>
<p>As part of the Matrix specification, Matrix clients have the option to rely on
the homeserver to generate URL previews. This means the homeserver (in this case
Synapse) needs to have a look at the content at that URL and extract data to
send back to the client.</p>
<p>In the past, Synapse has had issues with generating complete URL previews, and
some metadata (e.g. image, description) would be missing from the data that
Synapse sends to clients. Synapse 1.54 includes improvements to the generation
of URL previews, and while testing it we've been able to observe improvements to
previews generated for Twitter and Reddit.</p>
<h2 id="new-module-callbacks">New module callbacks</h2>
<p>Synapse modules allow third-party developers to write extra features for
Synapse, that wouldn't necessarily be generic enough to fit within the Matrix
specification. This includes custom behaviours such as smarter event filters,
bespoke media storage providers, or spam checkers. Since we rewrote Synapse's
module system in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/30/security-update-synapse-1-37-1-released#synapse-137-release-announcement">Synapse
1.37</a>,
we have been improving it by adding new callback functions that module can
implement, allowing them to interface better with Synapse.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.54 includes three new module callbacks. One of them,
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.54/modules/password_auth_provider_callbacks.html#get_displayname_for_registration"><code>get_displayname_for_registration</code></a>,
allows modules to define the display name for newly registered users. Together
with the existing
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.54/modules/password_auth_provider_callbacks.html#get_username_for_registration"><code>get_username_for_registration</code></a>
introduced in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/08/synapse-1-52-released/">Synapse
1.52</a>, they allow
modules a better control over the user registration process.</p>
<p>The two other module callbacks introduced in Synapse 1.54,
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.54/modules/third_party_rules_callbacks.html#on_profile_update"><code>on_profile_update</code></a>
and
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.54/modules/third_party_rules_callbacks.html#on_user_deactivation_status_changed"><code>on_user_deactivation_status_changed</code></a>,
allow modules to react to profile changes, as well as the deactivation (or
reactivation) of users.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse also includes more work to make joining large Matrix
rooms faster (I was telling you about that in the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/22/synapse-1-53-released">Synapse 1.53 release
announcement</a>). While
it's still very experimental and not yet ready for show time, it's still very
exciting to see this work happening!</p>
<p>Synapse 1.54 also includes a change to the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientversions">client-side versions
endpoint</a>
to advertise Matrix 1.1 and 1.2. See the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/02/matrix-v-1-2-release">Matrix
1.2</a> release
announcement to read all about the changes this latest version of the
specification brings to the ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="stabilisation-of-registration-tokens">Stabilisation of registration tokens</h2>
<p>Registration tokens is a feature introduced in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.42.0">Synapse 1.42.0</a>, which allows homeserver administrators to force their users to use specific tokens when registering. This is similar to Synapse's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/6f440fd859c411af8c32478b4353f7550619c3bd/docs/sample_config.yaml#L1291-L1294">registration shared secret</a> support, but with added features, such as the possibility to limit how users can be registered with the same token, or to make a token expire. See <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.53/usage/administration/admin_api/registration_tokens.html">the admin API documentation</a> for more information on how to manage registration tokens on your homeserver.</p>
<p>Registration tokens were initially proposed to the Matrix specification in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">MSC3231</a> by <a href="https://github.com/govynnus">Callum Brown</a> during their Google Summer of Code internship last summer. The MSC has since been accepted, and released in the stable Matrix specification as of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/02/matrix-v-1-2-release">Matrix v1.2</a>. As a result, its Synapse implementation has been updated to remove support for unstable identifiers. Administrators of homeservers on which the reverse proxy rules explicitly allow the unstable route for this feature need to update their configuration. Same goes for developers of Matrix clients that support this feature. See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.53/upgrade#stablisation-of-msc3231">upgrade notes</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="time-based-cache-expiry-now-enabled-by-default">Time-based cache expiry now enabled by default</h2>
<p>To avoid being overly intensive on resources by making too many queries to the database, Synapse maintains several in-memory caches to store data it needs to use frequently. However, this comes with the inconvenience that, if Synapse needs to store too much data, these caches can become fairly big and occupy too much space in the host's memory.</p>
<p>Historically, Synapse has dealt with this issue by having set sizes for each cache, either hardcoded or set in the configuration, and evicting the oldest items when exceeding this size. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.38.0">Synapse 1.38</a> introduced the possibility for homeserver administrators to configure Synapse to evict cache entries based on the time they were last accessed on. This mechanism acts on top of the aforementioned eviction policy, and allows automatically evicting entries that haven't been accessed for some time, leaving more room in the caches to store data that needs to be accessed more often.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.53 enables this behaviour by default. Without specific configuration, Synapse will automatically evict cache entries that haven't been accessed for more than 30 minutes. Server administrators that were already using this feature might need to update their configuration, as this change deprecates the <code>expiry_time</code> configuration setting, which will be removed in a future version of Synapse. See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.53/upgrade#time-based-cache-expiry-is-now-enabled-by-default">upgrade notes</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>You might have heard that we're working on improving the time it takes to join big Matrix rooms with Synapse. If not, then you definitely want to have a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/yxV73TQAodE?t=1095">the demos Matrix live</a> that was published earlier this month and includes more details and a demo of the work we've been doing in this area.</p>
<p>This release of Synapse includes an implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3706">MSC3706</a>, which is part of this work. It's still very experimental and definitely not production-ready, but it's a huge stepping stone towards making room joins snappier than ever.</p>
<p>We've also been continuing our work towards enabling end-to-end encryption for application services (see the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/01/18/synapse-1-50-released">Synapse 1.50 release blogpost</a> for more context on that). Synapse 1.53 includes support for sending to-device messages to application services. This is also still very experimental, watch this space for future updates.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.53.0">full changelog</a> for a complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.53/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1530">upgrade notes</a> for this version.</p>

<h2 id="twisted-security-release">Twisted security release</h2>
<p>The team behind <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a>, which is the main framework Synapse uses under the hood, recently released <a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/releases/tag/twisted-22.1.0">Twisted 22.1</a>. This version fixes a <a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/security/advisories/GHSA-92x2-jw7w-xvvx">security vulnerability</a> within the Twisted library.</p>
<p>While preparing the release of Synapse 1.52, we have investigated the impact of this vulnerability on Synapse. We came to the conclusion that it does not affect Synapse. We however advise server administrators to ensure they use an up-to-date version of the library as a matter of good practice.</p>
<p>For instances installed with <code>pip</code>, the library can be updated with <code>pip install --upgrade Twisted treq</code>. For instances installed with the <code>matrixdotorg/synapse</code> Docker image or Debian packages from <code>packages.matrix.org</code>, updating to Synapse 1.52.0 is sufficient, as these images and packages include up-to-date versions of all dependencies.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that a release candidate for <a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/releases/tag/twisted-22.2.0rc1">Twisted 22.2</a> has been published, with a fix for a potential denial of service vulnerability with SSH. Administrators of Synapse homeservers that have the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.52/manhole.html">manhole</a> feature enabled (which is the only feature of Synapse using SSH) are encouraged to ensure access to the manhole is correctly restricted (e.g. by preventing access from external locations).</p>
<h2 id="federation-admin-apis">Federation admin APIs</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse introduces a few admin APIs to help server administrators monitor and handle how their Synapse homeserver interacts with other federated homeservers. <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.52/usage/administration/admin_api/federation.html#destination-rooms">One of these APIs</a> offers server administrators a way to visualise which rooms are shared between the local homeserver and a given remote one.</p>
<p>Another API allows server administrators to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.52/usage/administration/admin_api/federation.html#reset-connection-timeout">reset federation timeouts</a>. If Synapse fails to connect to a remote homeserver, it will make note of the failure and will not retry the connection after a certain amount of time. This can happen if the remote homeserver goes offline or experiences connectivity issues. Synapse has a few ways of figuring out whether a remote homeserver has come back online, but this new admin API adds a way for administrators to manually tell Synapse a destination should be available.</p>

<p>This release also improves Synapse's deactivation behaviour by deleting account data when deactivating a user. &quot;Account data&quot; refers to private arbitrary data that is specific to an account. It is used among other things for secure server-side storage (SSSS) which allows securely backing up end-to-end encryption keys.</p>
