                <p>Today we are issuing security releases of matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk to
patch a couple of High severity vulnerabilities (reserved as
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE%2D2022%2D36059">CVE-2022-36059</a>
for the matrix-js-sdk and
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE%2D2022%2D36060">CVE-2022-36060</a>
for the matrix-react-sdk).</p>
<p>Affected clients include those which depend on the affected libraries, such as
Element Web/Desktop and Cinny. Releases of the affected clients will follow
shortly. We advise users of those clients to upgrade at their earliest
convenience.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities give an adversary who you share a room with the ability to
carry out a denial-of-service attack against the affected clients, making it
not show all of a user's rooms or spaces and/or causing minor temporary
corruption.</p>
<p>The full vulnerability details will be disclosed at a later date, to give
people time to upgrade and us to perform a more thorough audit of the codebase.</p>
<p>Note that while the vulnerability was to our knowledge never exploited
maliciously, some unintentional public testing has left some people affected by
the bug. We made a best effort to sanitize this to stop the breakage. If you
are affected, you may still need to clear the cache and reload your Matrix
client for it to take effect.</p>
<p>We thank <a href="https://valentin-lorentz.fr/">Val Lorentz</a> who discovered and
reported the vulnerability over the weekend.</p>

                <p>Hey everyone! We've just released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.65.0">Synapse
1.65</a>! Let's have a
peek at what's inside.</p>
<h2 id="private-read-receipts">Private read receipts</h2>
<p>A feature that the more privacy-focused users of Matrix have been missing was
the ability to hide read receipts from other users. Read receipts in rooms can
tell a user which messages another user has read in a room. However, they can
also be an unwelcome indicator that a user is currently reading a certain room,
thus giving away the user's activity on Matrix at a given time.</p>
<p>Hiding one's read receipts from other Matrix users is unfortunately not as
straightforward as simply preventing a client from sharing read receipts with
the server. This is because read receipts are also used by Matrix homeservers to
calculate how much of a room a user has read, and generate notification counts
for rooms accordingly.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.65 introduces stable support for private read receipts. This feature,
described by
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2285">MSC2285</a>, allows
clients to send a different type of read receipt to the server. This then tells
the homeserver to use this piece of information to update the user's
notification counts, but not to share it with other users.</p>
<h2 id="improved-room-management-apis-for-modules">Improved room management APIs for modules</h2>
<p>This version of Synapse includes two new module API methods to help Synapse
modules interact and manage rooms. The first one,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.65.0/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L1455-L1477"><code>lookup_room_alias</code></a>,
allows modules to retrieve the room ID corresponding to a given room alias. This
works both for local and remote aliases. The second one,
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.65.0/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L1479-L1528"><code>create_room</code></a>,
allows modules to create new rooms on behalf of an existing user.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.65.0/synapse/module_api/__init__.py#L925-L1017"><code>update_room_membership</code></a>
method has also been updated in this release of Synapse to allow modules to join
a room the server is not already in via federation. This can be done by using
the new <code>remote_room_hosts</code> argument, which takes a list of homeservers to try
to join via.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>Synapse 1.65 stabilises the implementation of
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">MSC3827</a>, which
allows filtering public room searches on room types. This means it is now
possible to search specifically for public spaces. For more information on this
feature, see <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/07/20/synapse-1-63-released">the Synapse 1.63
announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Synapse 1.65 implements the new experimental error codes
documented by
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">MSC3848</a>. Once
stabilised, these error codes will allow clients to show more specific errors to
their users about why an event could not be sent.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.65.0">full
changelog</a> for a
complete list of changes in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our
thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular
order) <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a>,

                <p>It's that time again: there's a new Synapse release, fresh out of the oven!
Let's take a look at what's inside <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.64.0">Synapse
1.64</a>.</p>
<h2 id="delegating-email-verification-is-now-deprecated">Delegating email verification is now deprecated</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.4.0">Synapse 1.4.0</a>
introduced a configuration option (<code>account_threepid_delegates.email</code>) to allow
homeservers to delegate validating the ownership of email addresses to an
external identity server. This validation is used by Synapse when adding an
email address to a Matrix account, or before performing a password reset.</p>
<p>As of Synapse 1.64, this option is deprecated, and Synapse will print a warning
if it is used. This is because this option relies on old API endpoints that have
since been
<a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/changelog/#identity-service-api-1-1">removed</a> from the
Matrix specification.</p>
<p>Synapse can do this validation internally provided it is configured with details
of an SMTP server. Administrators currently relying on
<code>account_threepid_delegates.email</code> should therefore ensure that an SMTP server
is correctly configured, and remove the <code>account_threepid_delegates.email</code>
option. See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.64/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#email">configuration
guide</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>We plan to fully remove this configuration option in Synapse 1.66, which is
expected to be released on August 30th.</p>
<p>Note that the equivalent option to validate the ownership of phone numbers
(<code>account_threepid_delegates.msisdn</code>) can still be used, though we expect to
deprecate it in a future release of Synapse.</p>
<h2 id="improved-tls-support-for-sending-emails">Improved TLS support for sending emails</h2>
<p>When configuring an SMTP server to use to send out emails to users, server
administrators can configure Synapse to use TLS to communicate to that server.
Until now, only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS">STARTTLS</a> was
supported in this case.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.64 introduces a new <code>force_tls</code> configuration option in the <code>email</code>
section of the configuration file. If this new setting is set to <code>true</code> Synapse
will use TLS for the initial connection rather than upgrading via STARTTLS.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.64/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#email">configuration
guide</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="memory-leak-in-frozendict">Memory leak in <code>frozendict</code></h2>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, we
<a href="https://github.com/Marco-Sulla/python-frozendict/issues/60">identified</a> a
memory leak within <a href="https://pypi.org/project/frozendict/">frozendict</a>, which is
a library that Synapse relies on. This would in turn cause Synapse instances to
slowly leak memory when processing <code>/sync</code> requests.</p>
<p>We highly encourage server administrators who installed Synapse via <code>pip</code> to
upgrade their local version of <code>frozendict</code> to version 2.3.3 or later, which
includes a fix to this issue. The Docker image <code>matrixdotorg/synapse</code> and the
Debian packages from <code>packages.matrix.org</code> already include the updated library.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This version of Synapse introduces support for room version 10! This new room
version enables support for the new <code>knock_restricted</code> join rule, to allow
knocking into rooms which are otherwise restricted to members of a specific room
(or space). See <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/rooms/v10/">the Matrix specification about room version
10</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Additionally, Synapse 1.64 features a new rate limiter to limit the rate of joins to the same
room. It is intended as a mitigation against abuse scenarios involving joining a
lot of users from different homeservers to a room to then send spam across it.
See the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#rc_joins_per_room">configuration
guide</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>This release of Synapse also extends the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#list-room-api">List
Rooms</a>
and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#room-details-api">Room
Details</a>
admin APIs to include the type of a room in responses, allowing server
administrators to differentiate spaces from other rooms.</p>

                <p>Hey all, it's time for another Synapse release! That's right, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.63.0">Synapse
1.63</a> is out,
let's have a look at it.</p>
<h2 id="clarifications-on-anonymised-server-statistics">Clarifications on &quot;anonymised&quot; server statistics</h2>
<p>Synapse has the ability to report usage statistics to the Matrix.org Foundation
(or to another location, if configured to do so). These statistics, such as
number of users, number of rooms joined by the server, etc. (they don't feature
any identifiable information about users and rooms) help us monitor the health
of the public federation.</p>
<p>In this release of Synapse, we have updated our public documentation about this
feature to clarify how it works and what exactly is being reported. This
documentation can be found <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.63/usage/administration/monitoring/reporting_homeserver_usage_statistics.html">right
here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that previous documentation and prompts surrounding this feature called it
&quot;anonymised&quot; server statistics. This could easily be misinterpreted, as while
per-user statistics are not reported, homeserver server names are. We have
therefore changed said documentation and prompts to be clearer about
what is actually reported.</p>
<p>Note that your homeserver will never report any statistics if the <code>report_stats</code>
configuration option is set to <code>false</code>. Server admins who are curious about
which software is used by the Matrix.org Foundation to record server statistics
can check out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/panopticon">panopticon</a>.</p>
<h2 id="improved-filtering-for-public-room-search">Improved filtering for public room search</h2>
<p>This version of Synapse ships with an experimental implementation of
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">MSC3827</a> which
allows filtering public room search results by room type. This feature will
enable better discoverability for Matrix Spaces (which are rooms with a specific
type, under the hood), as it will enable clients to search specifically for
public spaces.</p>
<p>This feature is still experimental as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">its
MSC</a> hasn't
completed the MSC process yet, though it is in its final comment period at the
time this post is being written. This means a stable implementation will be
coming to Synapse very soon, so watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>Synapse 1.63 also includes a new rate limiter to limit invites per issuer. This
rate limiter can be configured using the new <code>rc_invites.per_issuer</code>
configuration setting, see <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#rc_invites">the
documentation</a>
for more information.</p>

                <p>Hey all, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.62.0">Synapse
1.62</a> is out! Let's
have a look inside.</p>
<h2 id="spam-checker-improvements">Spam checker improvements</h2>
<p>In the past few weeks, the Synapse team has been working with the Matrix.org
Trust &amp; Safety team to help module developers build more efficient protections
against spam. As a consequence of this work, Synapse 1.62 introduces new ways
for modules to communicate the result of actions taken against a specific
message or operation through the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.62/modules/spam_checker_callbacks.html">spam checker module
callbacks</a>.</p>
<p>Previously, most spam checker callbacks would be expected to return a boolean
indicating whether a specific operation should be qualified as spam. Starting
from Synapse 1.62, modules are now expected to return either
<code>synapse.module_api.NOT_SPAM</code> (to indicate an action is not spammy), or an error
code that is part of <code>synapse.module_api.errors.Codes</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the previous behaviour is still supported but is now deprecated, and
will be removed in a future version of Synapse.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.62/upgrade.html#new-signatures-for-spam-checker-callbacks">the upgrade
notes</a>
for a list of the affected callbacks and an example of this change. Note that on
top of the list described there, the <code>check_event_for_spam</code> callback was also
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.62/upgrade.html#new-signature-for-the-spam-checker-callback-check_event_for_spam">updated with a similar
change</a>
in Synapse 1.61.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse includes important performance improvements around
syncing, specifically around handling device lists and notifications.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.62 also introduce a changes of its optional dependency on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-synapse-ldap3">LDAP3
authentication provider
module</a> to
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-synapse-ldap3/releases/tag/v0.2.1">v0.2.1</a>
in order to fix an issue with usernames that include uppercase characters.</p>

                <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Today we're exceptionally releasing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.61.1">Synapse
1.61.1</a>, which comes
as a security release. <strong>Server administrators are encouraged to update as soon as
possible.</strong></p>
<p>This release fixes a vulnerability with Synapse's URL preview feature. URL
previews of some web pages can lead to unbounded recursion, causing the request
to either fail, or in some cases crash the running Synapse process.</p>
<p>Homeservers with the <code>url_preview_enabled</code> configuration option set to <code>false</code>
(the default value) are unaffected. Instances with the <code>enable_media_repo</code>
configuration option set to <code>false</code> are also unaffected, as this also disables
the URL preview functionality.</p>
<p>Server administrators who are unable to update Synapse should disable URL
previews by setting <code>url_preview_enabled: false</code> in their configuration file.
They can also delegate URL preview to a separate, dedicated worker to ensure the
process crashing does not impact other functionality of Synapse.</p>

                <p>Hey everyone! Guess what? <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.61.0">Synapse
1.61</a> is out! Let's
have a look at it.</p>
<h2 id="farewell-groups">Farewell, groups</h2>
<p>If you are new to Matrix, you might have not heard of the feature referred to as
&quot;groups&quot; or &quot;communities&quot; (depending on the context). This feature allowed
grouping rooms and users to better represent a community, one of which being
<code>+matrix:matrix.org</code> which used to represent the Matrix community. This may
sound similar to <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/17/the-matrix-space-beta">Matrix
Spaces</a>, and it would
make sense since Spaces are meant to be a more powerful replacement for groups.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/04/05/synapse-1-56-released">Synapse 1.56</a>,
support for groups was deprecated, with a plan to fully remove it in a
later release of Synapse. This has now been done as of Synapse 1.61, and most of the
code supporting this feature has now been removed.</p>
<p>Note that this means that administrators of homeservers using workers can remove
endpoints related to groups from their reverse proxy configuration. See <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.61/upgrade.html#removal-of-deprecated-communitygroups">the
upgrade
notes</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="media-retention">Media retention</h2>
<p>A common issue we see homeserver administrators struggle with is managing the
disk space used by Synapse. A non-negligible part of that disk space usage is
dedicated to storing files uploaded by Matrix users, both local and remote.</p>
<p>Up until now Synapse would only provide administrators with limited, manual ways
to manage the media store of their homeserver, via the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/admin_api/media_admin_api.html">admin
API</a>.</p>
<p>As of this release, Synapse now allows administrators to define retention
lifetimes for local and remote media. This allows media that hasn't been
accessed in a long time to be automatically deleted, therefore freeing up disk
space. Server administrators wishing to control media retention more finely can
also define different policies for remote and local media.</p>
<p>This feature can be enabled by configuring the <code>media_retention</code> setting, see
<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#media_retention">the configuration
guide</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything else</h2>
<p>This release of Synapse introduces a change in the return value of the
<code>check_event_for_spam</code> spam checker module callback, in order to allow modules
more flexibility in communicating to users why their messages are rejected. This
is part of ongoing improvement works around spam checker callbacks, watch this
space next time for more information!</p>
