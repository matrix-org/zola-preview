                <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.29.0">Synapse 1.29.0</a> is now available!</p>
<p>This release includes several useful new configuration options for administrators of federated home servers. In all cases, the defaults match Synapse's prior behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li>AndrewFerr <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9203">implemented</a> <code>include_profile_data_on_invite</code> and <code>allow_profile_lookup_over_federation</code> which can limit disclosure of your users' profile information. These both default to True.</li>
<li>We've also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9383">implemented</a> <code>user_directory.prefer_local_users</code> which weights users on the same homeserver higher in directory searches. This defaults to False.</li>
</ul>
<p>Synapse is now easier to run in proxied environments, with tzyl <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9372">implementing</a> support for the <code>NO_PROXY</code> environment variable, as well as recognizing lowercase variants of that and related proxy variables.</p>
<p>Under the hood, we've been steadily improving our type hints, especially in light of the recent release of Twisted 21.2.0 which includes its own type annotations. We've also landed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9402">some improvements</a> which reduce the amount of work Synapse does when presence is enabled and you join a room for the first time. Oh, and the media repository now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9438">regenerates missing thumbnails</a> on demand.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you deploy Synapse behind a reverse proxy, Synapse now expects to receive an <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code> header on incoming requests and will log a warning if it is missing. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.29.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1290">upgrade notes</a> for more information. The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.29.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> has more information on what's in this release.</p>

<p>This release comes with several further improvements to the user experience of single sign-on and numerous bugfixes and stability improvements.</p>
<p>For admins, Synapse 1.28 adds a new Admin API for retrieving <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.28.0/docs/admin_api/rooms.md#event-context-api">event context</a> and implements new spam checker hooks which enable checking file uploads and remote downloads. We've also improved memory usage of media repository workers.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have marked an undocumented Admin API for deprecation. If any of your tools use <code>/_synapse/admin/v1/users/&lt;user_id&gt;</code> to get account information, please replace that with the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.28.0/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#list-accounts">V2 List Accounts</a> API, which has been available since Synapse 1.7.0.</p>
<p>There are no special upgrade instructions for 1.28.0. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.28.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> for more details on what's in this release.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/arya2331">arya2331</a>, <a href="https://github.com/auscompgeek">auscompgeek</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bubu">bubu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/compu42">compu42</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dykstranet">dykstranet</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/shadowjonathan">shadowjonathan</a>.</p>

<p>We're especially proud of this release, as this is the version of Synapse that powered <a href="/blog/2021/02/15/how-we-hosted-fosdem-2021-on-matrix">FOSDEM 2021 on Matrix</a>. As such, our main focus was on stability, performance, and long-awaited support for social login.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-new">What's New</h3>
<p>To our surprise, nearly <em>half</em> of all people who created accounts on the FOSDEM homeserver did so via a social login method. Full support for those methods is included in Synapse 1.27.0, and already available for all users on the matrix.org homeserver.</p>
<p>We've also changed how we use Redis in larger deployments, making Synapse more resilient to lost connections and eliminating delays when restarting with multiple federation senders.</p>
<p>Our Server Admin APIs saw a few tweaks, including new APIs to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.27.0/docs/admin_api/rooms.md#forward-extremities-admin-api">query and delete forward extremities</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.27.0/docs/admin_api/rooms.md#room-state-api">list the current state of a room</a>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.27.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> for more.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-changes-for-sso">Breaking Changes for SSO</h3>
<p>If you use Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML, OAuth2, or OpenID Connect you <strong>must</strong> adjust your provider's configuration before upgrading to Synapse 1.27.0, as some endpoint URLs have changed. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.27.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1270">upgrading notes</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="dropping-armv7-docker-images">Dropping ARMv7 Docker Images</h3>
<p>We were unable to produce ARM-based Docker images for this release due to problems with cross-compilation. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to cease building 32-bit ARMv7 Docker images as part of our release process. We will resume publishing ARM64 images with the next Synapse release.</p>
<p>Users on ARMv7 platforms (most notably Raspberry Pis) should consider building images locally using Synapse's Dockerfile or switching to installing Synapse directly as a Python module. Users with Raspberry Pi 3's or newer also have the option of installing a 64-bit Linux distribution and using an ARM64 Docker image.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This release includes a new database schema version. If you need to roll back to Synapse 1.25.0, you will also need to follow the associated <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1260">database downgrade instructions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to a truckload of refactoring and general improvements, Synapse 1.26.0 includes three major new features:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/auth_chain_difference_algorithm.md">brand new algorithm</a> for calculating the auth chain difference, which should dramatically improve worst case performance during state resolution (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622">#8622</a>).</li>
<li>Initial support for enabling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9110">multiple OpenID Connect providers</a>, paving the way for proper multi-provider social login workflows.</li>
<li>A significant speed-up to redaction performance in large rooms.</li>
</ol>
<p>It also brings several improvements to Admin APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific media items can be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/admin_api/media_admin_api.md#protecting-media-from-being-quarantined">protected from quarantine</a>. </li>
<li>The <code>joined_rooms</code> API now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#list-room-memberships-of-an-user">works for remote users</a>.</li>
<li>Deactivating a user can now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#deactivate-account">optionally remove their avatar URL and display name</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also made it possible to offload several additional APIs to worker processes, including read receipts and account data persistence, further improving Synapse's scalability.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> for more.</p>
<p>Lastly, a reminder: we have <strong>deprecated Python 3.5 and PostgreSQL 9.5</strong> and will cease support at the end of March. Due to deprecations in our Python tooling, we were unable to produce a binary package for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) in time for this release. We have resolved this for 1.27.</p>
<p>Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including <a href="https://github.com/0xflotus">0xflotus</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chris-ruecker">chris-ruecker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">dklimpel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/emelie-qis">emelie-qis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jerinjtitus">jerinjtitus</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/tzyl">tzyl</a>.</p>

Please update your code to use the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/master/docs/admin_api/rooms.md#delete-room-api">Delete Room</a> Admin API instead.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.25.0 brings over a month's worth of improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability for users to pick their own username when using Single Sign-On, right from within Synapse.</li>
<li>Support for <code>async</code> Python methods in custom spam checker modules.</li>
<li>New ways to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.25.0/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1250">restrict allowed IP address ranges</a> for outgoing requests from Synapse.</li>
<li>Significantly faster v2 state resolution on rooms with large numbers of power level events, which are common in some types of bridged IRC rooms.</li>
</ul>

                <p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.24.0">Synapse 1.24.0</a> is now available!</p>
<p>This release fixes a denial of service vulnerability (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-hxmp-pqch-c8mm">GHSA-hxmp-pqch-c8mm</a> / <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-26257">CVE-2020-26257</a>) in which a malicious homeserver could send malformed events into a room which would then break federation of that room.</p>
<p>This follows the disclosure of a denial of service vulnerability in OpenSSL (<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20201208.txt">CVE-2020-1971</a>). If you have installed Synapse from source, please ensure your host is up to date and then execute <code>pip install 'cryptography&gt;=3.3'</code> inside your Synapse virtualenv.</p>
<p>We've also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.1">Synapse 1.23.1</a> which includes that security fix and a small patch to maintain Python 3.5 compatibility. It is otherwise <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/compare/v1.23.0...v1.23.1">identical to 1.23.0</a>. Note that Synapse 1.24.0 includes backwards incompatible changes which may affect a small number of users. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1240">notes on upgrading</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.24.0 brings a pair of new Admin APIs, including a way to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.24.0/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#login-as-a-user">log in as users</a> and to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.24.0/docs/admin_api/rooms.md#delete-room-api">forcibly purge</a> rooms when deleting them. We've also made numerous bug fixes and improvements to SSO support, especially around OpenID Connect and SAML providers.</p>
<p>This release includes an optional change to push notification badges: currently, the number in the badge is based on the count of <em>rooms</em> with unread messages. However, in some specialized cases you may want the badge to show the count of <em>all</em> unread messages, even if there are multiple unread messages in the same room. This behavior can now be toggled with a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8820">new configuration setting</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, for server admins, the deprecated <code>/_matrix/client/*/admin</code> Admin API endpoints <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8785">have been removed</a>. If you have tools which target these endpoints, please update them to use the <code>/_synapse/admin</code> URL prefix instead.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.24.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> for more.</p>
<p>Installation instructions are available <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md">on GitHub</a>, as is the <code>v1.24.0</code> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.24.0">release tag</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> On Monday, we will be announcing a denial of service vulnerability which affects Synapse versions prior to 1.20.0. If you have not upgraded recently, please do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0">Synapse 1.23.0</a> now available!</p>
<p>For Synapse admins, this release support generating structured logs via the standard logging configuration (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8607">#8607</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8685">#8685</a>). This may require changing your synapse configuration; see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.23.0rc1/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1230">upgrade notes</a> for more information.</p>
<p>We've also added many new Admin APIs, contributed by <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">@dklimpel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add API to get information about uploaded media (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8647">#8647</a>)</li>
<li>Add API for local user media statistics (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8700">#8700</a>)</li>
<li>Make it possible to delete files that were not used for a defined time (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8519">#8519</a>)</li>
<li>Split API for reported events into detail and list endpoints. This is a breaking change to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8217">#8217</a> which was introduced in Synapse v1.21.0. Those who already use this API should check their scripts (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8539">#8539</a>) </li>
<li>Allow server admins to list users' notification pushers (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8610">#8610</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8689">#8689</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, Synapse 1.23.0 addresses some significant bugs, including regressions in the SQLite-to-PostgreSQL database porting script (<a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8729">#8729</a>, <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8730">#8730</a>, <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8755">#8755</a>) and an issue which could prevent Synapse from recovering after losing its connection to its database (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8726">#8726</a>). Synapse will also reject ACL modifications from clients which would otherwise cause a server to ban itself from a room (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8708">#8708</a>).</p>
<p>Installation instructions are available <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md">on GitHub</a>, as is the <code>v1.23.0</code> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0">release tag</a>.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We had a major break-through in Synapse 1.22 which we want to talk about in
more detail: <strong>Synapse now scales horizontally across multiple python
processes.</strong></p>
<p>Horizontal scaling means that you can support more users and traffic by adding
in more python processes (spread over more machines, if necessary) without
there being a single bottleneck which all the traffic is passing through - as
opposed to vertical scaling where you make things go faster overall by making
the bottleneck go faster.</p>
<p>After many years of having to vertically scale Synapse (by trying to make the
main process go faster) we’re now finally at the point where you can configure
Synapse so that <strong>messages no longer flow through the main process</strong> -
eliminating the bottleneck entirely.  What’s more, the Matrix.org homeserver
has now been successfully running in this config and enjoying the massive
scalability improvements for the last 2 weeks! Huge kudos goes to Erik and the
wider Synapse team for pulling this off.</p>
<p>Some readers might wonder how this ties in with <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">Dendrite entering
beta</a>, given one
of Dendrite’s design goals is full horizontal scalability.  The answer is that
we’re very much using Dendrite for experimentation and next-gen stuff at the
moment (currently focused more on scaling downwards for P2P rather than
scaling upwards for megaservers) - while Synapse is the stable and long-term
supported option.</p>
<p>So, that’s the context - now over to Erik with more than you could possibly
ever want to know about how we actually did it...</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Synapse started life off back in 2014 as a single monolithic python process,
and for quite a while we made it scale by adding more and more in-memory
caches to speed things up by avoiding hitting the database (at the expense of
RAM).  It looked like this:</p>
<div style="margin: auto; max-width: 640px;">
    <img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse1.png"/>
</div>
<p>Eventually the caches stopped helping and we needed more than one thread of
execution in order to spread CPU across multiple cores. Python’s Global
Interpreter Lock (<a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">GIL</a>)
means that Python can mainly only use one CPU core at a time, so starting more
threads doesn’t help with scalability - you have to run multiple processes.</p>
<p>Now, the vast majority of the work that Synapse does is related to “streams”.
These are append only sequences of rows, such as the events stream, typing
stream, receipts stream, etc. When a new event arrives (for example) we write
it to the events stream, and then notify anything waiting that there has been
an update. The <code>/sync</code> endpoint, for instance, will wait for updates to streams
and send them down to long-polling Matrix clients. </p>
<p>Streams support being added to concurrently, so have a concept of the
“persisted up-to position”. This is the point where <strong>all</strong> rows before that
point have finished persisting. Readers only read up to the current “persisted
up-to position”, so that they don’t skip updates that haven’t finished
persisting at that point. (E.g. if two events A and B get assigned positions 5
and 6, but B finishes persisting first, then the persisted up to position will
remain at 4 until A finishes persisting and then it jumps to 6).</p>
<p>To split any meaningful amount of work into separate processes, we need to add
a mechanism where processes can be told that updates to streams have happened
(otherwise they’d have to repeatedly poll the DB, which would be deeply
inefficient). The architecture ended up being one where we had the “main”
process that streams updates via a custom replication protocol (initially
long-polling HTTP; later custom TCP) to any number of “worker” processes. This
meant that we could move sync stream handling (and other read apis) off the
main process and onto workers, but also that all database writes had to go
through the single main process (as it was a star topology, the main process
could talk to all workers but workers could only talk to the main process and
not each other).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse2.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse2.png" /></p>
<p>As an aside: cache invalidations also had to be streamed down the replication
connections, which has the side effect that we could only cache things that
would only be invalidated on the main process.</p>
<p>We continued to move more and more read APIs out onto separate workers. We
also added workers in front of the main process that would e.g. handle the
creation of the new events, authenticating, etc, and then call out to the main
process with the event for it to persist the event.</p>
<h2 id="moving-writes-off-the-main-process">Moving writes off the main process</h2>
<p>Eventually we ran out of stuff to move out of the main process that didn’t
involve writing to the DB. To write stuff from other processes we needed a way
for the workers to stream updates to each other. The easiest and most obvious
way was to just use Redis and its pub/sub support. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse3.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse3.png" /></p>
<p>This almost allowed us to move writing of a particular stream to a different
worker, <em>except</em> writing to streams generally also meant invalidating caches
which in itself requires writing to a stream. We needed a way of writing to
the cache invalidation stream from multiple workers at once.</p>
<p>Sharding the cache invalidation thankfully turned out to be easy, as workers
would simply call the cache invalidation function whenever they get an
invalidation notice over replication. In particular, the ordering of
invalidations from different workers doesn’t matter and so there isn’t a need
to calculate a single “persisted up-to position”. Sharding then just becomes a
case of adding the name of the worker that is writing the update to the
replication stream, and then workers reading from it can basically treat the
cache stream the same as if they were multiple streams, one per worker.</p>
<p>This then unlocks the ability to move writing of streams off the main process
and onto different workers - and so we added the “event persister” worker for
offloading the main event stream off the main process:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse4.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse4.png" /></p>
<h2 id="sharding-the-events-stream">Sharding the events stream</h2>
<p>Eventually the worker responsible for doing nothing but persisting events
started maxing out CPU. This meant that we had to look at sharding the events
stream, i.e. writing to it from multiple workers.</p>
<p>This is more complicated than sharding the cache invalidation stream as the
ordering of the events does matter; we send them down sync streams, in order,
with a token that indicates where the sync stream is up to in the events
stream. This means that workers need to be able to calculate a “persisted
up-to position” when getting updates from different workers. </p>
<p>The easiest way of doing that is to simply set the persisted up-to position as
the minimum position received over federation from all active writers. This
works, except events would only be processed after all other writers have
subsequently written events (to advance the persisted position past the point
at which the event was written), which can add a lot of latency depending on
how often events are written. </p>
<p>A refinement is to note that if you have a persisted up-to position of 10,
then receive updates at sequential positions 11, 12, 13 and 14, you know that
everything between 10 and 14 has finished persisting (as you received updates
about them), and so can set the persisted up-to position to 14. Annoyingly,
it’s not required that positions are sequential without gaps (due to various
technical considerations), and so in the worst case this still has the same
problems as the naïve solution.</p>
<p>To avoid these problems we change the persisted up-to position to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock">vector
clock</a> of positions; tracking a
vector of positions - one per writer. This still allows answering the query of
“get all events after token X” (as events are written with the position and
the name of the writer). The persisted up-to position is then calculated by
just tracking the last position seen to arrive over replication from each
writer. </p>
<p>This allows writing events from multiple workers, while ensuring that other
workers can correctly keep track of a “persisted up-to position”. Then it's
just a matter of inspecting the code to ensure that it does not assume that it
is the only writer to the stream. In the case of writing to the events stream,
we note that the function persisting events assumes it's the only writer for a
given room, so when sharding we have to ensure that there are no concurrent
writes to the same room. This is most easily done by sharding based on room
ID, and ensuring that the mapping of room ID to worker does not change
(without coordination).</p>
<p>The only thing left is to then encode the vector clock position into the sync
tokens. We want to ensure that these tokens are not too long, as they get
included as query string parameters (e.g. the <code>since=</code> parameter of <code>/sync</code>).
By assigning persistent unique integer IDs to workers the vector clock can be
persisted as a sequence of pairs of integers, which is relatively few bytes so
long as we don’t have too many workers writing to the events stream. We can
further reduce the size of the tokens by calculating an integer “persisted
up-to position” as we did before, encoding that and only including positions
for workers that are larger than the integer persisted upto position. (The
idea here is that most of the time only a small number of workers will be
ahead of the calculated persisted up-to position, and so we only need to
encode those).</p>
<p>And this is what we have today:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse5.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse5.png" /></p>
<p>The major limitation of the current situation is that you can’t dynamically
add/remove workers which persist events, as the sharding by room ID is
calculated at startup, and so changing it requires restarting the whole
system. This could be replaced by any system that allowed coordination over
which persister is allowed to write to a room at any given point. However this
is likely tricky to get right in practice, but would allow dynamic auto
scaling of deployments, or automatically recovering from a worker that gets
wedged/dies.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that sharding event persisters isn’t the only
performance work that’s been going on - switching everything over to python 3
and async twisted has helped, along with lots of smaller optimisations on the
hot paths, and further rebalancing workers (e.g. moving background jobs off
the master process to dedicated workers).  We’ve also benefited a lot from the
maintainability of rolling out mypy typing throughout the codebase.  And next
up, we’ll be going back to speeding up the codebase as a whole - starting with
algorithmic state resolution improvements! 🎉</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>So, how does it stack up?</p>
<p>Here’s the send time heatmap on Matrix.org showing the step change on Oct 16th
when we rolled out the second event persister (full disclosure: this also
coincides with moving background processes off the main Synapse process to a
background worker).  As you can see, we go from messages being spread over a
huge range of durations (up to several seconds) to the sweet spot being 50ms
or less - a spectacular improvement!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse-heatmap.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse-heatmap.png" /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, here’s the actual CPU utilisation as we split the traffic from a
single event persister (yellow) to two persisters (one yellow, one blue),
showing the sharding beautifully horizontally balancing CPU between the two
active/active worker processes:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2020-11-03-synapse-cpu.png" alt="2020-11-03-synapse-cpu.png" /></p>
<p>We’ve yet to loadtest to see just how fast we can go now (before we start
hitting bottlenecks on the postgres cluster), but it sure feels good to have
all our CPU headroom back on Matrix.org again, ready for the next wave of
users to arrive.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>So there you have it: folks running massive homeservers (50K+ concurrent
users) like Matrix.org (and <em>cough</em> various high profile public sector
deployments) are no longer held hostage by the bottleneck of the main synapse
process and should feel free to experiment with setting up event persister
workers to handle high traffic loads.  Otherwise, if you can spread your users
over smaller servers, that’s also a good bet (assuming they don’t have
massively overlapping room membership, like we see on Matrix.org.)</p>
<p>The current <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/workers.md">worker
documentation</a>
is up-to-date, although does assume you are already very familiar with how to
administer Synapse.  It’s also very much subject to change, as we keep adding
new workers and improving the architecture.  However, now is a pretty good
time to get involved if you’re interested in large-scale Matrix deployments.</p>
