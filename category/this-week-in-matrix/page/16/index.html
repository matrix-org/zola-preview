<h2 id="nheko_rebornroadmap">nheko_reborn roadmap</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@red_sky:ocean.joedonofry.com">red_sky</a> has continued to work on nheko, and shared a general roadmap in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko-reborn:matrix.org">#nheko-reborn:matrix.org</a>:
<blockquote>The remainder of 0.6.x is expected to be bug fixes. This includes bug fixes in mtxclient as well as nheko.<br />0.7.0 will be the next feature release. The end goal here is to add some of the capabilities that people have been requesting, and other things that people haven't been requesting.<br />AFTER 0.7.0 releases, I will then focus on updating the encryption to include more than just text messages.</blockquote>
<h2 id="libqmatrixclientprojectquaternion">libQMatrixClient project, Quaternion</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has been writing the codes this week, <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> now supports room upgrades and more:
<blockquote>Master branch of <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> can now store access token in your secure storage/keychain, better integrating into frameworks of GNOME and KDE, as well as macOS and Windows.<br />Also, you can see the room version and upgrade rooms in Quaternion (just like Matthew said on FOSDEM ;) ) - this feature is enabled by <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a>, so other clients are welcome to support room versions/upgrades too!<br /><br />All this is within the work on the upcoming release of libQMatrixClient 0.5 and Quaternion 0.0.9.4 - stay tuned!</blockquote><br />Oh we will. <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a> support for these new features when?<br /><h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2><br />Neil:<br /><blockquote>With all the interest generated through Riot 1.0 we've seen a surge of new and returning users on matrix.org. So we've spent much of the week investing in stability and performance. We'll ship a new point release (0.99.2) next week.<br />Once again a <strong>big flashing advert</strong> that Synapse admins should no longer be using self-signed certificates for their federation API. <strong>Synapse 1.0 is scheduled in early March and will not accept self signed certs</strong> - so servers that do not update will lose the ability to federate with 1.0 servers. Updating your certs is straight forward, see our guide <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">and FAQ</a> for more info.</blockquote><br /><h2 id="matrixrubysdk">Matrix Ruby SDK</h2><br />Ananace has continued his work on <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby Matrix SDK</a>:<br /><blockquote>Just tagged and pushed a new version (0.0.4) of the Ruby SDK, since I've completely forgotten to do that for a while now.</blockquote><br />What's new?<br /><blockquote>A whole bunch of small stuff I did, mostly just additional exposed methods and parameters, and some fixed issues as well. I did add support for HS URL discovery using both SRV and .well-known though, which I think is probably the largest new feature.</blockquote><br />As if all this wasn't enough, a room on Matrix!<br /><blockquote>Created a discussion room for the Ruby SDK - since it seems like there are now people who have actually used it apart from me; <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruby-matrix-sdk:kittenface.studio">#ruby-matrix-sdk:kittenface.studio</a></blockquote>
<h2 id="synapsenetcoreworkers">synapse-netcore-workers</h2>
A project rarely seen has received a lot of attention this week!
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has been working on federation workers:</p>
<blockquote>I've been working on a federation worker for synapse written in .NET to improve outgoing federation performance.

<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>Clean up c++ code</li>
 	<li>Make the c++ code less heavy, we should focus on speed</li>
 	<li>Offload js code to direct qml binding, with this i mean instead of having ablock if-else code that modifies qml object that runs on component load, we do this directly in qml: see 0a800fc and https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriksblob/0a800fcdc0af4fa2e08526dbff88e06bcb591779/uMatriks/componentsChatItem.qml as an example for a cleaner code</li>
 	<li>Make all ui depended calls async, we should NEVER block ui</li>
 	<li>Offload heavy js logic to c++</li>
 	<li>Cleaner UI, with less crust</li>
 	<li>Async everything</li>
 	<li>Merge our WIP call support</li>
 	<li>Finish impl of call support (maybe move to a standalone webrtc module)</li>
 	<li>Slowly start moving to QQC2</li>
 	<li>Implement reply</li>
 	<li>Implement sending of media</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="riotbreadcrumbs">Riot breadcrumbs</h2>
We <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/the-big-1-0-68fa7c6050be">linked to the announcement last week</a>, and have been using it for even longer, but somehow I missed a great labs feature that shipped with Riot 1.0: "room breadcrumbs", which you can enable from the Labs page of Riot settings. This gives you a series of quick links with the history of rooms you were most recently in. So if you're like me, clicking between rooms all day, you can get where you're going a little faster.
<h2 id="mautrixwhatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</h2>
There is no big news about mautrix-whatsapp this week, other than that I installed it on my own server and found that it works really <em>really</em> well. I'd love to switch to this as a main interface for my less-decentralised friends, but like others, I've been stung by <a href="https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp/issues/98">this issue in an upstream project</a>. If there are go-fans reading (and I know there are), I wonder if it's an issue which can be fixed?
<h2 id="aroundtheweb">Around the Web</h2>
A tidy little article on "non-centralised" applications. Article by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@JonTheNiceGuy:matrix.org">Jontheniceguy</a> helps pin down some of the terminology around decentralisation and the like. <a href="https://jon.sprig.gs/blog/post/1041">https://jon.sprig.gs/blog/post/1041</a>

All good things must come to an end - and here we are!
<p>Matrix is getting a lot of attention recently (has it been on the front page of HN every day this week? I remember that I used to be excited seeing that happen), and seeing a lot of growth as well.</p>
<p>If you have something to say here, something to add, come chat to us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> - I love that this is a supportive and engaged project ecosystem, so come share what you have!</p>

As you may have seen, Matrix Live this week features Neil and Matthew <a href="/blog/2019/02/15/publishing-the-backend-roadmap/">discussing the newly announced backend roadmap</a>.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LfyQ6cNGbLk" width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p>We also have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.1.1">Synapse v0.99.1.1</a> available, as the race to Synapse v1.0 gets closer and closer and closer!</p>
<p>Brendan also said, regarding low-bandwidth:</p>
<blockquote>Some of the week has been spent finalising the components used in <a href="https://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/matrix.webm">the low-bandwidth demo we did at FOSDEM</a>. This required polishing some internal developments, which are now almost ready to be published to the wide world! This should happen in the next few days so stay tuned :)</blockquote>
<h2 id="riot100andhotfix101">Riot 1.0.0, and hotfix 1.0.1</h2>
If you're following Matrix much at all, you will surely have seen it by now: Riot, the most popular client, has <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/the-big-1-0-68fa7c6050be">announced the v1.0 milestone</a>. I won't reiterate the features and improvements here, but do check out the blog post, or just head over to <a href="https://riot.im/app">https://riot.im/app</a> and see for yourself!
<p>Particularly exciting is the new encryption verification process, involving sharing a list of emojis out-of-band:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

<blockquote>boring refactoring stuff :-( at the moment to prepare everything for e2e encryption work</blockquote>
. . .which seems to me not boring at all - we can expect, in the next few months, another Matrix Client with E2EE support, and on mobile!
<p>In my role as editor of this particular blog post, I enjoy certain luxuries that others might envy. For example, today, I tried a new preview build of FluffyChat. This I installed on my barely-repaired OnePlus One running Ubuntu Touch 16.04.</p>

<h2 id="matrixarchivekeyring">matrix-archive-keyring</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been working on new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>:
<blockquote>I've paused porting Synapse to OpenBSD this week, while I attempt to both fix and <em>revert</em> some security issues caused by <code>sudo apt-key add</code> for Matrix.org and Riot.im packages for Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution users.<br /><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4609">matrix-org/synapse PR #4609</a> was my first attempt to fix the problem, however I fell short this time in ease-of-use and my implementation had other issues. (Read: The <code>repo-key.asc</code> downloaded from Matrix.org Debian repository should go to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>, and must not be added by <code>apt-key add</code> or added to <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d</code> directly. I attempted the latter with my first PR; but that would've allowed the Matrix.org signing key to also be used to verify packages from Debian's main repositories. Yikes!)<br />As my second attempt, I'm now creating a new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>. There's multiple things this package intends to do:
</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>A post-install script to remove any previously added Matrix.org package signing keys from <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg</code>. (This is the file <code>apt-key add</code> most commonly uses, and the most commonly found bad advice on the Internet.)</li>
 	<li>Convert <code>repo-key.asc</code> to a de-armorized <code>.gpg</code> format, understood better by apt(8). (Essentially, <code>gpg --dearmor</code>.)</li>
 	<li>Install the converted <code>.gpg</code> key to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>.</li>
 	<li>Make sure <code>apt(8)</code> uses the newly added key for Matrix.org repository only?</li>
 	<li>Deliver any updates to <code>repo-key.asc</code> directly to you via <code>apt upgrade</code>. Your operating system might then also do it automatically for you if <code>unattended-upgrades(8)</code> is installed on your system. ?</li>
 	<li>Make sure everything goes away when this keyring package is uninstalled. No more <code>sudo sh -c 'apt-key del C35EB17E1EAE708E6603A9B3AD0592FE47F0DF61; rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> to get rid of the repository.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
I have one more interesting enhancement to disclose.<br />We can ask you with <code>debconf</code> if you want to install <code>deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian $(lsb_release -cs) main</code> to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> while you're installing the new keyring with <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code>.<br />You'll most likely notice the difference in install instructions, as a result of this package. Before and after:</blockquote>
<pre><code># Before
sudo apt install -y lsb-release curl apt-transport-https
echo "deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian `lsb_release -cs` main" |
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list
curl "https://matrix.org/packages/debian/repo-key.asc" |
    sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
<pre><code># After
sudo apt install matrix-archive-keyring
sudo sh -c 'apt update &amp;&amp; apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
<blockquote>If you are a Debian or Ubuntu user and Synapse homeserver operator using Matrix.org repositories, I'll be towncrying when this package becomes available as much as I can. All you should need to do then is <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code> and it should patch the security holes in your operating system if you've formerly installed packages from Matrix.org or Riot.im! (The command may change a bit, because next Debian operating system release "Buster" has entered soft-freeze just today (2019-02-12) and not accepting new packages into that release.)<br />PS: I'm at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#debian-matrix:matrix.org">#debian-matrix:matrix.org</a>, please come talk to us if Debian packaging interests you!</blockquote>
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For the eager early testers not afraid of building from source, <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code> version <code>2015.12.09+debian0.10</code> is available for early testing (attached).
<pre><code># Something like this!
sudo apt install devscripts
tar -xfvJ matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10.tar.xz
cd matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10
debuild -us -uc
sudo dpkg -i dpkg -i ../matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10_all
</code></pre>
Please follow <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=922155">Debian Bug#922155</a> for updates. Debian binary packages will be available later sometime this/next week from Debian's <code>unstable</code> distribution (<code>contrib</code>), if all goes well and there are no remaining Debian policy violations or serious bugs.

<blockquote>Synapse 1.0.0 will be compliant with r0.1 and the goal of Synapse 0.99.0 is to act as a stepping stone to Synapse 1.0. Synapse 0.99.0 supports the r0.1 release of the server to server specification, but is compatible with both the legacy Matrix federation behaviour (pre-r0.1) as well as post-r0.1 behaviour, in order to allow for a smooth upgrade across the federation.<br />It is critical that all admins upgrade to 0.99.0 and configure a valid TLS certificate. Admins will have 1 month to do so, after which 1.0.0 will be released and those servers without a valid certificate will no longer be able to federate with &gt;= 1.0.0 servers.</blockquote><br /><em>Please</em> <a href="/blog/2019/02/05/synapse-0-99-0/">read the announcement post</a> and be sure to come and chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a> if you need help!<br /><h2 id="gsoc2019">GSOC 2019</h2><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> has been helping admin this year's GSOC application:<br /><blockquote>Matrix.org has applied to be a GSOC (Google Summer of Code) mentoring organisation.

So to get it to work, I had to patch the app and write a little proxy so it gets the proper homeserver (and optionally identity server) from an email address.<br />A patched version of Tchap can be found at <a href="https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android">https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android</a>, code for the proxy at <a href="https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-proxy">https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-proxy</a>. At the moment it's very crude, and images/files don't work since the virus scan API is unimplemented, but at least it can be used outside the French government. ?</blockquote>

<h2 id="preparingforsynapseonopenbsd">Preparing for Synapse on OpenBSD</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been making progress on a project to get Synapse running on OpenBSD, and to that end has been preparing and improving the dependencies that we take for granted on Linux. To summarise the current status:
<blockquote>This week I've been porting Synapse's dependencies to OpenBSD <code>-current</code> distribution. There is no port yet for Synapse in OpenBSD.
Ports missing from OpenBSD <code>6.4</code> for Synapse's dependencies were:</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li><code>py-frozendict</code>: ok'd, waiting…</li>
 	<li><code>py-unpaddedbase64</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-canonicaljson</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-signedjson</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-treq</code>: WIP (this will take a while, lots of dependencies)</li>
 	<li><code>py-daemonize</code>: ok'd, waiting…</li>
 	<li><code>py-pymacaroons</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-phonenumbers</code>: <code>8.10.4</code> done, waiting to be imported…</li>
 	<li><code>py-prometheus_client</code> done, needs to be tested/imported…</li>
 	<li><code>coturn</code>: TBD, maybe?</li>
</ul>
waiting = usually waiting for an OpenBSD developer to "ok" and import
<blockquote>Of those, <code>py-phonenumbers</code> was added to OpenBSD<br /><code>-snapshots</code> (<code>-current</code>) distribution. <code>py-phonenumbers</code> (?) and <code>py-service_identity</code> received updates to ports. <code>py-prometheus_client</code>, <code>py-daemonize</code> and <code>py-frozendict</code> are ported ready and waiting to be given "ok" at OpenBSD's <code>ports@</code> mailing list.<br />There is <a href="https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip/tree/master/net/synapse">an unofficial up-to-date Synapse port exists at GitHub</a> maintained by someone else, which I've not yet tested. (At glance, I can take a guess the <code>devel/tz</code> port may not be required.)<br />(<code>coturn</code> doesn't have a port yet, may have to look at it later.)</blockquote>

<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
Neil and the team have been working frantically on getting a new Synapse release out this week:
<blockquote>This week has been all about gearing up for v0.99.0 and if you would like to help us test it, our latest release candidate lives <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.0rc4">here</a><br />We've taken the decision to bump up to v0.99.0 because it is very much a precursor to v1.0. When v1.0 lands it will contain a breaking change that means all homeservers will need a valid certificate for their server to server endpoint, self signing will no longer be possible.<br />v0.99.0 contains support to help you do this, but once it lands all admins will need to upgrade, failure to do so will mean losing the ability to federate with &gt; v1.0 servers.<br />We'll have detailed docs ready to go alongside the full v0.99.0 release, and we plan to leave at least 1 month between v0.99.0 and v1.0, but for now please be aware that the change is coming.<br />Huge thanks to Rich, Erik, Hawkowl and Anoa for all their work in getting us to rc stage.</blockquote>

<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Working furiously towards an r0 spec release. Event ids as hashes (MSC 1659) and S2S API certificates (MSC 1659 ) are very close now - see <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8</a> to track our progress.</li>
 	<li>Since <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1711">MSC1711</a> is a breaking change, we will initially ship our next release (v0.35.0) with ACME support to make it easy to provision and renew certificates. The give everyone a month to upgrade and install a cert before we ship Synapse v1.0 which will require that servers have certificates in order to federate. Don't worry, there will be plenty of details on the steps necessary for admins when v0.35.0 lands - watch this space.</li>
 	<li>Finally a raft of db performance improvements, room version upgrade bug fixes, as well taking a look at room directory and user directory efficiency.</li>

<ul>
 	<li>The bridge could not create new Matrix rooms on versions of Synapse after a certain change, because it did not reserve the room alias prefix it used. That's been fixed, but anyone currently running matrix-puppet-slack will need to edit their slack_registration.yaml and restart Synapse. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack/releases/tag/1.10.1">the Release</a> for instructions on doing so.</li>
 	<li>The bridge will no longer send "Edit: " events when Slack sends it a "message_changed" message, if the message text has not actually changed (Slack sends these events for URL previews, for example, but this just causes duplicate bridged messages). This fix has been a long time coming.</li>

</h3><br /><blockquote>We are still working on the key backup screens. The last bit on the SDK side, the passphrase support, has been implemented this week.
<br /><br />Reskin is almost done. It just needs some small adjustments. We will release a beta soon so that we can gather users feedback.
<br /><br />This week, we have also fixed small but boring UX issues in Riot and we will continue to do so up to the end of the month and FOSDEM!
</blockquote><br /><h3>Riot Android
</h3><br /><blockquote>Reskin is almost done too and available on develop builds.
<br /><br />Benoit has started to implement the key backup passphrase management in the SDK. Valere is still improving push notifications at the code level but also at the display level.
<br /><br />We are working hard to polish the app for FOSDEM.

</h3><br />Rick reports:<br /><blockquote>We now have a
<b> HipChat migration tool - </b><a href="https://www.modular.im/tools/hipchat-migration">https://www.modular.im/tools/hipchat-migration</a><b>. </b>This tool helps migrate a HipChat workspace to your very own Modular Hosted Homeserver. Migration is performed by uploading an exported copy of an existing HipChat workspace so that the tool can automatically re-create all of the users and rooms (including messages and attachments) on your new Matrix homeserver. Once the migration is complete all of the migrated users will be emailed with login instructions, so that they can seamlessly continue chatting where they left off in HipChat. If your organisation (or if you know of an organisation that) has not yet decided what to do when Stride &amp; HipChat is discontinued next month, come and try Modular!

</h3><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a> reports:<br /><blockquote>People have been generally happy about the flood of new issues following the completion of the internal audit last week, and a few folks have been opening PRs addressing some of the “good-first-issues” labeled ones, which has been amazing to see, including fixing room joins and a couple of default variables.

<br /><br />On my end, this week mainly consisted in reviewing most of these PRs (and merging them when that was possible), while <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> worked on making Dendrite's CI more complete and reliable, especially by configuring it to run <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">sytest</a> against Dendrite which will allow us to better track its compliance to the Matrix specification.
<br /><br />If you're interested in contributing on Dendrite, there's still some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">“good first issues”</a> open, and we'll be happy to chat and help in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite-dev:matrix.org">#dendrite-dev:matrix.org</a> ?

<h2>Matrix.org Foundation

Matthew has a final draft of the Matrix.org Foundation governance document ready: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1779/proposals/1779-open-governance.md">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1779/proposals/1779-open-governance.md</a>. Comments on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1779">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1779</a> would be much appreciated!  We expect to propose merging it next week, and then incorporating it into the final Articles of the foundation.
<h2>Riot Web</h2>
Loads and loads of work happening on <a href="https://riot.im/experimental">https://riot.im/experimental</a> which is now where all new development is happening as we race towards launching the new design.  Highlights include:
<ul>
 	<li>All new key verification is implemented! (in olm &amp; matrix-js-sdk).  We're currently hooking up the UX.</li>
 	<li>Online key backup is pretty much finished.</li>
 	<li>Cross-signing is up next.</li>
 	<li>Redesign backlog is progressing (slightly stuck on making the RoomList resizing work nicely, but almost there)</li>
 	<li>Finalising the all new registration/login screens</li>
 	<li>...and loads of other stuff too.</li>
</ul>

On this subject, it's always worth thinking about the importance of openness and interoperability in messaging.

Come chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> with your Matrix news to be featured in this post. Next Friday there will be another weekly edition, but before then expect to see an edition to the effect "benpa's best-of-the-community 2018".

It's the 28th of December as I write this, and I hope you had a good year. Long as it is, I recommend reading <a href="/blog/2018/12/25/the-2018-matrix-holiday-special/">Matthew's write-up of the year</a>, as it covers a lot of ground!
<p>Many of the core team have been out of the office this week, but there are still plenty of updates to share from the Matrix ecosystem!</p>
<h2 id="mxisdv122">mxisd v1.2.2</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> released mxisd v1.2.2:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a> had a Holiday-special release: <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.2.2">v1.2.2</a> before v1.3.0.
<p>This release introduces two new big features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Username login rewriting via 3PID to allow advanced flows, like bypassing the synapse restriction of having numerical usernames for non-guest users</li>
 	<li>Support for multiple Base DNs for LDAP backends</li>
</ul>
Work has started on v1.3.0 so this is definitely the last release before a non-backward compatible release.</blockquote>

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:feneas.org">Jason Robinson</a>:
<blockquote>I started work on a Prometheus Alertmanager bot for Matrix.

From the release notes:
<blockquote>New features:
<ul>
 	<li>Enhanced history view with adaptive layout, day divider</li>
 	<li>Reorganised headerbar, app menu merged with user menu</li>
 	<li>Larger display of emoji-only messages</li>
 	<li>Some performance improvements</li>
 	<li>Opening a room jumps to first unread message</li>
</ul>
Bugfixes:
<ul>
 	<li>More reliable notifications</li>

</ul>
Under the hood:
<ul>
 	<li>Large code refactor</li>
 	<li>Logging infrastructure</li>
 	<li>Continuous integration</li>
 	<li>More informative build output</li>

If/when the proposal or something similar goes through, I'll probably add support for it in the new command handling system.<br /><br />Next I'll make some developer docs so that other people could actually make their own plugins.<br /><br />The code is at <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">https://github.com/maubot/maubot</a> and you can ask about maubot in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#maubot:maunium.net">#maubot:maunium.net</a>.</blockquote><br /><h2 id="matrixclientelnewfeatures">matrix-client.el new features</h2><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alphapapa:matrix.org">alphapapa</a>:<br /><blockquote>Emacs makes it so easy to integrate things.

                <h2 id="matrixlivehalfshottalksbridgesandworkingonlibpurplebridgingtomatrix">Matrix Live: Half-Shot talks bridges, and working on libpurple bridging to Matrix</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">You may have seen that <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> been working fearlessly and tirelessly on bridges for many, many months. In this episode of Matrix Live Half-Shot chats with Matthew about his work, progress and achievements, with a focus on recent <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a> and XMPP work. Audio is not amazing, but worth listening to get acquainted with recent work.</p>

As a note from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>:
<blockquote>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a> bridge gained a XMPP specific backend for better performance when you want to do just xmpp bridging. It's rather quick right now, and needs dogfooding.</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a>:</p>
<blockquote>A couple of weeks ago, <a href="https://github.com/fr1kin">fr1kin</a> PR'd a nice Matrix badge to the <a href="https://shields.io/">Shields</a> project that tells you how many users are in a public room. There were a few issues with it so I PR'd some changes to make the badge more usable, and it's now merged and live (as of yesterday evening), with examples available <a href="https://shields.io/#/examples/chat">here</a>! ?<br />For instance, here's a badge for TWIM: <a href="https://img.shields.io/matrix/twim:matrix.org.svg">https://img.shields.io/matrix/twim:matrix.org.svg</a> ?</blockquote>
<h2 id="specupdate">Spec update</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1756">New MSC for cross-signing</a>, which has different (hopefully better) semantics from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1680">previous cross-signing MSC</a>.
<h2 id="matrixjssdkbotsupportforapplicationservices">matrix-bot-sdk support for application services</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>, author of <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a>:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> has received early support for application services. Similar to the official <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">matrix-js-sdk</a>, the bot-sdk uses an Intent-based model for making bridges easier to write. Check out the simple example <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk/blob/master/examples/appservice.ts">here</a> for more information on how it works.</blockquote><br /><h2 id="komalibrary">koma-library</h2><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@druig:matrix.org">druig</a> continues work on their JavaFX/kotlin client project:<br /><blockquote>The matrix client API implementation in <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma">koma</a> is being extracted into <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma-library">a new repo</a>, which is going to be a lightweight library for Kotlin.</blockquote>
<h2 id="seaglassnowavailableonhomebrew">Seaglass now available on homebrew</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aaron:raim.ist">Aaron Raimist</a> reports that Seaglass is available on homebrew for macOS:
<blockquote>Installing Seaglass is now easier than ever. If you already use Homebrew to manage other packages, you can now install Seaglass with a simple <code>brew cask install seaglass</code>.<br /><br />If you don't use Homebrew, you can still <a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass/releases">download Seaglass from GitHub</a>.</blockquote><br /><h2 id="matrixclientelexists">matrix-client.el is reborn!</h2><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alphapapa:matrix.org">alphapapa</a> reports from a team who have forked and are maintaining a Matrix client for Emacs:<br /><blockquote>Many additions and improvements to matrix-client.el (https://github.com/jgkamat/matrix-client-el) recently, including a "standalone client" mode that launches Emacs to look like this.</blockquote>

<blockquote>the <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> playbook has received some bugfixes and improvements lately. Most importantly, it's now running the freshly-released Synapse 0.34.0 under Python 3, so memory usage should be much better.</blockquote><br /><h2 id="libqmatrixclientquaternion">libQMatrixClient/Quaternion</h2><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>:<br /><blockquote>I started work on matrix: scheme support in libQMatrixClient/Quaternion.

<h2 id="fractalroadto40">Fractal road to 4.0</h2>
Fresh from their hackfest in Seville last week, <a href="@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre Franke</a> reports:
<blockquote>The <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a> crew spent the week chasing last minutes bugs and made two beta releases (3.99.0 and 3.99.1) in preparation for the big new stable release, 4.0, which is right around the corner.</blockquote><br /><h2 id="newroomsforspacelaunchesandaviation">New Rooms for Space Launches and Aviation</h2><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aaron:raim.ist">Aaron Raimist</a> has been creating some new rooms:<br /><blockquote><strong><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#space:im.kabi.tk">#space:im.kabi.tk</a></strong> for anyone interested in space, rocket launches, satellites, etc.<br />Are you wondering what NASA's new Mars Rover is doing? Maybe you live on the west coast of the United States, and you saw that meteor on Wednesday night that came within minutes of a scheduled rocket launch and just after three astronauts left the space station. If any of that sounds interesting to you, feel free to join the room.<br />A Matrix bot is being tested to send updates about upcoming rocket launches to the room.<br /><br /><strong><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#aviation:matrix.org">#aviation:matrix.org</a></strong> for anyone interested in aviation.

<h2 id="t2botioupgrade">t2bot.io upgrade</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>:
<blockquote>Just a head's up that I've increased the storage capacity of the database. With current projections, the server should be good for another year or two.<br /><br />The database is also 1ms closer to Synapse and has a faster CPU in it. It probably won't make a dent in speed on federation, but it is a step forward.<br /><br />I'll be rolling out python 3 to the homeserver this week too, which should help a little bit.</blockquote><br /><a href="https://riot.im/experimental/#/room/#help:t2bot.io/$154511414912clELm:t2l.io">https://riot.im/experimental/#/room/#help:t2bot.io/$154511414912clELm:t2l.io</a><br /><h2 id="fluffychat80rcannounced">FluffyChat 8.0 RC announced</h2><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:chat.regionetz.net">Krille</a> and his Ubuntu Touch fans are looking forward to FluffyChat 8.0:<br /><blockquote>Hey guys, in order to release the FluffyChat 8.0 Christmas Edition, the <a href="https://github.com/ChristianPauly/fluffychat">FluffyChat</a> 8.0 release candidate is ready for you! :-)<br />Also the weblate translations are ready: <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/fluffychat/">https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/fluffychat/</a></blockquote>
<h2 id="riotios">Riot iOS</h2>

 	<li>Back to reskin. We start to implement e2e backup screens.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="riotandroid">Riot Android</h2>
From the Riot Android team:
<ul>
 	<li>New screen to troubleshoot notification issue has been merged on <code>/develop</code>.</li>
 	<li>Splitting current Android SDK to separate crypto part is on it's way. We're doing this in order to be able to integrate crypto faster in the Riot reboot.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
Neil from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">Synapse</a> reports:
<blockquote>We released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.34.0">0.34.0</a>! This release recommends Python 3 for production and brings with it huge performance improvements. If you've been putting upgrading off upgrading your Synapse, now is the time to do so. For more details <a href="/blog/2018/12/21/porting-synapse-to-python-3/">here is a post</a> that explains what you should expect and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad3oqEo5leM">recent Matrix Live interviews</a> Amber (hawkowl) on the subject.<br /><br />Aside from that we are working furiously towards federation R0 and have a bunch of MSCs to get us ever closer. You can <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/2">track our progress here</a>.</blockquote><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewsh:matrix.org">andrewsh</a> notes that 0.34.0 is also available in the Debian repos:<br /><blockquote>Synapse 0.34.0~rc2 in Debian since Tuesday, 0.34.0 uploaded today; both use Python 3 only</blockquote>
<h2 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a> reports:
<blockquote>Dendrite's internal audit is progressing very well and is getting very close to its end.<br />What's left to do for me is check the implementation status of a few Matrix features, and translate those into tagged GitHub issues so that everyone can have as clear of a view as possible on what's left to work on.<br />I'm on holiday all of next week, but hopefully will have some good news about that the following week.</blockquote>
