<p>kitsune writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> 0.3.0.2 has been released - no new features, just small fixes including one for an unlucky typo preventing 0.3.0.1 from generating .cpp files with GTAD.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> 0.0.9.2 is out, another step towards 0.1. Aside from bugfixes and using the latest libQMatrixClient, it features an entirely new timeline layout similar to that of Riot (the old one is still around too). Also, you can now change some settings through the menu rather than by editing a configuration file or registry - including switching timeline layouts on the fly!</p>

<p>ma1uta writes about his <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon">jeon</a> Java HS, <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk">jmsdk</a> and Matrix <a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/matrix-api.html">spec work</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I reorganized my projects and extracted the sdk from the api. So, today I have one project for the api (<a class="linkified" href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon</a>), another for the sdk (<a class="linkified" href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk</a>) but last is very early and non-usable.<br />Also I covered the code with the swagger-annotation and now I can generate the swagger schema from the code. There is an example: <a class="linkified" href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon/blob/master/client-api/generated/swagger-ui/swagger.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon/blob/master/client-api/generated/swagger-ui/swagger.json</a><br />And there is an example of the spec was generated from swagger: <a class="linkified" href="https://ma1uta.github.io/matrix-api.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ma1uta.github.io/matrix-api.html</a> (plain and without sorting or grouping, I'll maybe fix it).<br />Everyone can ask me in the <a class="" title="#jeon:matrix.org" href="https://riot.im/develop/#/room/#jeon:matrix.org" data-reactroot="">#jeon:matrix.org</a> (matrix api) or <a class="" title="#mxtoot:matrix.org" href="https://riot.im/develop/#/room/#mxtoot:matrix.org" data-reactroot="">#mxtoot:matrix.org</a> (matrix-mastodon bridge).<br />Then I want to cover the remaining api (appservice, push, identity but not federation because it isn't completed yet), write sdk (client, bot). And publish api and sdk on the maven central repository.</p>

<h3 id="ci-cd-for-plasma">CI/CD for Plasma!</h3>
<p>Nico gives updates on <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/">Plasma</a>, the new Scala/Akka homeserver:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've setup <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/pipelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CI/CD</a> for plasma HS. Now every time a push occur on the repo, the pipeline builds and deploys a plasma HS instance on a test server.<br />This test instance is reachable at <a class="linkified" href="http://matrix.beerfactory.org:9000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://matrix.beerfactory.org:9000</a>. For now it is very modest and can only reply to a few C2S endpoints like <a href="http://matrix.beerfactory.org:9000/_matrix/client/versions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>GET /_matrix/client/versions</code></a>. <code>POST /_matrix/client/r0/login</code> and <code>POST /_matrix/client/r0/register</code> are also available for testing registration and login flow. <code>POST /_matrix/client/r0/createRoom</code> is also available with the <code>TEST_TOKEN</code> auth token value, but it's only a mock.<br />I'm now working on implementing the concept of room servers: each room will be managed by a dedicated room server (an <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/actors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actor</a>), so they get fault tolerance and scalability by default (through <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/common/cluster.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">akka clustering</a>).<br />There's also a dedicated room for this project : <a class="" title="#plasma:beerfactory.org" href="https://riot.im/develop/#/room/#plasma:beerfactory.org" data-reactroot="">#plasma:beerfactory.org</a></p>

<p>v0.3.2 of matrix-python-sdk released. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk/releases/tag/v0.3.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the github release</a> for list of changes. (v0.3.0 and v0.3.1 are substantially the same with small formatting errors). There are a lot of hugely annoying bugs fixed in this one, so upgrading soon is recommended.</p>

<p>There's also been a lot of work on adding E2E to the python-sdk from Zil0 and his GSoC project!</p>
<h3 id="gomatrixclient">gomatrixclient</h3>
<p>Black Hat writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am currently writing a high-level API on top of gomatrix. As gomatrix is suitable for bots but not for clients, I decided to write a layer above it.
(The motivation is to provide a backend for Matrique)
It will have similar API as libqmatrixclient, but in Golang.
It is currently under heavy development, and API breaking changes are frequent.
Sources are available in Gitlab: <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/gomatrixclient">https://gitlab.com/b0/gomatrixclient</a>P.s. It is a library for writing clients in Golang. But it also provides useful APIs for basic functions, e.g. getting avatars.</p>

<h3 id="fractal-3-29-1">Fractal 3.29.1</h3>
<p>Tobias says: New <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal">Fractal release</a> 3.29.1, which includes a Eisha's new image viewer [implemented as part of GSoC]!</p>

<h3 id="terraform-provider">Terraform Provider</h3>
<p>TravisR writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a Terraform provider for matrix. It is still a work in progress, however I plan to have the basics completed in the coming days. The provider gives you the opportunity to create users, rooms, and other objects on your homeserver, making your homeserver part of your infrastructure. This could be useful for people who want to set up a monitoring room, or for setting up default rooms on a homeserver instance. In particular, this provider will be used by the monitor bot (see last week's post) to set up the test homeservers for seeing how the bot scales with increased server counts.

<h3 id="mxtoot-0-4-3">mxtoot 0.4.3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>ma1uta says:</p>
<p>I've fixed a few bugs and added some new commands (show status by id and show n-last statuses), and now
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/mxtoot">mxtoot 0.4.3</a> (Matrix-Mastodon bridge) can send public, private, unlisted and direct messages.
There are 4 features left to go:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>show, add and remove follows;</li>
 	<li>show threads;</li>
 	<li>show notification, public and federated lines (and optionally merge them with the home timeline);</li>
 	<li>show account info by id.</li>
</ul>
Also I think to implement a bridge Matrix-ActivityPub as S2S. For example, a room - is a ActivityPub's actor. Room participants is a bot corresponds to actors you follow to. Room timeline is a Inbox+Outbox. Reactions is a likes/favorites. Pinning message is a boost. Replies will be very useful.

<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> now supports logging in with your own bot. It means that you can look almost like a real user and even use direct messages without logging in with your real Telegram account!</p>

<h3 id="and-finally">And finally...</h3>
<p>On the core team it's been an irregular week; as mentioned in last TWIM we spent most of it in workshops working through spec issues as part of the mission to finally get to an 'r0' stable release of the spec across all APIs - not just the Client/Server API.  The majority of this was spent making up for lost time on the S2S API, analysing its various holes and designing solutions to them.  Things are looking promising - we're keeping the work under wraps though given the potential for abuse, although we should see more gaps being fixed in the coming days.  Meanwhile we're aiming to get the r0 stable release out by the end of August.  We also unblocked a few longstanding MSCs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/433">.well-known</a> URIs and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1232">media limits</a>), although in the end the S2S stuff took priority.  On the client side we did a lot of design sessions on Riot/Mobile (working out how the new app design should work on Mobile - watch this space for details!) and also how to speed up app launch (the concept of Hybrid Sync; somewhere between an initial sync and an incremental sync - basically an initial sync which can be interrupted in order to let the user use the app whilst the initial sync is still ongoing) - we'll write up the notes and publish these asap.</p>
<p>We also announced the <a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">Open Governance</a> work which we've been doing in order to extend control of the Matrix spec to properly include the wider Matrix community - the plan is to get the Matrix.org Foundation legal entity set up roughly around the same time as the r0 release of the spec in August, and formally decouple control of the Matrix spec from New Vector (the company we set up last year to hire the core team).</p>
<p>We'd also like to welcome mujx (developer of nheko) and kitsune (developer of Quaternion and libQMatrixClient) to the new core team as we start trialling the new governance structure (which mainly amounts at this point to getting review approvals on spec proposals and changes from the relevant domain experts on the new team).  This brings us to a full complement for the team: Erik (servers), richvdh (servers, crypto &amp; clients), Dave (clients &amp; push/identity) and uhoreg (crypto, general) from the current core team; and Anoa (servers, AS API), TravisR (integrations, AS API; acting with Dimension hat on), mujx &amp; kitsune from the community.</p>
<p>Otherwise, spec work has taken priority over writing software, with the exception of: APwhitehat doing as much federation work in Dendrite as part of GSoC as the current unstable state of the API allows; Michael (t3chguy) has been blitzing through P1 Riot/Web issues.  Next week should be back on the normal (if not better!) trajectory however.  No Matrix Live this week however, as we're all exhausted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am working on implementing end-to-end encryption in the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">Python SDK</a>. As of now, I have done a good part of the encryption and decryption work with Olm and Megolm, enough to allow communicating with Riot in an encrypted room. My next goals include device list tracking and key persistence, which are the main steps left before the implementation starts being usable in a real environment.</p>

<p>My aim is to achieve feature completion on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>. Have got lots of help from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>, for which I'm very grateful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Features worked on this month:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>we made a transactions cache/table for idempotency. So now dendrite will not reprocess events as far as client-server api is concerned.</li>
 	<li>added request authentication function which recognises an application service user (partially landed.)</li>
 	<li>username auto generation, which let's you register without username (will be used for guest access later.)</li>
 	<li>We also added a tokens library based on macaroons, however we might not be using it anytime soon. Since it's been known to be very problematic (on synapse).</li>
 	<li>Other small bug fixes not big enough to mention.</li>
</ul>

As backend it uses the <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/matrix-java-sdk">matrix-java-sdk</a>, the GUI is written in TornadoFX, a Kotlin-Wrapper for JavaFX. The room for this client is <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#palaver:matrix.localtoast.de">#palaver:matrix.localtoast.de</a>. The current features are listed in the changelog: <a href="https://github.com/MrCustomizer/palaver/blob/v0.1.0/CHANGELOG.md">https://github.com/MrCustomizer/palaver/blob/v0.1.0/CHANGELOG.md</a>.

<h3 id="kitsune-gtad-and-libqmatrixclient"><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>: <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad">GTAD</a> and <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has announced <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad">GTAD</a> v0.6 and <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> v0.3. We've covered <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad">GTAD</a> before, but I think it's worth including this note from the readme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GTAD (Generate Things from an API Description) is a generator of code from a Swagger/OpenAPI specification. Initially made to generate marshalling/unmarshalling C++ code for Matrix CS API, it can be extended to support other API descriptions and other programming languages with static type checking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> regarding the GTAD 0.6 release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version of API code generator, GTAD, 0.6, has been released today, adding support of variant types, proper dealing with definitions referencing other files ($ref) and more options to override schema names - even defined inline. Most importantly, GTAD has got extensive README.md that describes (most of) the things needed to start writing your own templates! As usual, kitsune will be happy to help those who would like to try it (both with C/C++ projects and other languages).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>libQMatrixClient has been benefiting from GTAD over the last 4 months or so - but this is the first release where GTAD is stable and feature-complete enough to be shared with other projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://matrix.to/#/#gtad:matrix.org">#gtad:matrix.org</a> is the new room for GTAD chat and support.</p>
<p>and <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> 0.3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version of libQMatrixClient, 0.3, comes out this weekend. This is the first libQMatrixClient release to include (almost) all CS API requests and supplementary (non-event) definitions, thanks to GTAD 0.6. Notably, it now includes jobs to register users, manage devices and keys on the server (no local key management yet - E2E work has just begun). This version also gains centralised request error handling so that clients could deal with problems in a unified way, and support &quot;Consent not given&quot; errors of GDPR fame, so that client authors could automatically open consent pages. You can also trigger logging out of all devices through libQMatrixClient thanks to a very recent addition to CS API spec from <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We've got a shiny new application service component which runs as a separate process (if you're doing multiprocess dendrite) that handles all outbound communication to application services. Last week I got event sending working. This week I'm hooking up an internal API for other components (roomserver, c-s api) to talk to the app service component, as we occasionally need to ping AS's to ask about existence of rooms or users. Getting those two endpoints covered is the goal of this week.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> appeared with an extremely ambitious piece of work. His goal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to create a full spec's implementation on java (all 5 specification). After that I want try to write a homeserver (2 variants: distributed on java+kafka and simple which can run on a light vps). But it's a long-term goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far work has begun on an implementation of the Matrix API in Java:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon</a> - another java implementation of the matrix api (client-server, server-server, application server, push server, identity server) using jax-ws. It corresponds the specification on <a href="/docs/spec">https://matrix.org/docs/spec</a>. On the next step I want dive deep into synapse to parse it's api and fill the gaps of the spec with sending pull request. May be I will write something like a TCK (test compatibility kit).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And an SDK for which there is a sample bot for mastodon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also this project has a very early sdk (client, bot). I will fix it after finishing works with the spec.
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/mxtoot">https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/mxtoot</a> - matrix-mastodon bridge.
With this bridge you can invite a bot and read your home mastodon's timeline, post messages, reply and boost messages.</p>

<p><b>HAPPY GDPR DAY EVERYONE!!!!1!</b></p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Our long-awaited new <a href="/docs/guides/privacy_notice.html">privacy policy</a> & <a href="/docs/guides/terms_and_conditions.html">term & conditions</a> for the matrix.org server are here - Phase 1 is complete!
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Folks are already accepting the new policies - thanks.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">We're going to start requiring acceptance to access the matrix.org server on Tuesday (May 29th).
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">We're already receiving our first GDPR requests… :|
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Erasure and Right-to-be-forgotten work (Phase 2) is next up so we can action the requests in a timely manner.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like we will go ahead on removing MXIDs on events as a Phase 3 (although for now we do warn people that this is effectively a technical limitation of Matrix, albeit one that we're working on).

<h3 id="mtxclient-e2e-progress">mtxclient E2E progress</h3>
<p>Big E2E progress from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mujx:matrix.org">mujx</a>, developer of the <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> client on his project <a href="https://github.com/mujx/mtxclient">mtxclient</a>. <a href="https://github.com/mujx/mtxclient/commit/7e522df71c804cbc04f38007c3958ebbb56815d3">As of this week</a>, mxtclient is able to decrypt group events. When writing (that is, sending encrypted messages) is complete, the idea is to migrate this work back to nheko, though mujx points out this library could be used in any client.</p>

This tool is used to output the last five messages from a given room to displayed as HTML, the idea being to display output from a specific room as a website widget. You can see an example using <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev</a> <a href="http://matrix.hackerspaces.be:1337/!XqBunHwQIXUiqCaoxq:matrix.org?color=green">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="opsdroid-room-state-connector">opsdroid room state connector</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@SolarDrew:matrix.org">SolarDrew</a> implemented a <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/database-matrix">database module</a>for <a href="https://opsdroid.github.io/">opsdroid</a> to allow Matrix room state to be used to persist chat bot memory. (Suggestion apparently came from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a>, the human not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadair_Idris">the place</a>.)</p>
<p>The idea of using the room state to encapsulate bot data per-room was well received, discussion in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#TWIM:matrix.org</a> suggests this is an estabilished practice for some developers.</p>

<p><a href="https://brendan.abolivier.bzh/">Brendan</a> produced a <a href="https://brendan.abolivier.bzh/enter-the-matrix/">really, really informative article introducing Matrix</a>.

<h2 id="spec-proposals">Spec Proposals</h2>
<p>As you may have seen from the <a href="/blog/2018/05/17/introducing-matrix-specification-changes/">previous blog post</a>, we have a new drive to advance the Matrix Specification itself. Part of this is <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a>, which lists all the spec change proposals we've accumulated so far, and describes the flow for getting new proposals merged. There is a new room, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> for discussion, please join if you want to get involved in this process. Check out the page and the blog post for more detail.</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Fractal2018">Fractal Hackfest 2018</a>: was super successful and productive by all accounts, and there were many!

<p>A major topic at the Hackfest was a discussion of splitting the Fractal client into two UIs for the different behaviours of messaging apps. For anyone interested in product design thinking this is a genuinely fascinating topic. I encourage you to read <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2018/05/16/banquets-and-barbecues/">&quot;Banquets and Barbecues&quot;, Tobias' excellent coverage</a> of the latest thinking.

Lots of excitement at the variety of independent clients and servers able to interact over the matrix protocol. The images above show <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">The Construct</a> (server) and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a> (client), and then <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a> and <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a>. A fundamental part of matrix is to be an open protocol, so it's great to see entirely independent implementations liaising together! While implementing <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> has been documenting spec omissions <a href="https://kamax.io/matrix/api/client_server/unstable.html">in a branch of the spec</a> - we're hoping he will contribute these back!</p>
<p>Honourable mention for <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mujx:matrix.org">mujx</a>, who was sending messages with <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">Ruma</a> a year ago!</p>
<h2 id="matrix-core-team-expansion">Matrix Core team expansion</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Stève - 17th May (yesterday)</li>
 	<li>Amber - 21st (Monday)</li>
 	<li>Anoa - 21st (Monday)</li>
 	<li>Hubert - 28th May</li>
 	<li>Half-Shot - 4th June
...and one more community member, hopefully (just sorting paperwork currently!)</li>
</ul>
Heads up that we're consciously trying to hire a mix of folks from the Matrix community as well as those outside it - and avoid hiring the whole community, both to ensure diversity of viewpoint & experience in the core team, and also to avoid cannibalising folks who working on their own commercial projects on top of Matrix. We'd prefer Matrix to be as decentralised and heterogenous as possible, needless to say - and instead try to support folks in building on Matrix without hiring them into the core team (where we'd expect them to focus on the core project for everyone's benefit). This may change once we have Matrix set up as a separate foundation, once we've got out of beta, of course.
<h2 id="new-rooms">New Rooms</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> is a new room dedicated to discussions on specific matrix spec proposals, as part of the process we're building around contributing to the matrix spec.</li>

<p>The talk of the town in Strasbourg this week was the arrival of Fractal Hackfest 2018! Event is still ongoing, and I'm sure they will provide a report of the progress on <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Fractal2018">https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Fractal2018</a>, though <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre</a> kindly sent us a photo of the group in action</p>

<h2 id="home-assistants">Home Assistants</h2>
<p>Wonderful things are happening and being discovered regarding IoT and Home Automation. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg:matrix.org">uhoreg</a> was the first to point us to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tinloaf:matrix.org">tinloaf's</a> project to build a Matrix Chatbot component for <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This component allows you to send messages to matrix rooms, as well as to react to messages in matrix rooms. Reacting to commands is accomplished by firing an event when one of the configured commands is triggered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(this is not the same as notify.matrix <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/notify.matrix/">https://www.home-assistant.io/components/notify.matrix/</a>, which is used to deliver messages from Home Assistant to a room.)</p>
<p>Enthusiasm for this work led to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jon:terracrypt.net">jfred</a> discussing his past adventures in Matrix, including a component for <a href="https://github.com/theschwa/sibyl">sibyl</a>, 'a python chatbot with a focus on XBMC' allowing Matrix communication.</p>
<p>All this excitement led to Cadair creating <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#homeautomation:cadair.com">#homeautomation:cadair.com</a>, which has started a more thorough discussion. I'm eager to see more non-chat applications of Matrix, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> came up with others with projects in progress.</p>
<h2 id="on-gdpr">On GDPR</h2>
<p>GDPR has been a <del>favourite</del> topic for a while now. If you didn't already, take a look at the latest thinking from the Matrix Core team here: <a href="/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/">https://matrix.org/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting that we feel that GDPR is an excellent piece of legislation from the perspective of forcing us to think more seriously about our privacy – it has forced us to re-prioritise all sorts of long-term deficiencies in Matrix (e.g. dependence on DNS; improving User Interactive authentication; improving logout semantics etc).  There's obviously a lot of work to be done here, but hopefully it should all be worth it!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="travisr-on-gdpr">TravisR on GDPR</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/">TravisR</a> has also been thinking about GDPR, and how it relates to his <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-voyager-bot">Voyager bot</a>. In his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TWIM: I've mostly been working on figuring out how GDPR affects t2bot.io for the last couple weeks. One of the things running on t2bot.io is Voyager - a bot that tries to join rooms it sees mentioned in people's messages, graphing them on <a href="https://voyager.t2bot.io">https://voyager.t2bot.io</a>. With the increase in talk about GDPR and more bots starting to wander the federation, the recurring topic of whether Voyager should change its approach to finding and listing rooms.</p>
<p>With the current approach, Voyager reads messages and tries to find room aliases to try and join. Individual people can opt-out of this tracking to stop Voyager from reading/parsing their messages (opting back in at a later time, if desired). The room moderators can kick or ban the bot to completely remove their room from the graph, and can invoke a 'soft kick' if they'd like to have their room remain listed, but don't want the bot in the room. Voyager will make sure to only show information for public rooms and will update the graph if the room flips between public and private.</p>
<p>If anyone has feedback on how this approach could be improved (or if it should be left as-is), please come by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#voyager:t2bot.io">#voyager:t2bot.io</a> on matrix to start the conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="translations">Translations</h2>
<p>I was surprised and excited to learn that a Russian translation of the Matrix FAQ has been produced by a group of Russian-language users. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a several Russian-speaking users spontaneously decided to unite and help Matrix. We created a room where translated FAQ using the embedded etherpad widget. Some of us are here: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@commagray:matrix.org">Magnolia</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@commagray:matrix.org">Fenneko is a Good Girl</a> for example. Anybody can join to us <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#perevodators:matrix.org">#perevodators:matrix.org</a> and helps. We accept any help.<br />  Preview: <a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/index.html">https://ma1uta.github.io/index.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've provided a PR which I will presently merge (though of course, as I don't speak Russian I will need to trust that it's really a translation of the FAQ!)</p>

<h3 id="spec-proposals">Spec Proposals</h3>
<p>Much-needed work has begun to classify and present the spec proposals for the Matrix specification. We've tagged up the all the issues in GitHub, new page will appear on matrix.org at the start of next week if I can just stop preening the generator.</p>

The author is focused more on Riot than Matrix, still it's great knowing how much interest there is in the wild.</p>
<p>Happily, I was at an unrelated event in London earlier in the week, and had my first IRL experience meeting someone who already knew (and then enthused) about the project. Feels good.</p>

<p>Do you have a suggestion for this series? What could we be doing more of? I have a nascent plan to do 'deeper' conversations with people or projects that aren't necessarily in the normal run of things, but are interesting uses of Matrix.

<h4 id="journal">Journal</h4>
<p>One of the riot developers, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lb:ldbco.de">luke</a> has a fun side-project called <em><a href="https://journal.ldbco.de/#/journal/journal:ldbco.de">Journal</a></em>, this being a blogging platform built on matrix.</p>
<p>Says Luke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The big news this week being that I'm going to redesign the interface to focus on the personal blog use-case, optimising for easy setup and easy blog post sharing.
And hopefully push a 1.0 release that I'd be happy to use as my own personal blog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth noting that the linked project page (<a href="https://journal.ldbco.de/#/journal/journal:ldbco.de">Journal</a>) is <em>itself</em> a blog using journal (the url might give you a hint of this!)</p>

<h4 id="gtad">GTAD</h4>
<p>This week <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has been focused on 'GTAD (Generate Things from API Description)', which is a code generator for C++, taking API description in Swagger/OpenAPI as it's source. Now at version 0.5, apparently GTAD</p>
<blockquote>
<p>can generate correct buildable (and runnable) code to convert data structures used in CS API between JSON and C++ - for the entirety of CS API calls. That basically means that libqmatrixclient gains (so far low-level) C++ CS API for all calls in <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/unstable.html">The Spec</a> and will follow updates to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is super-exciting, especially as we are going to see discussion and progress on the spec...</p>

<h4 id="riot-web">Riot/Web</h4>
<ul>
<li>We're committing to 2-weekly releases come what may, to avoid another massive gap like the one between 0.13 and 0.14.</li>
<li>RCs will get cut starting from Wednesday; actual release then happens on the Monday having given folks a chance to test the RC on /staging (and to iterate on the RCs).</li>
<li>Obviously this is flexible if we need to rush out fixes sooner.</li>
<li>On that note, 0.14.2-rc1 was cut on Wednesday!  Please test it at riot.im/staging. It's mainly bugfixes but also the full relayering between riot-web and matrix-react-sdk.</li>
<li>Dave's working on finally hooking in Jitsi as the default conferencing system</li>
<li>t3chguy's been working on Replies, which continue to look awesome</li>
<li>Next up: E2E cross-signing (at last!!!!)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="riot-mobile">Riot/Mobile</h4>
<ul>
<li>New releases are out! Mainly preparing for sticker viewing and trying to fix the Android push notification situation.  PLEASE TELL US IF YOU ARE STILL HAVING ANDROID PUSH NOTIFICATION PROBLEMS!</li>
<li>Lots of review of Android by Benoit - adding in Kotlin support as of today and establishing a formal roadmap for Android work (we'll show the blog post when we have it)</li>
<li>Lots of Matrix-for-French-Government stuff.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="synapse">Synapse</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/2018/04/27/synapse-0-28-0-released/">Synapse 28.0 was released!</a> A major bump mainly thanks to lots and lots of contributions from the wider community.</li>
<li>Massive experimental work on GDPR in progress - doing the thought experiment of pseudonymising MXIDs throughout Matrix on a per-room basis so that it's possible to redact MXIDs in the event of a “right-to-erasure” GDPR event.  Rich vdH is leading the work.</li>
<li>The good news is that introducing an MXID abstraction layer like this could help us enormously with some of Matrix's longest-term architectural issues - i.e. account migration and portability; improving on PERSPECTIVEs for managing server identity; future support for P2P Matrix; solving the domain name reuse problem; etc.</li>
<li>The bad news is that it would obviously be a very significant change to the Matrix spec, although we'd be doing it in such a way which minimises impact to client implementers and keep the CS API looking as similar as possible.</li>
<li>We're not sure whether we need to rush this through or not yet; still waiting for final GDPR clarification from lawyers, but it feels like this might be a good opportunity to force us to finally tackle some of these harder problems.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Erik's Delta State Resolution algorithm work is continuing well; we're hoping to finish & merge it asap in order to get back headroom on the server.</li>
<li>Thankfully the matrix.org synapse itself has been relatively stable this week, other than being completely overloaded causing Freenode to be almost unusable.</li>
<li>We've started using Ansible in production, although the playbooks need some iteration before we're fully happy to announce them & recommend folks use them as an official way of running Synapse in production.</li>

                <h2 id="project-updates">Project Updates</h2>
<h4 id="drupal-matrix-api-module">Drupal matrix_api module</h4>
<p>Updated the Drupal matrix_api module to pass the auth token as a header instead of as a GET param... the GET param was leaking the token if there was an http exception thrown.</p>

<h4 id="mxisd">mxisd</h4>
<p>v1.0.0 has been released and is now stable, making it the first community Identity server and first open federation one.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a>) - <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd">https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd</a></p>
<h4 id="nheko">nheko</h4>
<p>0.3.x of nheko was released! There is progress towards e2e encryption in mujx/mtxclient. Once this encryption is working there, it can eventually be included in nheko.</p>

<h4 id="fractal">Fractal</h4>
<p>Fractal 0.1.26 was released this week, which includes an animated scroll to bottom animation, fixed MacOS compilation, and bug fixes. Since then markdown support and many other commits have been spotted...</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/">https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/</a></p>
<h4 id="libqmatrixclient">libqmatrixclient</h4>
<p>kitsune released 0.2 of libqmatrixclient a couple of weeks ago, which he says is &quot;the first one more or less functional and stable&quot;!</p>
<p>Highlights include redactions support, files transfer (both ways), rooms creation, account data (tags, direct chat flags). Also there are a few things making libqmatrixclient clients stand out compared to, e.g., Riot: one can set per-room names/avatars, and also the best estimate for the number of unread messages can be taken from the library and shown in the client application.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="matrix-monitor-bot">matrix-monitor-bot</h4>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#monitorbot:t2bot.io">#monitorbot:t2bot.io</a> is a bot to measure latency between homeservers (as perceived by users).</p>
<p>It's able to report metrics to Prometheus and has it's own built-in dashboard (see <a href="https://lag.t2bot.io/">https://lag.t2bot.io/</a> for some horrendous times). In the coming weeks it'll become more production-ready, however in the meantime if people are looking to help iron out the scalability issues, please run an instance on your homeserver.</p>

<h4 id="umatriks">uMatriks</h4>
<p>thrrgilag wrote on behalf of uMatriks, to say that v0.10 was published to the openstore this last week which now includes unread counts for rooms. Those not already familiar, uMatriks is a native matrix client being developed for Ubuntu Touch.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks</a></p>
<h4 id="construct">Construct</h4>
<p>There looks to be lots of activity on Construct (jzk's fork of the charybdis ircd which adds in a C++ homeserver implementation) based on the commit log at <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis</a>. jzk's work there has been highlighting some of synapse's nastier problems (e.g. thundering presence bugs), and it looks like the federation support is progressing steadily, including handling EDUs (presence &amp; typing data).

<h4 id="matrix-puppet-maxs">matrix-puppet-maxs</h4>
<p>tyler shared his &quot;horrifying&quot; project, for people that want to use Matrix to send an SMS via an XMPP bridge to their Android phone, in order to provide SMS and call notifications inside Riot.</p>

<h4 id="matrix-register-bot">matrix-register-bot</h4>
<p>krombel built a bot to have a two step registration to synapse, check it out:</p>

<h4 id="picard">picard</h4>
<p>Cadair reported that he and SolarDrew have written a bot to bridge a whole slack team into a matrix community. It basically handles all the room admin for you including:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Invite the slack bot to the channel</li>
 	<li>Creating matrix rooms</li>
 	<li>Setting users as admins</li>
 	<li>Setting room name and room avatar and as publicly joinable</li>
 	<li>Setting up the link with the slack AS</li>
 	<li>Creating and adding rooms to the community</li>
 	<li>Inviting all members of the communtiy to the rooms</li>
</ul>
It does these things on a 1 min cron, to pick up new channels as they are created on the slack side.

<h4 id="opsdroid-connector">opsdroid connector</h4>
<p>Cadair also mentioned that picard uses the opsdroid connector for matrix, also written by himself and SolarDrew, and has had recent updates.</p>

<h4 id="matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</h4>
<p>Release v0.2.0 of the python sdk. Highlights from this release are a workaround for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3054">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3054</a> and use of connection pooling via a requests session.</p>

<h4 id="idlerpg">IdleRPG</h4>
<p>remaeus wrote in to say &quot;we (+rpg:verse.im) just launched an initial build of #idlerpg:verse.im (now also available at #idlerpg:matrix.org) — an automated RPG that rewards you for staying online (via the presence API). It's an initial test case for prototyping out a bot framework called &quot;doorman&quot; with multi-service support, but focused on Matrix as we are using it as a &quot;backbone&quot; for our p2p app framework.&quot;</p>

<h4 id="uri-protocol-scheme">URI protocol scheme</h4>
<p>kitsune started working on a design proposal for the Matrix URI scheme, with the ultimate goal to have the scheme passed through IANA so that we're no worse than IPFS and others. The document is here (alpha quality but comments are already welcome): <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18A3ZRgGR-GLlPXF_VIHxywWiX1vpMvNfAU6JCnNMVuQ/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/18A3ZRgGR-GLlPXF_VIHxywWiX1vpMvNfAU6JCnNMVuQ/edit</a></p>
<p>There is also a spec proposal room: <a>#uri-scheme-proposal:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>)</p>
<h4 id="riot-web">Riot/Web</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>The Great Relayering landed - almost all of Riot/Web's code is now gathered together in one sensible place (matrix-react-sdk). No more duplicate PRs or CSS & JS living in different repos!</li>
 	<li>Folks with open PRs against the riot-web repository will need to reopen them against matrix-react-sdk (or more likely, merge them into their existing equivalents on matrix-react-sdk)</li>
 	<li>Michael (t3chguy's) Replies work has almost landed and is looking fantastic!</li>
 	<li>Next up: improving test coverage slightly; fixing regressions in 0.14; and a few other minor bits and bobs before we land 0.15.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="riot-mobile">Riot/Mobile</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>New releases on the horizon for both iOS & Android</li>
 	<li>Welcomed Benoit to the Android team, acting as lead android dev!</li>
 	<li>Finalising all new UX for configuring push notification permissions…</li>
 	<li>Final touches for Sticker viewing (including animated stickers!)</li>
 	<li>Fix embarrassing crash on iOS on certain shapes of Riot/Web URLs...</li>
 	<li>Supporting French Government Matrix activity</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="synapse">Synapse</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Operational firefighting continues: stopping malformed events from impacting federation; investigating thundering herds of presence EDUs; trying to keep Freenode joins from lagging;</li>
 	<li>Meanwhile, Erik has been working hard on the problem of Incremental State Resolution (the big algorithmic win which could massively improve HS performance, especially for Synapse); this is looking promising and has ended up taking the form of a formal mathematical proof that the proposed algorithm works: <a href="/_matrix/media/v1/download/jki.re/hSmkLkFGVUnrXjtYcjsCUsyS">https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/jki.re/hSmkLkFGVUnrXjtYcjsCUsyS</a> (aka <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3122">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3122</a>) is where that's happening! Warning: contains maths.</li>
 	<li>...and also wrote a Rust testjig for state resolution to help reason about it: <a href="https://github.com/erikjohnston/rust-matrix-state">https://github.com/erikjohnston/rust-matrix-state</a></li>
 	<li>Official Ansible playbook repository dev is progressing on the develop branch at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ansible">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ansible</a> thanks to massive work from Michael K. We'll blog properly about this when ready for use in earnest.</li>
 	<li>Dave has been doing an interesting experiment in syncing user profile data from HSes into ISes (useful for folks running a private federation with its own IS who want to use the IS as a global user directory); almost complete - we'll see how this goes.</li>
 	<li>GDPR work is in progress. We're seeing how far we can push the envelope on improving privacy, including a very interesting thought experiment on pseudonyimsing MXIDs to provide 'perfect' right-to-erasure. vdH is on the case. Warning: this may well require a major federation protocol bump if we go through with it.</li>
 	<li>More Python3 port PRs are landing from NotAFile - thanks! They're getting slightly lost behind everything above.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Still stuck behind Synapse work.</li>
 	<li>Barring disasters we have at least 2 new folks starting fulltime in the core team (both synapse & dendrite) to help backend progress at the end of May however!</li>
 	<li>Lots of PRs coming in from APWhitehat though - thanks!!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec">Spec</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>uhoreg has been looking at the .well-known URI proposal again</li>
 	<li>Spec work on the core team is currently stuck behind Riot/Web and Synapse work, sadly, on the basis that burning implementation problems are more visible and harming to the project than burning spec problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="matrix-in-the-news">Matrix in the News</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/france-alternative-whatsapp-telegram-spying-concerns,36898.html">Tom's Hardware</a> provided a great article on about Matrix in the French Government.</p>
