                <h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates!</h2>
<p>First of all: we've just released the first draft of the proposal for our next generation State Resolution algorithm as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">MSC1442</a> (State Resolution: Reloaded).  This is the result of a massive amount of work from Erik - if you are at all interested in the problems that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1953">state resets</a> have plagued us with, then you will want to <strong>read the proposal and please comment on it</strong>!</p>
<p>The next step on State Resolution: Reloaded (once approved) is to be able to actually roll it out - and to this end, richvdh has proposed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1425">MSC1425 (Room Versioning proposal)</a>. This was published at the beginning of the week but we haven't had any feedback yet - again, please read &amp; give feedback as the intention is to start working on this as soon as possible!  Matthew's also been updating the Lazy Loading proposal (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1227">MSC1227</a>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Matrix Spec is now awash with activity, lots of work from <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> and others to accelerate progress. Take a look at the <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">proposals list</a> to stay up to date, or straight to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc">matrix-doc</a> repo and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> room to get the raw activity.</p>
<p>Finally, discussions relating to the spec proposal process itself have attracted attention: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1426">MSC1426</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1421">MSC1421</a>, and we're already trialling the new process (using Github PRs rather than Google Docs) in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">MSC1442</a> (State Resolution: Reloaded) already.</p>
<h2 id="nheko-0-5-x">nheko 0.5.x</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> 0.5.1 is out, and it's great! Get a version for your platform from <a href="https://bintray.com/mujx/matrix/nheko/">bintray.com</a>. I've been using it for the last week or so (on macOS) and found it very stable and usable. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mujx:matrix.org">mujx</a> commented that &quot;highlights were encryption support &amp; desktop notifications on all platforms&quot;, but you can get much more thorough notes from the <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko/releases">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="plasma">Plasma</h2>
<p>It's been several weeks since we mentioned <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/">Plasma</a>, but work on the C2S parts of the spec implementation have been happening quietly behind the scenes. Project lead <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/">Nico</a> said recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've updated the CI test server with the latest snapshot version of plasma. <code>createRoom</code> and <code>invite</code> C2S endpoints are fully implemented and should work as expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find the full list of implemented endpoints <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/blob/master/README.md">in the readme</a>, and also read the <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/blob/master/docs/architecture.md">architecture overview</a>.</p>
<h2 id="kitsune-live-on-stage">kitsune, live on stage</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> presented an introduction to Matrix (for a technical audience) at the Tokyo Linux Users Group - you'll need to skip to 1h41m16s into the video.</p>

<h2 id="gtad-pulls-in-description-and-summary-fields-from-the-api">GTAD pulls in description and summary fields from the API</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> continues working on <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad">GTAD</a>, and this week has started automatically including docs in <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GTAD is now aware of description and summary fields in API descriptions so you can use them with Javadoc/Doxygen. As a result, libQMatrixClient master branch now enjoys doc-comments throughout its CS API layer - the rest of the library builds in envy.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="simplematrix">SimpleMatrix</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@MTRNord:matrix.ffslfl.net">MTRNord</a> introduced us to <a href="https://git.nordgedanken.de/Nordgedanken/SimpleMatrix">SimpleMatrix</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SimpleMatrix is my approach on making an Android App that is more easy to use than the official one in Terms of UX and UI. Planned is also a Android Wear App within this App for mostly Notifications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SimpleMatrix is planning to use <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/matrix-java-sdk">matrix-java-sdk</a>, but for now is a visual mockup, it doesn't currently connect to Matrix.</p>

<h2 id="tales-of-half-shot-and-his-many-bridges">Tales of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> and his many Bridges</h2>
<h3 id="arrival-of-the-discord-dms">Arrival of the Discord DMs</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>After lots of begging, frustration and eventually an offer of a free lunch (thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">Anoa</a>): I give you Discord DMs.<br />This first cut bridges over existing regular and group DMs to Matrix. In the future we will also allow you to create DMs from Matrix so that you can contact users without even logging into Discord. With thanks to the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discord:half-shot.uk">#discord:half-shot.uk</a> community for helping shape this feature!</p>
<p>Currently this is in PR form but is very likely to make it into the 0.3 release of <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="half-shot-fixes-the-foonetic-irc-bridge">Half-Shot fixes the Foonetic IRC bridge</h3>
<p>For those who (want to) use Foonetic IRC channels, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> is here for you! Previously this bridge had been down due to invalid certificates, but this is now resolved.</p>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Synapse 0.33 landed on Thursday, boasting 2x speed-ups for /sync and (briefly) meaning that the matrix.org homeserver felt impressively snappy and fast!  Ironically traffic levels promptly grew again such that the synapse master process is now the bottleneck once more, but between incremental state res, python 3 and upcoming room-sharding work we should see the performance fixes continuing to come!  Meanwhile, lots of PRs in the queue for Synapse 0.34 - including Lazy Loading support as per (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1227">MSC1227</a>), and a whole new set of stats functionality for tracking per-room and per-user stats.</p>
<h2 id="riot">Riot</h2>
<p>Lots of activity in the build up to Riot/Web 0.16 - merging the new Slate rich text editor to /develop (try it now!), upgrading Jitsi and turning it on by default (at last!! - again, try it on /develop, although you'll have to enable it in Labs).  We'd be particularly interested in how Jitsi is behaving, as so far for us it's been unrecognisably improved over the previous deployment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, lots of work on Lazy Loading members on Riot/Web and Riot/iOS, and lots of stability perf work in general across mobile.</p>
<h2 id="state-resolution-special-matrix-live">State Resolution Special... Matrix Live!</h2>
<p>And finally, all you could ever want to hear about the new State Resolution algorithm on a special edition of Matrix Live, starring Erik &amp; Matthew!</p>

                <p>Welcome to TWIM for Friday the 13th! Nothing too scary, but lots of client updates and news.</p>
<h2 id="quaternion">Quaternion</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> has gained a new <code>/html</code> command that allows one to send raw HTML. Note that an actually displayed HTML subset entirely depends on the receiving client; no HTML validation or sanitation is done; a plaintext version is automatically created by stripping all the HTML tags.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:lain.haus">f0x</a> is working on <a href="https://github.com/f0x52/neo">Neo</a> again:</p>

<h2 id="matrix-logger">matrix-logger</h2>
<p>A useful tool from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@CromFr:matrix.org">CromFr</a> for anyone who wants to archive logs of rooms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a small matrix &quot;client&quot; for logging messages in joined rooms, and store them in a format very similar to Weechat logs.
<a href="https://gitlab.com/CromFr/matrix-logger/tree/master">Source code (Rust)</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/CromFr/matrix-logger/tags">Binary release (x86_64 windows &amp; linux)</a>
Please open issues if encounter any bug or need specific features.\nAlso I'm new to rust, so any review / advices would be appreciated :)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="matrique-client-progress">Matrique client progress</h2>
<p><a href="http://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> has been working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/matrique-go">Matrique</a>, and it's looking really good! Screenshot below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrique now has support for sending/receiving messages (plaintext, markdown, HTML, rainbow), emotes and notices. It also supports receiving images, videos, files and states. I am still working on file receiving functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/matrique-client.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3397" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/matrique-client.png" alt="" width="960" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>I love that all clients include rainbow messages.</p>
<h2 id="fluffychat-for-ubuntu-touch">fluffychat for Ubuntu Touch</h2>
<p>New to me, <a href="https://github.com/ChristianPauly/fluffychat">fluffychat</a> is a &quot;Simple Matrix Messenger for <a href="https://ubports.com">Ubuntu Touch</a>&quot;. The design philosophy for this app is focused on simplicity, and the hope is for it to complement <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a>, another Ubuntu Touch client.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are you not just contributing to uMatriks?
uMatriks is great and it's superb, that someone has created a Matrix Client for Ubuntu Touch. But sometimes you have a so detailed vision of a user interface, which you want to implement, that you can not just contribute to an existing project. However, I would like to work with the uMatriks developers together. We could use the same push gateway for example.</p>

<p>So now the K8s stuff has configuration examples for Synapse + Riot + mxisd + coturn, all runnable on your very own Kubernetes cluster - though with some manual tinkering required at the moment.<br />I've updated the Kubernetes configuration examples to include everything you need for a full Matrix stack; Synapse + Riot + mxisd - using the built-in K8s ingress<br />And + coturn of course, not to forget</p>

<p>The second evaluation for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a> is nearly here, so we have some updates from the student participants:</p>
<h2 id="apwhitehat-is-working-on-dendrite"><a href="https://matrix.turbo.fish/blog/2018/07/05/this-week-in-matrix-2018-07-05/@apwhitehat:matrix.org">apwhitehat</a> is working on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite updates for TWIM (before GSoC 2nd eval):
This month we've got most of the federation APIs working on Dendrite. These are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>State APIs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/486">#486</a></li>
 	<li>Get missing events API <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/516">#516</a></li>
 	<li>Query user devices <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/498">#498</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We still need to figure out pagination for backfill API.</p>
<p>On applications services, we've got a lot of APIs working, thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>. Authentication now acknowledges App services, though lot of other stuff is under review. I am eagerly waiting for it to land.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the same topic, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've had a PR from fadeAce/dirichlet_zby for the server-side implementation of end-to-end encryption support in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>. Will be looking forward to seeing that land as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an explanation of the endpoints required for this <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.3.0.html#end-to-end-encryption">in the CS API docs</a>.</p>

<p>Sounds like <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Zil0:matrix.org">Zil0</a> has been going great guns on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Encryption in matrix-python-sdk should now work fairly well.<br />The biggest parts to write were device tracking and key persistence. All the PRs are now opened, and the code is fully tested and documented.<br />It is possible to try out the implementation before it lands by referring to instructions written here.<br />Also a special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/poljar">poljar</a> for some great work on new Olm bindings, which allowed the project not to get stuck with packaging issues.<br />Further work include encrypted attachments, device verification and key sharing.</p>

<h2 id="koma-kotlin-client">koma, kotlin client</h2>
<p>Last week I mistakenly referred to <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">Koma</a> as being written in Rust, then Java. This was all incorrect, though being written in Kotlin, Koma does run on the JVM and use JavaFx.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sideboat:matrix.org">sideboat</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">koma</a>, we are improving the room info window used for viewing and editing the name, icon, and aliases of a room.

<p>Neil says:</p>

<p>We've just cut the next release candidate for Synapse: 0.32.0rc1.<br />The upcoming release focuses almost entirely on security; fixing federation bugs and adding new features for countering abuse.</p>

<h2 id="riot">Riot</h2>
<p>This week we welcome Bruno to the Riot team, he's off and away working on getting integration tests set up.</p>
<p>Otherwise:</p>

<p>Welcome to This Week in Matrix, let's see what updates the community has to offer this week!</p>
<h2 id="koma">koma</h2>
<p>Announcing his update nearly a week ago, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@radicus:matrix.org">radicus</a> released <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/releases/tag/0.7.3">v0.7.3</a> of <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">koma</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There have been quite some changes since updates of the project were last posted, but the major ones are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Upgrade to JavaFx 9</li>
 	<li>Experimental support for infinite scroll on message list</li>
 	<li>Rewrite ListView to improve performance and reduce jar file size</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="dialogflow-connector">dialogflow connector</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@vurpo:vurpo.fi">vurpo</a> has released <a href="https://gitlab.com/vurpo/matrix-dialogflow">matrix-dialogflow</a>, which allow the use of DialogFlow agents as chatbots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've written a little bot for connecting a DialogFlow agent to Matrix as a chatbot. I did this for my own personal purposes but I know someone else might find this handy as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</h2>
<p><a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New stuff in mautrix-telegram:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>A basic telematrix database import script</li>
 	<li>Improved config for relaybot message formatting, including the option to use Matrix displaynames (instead of just mxid localparts)
I've also been planning an improved Matrix-&gt;Telegram formatting converter and a provisioning API for integration managers like Dimension.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="jmsdk">jmsdk</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> has been working on a matrix client this week. To that end, he has implemented <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk">jmsdk</a>, a &quot;very early version of the matrix sdk and common classes (client, bot, …)&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently implemented the matrix client on the java with full support of the C2S API. It still under development and contains bugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has also been working on a &quot;bot sdk with core classes to write custom bots and appservices.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="matrix-appservice-voip"><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/matrix-appservice-voip">matrix-appservice-voip</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> has been working on VoIP bridging between Matrix and regular phones using Freeswitch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have successful VoIP bridging between Matrix and regular phones using Freeswitch, for 1:1, both directions! a v0.1 is scheduled in a few days once configuration is possible and a getting started doc is written.</p>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>more voice backends (think Jitsi, etc.)</li>
 	<li>SMS support with Twilio and/or OVH initially</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd">mxisd</a> integration to automatically invite bridge users if needed and suggest bridge users</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxgwd</a> integration to auto-join HS regular users if a VoIP bridge user invites them, so &gt; calls are directly seen</li>
 	<li>And much more in later releases</li>

<h2 id="transform">transform</h2>
<p>A wild <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bettiah:matrix.org">bettiah</a> appeared, announced a completely new homeserver implementation in TypeScript:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been working on a homeserver implementation over at <a href="https://github.com/bettiah/transform">https://github.com/bettiah/transform</a> . It is fairly basic at the moment, but the development experience is straight-forward and even fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm interested to see a TypeScript backend running, and of course it's great to have more homeserver implementations! Some highlights from the <a href="https://github.com/bettiah/transform">readme</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Transform is a matrix homeserver built using Typescript and Redis. It is not fully functional yet.
<strong>Status:</strong> Register, Login, CreateRoom, Invite &amp; Join seem to be functional with riot web client. But quite a lot of functionality is missing and the software is definitely not ready for deployment in a public facing role.
<strong>Design:</strong> A lot of the code is auto-generated from the excellent swagger specs for the client-server api.
<strong>Contributing</strong>: It is early days yet. However, Typescript has enabled safe &amp; rapid progress. Redis streams too seem to have a very well thought out api and the whole thing has been a fun experience so far. Contributions are very welcome.</p>

<p>kitsune writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> 0.3.0.2 has been released - no new features, just small fixes including one for an unlucky typo preventing 0.3.0.1 from generating .cpp files with GTAD.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> 0.0.9.2 is out, another step towards 0.1. Aside from bugfixes and using the latest libQMatrixClient, it features an entirely new timeline layout similar to that of Riot (the old one is still around too). Also, you can now change some settings through the menu rather than by editing a configuration file or registry - including switching timeline layouts on the fly!</p>

<p>Decided to actually start pushing code I've been slowly prodding at for the last while, ever since starting the Ruby Matrix SDK in fact. Working on a Sibbell like system that tracks new releases on GitHub projects, posting them into a specified Matrix room.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I reorganized my projects and extracted the sdk from the api. So, today I have one project for the api (<a class="linkified" href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon</a>), another for the sdk (<a class="linkified" href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk</a>) but last is very early and non-usable.<br />Also I covered the code with the swagger-annotation and now I can generate the swagger schema from the code. There is an example: <a class="linkified" href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon/blob/master/client-api/generated/swagger-ui/swagger.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon/blob/master/client-api/generated/swagger-ui/swagger.json</a><br />And there is an example of the spec was generated from swagger: <a class="linkified" href="https://ma1uta.github.io/matrix-api.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ma1uta.github.io/matrix-api.html</a> (plain and without sorting or grouping, I'll maybe fix it).<br />Everyone can ask me in the <a class="" title="#jeon:matrix.org" href="https://riot.im/develop/#/room/#jeon:matrix.org" data-reactroot="">#jeon:matrix.org</a> (matrix api) or <a class="" title="#mxtoot:matrix.org" href="https://riot.im/develop/#/room/#mxtoot:matrix.org" data-reactroot="">#mxtoot:matrix.org</a> (matrix-mastodon bridge).<br />Then I want to cover the remaining api (appservice, push, identity but not federation because it isn't completed yet), write sdk (client, bot).

<p>Nico gives updates on <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/">Plasma</a>, the new Scala/Akka homeserver:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've setup <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/pipelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CI/CD</a> for plasma HS. Now every time a push occur on the repo, the pipeline builds and deploys a plasma HS instance on a test server.<br />This test instance is reachable at <a class="linkified" href="http://matrix.beerfactory.org:9000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://matrix.beerfactory.org:9000</a>. For now it is very modest and can only reply to a few C2S endpoints like <a href="http://matrix.beerfactory.org:9000/_matrix/client/versions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>GET /_matrix/client/versions</code></a>. <code>POST /_matrix/client/r0/login</code> and <code>POST /_matrix/client/r0/register</code> are also available for testing registration and login flow. <code>POST /_matrix/client/r0/createRoom</code> is also available with the <code>TEST_TOKEN</code> auth token value, but it's only a mock.<br />I'm now working on implementing the concept of room servers: each room will be managed by a dedicated room server (an <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/actors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actor</a>), so they get fault tolerance and scalability by default (through <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/common/cluster.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">akka clustering</a>).<br />There's also a dedicated room for this project : <a class="" title="#plasma:beerfactory.org" href="https://riot.im/develop/#/room/#plasma:beerfactory.org" data-reactroot="">#plasma:beerfactory.org</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am currently writing a high-level API on top of gomatrix. As gomatrix is suitable for bots but not for clients, I decided to write a layer above it.
(The motivation is to provide a backend for Matrique)
It will have similar API as libqmatrixclient, but in Golang.
It is currently under heavy development, and API breaking changes are frequent.
Sources are available in Gitlab: <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/gomatrixclient">https://gitlab.com/b0/gomatrixclient</a>P.s. It is a library for writing clients in Golang. But it also provides useful APIs for basic functions, e.g. getting avatars.</p>

<p>TravisR writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a Terraform provider for matrix. It is still a work in progress, however I plan to have the basics completed in the coming days. The provider gives you the opportunity to create users, rooms, and other objects on your homeserver, making your homeserver part of your infrastructure. This could be useful for people who want to set up a monitoring room, or for setting up default rooms on a homeserver instance. In particular, this provider will be used by the monitor bot (see last week's post) to set up the test homeservers for seeing how the bot scales with increased server counts.

<blockquote>
<p>ma1uta says:</p>
<p>I've fixed a few bugs and added some new commands (show status by id and show n-last statuses), and now
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/mxtoot">mxtoot 0.4.3</a> (Matrix-Mastodon bridge) can send public, private, unlisted and direct messages.
There are 4 features left to go:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>show, add and remove follows;</li>
 	<li>show threads;</li>
 	<li>show notification, public and federated lines (and optionally merge them with the home timeline);</li>
 	<li>show account info by id.</li>
</ul>
Also I think to implement a bridge Matrix-ActivityPub as S2S. For example, a room - is a ActivityPub's actor. Room participants is a bot corresponds to actors you follow to. Room timeline is a Inbox+Outbox. Reactions is a likes/favorites. Pinning message is a boost. Replies will be very useful.

<h3 id="and-finally">And finally...</h3>
<p>On the core team it's been an irregular week; as mentioned in last TWIM we spent most of it in workshops working through spec issues as part of the mission to finally get to an 'r0' stable release of the spec across all APIs - not just the Client/Server API.  The majority of this was spent making up for lost time on the S2S API, analysing its various holes and designing solutions to them.  Things are looking promising - we're keeping the work under wraps though given the potential for abuse, although we should see more gaps being fixed in the coming days.  Meanwhile we're aiming to get the r0 stable release out by the end of August.  We also unblocked a few longstanding MSCs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/433">.well-known</a> URIs and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1232">media limits</a>), although in the end the S2S stuff took priority.  On the client side we did a lot of design sessions on Riot/Mobile (working out how the new app design should work on Mobile - watch this space for details!) and also how to speed up app launch (the concept of Hybrid Sync; somewhere between an initial sync and an incremental sync - basically an initial sync which can be interrupted in order to let the user use the app whilst the initial sync is still ongoing) - we'll write up the notes and publish these asap.</p>
<p>We also announced the <a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">Open Governance</a> work which we've been doing in order to extend control of the Matrix spec to properly include the wider Matrix community - the plan is to get the Matrix.org Foundation legal entity set up roughly around the same time as the r0 release of the spec in August, and formally decouple control of the Matrix spec from New Vector (the company we set up last year to hire the core team).</p>
<p>We'd also like to welcome mujx (developer of nheko) and kitsune (developer of Quaternion and libQMatrixClient) to the new core team as we start trialling the new governance structure (which mainly amounts at this point to getting review approvals on spec proposals and changes from the relevant domain experts on the new team).  This brings us to a full complement for the team: Erik (servers), richvdh (servers, crypto &amp; clients), Dave (clients &amp; push/identity) and uhoreg (crypto, general) from the current core team; and Anoa (servers, AS API), TravisR (integrations, AS API; acting with Dimension hat on), mujx &amp; kitsune from the community.</p>
<p>Otherwise, spec work has taken priority over writing software, with the exception of: APwhitehat doing as much federation work in Dendrite as part of GSoC as the current unstable state of the API allows; Michael (t3chguy) has been blitzing through P1 Riot/Web issues.  Next week should be back on the normal (if not better!) trajectory however.  No Matrix Live this week however, as we're all exhausted.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>we made a transactions cache/table for idempotency. So now dendrite will not reprocess events as far as client-server api is concerned.</li>
 	<li>added request authentication function which recognises an application service user (partially landed.)</li>
 	<li>username auto generation, which let's you register without username (will be used for guest access later.)</li>
 	<li>We also added a tokens library based on macaroons, however we might not be using it anytime soon. Since it's been known to be very problematic (on synapse).</li>
 	<li>Other small bug fixes not big enough to mention.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has announced <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad">GTAD</a> v0.6 and <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> v0.3. We've covered <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad">GTAD</a> before, but I think it's worth including this note from the readme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GTAD (Generate Things from an API Description) is a generator of code from a Swagger/OpenAPI specification. Initially made to generate marshalling/unmarshalling C++ code for Matrix CS API, it can be extended to support other API descriptions and other programming languages with static type checking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> regarding the GTAD 0.6 release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version of API code generator, GTAD, 0.6, has been released today, adding support of variant types, proper dealing with definitions referencing other files ($ref) and more options to override schema names - even defined inline. Most importantly, GTAD has got extensive README.md that describes (most of) the things needed to start writing your own templates! As usual, kitsune will be happy to help those who would like to try it (both with C/C++ projects and other languages).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>libQMatrixClient has been benefiting from GTAD over the last 4 months or so - but this is the first release where GTAD is stable and feature-complete enough to be shared with other projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://matrix.to/#/#gtad:matrix.org">#gtad:matrix.org</a> is the new room for GTAD chat and support.</p>
<p>and <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> 0.3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version of libQMatrixClient, 0.3, comes out this weekend. This is the first libQMatrixClient release to include (almost) all CS API requests and supplementary (non-event) definitions, thanks to GTAD 0.6. Notably, it now includes jobs to register users, manage devices and keys on the server (no local key management yet - E2E work has just begun). This version also gains centralised request error handling so that clients could deal with problems in a unified way, and support &quot;Consent not given&quot; errors of GDPR fame, so that client authors could automatically open consent pages. You can also trigger logging out of all devices through libQMatrixClient thanks to a very recent addition to CS API spec from <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>.</p>

<p>We've got a shiny new application service component which runs as a separate process (if you're doing multiprocess dendrite) that handles all outbound communication to application services. Last week I got event sending working. This week I'm hooking up an internal API for other components (roomserver, c-s api) to talk to the app service component, as we occasionally need to ping AS's to ask about existence of rooms or users. Getting those two endpoints covered is the goal of this week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to create a full spec's implementation on java (all 5 specification). After that I want try to write a homeserver (2 variants: distributed on java+kafka and simple which can run on a light vps). But it's a long-term goal.</p>

<p>So far work has begun on an implementation of the Matrix API in Java:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon</a> - another java implementation of the matrix api (client-server, server-server, application server, push server, identity server) using jax-ws. It corresponds the specification on <a href="/docs/spec">https://matrix.org/docs/spec</a>. On the next step I want dive deep into synapse to parse it's api and fill the gaps of the spec with sending pull request. May be I will write something like a TCK (test compatibility kit).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And an SDK for which there is a sample bot for mastodon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also this project has a very early sdk (client, bot). I will fix it after finishing works with the spec.
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/mxtoot">https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/mxtoot</a> - matrix-mastodon bridge.
With this bridge you can invite a bot and read your home mastodon's timeline, post messages, reply and boost messages.</p>

<p>And here it is. As you may have noticed, I'm leaning much more toward quoting wherever possible, rather than trying to paraphrase. The aim is to keep the content authentic and community-driven, rather than a narrative from one fairly naive observer. The risk is it makes the post awkward to read as it switches voice too frequently. Come to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> and let me know if you have opinions on this.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">@slavi:devture.com</a> sent great news: <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> can now set up your homeserver using the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/matrixdotorg/synapse/">Matrix Synapse Docker</a> image. In his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using this Ansible playbook is probably the easiest way to set up a fully-functioning Matrix homeserver on your own machine. The setup includes Matrix Synapse and some related services required to actually make it useful (automatically-managed HTTPS; STUN/TURN server for audio/video calls; Postgres database for Synapse; optionally riot-web; optionally Amazon S3 storage support)</p>

<p>Helpfully named <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@zeratax:dmnd.sh">Zeratax?utf8=✓</a> has released <a href="https://github.com/ZerataX/matrix-registration">matrix-registration</a>, an application which allows you to &quot;easily create tokens to invite users on your homeserver without the need to open up public registration&quot;. There is a public demo here: <a href="https://zeratax.github.io/matrix-registration/demo.html">https://zeratax.github.io/matrix-registration/demo.html</a></p>
<p>Says <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@zeratax:dmnd.sh">Zeratax</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>my personal problem was:
i didn't want to open up registration for everyone
i didn't want to register every account manually and have to worry about seeing passwords etc
now i can just share a link, e.g:
https://zeratax.github.io/matrix-registration/demo.html?token=JargonGingerYankee</p>

<p>Last week dendrite was filtering events from user's into separate queues for each application service to eventually be given. Sending these events requires batching them up into transactions and then sending them to an HTTP endpoint on the application service. I'm happy to report that from today, that functionality is now implemented, along with graceful handling of both server and application service downtime.</p>

<p><a href="http://riot.im/">Riot</a> is undergoing a visual redesign, thanks to <a href="http://helminen.co/">Jouni Helminen</a>. Take a look at <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/a-sneak-peek-at-a-whole-new-riot-im-1114df653782">the redesign work on the Riot blog</a>. The changes are not radical, but will help standardise and modernise the Riot interface. Early feedback I've seen has been mostly positive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The user can now change the following settings: Avatar, display name, add and remove email addresses and phone numbers. Also, they can see the homeserver and their own MXID.<br />We will probably make some more small changes on the way to make the UX as good as we possibly can.</p>

</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Folks are already accepting the new policies - thanks.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">We're going to start requiring acceptance to access the matrix.org server on Tuesday (May 29th).

</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Erasure and Right-to-be-forgotten work (Phase 2) is next up so we can action the requests in a timely manner.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like we will go ahead on removing MXIDs on events as a Phase 3 (although for now we do warn people that this is effectively a technical limitation of Matrix, albeit one that we're working on).

<p>As part of my master's thesis, I wrote the DSN Traveller bot, which is crawling the matrix federation to measure the shape and size of the matrix network, and how distributed it currently is. The bot is already in a smaller number of rooms for testing, and will join the remaining rooms over the next days.

<p><a href="https://brendan.abolivier.bzh/">Brendan</a> produced a <a href="https://brendan.abolivier.bzh/enter-the-matrix/">really, really informative article introducing Matrix</a>. As someone who is still very new to the project I found this writng to be very clear and informative, so thank you! The article made it to the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17063761">top of Hacker News</a>, where you can find a discussion of both the article and Matrix itself.</p>
<h3 id="presentation-about-matrix">Presentation about Matrix</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/martinkrafft">martinkrafft</a> presented about Matrix at <a href="https://wossat.nz/">wossat</a> a New Zealand Open Source show and tell meetup. His talk <a href="https://twitter.com/wossat/status/997230578385612801">can be seen here</a>, and focuses on the benefits of Matrix for users.</p>
<h2 id="spec-proposals">Spec Proposals</h2>
<p>As you may have seen from the <a href="/blog/2018/05/17/introducing-matrix-specification-changes/">previous blog post</a>, we have a new drive to advance the Matrix Specification itself. Part of this is <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a>, which lists all the spec change proposals we've accumulated so far, and describes the flow for getting new proposals merged. There is a new room, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> for discussion, please join if you want to get involved in this process. Check out the page and the blog post for more detail.</p>
<p>Next up: try to turn some of the many WIP proposals into Spec PRs...</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Fractal2018">Fractal Hackfest 2018</a>: was super successful and productive by all accounts, and there were many!

<p>A major topic at the Hackfest was a discussion of splitting the Fractal client into two UIs for the different behaviours of messaging apps. For anyone interested in product design thinking this is a genuinely fascinating topic. I encourage you to read <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2018/05/16/banquets-and-barbecues/">&quot;Banquets and Barbecues&quot;, Tobias' excellent coverage</a> of the latest thinking.

Lots of excitement at the variety of independent clients and servers able to interact over the matrix protocol. The images above show <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">The Construct</a> (server) and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a> (client), and then <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a> and <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a>. A fundamental part of matrix is to be an open protocol, so it's great to see entirely independent implementations liaising together! While implementing <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> has been documenting spec omissions <a href="https://kamax.io/matrix/api/client_server/unstable.html">in a branch of the spec</a> - we're hoping he will contribute these back!</p>
<p>Honourable mention for <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mujx:matrix.org">mujx</a>, who was sending messages with <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">Ruma</a> a year ago!</p>
<h2 id="matrix-core-team-expansion">Matrix Core team expansion</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Stève - 17th May (yesterday)</li>
 	<li>Amber - 21st (Monday)</li>
 	<li>Anoa - 21st (Monday)</li>
 	<li>Hubert - 28th May</li>
 	<li>Half-Shot - 4th June
...and one more community member, hopefully (just sorting paperwork currently!)</li>
</ul>
Heads up that we're consciously trying to hire a mix of folks from the Matrix community as well as those outside it - and avoid hiring the whole community, both to ensure diversity of viewpoint & experience in the core team, and also to avoid cannibalising folks who working on their own commercial projects on top of Matrix. We'd prefer Matrix to be as decentralised and heterogenous as possible, needless to say - and instead try to support folks in building on Matrix without hiring them into the core team (where we'd expect them to focus on the core project for everyone's benefit). This may change once we have Matrix set up as a separate foundation, once we've got out of beta, of course.

<p>The talk of the town in Strasbourg this week was the arrival of Fractal Hackfest 2018! Event is still ongoing, and I'm sure they will provide a report of the progress on <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Fractal2018">https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Fractal2018</a>, though <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre</a> kindly sent us a photo of the group in action</p>

<h2 id="home-assistants">Home Assistants</h2>
<p>Wonderful things are happening and being discovered regarding IoT and Home Automation. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg:matrix.org">uhoreg</a> was the first to point us to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tinloaf:matrix.org">tinloaf's</a> project to build a Matrix Chatbot component for <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This component allows you to send messages to matrix rooms, as well as to react to messages in matrix rooms. Reacting to commands is accomplished by firing an event when one of the configured commands is triggered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(this is not the same as notify.matrix <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/notify.matrix/">https://www.home-assistant.io/components/notify.matrix/</a>, which is used to deliver messages from Home Assistant to a room.)</p>
<p>Enthusiasm for this work led to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jon:terracrypt.net">jfred</a> discussing his past adventures in Matrix, including a component for <a href="https://github.com/theschwa/sibyl">sibyl</a>, 'a python chatbot with a focus on XBMC' allowing Matrix communication.</p>
<p>All this excitement led to Cadair creating <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#homeautomation:cadair.com">#homeautomation:cadair.com</a>, which has started a more thorough discussion. I'm eager to see more non-chat applications of Matrix, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> came up with others with projects in progress.</p>
<h2 id="on-gdpr">On GDPR</h2>
<p>GDPR has been a <del>favourite</del> topic for a while now. If you didn't already, take a look at the latest thinking from the Matrix Core team here: <a href="/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/">https://matrix.org/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/</a></p>

<p>It's worth noting that we feel that GDPR is an excellent piece of legislation from the perspective of forcing us to think more seriously about our privacy – it has forced us to re-prioritise all sorts of long-term deficiencies in Matrix (e.g. dependence on DNS; improving User Interactive authentication; improving logout semantics etc).  There's obviously a lot of work to be done here, but hopefully it should all be worth it!</p>

<h2 id="travisr-on-gdpr">TravisR on GDPR</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/">TravisR</a> has also been thinking about GDPR, and how it relates to his <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-voyager-bot">Voyager bot</a>. In his words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TWIM: I've mostly been working on figuring out how GDPR affects t2bot.io for the last couple weeks. One of the things running on t2bot.io is Voyager - a bot that tries to join rooms it sees mentioned in people's messages, graphing them on <a href="https://voyager.t2bot.io">https://voyager.t2bot.io</a>. With the increase in talk about GDPR and more bots starting to wander the federation, the recurring topic of whether Voyager should change its approach to finding and listing rooms.</p>
<p>With the current approach, Voyager reads messages and tries to find room aliases to try and join. Individual people can opt-out of this tracking to stop Voyager from reading/parsing their messages (opting back in at a later time, if desired). The room moderators can kick or ban the bot to completely remove their room from the graph, and can invoke a 'soft kick' if they'd like to have their room remain listed, but don't want the bot in the room. Voyager will make sure to only show information for public rooms and will update the graph if the room flips between public and private.</p>
<p>If anyone has feedback on how this approach could be improved (or if it should be left as-is), please come by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#voyager:t2bot.io">#voyager:t2bot.io</a> on matrix to start the conversation.</p>

<h2 id="translations">Translations</h2>
<p>I was surprised and excited to learn that a Russian translation of the Matrix FAQ has been produced by a group of Russian-language users. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a several Russian-speaking users spontaneously decided to unite and help Matrix. We created a room where translated FAQ using the embedded etherpad widget. Some of us are here: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@commagray:matrix.org">Magnolia</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@commagray:matrix.org">Fenneko is a Good Girl</a> for example. Anybody can join to us <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#perevodators:matrix.org">#perevodators:matrix.org</a> and helps. We accept any help.<br />  Preview: <a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/index.html">https://ma1uta.github.io/index.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've provided a PR which I will presently merge (though of course, as I don't speak Russian I will need to trust that it's really a translation of the FAQ!)</p>

<h3 id="matrixstats-org">matrixstats.org</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@a13xmt">a13xmt</a> came to use with <a href="https://matrixstats.org">https://matrixstats.org</a>, a bot-powered room directory</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Public catalog for matrix rooms announced: matrixstats.org. The place where you can find a lot of rooms and sort them by ratings or categories. Presented rooms are collected from different homeservers; some of rooms have detailed statistics. The homeservers itself can be explored without the registration. The project is currently in beta stage, so some features may be missing. We would be glad to receive any feedback and ideas for further improvement.

<ul>
<li>New release due monday - whether it's 0.14.3 or 0.15 depends on whether we can make the sticker picker fast enough to launch!</li>
<li>Lots of other polish; E2E is now as fast on Firefox as it is on Chrome!</li>

<h3 id="spec-proposals">Spec Proposals</h3>
<p>Much-needed work has begun to classify and present the spec proposals for the Matrix specification. We've tagged up the all the issues in GitHub, new page will appear on matrix.org at the start of next week if I can just stop preening the generator.</p>

<p><a href="https://itscode.red/posts/1-year-using-matrix/">Another week, another article</a> on the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17031306">Hacker News</a>. The author is focused more on Riot than Matrix, still it's great knowing how much interest there is in the wild.</p>
<p>Happily, I was at an unrelated event in London earlier in the week, and had my first IRL experience meeting someone who already knew (and then enthused) about the project. Feels good.</p>

<p>Do you have a suggestion for this series? What could we be doing more of? I have a nascent plan to do 'deeper' conversations with people or projects that aren't necessarily in the normal run of things, but are interesting uses of Matrix. Does this sound like something you'd want to read on a Friday afternoon?
