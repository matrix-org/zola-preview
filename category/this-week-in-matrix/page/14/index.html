<li><strong>Muhammad Radwan</strong>, on behalf of <strong>Tactical Tech</strong>, will present their work on <strong><a href="https://theglassroom.org/misinformation/">The Glass Room Misinformation Edition</a></strong>.
<em>What happens when we increasingly rely on social media and the web for nearly all our information? What information do we see, and what do we miss? How do we know if a picture or a tweet is genuine or truthful? And what can we do if we can‚Äôt be sure?</em></li>
<li><strong>Popi</strong> from <strong>CHATONS</strong> will present the work done by CHATONS (&quot;Collective of Alternative, Transparent, Open, Neutral and United Hosters&quot;)

<li><strong>Hubert|Uhoreg Chathi</strong> will present on the state of encryption in Matrix, and more broadly
<em>Why the PGP model is insufficient, what properties we want from encryption (e.g. why we want perfect forward secrecy), how the newer protocols (OTR, double-ratchet, megolm) give us some of the properties we want, and then what's coming in the future (MLS, and what that gives us)</em></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy November from the Synapse team! As mentioned last week, we pushed a small <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.1">v1.22.1 release</a> last Friday which fixed two regressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug where an appservice may not be forwarded events for a room it was recently invited to. Broke in v1.22.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8676">#8676</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <code>Object of type frozendict is not JSON serializable</code> exceptions when using third-party event rules. Broke in v1.22.0. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8678">#8678</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't upgraded your Synapse in a while, <em>please do.</em></p>
<p>A major focus of Synapse is being able to meet the performance and reliability needs of massive homeservers like <code>matrix.org</code>. If you're curious about how Synapse's architecture has evolved over the years to meet these scaling challenges, check our our blog post from Tuesday: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/03/how-we-fixed-synapses-scalability">How we fixed Synapse's scalability!</a></p>
<p>Lastly, we anticipate releasing 1.23.0 in the next fortnight; keep your eyes peeled for release candidates and let us know if you have any feedback. For a preview of what's coming, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/compare/v1.22.1...develop">check out GitHub</a> for the new commits that have landed on the <code>develop</code> branch since our last release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PLUS <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synapse now horizontally scales across multiple python processes, as of 1.22: you can configure it so that events are no longer sent through the main proc, eliminating the single biggest bottleneck for large scale Synapse deployments.

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things have been quiet for Dendrite over the last week as I have been working on Pinecone/P2P and Kegan has been working on threading.</p>
<p>That said, a couple of minor changes have been merged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Forgetting rooms is now supported (thanks <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gjson dependency has been updated for correct integer safe ranges</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is the same as last week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 57%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 81%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for general Dendrite chat or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite-dev:matrix.org">#dendrite-dev:matrix.org</a> for development discussion.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the sync on Monday, I was mostly distracted from Hydrogen this week. (<em>sorry Bruno -BP</em>) I did release the picture lightbox on Monday, and yesterday managed to close 4 bugs. There's also a community PR for better usability and accessibility in the login screen (keep those coming!) and after some work to make encryption more robust, I hope to do a release with all those goodies tonight.</p>

<p>Since <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/23/this-week-in-matrix-2020-10-23#fractal">a couple of weeks ago</a>, we have merged a couple of branches that do a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clean up use of deprecated gtk-rs API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimize use of child properties, which are gone in GTK4</p>

<p>We are working through some low hanging fruit around post registration, blank screen interaction prompts and toast tweaks. We are also  experimenting with SSO for matrix.org. Meaning that Element will give the user the option of either username/password or SSO. Finally, we are continuing our VoIP efforts and nailing down the designs, checkout Matrix Live for all the details. Next week we'll carry on with post registration UX, VoIP improvements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi all! I <em>think</em> this is the right place to share this ü§û. I've been working on a Matrix SDK for Elixir over the last few months as a side project, it's very early days and it's currently just a bare-bones wrapper for the Client-Server API. I've also written the Elixir/Erlang bindings for Olm (currently missing group sessions) which should be added to the SDK soon. The repo can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/niklaslong/matrix-elixir-sdk">https://github.com/niklaslong/matrix-elixir-sdk</a> and the Elixir bindings for Olm are linked in the readme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the right place! Thanks cognitive_tea :D</p>
<p>Asked if there were big plans for use of the project</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not as yet, though a few people have reached out to me already and are building on top of it. I started it as a way to get going with Matrix dev and as a fun side project. That being said, I think providing the tools to Matrix-enable Elixir apps might lead to some interesting things.
If anyone has any precise ideas on how they would want to integrate their Elixir apps with Matrix, I'd be super happy to have a chat üëçÔ∏è
Less precise ideas are also welcome, of course üôÇ</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.0">Synapse 1.22.0</a> is out! We announced its first release candidate <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/23/this-week-in-matrix-2020-10-23#synapse">last week</a>, and after a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.0rc2">small rc2</a> the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.22.0">final release</a> was published last Tuesday. We anticipate a small 1.22.1 release later today with fixes for messages not always being sent to app services (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8673">#8673</a>) and serialization errors with third-party event rules (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8678">#8678</a>).</p>
<p>We continue to see improved client join <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">Apdex</a> scores for matrix.org, indicating that our work in 1.22.0 to split background tasks into separate workers and allow for sharded event persisters successfully improved the user-visible performance of large homeservers.</p>
<p>In other news, we pushed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8675">a temporary hotfix</a> to the matrix.org homeserver earlier this week, instructing it to drop all cross-user <code>m.key_share_request</code> messages. This was necessary to mitigate <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/famedlysdk/-/issues/126">a bug</a> in a third-party library which caused some clients to flood the server with requests. We'll re-enable these messages once we resolve <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8677">issue #8677</a>. In the meantime, we strongly encourage <a href="https://fluffychat.im/">FluffyChat</a> users to upgrade to version 0.21.1.</p>
<p>We're hard at work on the next release of Synapse, and the development branch <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/compare/v1.22.0...develop">already includes</a> many bugfixes, several new admin APIs, and support for structured logging‚Äîstay tuned!</p>

<p>This was an exciting week again. Trilene did the usual and just opened a PR, that implements the video part of call support. In my testing so far this seems to work amazingly well (ignore, that my webcam is crappy in the video, I only have so many devices...)! It's hard to overstate my satisfaction, if I am allowed to quote songs without getting a DMCA! If you want to try it out, you will need the qmlgl plugin at runtime (I had to patch some ebuilds on Gentoo to do so) and build Nheko from source. Support in our AppImage and Flatpak and for our Windows and MacOS builds will come at a later date. A big shoutout to trilene, who just works on VOIP in Nheko, without saying a word, and then drops a ready PR.</p>
<p>Another exciting new feature by lorendb, you can now specify <code>--profile &lt;profilename&gt;</code>, when you start Nheko, to create a separate profile. This allows you to open multiple instances and use multiple accounts at the same time (but it still uses separate instances of Nheko). This is pretty useful, if you have multiple accounts on different homeservers or are testing stuff for example. He also added a shortcut to delete the current content of the message area (Ctrl-U).</p>
<p>We also fixed a long standing bug, that crashed Nheko when pasting an image on mac OS, prevented copying text in some cases and build times should be about halfed again.</p>
<p>That's all I got today. I guess we should do a new release at some point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked about trilene, who is a reliable Nheko contributor, Nico replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>trilene seems to be a bit camera shy and prefer to work on code than take credit and talk about upcoming features. I'm surprised everytime, when a new PR is opened or trilene asks a weird question, that can only end up in an amazing contribution :3</p>

<p>I hacked together a maubot-based roundtrip test that leverages the echo bot's ping command reply and reports rtt to Icinga as a passive check result. Its practical use is scientifically questionnable, but it gives a hint on end-user experience.

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting November 28th and 29th of this year, many bots on t2bot.io will be supporting end-to-end encryption. Though not all bots will be supporting it, this is an important milestone towards getting end-to-bridge encryption enabled on t2bot.io as a proof of being able to scale to the higher demand of encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>The eventual goal is to support encryption on all of t2bot.io‚Äôs bots and bridges, however we need to take small steps to get there üôÇ. Note that in order to function, bots will decrypt <em>all</em> messages they see, but only respond to the ones they care about - this can still be uncomfortable for some rooms though, so feel free to kick them out.</p>
<p>For more detail on which bots are getting support and what all this entails/means, please see the <a href="https://t2bot.io/blog/2020/10/30/enabling-encryption-for-bots/">dedicated blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Keymaker is a new WIP Project of some people (over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#serverlist:nordgedanken.dev">#serverlist:nordgedanken.dev</a>  ) that aim to provide a <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/communities/">mastodon</a> alike Server List and we would love to get some more input from the Community for this project on whats wanted, whats needed and whats maybe not that good to base on the mastodon counterpart.</p>
<p>This means we are building:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A list of Servers where Owners can add their servers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We try to do Quality controls (No fully self add. Servers get reviewed.) using a Code of Conduct Ruleset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verified Listings using well-known files on serverside (Also allowing Admins to modify server data themself)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server Details like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ping and Avalibility Stats (thanks to tulir for providing a API)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public Room Lists fetched from the Server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NSFW Ratings (A NSFW tag was too generic for us)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Section to list Rules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Admin addresses for easy ways of reaching the Server admins</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing to select registration state (&quot;Open&quot;, &quot;Invite Only&quot;, &quot;Closed&quot;)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Code is fully written in Rust and using Postgres as a backend. Have a look at: <a href="https://github.com/daydream-mx/keymaker">https://github.com/daydream-mx/keymaker</a></p>
<p>Join us at: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#serverlist:nordgedanken.dev">#serverlist:nordgedanken.dev</a> </p>
<p>In a further post we plan to announce the launch of this Project as a Website. Server owners might get a ping before that to allow for setting up servers for this. This Project is not yet deployed to be used.</p>

<p>As we also allow non public servers (registration -&gt; closed) it may also be a nice way to find communities that federate and have a look if they have a interesting room to join in the public rooms list. :)</p>

<p>Hello everyone, normally anoa would be doing this update but today you get me (TravisR) instead. Luckily anoa has left me a script to run, so here's hoping I haven't completely messed up this week's update üòÖ</p>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a>.</p>

<h4 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h4>
<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we're still focusing on the same MSCs from previous weeks to get widgets over the line. This includes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2774">MSC2774</a> to have widgets aware of their widget ID, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2765">MSC2765</a> so widgets can be pretty in clients like Element, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2790">MSC2790</a> to support a form of user input with widgets.</p>
<p>Normally there would be a graph here of our MSC progress, however my machine refuses to accept that line graphs are a real thing today. As a replacement, here's a <a href="https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/generate_chart_e.html?hlyRange=1997-12-02%7C2020-10-22&amp;dlyRange=1995-04-01%7C2020-10-22&amp;mlyRange=1995-04-01%7C2007-11-01&amp;StationID=27378&amp;Prov=AB&amp;urlExtension=_e.html&amp;searchType=stnProv&amp;optLimit=specDate&amp;StartYear=1840&amp;EndYear=2020&amp;selRowPerPage=25&amp;Line=46&amp;Month=10&amp;Day=22&amp;lstProvince=&amp;timeframe=2&amp;Year=2020&amp;type=bar&amp;MeasTypeID=snow">snowfall accumulation graph for Banff</a> as reported by Environment Canada.</p>

<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> on Tuesday, a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/20/dendrite-0-2-0-released">reasonably big update</a> containing various improvements over the initial beta release, and then followed it up with a bug-fix <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.2.1">v0.2.1</a> release on Thursday. </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has been running Dendrite and reporting their findings, and also to contributors who have been submitting pull requests!</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer builds separate binaries for each polylith component, but instead has one multi-personality binary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Docker images have been simplified into two images: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-monolith">dendrite-monolith</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/matrixdotorg/dendrite-polylith">dendrite-polylith</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal HTTP API calls are now made using H2C (HTTP/2) in polylith mode, which resolves some head-of-line issues with the connection pool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities have been refactored, which should fix some cases where room state can end up corrupted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A couple of bugs when handling state rewrites have been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sync API no longer sends old state events to clients as if they were new</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SQLite locking bugs around the latest events updater have been resolved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notification levels are now parsed correctly in power level events (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pestdoktor">Pestdoktor</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invalid UTF-8 is now correctly rejected when making federation requests (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pestdoktor">Pestdoktor</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance for v0.2.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 57%, up from 56% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 81%, up from 80% last week</p>

<p>Element Android v1.0.9 is now available on the PlayStore. For the next release (1.0.10), we will optimize the performance (again!). We already have made some progress when sending a message to a room. We are now working on the crypto module and also we will probably upgrade the Realm database library, which seems more stable now. Besides that, we are still implementing the remaining features with the objective of getting a good feature parity with the other Element Matrix clients.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now shows the filename of an image on hover. (Contributed by kamath_manu)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko now shows the fontname in the font selection rendered using that font. This makes it easier to know, how the font will look, once you select it. (Contributed by lorendb)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a crash when closing Nheko. While this didn't really cause issues, since you were closing it anyway, it's just bad form to crash instead of exit properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed the membercache. Nheko used to load all members on startup and store them in memory. This made startup slower. Removing it sped up the start by a nice chunk and freed about 30MB of RAM on my system. One step closer to using reasonable amounts of RAM!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed excessive clipping when rendering the timeline. This prevented all batching of text messages. Now it only clips the replied to message, which makes scrolling much smoother again!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, some controversial change, which is currently in master but may be reverted at some point: Nheko now automatically forwards keys to verified devices, when they request the keys, without prompting you. While that can be toggled off in the settings, it currently defaults to on. This weakens backward secrecy of e2ee a bit, but it makes it possible to recover from e2ee issues much more easily. Currently I'd argue, that it is an acceptable tradeoff. It is very hard to verify room membership of users at any point in time but the current one and room membership is not verified end to end in any way, so you need to trust the server to provide you with the correct memberlist or you just send keys to verified users. While Nheko still sends keys to all members of a room, when creating the session, it only forwards your own keys to trusted users without prompting you. Currently I think this is an acceptable tradeoff, as opening a popup with &quot;user x wants to have session y shared in room z&quot; is unlikely to be understood by anyone properly either. I'd be glad to hear your opinions though!</p>
<p>That's it for this week, but next week will be interesting too. Lorendb has been hacking on profile support, allowing you to run multiple login sessions of Nheko in separate windows and some other UI features.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.6.2">Quotient 0.6.2</a> has been released, with a couple of minor bugfixes. This release is used as a foundation of <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.9.5-beta1">Quaternion 0.0.9.5 beta</a> that's also getting out today - with support of (proper Matrix subset of) HTML, rich text user links (like pills, only lighter), initial Markdown support (if you build with fresh enough Qt), reactions (thanks to Karel Kosek @krkk), navigation to earlier events (thanks to Roland Pallai @rpallai) and quite a few other improvements. To make this release Quaternion had to gain its own basic HTML parser and Matrix-to-Qt-to-Matrix converter, which is likely to end up being a separate micro-library, in the hope that it will be useful for other Matrix projects building on Qt (even non-Quotient ones). A separate call to translators - quite a few strings got updated, so please head to <a href="https://app.lokalise.com/project/730769035bbc328c31e863.62506391/">Quaternion project at Lokalise</a> and push the numbers at least to 80%!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In recent weeks the XR Finland community has been moving over from Wire to our own Matrix homeserver for encrypted secure chat. This was something that had been planned for a while but kicked off in recent weeks due to Wire suffering from serious encryption key delivery issues, causing messages for many to be unreadable in large groups. Currently we've migrated almost 300 rebels with more to come. Feedback has mostly been very positive, people generally like the Element clients ü§© One of the interesting changes has been a huge uptick in the amount of discussion, which can be taken as a good sign. The plan is to next start bridging to some of the international XR chapters, for example those on Mattermost, Telegram and Slack. And maybe get them over to Matrix too eventually ;)</p>
<p>To aid in community management, we've started creating <a href="https://github.com/elokapina/bubo">a bot called Bubo</a>. Right now it mostly helps with maintaining rooms and allowing mass invites, but more features to help the community cooperate are coming. We were planning to utilize (actual) communities so it has some functionality for those, but decided then to wait for the communities rewrite. It doesn't yet have any releases, will update in coming weeks as features are added and releases made.</p>

We will be cutting a v0.2.0 release candidate later today, which contains a significant number of important fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>We didn't publish a full changelog last week due to the beta announcement, therefore the following list includes changes from the last two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Database migrations are now ran automatically at startup</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer runs state resolution over single trusted state snapshots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monolith deployments with Kafka now work again (each component sets up connections independently to avoid duplicate consumers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now correctly rejects invalid UTF-8 - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>A bug with concurrent map writes in the rate limiting in the client API has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities and their previous events are now checked fully against the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typing events are now ignored if the sender domain doesn't match the origin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duplicate redaction entries no longer result in database errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some bugs in <code>/send</code> have been fixed where the full room state wasn't requested properly before sending a new snapshot to the roomserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The membership updaters now use database writers properly, which fixes some SQLite locking issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sync API no longer burns CPU processing unnecessary device key change notifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>QueryStateAfterEvents</code> now resolves state from multiple snapshots properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cumulative room state is now sent to the roomserver when creating rooms locally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missing auth events will now be retrieved from multiple servers in the room if necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation requests now have variable timeouts, allowing us to wait much longer for a remote server to process certain tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/send</code> endpoint now returns 500 errors far less often, reducing the frequency that other servers back off from sending to Dendrite</p>

<p>Hello everyone, this week we merged the federation branch into master. It's not ready to be used properly yet, but we're merging it as it seems stable enough for now. We also improved performance of the federation branch a lot by turning off debug logs.</p>
<p>Other news:</p>
<ul>
<li>I opened two issues on element-ios which currently break register and login support on Conduit, making it completely unusable. Hopefully they can be resolved soon (https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3736, https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3737)</li>
<li>I'm working on an MSC for threading. It's still WIP, but you can take a look here: https://demo.codimd.org/s/SykbuAUwP</li>

<p><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/stonking">Stonking</a> week for Synapse as we landed sharded event persisters and deployed to matrix.org. This is the last significant component other than the main process to go through the sharding process and a major hurdle in horizontal scalability of Synapse.</p>
<p>Initial results look good with event persistence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">apdex</a> improving, however we think there are still some significant performance improvements available through configuration and will continue to experiment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We also moved off background processes from the main process. This is significant because it means that while the main process is not shardable it really doesn‚Äôt do anything anymore other than orchestration.</p>
<p>Again the initial impact looks very promising and we will continue to tune. Having moved the background processes away it also makes profiling the main process that much easier.</p>

<p>Small bit of news I wanted to talk about from Bridge Island. My <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8437">implementation</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> has been merged which means appservices / bridges can now listen in for incoming presence, typing and read receipt events! This means that the Slack bridge can now reliably send your typing status to Slack, and Bifrost can reliably bridge your everything to XMPP. The MSC is still in flux and could change, but for now this could really improve the native feeling of bridges :)</p>
<p>(Oh and I should mention anyone using matrix-appservice-bridge v2.2.0+ can use this behaviour for free)</p>

<p>Hot on his heels, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been adding support for the MSCs Half-Shot implemented in Synapse to my bridges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enabling end-to-bridge encryption now uses appservice login (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2778">MSC2778</a>), which means setting up the shared secret login module is no longer required for e2be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mautrix-python has support for receiving ephemeral events via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> in a branch, which will be merged once Synapse v1.22 is released. After it's merged, <code>/sync</code>ing with double puppets will no longer be necessary to bridge ephemeral events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these will also be implemented in mautrix-go/whatsapp soon.</p>
<p>Now I just need Half-Shot to make synapse send to-device events to appservices, after which bridges won't need any hacky <code>/sync</code>ing at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several releases this week (0.1.11 to 0.1.15) with lots of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>url-based navigation has landed! All navigation in the app is now done through urls, meaning you can also bookmark any UI state (e.g. grid configurations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed 2 memory leaks (exposed now because you can unload your session without refreshing the page)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed an issue with libolm running out of memory if you send a message to more than 44 devices (see issue #150).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some logical additions now we have url navigation: restoring the last url when opening the app with the default route, and a button to close your session and go back to the picker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the app now blocks concurrent access to the same session from different tabs (it just closes the session in the non-active tab). This will prevent multiple syncs tripping over each other writing to indexeddb (e.g. ConstraintErrors and friends).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>updates are announced in the app (for now through a confirm dialog, but will use an in app notification once we have it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixes updates not installing on iOS, by having an update prompt. To get this update on iOS though, you'll need to unpin the app, and pinning it again. You'll need to login again after this. All future updates should be installable through the update prompt once you have 0.1.15 though, you won't have to do this again normally.</p>

<p>uses the hydrogen icon when pinning on iOS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I published the first preview of my Sailfish client called Konheko. While you can run Android applications on Sailfish, they usually are a subpar experience, since they really don't fit the platforms design and style and also usually don't properly send notifications.</p>
<p>So about a year ago I started working on a Matrix client for SailfishOS, but I never really made much progress. Well, last weekend I did, and so it can now send plain text messages as well as various forms of media messages, I made a basic application icon and I've been using it this week already (for unencrypted rooms).</p>
<p>It is still missing a lot of features, but if you want you can install it from <a href="https://openrepos.net/content/deepbluev7/konheko">OpenRepos</a>. Sources are available <a href="https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/konheko">here</a>. Just be aware, that it currently stores all messages in RAM, so every restart will take forever to load your rooms and it may run out of RAM at some point. Storing messages in some database will come at some point. Also, a lot of menus may lead nowhere, since those are just placeholders for me atm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently, I tweaked Element-web to feature a few changes similar to SchildiChat for Android.</p>
<p>For now, it's probably best seen rather as a proof-of-concept than a finished product, as there are still some layout bugs, and no settings available for the added features (I know some people prefer separate lists for direct and group chats).
I consider it usable though.</p>
<p>Particular changes compared to upstream Element-web include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A common section for groups and direct chats in the overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message bubbles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bigger items in the room overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A different dark theme, similar to SchildiChat for Android</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know how much I will work on this in the future, but I figured it might be interesting to share either way. Maybe even someone with more web-development skills than me might want to help improving it :)</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">has officially entered beta</a>!</p>
<p>It aims to be an efficient, reliable and scalable alternative to Synapse.</p>
<p>We encourage early adopters to try it out starting with v0.1.0 in Monolith/Postgres mode.</p>
<p>Dendrite supports a large amount of the Matrix spec including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All room versions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E2E encryption (but not cross-signing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and many others!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll be hard at work in the coming weeks ironing out any issues that crop up as Dendrite enters the global</p>
<p>federation of Matrix servers. At present, Dendrite has not been optimised for memory/CPU usage, nor does it
fully support sharding, so there is still much scope to improve the already impressive resource usage whilst</p>
<p>heading towards 100% spec compliance.</p>
<p>Spec compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 77%, same as last week</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week I worked on a new feature: the Admin Room. This is a room that is automatically created for the first user of a new homeserver. This room will be used to send warnings to server admins in the future and can be used to control Conduit (like querying information, running cleanup, banning servers, hiding public rooms or restarting Conduit). Power levels can be used to control who in the room has access to which commands. The admin room will work over federation, so it's easy to help someone fix his server.</p>
<p>Other news:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Federation is now disabled by default and can be enabled in the config</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bug with typing notifications is fixed</p>

<p>After a long and sometimes painful journey we plan to run sharded event persisters on matrix.org from Monday. All being well we will start running background processes on their own worker to free up the main process.
These two projects combined should noticeably improve performance of matrix.org and any large scale deployments.</p>
<p>Aside from that we are continuing to work on room knocking as a feature and have been considering ways to reduce load attributable to state resolution.</p>
<p>We will also dust off the notifications project.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we finally cleaned up the remaining parts of Chethans GSoC work and merged it. This means Nheko now has partial support for cross-signing. You can either start the verification from another client or when viewing the profile of a user. There are a few things still missing though:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko does not use the verification status at all at the moment. So while you can verify your master key and let others verify your master key, from Nhekos perspective there is not much benefit yet. You will however show up with a green checkmark in other clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While nheko supports verifying your own master key and after that will also let others verify your master key, it does not yet download the self and user signing keys. This means you won't be able to upload cross-signing signatures for your own devices and other users master keys yet. I'll see if I can implement in the next weeks or so (since literally only the private key download or sharing is missing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko can't bootstrap cross-signing yet. This means you need to bootstrap it from Element or another client once. That will probably take a bit until this is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UX is still WIP. Currently it shows a lot of unnecessary buttons, that are a bit confusing as well as not enough green checkmarks, so that needs some work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things that happened in the mean time or are work in progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decryption errors should be reduced by a bit now. This is still work in progress though. With device trust landed now, we should be able to do automatic key requests, sharing and key backup soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lurkki is currently cleaning up the design of the built in video player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manu_kamath is improving the design when showing images at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LorenDB has been updating our screenshots and working on an Esperanto translation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trilene has been ever busy improving edge cases around the Voip support in Nheko.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So far Hacktoberfest seems to be going well with quite a few people trying to clean up some of the rougher edges in Nheko. If you are using Nheko and think some things could be better, why not try to fix it yourself? October is the perfect time for that!</p>
<p>Featurework of this cycle is also slowly nearing its end. Once cross-signing, voip and the new event store are stable, we plan to improve the UX a bit more as well as some other annoyances and maybe we can do a new release then! A nice and spooky Hacktober everyone!</p>

<p>The VoIP tester is now roughly 'usable' but please note that IPv6 support is totally untested (I don't have IPv6) ‚Äî it is also suspected that some browsers won't try IPv6 anyway.</p>

<p><a href="https://fossil.nil.im/objmatrix">ObjMatrix</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ObjFW/ObjMatrix">GitHub</a>) is a new Matrix client library written in modern Objective-C for <a href="https://objfw.nil.im/">ObjFW</a>. Because it uses ObjFW, it is not limited to Apple platforms, and instead is <a href="https://objfw.nil.im/doc/trunk/PLATFORMS.md">extremely portable</a> and should run on basically everything.</p>
<p>This is currently in its very early stages and is intended to be suitable to develop bots and clients with very soon. Being suitable to develop bridges with it is another goal for later.</p>
<p>Since ObjFW also works on platforms that are usually hard to support or port software to (e.g. <a href="https://www.morphos-team.net/">MorphOS</a>), this will hopefully also bring clients for these less mainstream operating systems. I'm especially hopeful about MorphOS here, since ObjFW already runs quite well there (parts of it are included with the OS even!), and hardware on which MorphOS runs on is usually not powerful enough to run Element Web. And eventually, I will want to have a Matrix client on my Amiga, too üòâ (which this should enable).</p>

<p>Gitter is joining the Matrix ecosystem!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's true! Element has acquired Gitter from GitLab and will be implementing
Gitter's current chat features in Matrix, before rebuilding Gitter as a Matrix
client! Before all that however, the first step is to build a proper, modern
bridge between the two networks, replacing the old one that's been around for
years.</p>

Ok, who am I kidding - before Matrix clients get on with adoption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will allow people to post links to Matrix rooms/messages/users and when clicked will open right in your favourite Matrix client. Super convenient and great for adoption!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite is nearing beta! Today we will be cutting a candidate 0.1.0rc1 version after a week of hunting and fixing bugs. We are on track to release version 0.1.0 next week, at which point we will be inviting people to try installing and using Dendrite!</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initial sync is fixed after a bug caused us to fall back on incremental sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP header is now handled properly when MIME-formatted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal API calls over HTTP in polylith mode now use their own HTTP client with higher timeouts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now tries harder to find missing auth events, using fetcher workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer falls back on <code>/state</code> unnecessarily, which was the cause of a major memory leak and high CPU usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation HTTP calls now include the <code>User-Agent</code> header</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The event <code>depth</code> field is now ignored in the federation API</p>
</li>

<p>We now report the password change capability properly (thanks <a href="https://github.com/bn4t">bn4t</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registration flows now include the <code>completed</code> field after a failure (thanks <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug in the previous event updater in the roomserver has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where we didn't check our own old verify keys when verifying event signatures is fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where we didn't handle event ID domains being different to the event origin in earlier room versions has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLS fingerprints have been removed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 77%, same as last week</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, we updated some of our documentation and created a whole new set of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">easy first issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted">medium to hard issues</a> for contributors.</p>

<h3 id="the-construct">The Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jason:zemos.net">Jason</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix Construct supports aarch64 (ARMv8) architectures. The experience has been phenomenal, with performance exceeding all expectations. Last week I wrote about all new vector code inside Construct using SSE through AVX-512 hardware acceleration in servers; that same code is now accelerated by SVE (Scalable Vector Extensions) on ARM architectures when you compile with clang.</p>
<p>This result is important: ARM virtual machines are offered at a significantly lower price compared to x86 from the same vendor. The systems are cheaper, require less power, but generally perform worse. The trick is to optimize the software for the weaker hardware. The benefit allows, for example, Matrix server hosts running Construct to make th eir profit margin from the lower TCO, getting more out of every computing cycle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I made a Signal bridge using <a href="https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald">signald</a>.</p>
<p>Currently it supports bridging messages, reactions and signal read receipts. End-to-bridge encryption also exists (mautrix-python does all the work there). The bridge can be linked as a secondary device and possibly even registered as the main device, but I didn't actually test registering yet. Setup instructions are currently somewhat non-existent, but it's mostly the same as my other bridges plus signald as a separate daemon.</p>

<p>Element Android: Version 1.0.8 is now available on the stores, it fixes issues with verification and PIN code among other issues (see <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/releases/tag/v1.0.8">https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/releases/tag/v1.0.8</a> for more details). Now we are working on improving performance when sending messages to rooms, and also improving global UX, especially of the home (rooms list). Search messages (in clear rooms for the moment) is coming soon, and it will be also possible to filter the room members list.</p>
<p>We will also spend some time on the new Android SDK, https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2, which is for the moment a quick extract of what we have in Element Android. We have to take care of it as a real product now: document it properly, set up CI, export Javadoc, develop a sample app, etc.</p>

<p>t2bot.io has crossed 1M monthly active users</p>
<p>All of these users are Telegram/Discord users that have been brought into Matrix over the last 30 days. This doesn't appear to be a temporary spike either: over the last 8 weeks t2bot.io has been hovering at 900-950 thousand monthly active users, up from 600-700 thousand. Record-setting traffic levels have also been achieved, with matrix.org being able to keep up for the first time in a long while.</p>
<p>Overall it's a good sign to see so many communities making the jump to Matrix and sticking around ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

<p>Signature verification has been updated to not fail if the event <code>origin</code> field is missing (although it still requires a signature from the domain of the <code>sender</code> field)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of places where we use SQL transactions have been updated with safe wrappers (thanks <a href="https://github.com/samcday">samcday</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly for federation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>

This will help client developers and is a precursor to improving notification support.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also been looking at adding monitoring to get a better sense of which rooms are most expensive from a state resolution perspective, we also want a better way to track federation lag.</p>
<p>Up next we‚Äôll move all background tasks away from the main process and try it out on matrix.org, we are hoping for a 10-15% saving in CPU. Event persistence sharding, specifically the new stream token format is on hold slightly while we work on a nasty race condition on start up of the event persister. We hope to get back to the main sharding project next week.</p>

<h3 id="the-construct">The Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jason:zemos.net">Jason</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix concludes a summer of Construct where several transformative rounds of optimization took place. I'd like to talk about these achievements and why they are important for
future directions.</p>
<p>Over the summer, Construct introduced new vector extensions to the project. As server software, our primary target is the datacenter which (for now) is dominated by x86 hardware. The latest features of x86 chips include AVX-2, AVX-512, and on-die GPU. These advancements are important because they help mitigate current limitations of hardware, such as the cubic relationship between a processor's frequency and its power consumption. These limitations mean that CPU cores aren't completing more cycles-per-second every iteration of their development -- they're not getting much faster.</p>
<p>The problem with threads is that they can introduce a lot of complications to a project. Construct is able to forego multi-threading as a network server because it is primarily IO-bound. The benefits to a single-thread design in both performance and simplicity cannot be overstated. This is why Construct stands to benefit the most from features which allow more work to be accomplished at every individual computing cycle.</p>
<p>Construct undertook several endeavors over the summer which directly leverage platforms featuring SSE, AVX, AVX-512, etc. As an added bonus, our approach is designed to effortlessly port to ARM's Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) as it becomes available (inside datacenters too!). Our focus has been JSON, Unicode, and finally Base64. Detailed explanations for each of these will need to be discussed in their own posts, but in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Matrix specifies a canonical form of JSON which is not necessarily the same as the JSON the server receives. Therefor it is imperative that Construct is liberal with what JSON it accepts and correct with its transformation into canonical JSON. Over the summer, a portion of Construct's canonical transform received some optimization to go beyond the default method of character-by-character read-modify-write. As seen in [1], a streaming hardware-accelerated transform now processes at least 16 characters at a time (with more possible) without forward branching except for the parts where transformation needs to occur. One of these transformations is UTF-16 to UTF-8 surrogate conversion, which leads into the second endeavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construct introduced a completely branch-free Unicode toolset in [2]. Among the functions offered is a custom transform of UTF-16 surrogate pairs to UTF-8 sequences. Using the new vector registers, Construct can transform two UTF-16 surrogates in parallel to output two UTF-8 sequences, or two UTF-16 surrogates in a pair to output one UTF-8 sequence. Unfortunately, these specific functions were written at fixed vector widths, so more work needs to be done to really take advantage of the widest hardware. Each surrogate is 6 bytes, and a surrogate pair is 12 bytes; therefor we cannot make use of the last 4 bytes of a 16 byte vector. However, with a little more work this approach can be extended to a 64 byte vector, capable of decoding 5 surrogate pairs and 10 individual surrogates in parallel!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professor Daniel Lemire recently published a paper about fast Base64 from hardware acceleration in [3]. This approach is extremely elegant on the 64-byte-wide AVX-512 system. Prior to Construct's implementation of this in [4], the Boost library base64 encoding and decoding took roughly 20 and 25 cycles per character respectively. Our implementation on the same system, an old system with only SSE2 (not even AVX-512!) yields 5 and 6 cycles per character!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this helps lay a foundation for Construct to introduce Federated Media Rooms sometime in the future. Currently, Construct stores media in a separate database. Recently there's been work on a separate branch at [5] which stores actual file block inside events using Base64. It is for this reason sub-cycle and branchless JSON parsing and Base64 encoding is essential for maximum performance. The result is worthwhile, as the latency for querying the media database is slower than parsing and decoding the event content already in-hand.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Construct is available at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct</a> and don't forget to idle and perform <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:maunium.net">#construct:maunium.net</a></p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I present you a new project I've been working on for some time. It's a bot that allows you to use the admin API through matrix, by typing commands to the bot. The inspiration comes from the OperServ-like bots that allow IRC operators to administrate an IRC server.</p>
<p>The bot exposes some of the available admin APIs and aims to provide some more high level commands by combining different APIs. There is currently one &quot;high level command&quot;, <code>!room garbage-collect</code>, which allow you to purge from your HS all rooms without local users.</p>
<p>The project is written in crystal and is my first project in this language. It should be stable in normal conditions, but don't hesitate to fill issues. A Docker image is provided for more convenience.</p>
<p>I hope you will find this project useful üôÇ</p>

<p>Soru made a new thing, <a href="https://gitlab.com/Sorunome/matrix-gotify">matrix-gotify</a>. It is a <a href="https://gotify.net/">gotify</a> plugin to receive matrix notifications. This means, you can now receive matrix push notifications on your android phone self-hosted without the need of google services! That is why putting the full event in the push notification is actually not a privacy leak in this case.</p>
<p>This plugin could also be used to receive push notifications on any other kind of device that gotify supports.</p>
<p>Please note that this is independent of any matrix client - you don't even need to run one to be able to use this!</p>

<p>I asked whether an <a href="https://bubu1.eu/openpush/">OpenPush</a>-like solution be
built on top of this , and Sorunome responded that someone had already
started working on just that! https://github.com/gotify/android/pull/115</p>
<p>This would allow other matrix clients on your phone to get their push
notifications through your gotify client, instead of needing to run a process
each. Great for battery life without proprietary Google blobs!</p>

<p>I have been through the perils of setting up a TURN server and having VoIP continue to fail, whilst spending hours scratching my head and staring at Wireshark without getting anywhere. When I was given free reign over project choice last year during my internship, I chose to start a tool that tests your homeserver's VoIP configuration, hoping it would be useful to both me and the community at large.</p>
<p>It saw some progress but I never managed to iron out some of the 'last few things' or put a pretty front on it ‚Äî until about 2 weeks ago, when I got some more time to do it.</p>
<p>There are known issues ‚Äî such as the scores being very arbitrary, wrong and misleading; it crashes Chromium every time (on my machine) and it completely misbehaves in Brave Browser (on my machine). It may also not be the prettiest (but hopefully it is at least somewhat inoffensive). I hope to work on these annoying issues soon.</p>
<p>I have deployed a test instance at <a href="https://test.voip.librepush.net">https://test.voip.librepush.net</a> ‚Äî it can be tried in a WebRTC-supporting browser (probably Firefox if you want half a chance). Please don't take it to heart if you get a Fail or Poor score ‚Äî it's probably not your fault. :)</p>

<p>Conduit is a Matrix homeserver written in Rust <a href="https://conduit.rs">https://conduit.rs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome back! This week we made some groundbreaking progress - this is not a joke, we found a bug in Synapse while breaking multiple Matrix rooms, causing the Matrix team a lot of unnecessary stress. Let me explain:
The good news is that Conduit is starting to federate now. This means that you should be able to join all public rooms of the Matrix network and exchange messages. Note that Conduit does not do all the checks it should be doing yet making it stop sending messages from time to time as well as that advanced features like loading the history, syncing temporary data like read receipts or accepting invites are not implemented yet.</p>
<p>The bad news is that, while Synapse is happy to accept Conduit's messages when it is already part of the room, joining into one of the rooms Conduit servers are part of didn't work because of an event validation bug. The Matrix team did an excellent job at fixing this bug and releasing a Synapse patch the same day, but the damage has been done making a few rooms inaccessible to old Synapse servers.
Thanks to everyone who supports me on &quot;Liberapay&quot; (https://liberapay.com/timokoesters) or Bitcoin!</p>

This means that Synapse is now easily installable on any operating system that supports pkgsrc (which is many, e.g. NetBSD, Linux, macOS, Solaris, AIX, Haiku, ‚Ä¶). And while at it, I also ported mautrix-hangouts + dependencies (in pkgsrc as <code>chat/mautrix-hangouts</code>).</p>

<p>Hey bridge developer enthusiasts! Myself and ChristianP (bridge crew of matrix.org) have been working hard on freshening up the matrix-appservice-bridge library. It's no secret that it was using &quot;classic&quot; Javascript rather than ES6 syntax, was poorly documented in places and there were no types at all to make use of.</p>
<p>But that's all changed now, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/2.0.0-rc1">2.0.0-rc1</a> release brings fresh types, new convenience methods, a total swichover from Bluebird Promises to native Promises and much much more. If you are looking to quickly get set up writing bridges, it's never been easier.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/tree/develop/examples/slack-starter">slack-starter</a> project to get your first taste of bridge excellence and see what you think.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi encryption fans. This week the bridge team has been churning away at adding support for encrypted rooms in the <code>matrix-appservice-bridge</code> library, to enable support in <code>matrix-appservice-irc</code>, <code>matrix-appservice-slack</code>, and anyone else using the library. This is probably the most exciting feature the library has seen in a long time! </p>
<p>The feature will be a simple config toggle, so existing bridges will have to do very little work to support it.</p>
<p>The first phase plans to use <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a> with bridge users syncing like real users, but eventually the hope is that this will be all built into the library.

<blockquote>
<p>0.6.3 and 0.6.4 were released this week, and I'm now working on desktop notifications support and push rules control.</p>
<h4 id="added">Added</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add a <strong>system tray icon</strong>.</p>
<p>A left click will bring up the Mirage window, 
middle will quit the application and right will show a menu with these </p>
<p>options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>closeMimizesToTray</code> setting to the config file, defaults to <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Controls whether closing the Mirage window will leave it running in the 
system tray, or fully quit the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a discrete <strong>read marker indicator</strong> to messages, shows how many people </p>
<p>have this event as their last seen one in the room.<br />
A way to see who read the message and when will be added in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: add <code>chat.message.localEcho</code> and <code>chat.message.readCounter</code> color properties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>zoom</code> setting, defaults to <code>1.0</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>lexicalRoomSorting</code> setting, to sort rooms by their name instead of</p>
<p>recent activity.<br />
A restart is needed to apply changes to this setting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restrict Mirage to a single instance per config folder, trying to launch a</p>
<p>new window will instead focus the existing one.<br />
The <code>MIRAGE_CONFIG_DIR</code> and <code>MIRAGE_DATA_DIR</code> environment variables can be</p>
<p>set to run different &quot;profiles&quot; in parallel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the visible lag when opening a chat page, switching rooms should be </p>
<p>a lot smoother</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When using the <code>focusPreviousMessage</code> and <code>focusNextMessage</code> keybinds, if no</p>
<p>message is focused and the timeline has been scrolled up, 
focus the message in the center of the view instead of returning to the </p>
<p>bottom of the timeline and focusing the last one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't re-center the room list on clicks by default.</p>
<p>This prevents the list from jumping around every time a room is selected.<br />
The previous behavior can be restored with the new <code>centerRoomListOnClick</code></p>
<p>setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show a better terminal error message than &quot;Component is not ready&quot; when the </p>
<p>window creation fails, giving details on what went wrong in the code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an account's access token is invalid (e.g. our session was signed out </p>
<p>externally), say so with a popup and cleanly remove it from the UI, 
instead of spamming the user with errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename message context menu option &quot;Debug this event&quot; to just &quot;Debug&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unify up/down and (shift+)Tab navigation for the account Sessions page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to the UI scale/zoom via keybinds are now persisted across restarts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: <code>uiScale</code> is now bound to <code>window.settings.zoom</code>.</p>
<p>This change is necessary to keep the zoom keybinds working.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fixed">Fixed</h4>

<p>Hemppa the bot is a multi-purpose Matrix bot for writing new functionality easily with Python. </p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cos:hacklab.fi">Cos</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hemppa gained a small but big feature for making fediverse better: per-room Mastodon tooting support. This means that you can set up a Mastodon account in your room and anyone with moderator rights can toot to that account. This way you and your roommates can super easily send toots to the world directly from Matrix. Mastodon (unlike the big alternative) supports RSS feeds out of the box so it's very easy to subscribe to users and hashtags with stock RSS bot.  Toot #hemppathebot if you like it!

<p>Normally the ping shows how long other servers take to receive the sending-server's message. Some servers receive it quickly, some take hours. All this flows into the statistic of the sending server. I wrote a small program that's the other way around. Instead of measuring the sending-server's ping, it associates each measurement with an echo-bot (instead of the sending server), so this plot shows which maubots are the fastest to respond (it's probably not accurate at all, because most of the pings were started on conduit servers this week, but it's interesting nevertheless):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since we suddenly have multiple projects that've separately gone on to trial our new and shiny Matrix-on-location for multiple respective use-cases, from conferences to anonymous - encrypted - support chats, we've had to end our soft-launch period <strong>very</strong> quickly.</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>

<p>For minutes, confusion reigned in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">chat</a> about just what this meant! Fortunately, clarity arrived:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To clarify; Ending the soft-launch period means that we've now gone on to a full launch, with public announcements and everything else that includes</p>

In its place we've put something in a very similar vein: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1960">MSC1960</a> (OpenID Connect exchange for widgets).</p>
<p>We had another long overdue Spec Core Team retro this week. On the whole it felt very productive, and we've hopefully helped identify some key issues and actions going forward to help internally organise the way the team spends time on MSCs (read: unblocking review progress from the team).</p>
<p>We're still working out our exact strategy asynchronously at the moment, so expect more details to follow soon.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we put out a new release candidate for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.0rc3">Synapse 1.20.0</a>, highlights include shadow ban support, more async/awaiting and unread message counts being added to sync responses to support upcoming notifications work. </p>
<p>Aside from that Erik has been continuing to get event persistence sharding ready for shipping. He already has a working version, but currently all workers will run at the speed for the slowest instance. Once that is fixed we will put it on matrix.org to see how it performs.</p>
<p>Patrick has finished up on asyncing all the things, and is now studying flame graphs to figure out where all the cycles on the main process are going.</p>
<p>Andrew has been taking a look at the knocking <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC</a>, expecting concrete progress in the next few weeks. </p>
<p>Brendan has been working notifications support and is currently in VoIP land helping Dave on trying to level up our VoIP support.</p>
<p>Finally Oliver has dusted off his TURN tester from last Summer to get it working before he returns to university. The idea is that it will act a bit like the federation tester for but for TURN configuration.</p>

<p>It's been a big week for <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Released 0.0.36 with end-to-end encryption enabled! üéâ<br />
Most of this week was spent on performance improvements for IE11, where asm.js runs quite slow. Decryption is run in parallel on 4 workers in that browser, giving a massive speed-up and added responsiveness (the UI would freeze for 7 seconds when opening a room prior to this). There is still some polishing to do on sharing room keys, which I will get to next week, but all in all, it should work well. Next week I also want to get started on supporting key backup, so you can also read your encrypted history from before you logged in.</p>

<h3 id="maunium-sticker-picker">Maunium sticker picker</h3>
<p>This isn't strictly a client, but it's in the clients section.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting stuff into the spec or even implemented in Elements is very slow, so while we wait for proper native sticker packs and pickers (i.e. not in an iframe/webview), I decided to make a better sticker picker widget: <a href="https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker">https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker</a></p>
<p>The goal is to be as fast and simple as possible. The picker and sticker packs are just some static files that can be served anywhere (no compilation required). It doesn't require self-hosting anything except said static files, and it has been confirmed to work on all three Elements.</p>
<p>There's a Telegram import script that's used to reupload stickers to Matrix and generate the static sticker pack files that the picker widget uses. It's technically also possible to make the sticker pack files yourself, but there's no easy way to do that yet.</p>
<p>Due to the simplicity of the picker there's no authentication, which also means everyone sees the same sticker packs. One way to get around that limitation is to have a unique URL for each user. I'll probably write a bot to manage copies of the picker for multiple users in the future.</p>
<p>Other future improvements include remembering frequently used stickers (surprisingly, all three Elements keep localStorage for widgets), importing Telegram animated stickers and searching for stickers by emoji/name</p>
</blockquote>
<p>later more words appeared from Tulir:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the initial announcement, my sticker picker has received some more features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a slider to configure the number of stickers shown per row</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequently used stickers now show up at the top</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imported all the packs from Scalar (the default integration manager)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A model of productivity, Tulir also announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>my sticker picker has dark theme support too now</p>

<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we're sticking with the widget theme, but also adding something new. Travis is writing up a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2764">mahoosive widgets PR</a> in addition to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls/turt2live">some widget MSCs</a>. We're also adding on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2753">MSC2753</a> (peeking /sync), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2444">MSC2444</a> (peeking federation), which will both unlock some very exciting upcoming features (such as x-as-rooms)!</p>

<p>Erik has made an initial, naive implementation of a sharded Event Persister worker - the non-sharded version currently being one of the biggest bottlenecks on matrix.org right now. It still needs a bit of polish to be production ready, and Sytest will need some updating to support testing it, but otherwise progress is looking good!</p>
<p>Brendan is polishing his unread counts implementations, while Rich is writing up the push rules replacement tech in an MSC. Rich has also been optimizing the device code in Synapse to both simplify the code, as well as cut down on unnecessary device data being sent over federation.</p>
<p>Patrick has finished converting Synapse's database code to be fully async! This has the benefit of making profiling the matrix.org Synapse process much more sane, and we're already starting to find a few little places where Synapse is burning CPU unnecessarily! Now, Synapse won't be fully async'd until Twisted itself is, and we drop support for older Twisted versions that aren't, which is not <em>soon</em>. However the majority of the code that developers touch and that is executed being async has massive benefits either way üôÇ</p>
<p>Andrew has been working on having a confirmation pop up after users click the link in their email, to help prevent phishing scams. He's also trying to finally make Synapse spec-compliant in accepting identifier dictionaries during user-interactive authentication.</p>
<p>Olivier has been continuing to help Synapse recover missed messages better after it has been offline for an extended period of time, as well as various fixes to push. </p>
<p>Expect a fresh release with all these changes soon!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we have been continuing on our bug-hunt mission and have been working on refactoring some significant parts of the codebase to simplify the API surfaces and avoid race conditions.</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The current state server is in the process of being deprecated, with this functionality being folded into the roomserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for rate limiting on certain CS API endpoints has been added </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for password changes has been added, allowing users to change their own password</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/sync</code> no longer incorrectly lists some rooms in the leave section, which caused problems with Element Web and other clients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roomserver input events are now handled in FIFO order with per-room workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roomserver input, query and perform packages are now split up nicely</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federation sender and keyserver now delay some startup tasks to allow the HTTP listeners to start more quickly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federation sender is now used for backfilling and getting missing events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some more SQLite writer bugs have been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room information in the roomserver is now handled in a common structure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public rooms API now correctly searches remote servers (thanks <a href="https://github.com/rohitmohan96">rohitmohan96</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initial support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2753">Peeking (MSC2753)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2444">Peeking over Federation (MSC2444)</a> is in progress</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, up from 55% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 71%, same as last week</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Last week, we updated some of our documentation and created a whole new set of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">easy first issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted">medium to hard issues</a> for contributors.</p>

<p>Introducing a new bridge to the family, tomsg-matrix!</p>
<p>A friend of mine preferred using <a href="https://git.tomsmeding.com/tomsg/">his own chat protocol</a>, but having a chat protocol is useless without having people to talk to. Since I prefer using Matrix I thought it would be a fun exercise to try and create a bridge using Rust.</p>
<p>The bridge uses the newly created (still very WIP) <a href="https://github.com/lieuwex/matrix-appservice-rs">matrix-appservice-rs</a>. A Rust library that builds on top of the Ruma suite, the goal is for it to be comparable to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-node">matrix-appservice-node</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>.</p>
<p>The code for tomsg-matrix is <a href="https://github.com/lieuwex/tomsg-matrix">open source</a>, but be prepared, I hastily pushed it to GitHub without cleaning it up.</p>
<p>Come chat to us over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#tomsg:lieuwe.xyz">#tomsg:lieuwe.xyz</a>, hoping that it doesn't break. :P</p>
