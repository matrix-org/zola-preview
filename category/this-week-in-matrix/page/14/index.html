<p>As a crude measure of growth, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> commented about <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:elokapina.fi">kapina-jaywink</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent weeks the XR Finland community has been moving over from Wire to our own Matrix homeserver for encrypted secure chat. This was something that had been planned for a while but kicked off in recent weeks due to Wire suffering from serious encryption key delivery issues, causing messages for many to be unreadable in large groups. Currently we've migrated almost 300 rebels with more to come. Feedback has mostly been very positive, people generally like the Element clients ü§© One of the interesting changes has been a huge uptick in the amount of discussion, which can be taken as a good sign. The plan is to next start bridging to some of the international XR chapters, for example those on Mattermost, Telegram and Slack. And maybe get them over to Matrix too eventually ;)</p>
<p>To aid in community management, we've started creating <a href="https://github.com/elokapina/bubo">a bot called Bubo</a>. Right now it mostly helps with maintaining rooms and allowing mass invites, but more features to help the community cooperate are coming. We were planning to utilize (actual) communities so it has some functionality for those, but decided then to wait for the communities rewrite. It doesn't yet have any releases, will update in coming weeks as features are added and releases made.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:elokapina.fi">kapina-jaywink</a> also</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wants to clarify that XR is a decentralized movement and this does not mean other chapters will adapt Matrix - but we can hope and for sure here in Finland we'll be spreading the good experiences to other chapters ;)</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">released our first beta last week</a> and we've been busy taking feedback from the community and fixing problems as they have been reported to us. We will be cutting a v0.2.0 release candidate later today, which contains a significant number of important fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>We didn't publish a full changelog last week due to the beta announcement, therefore the following list includes changes from the last two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Database migrations are now ran automatically at startup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State resolution v2 performance has been improved dramatically on large state sets, seen to be running up to 20x faster in some rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer runs state resolution over single trusted state snapshots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monolith deployments with Kafka now work again (each component sets up connections independently to avoid duplicate consumers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now correctly rejects invalid UTF-8 - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully read markers are now handled - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>completed</code> field is now returned properly for user-interactive auth - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The devices table now tracks last seen timestamps, IPs and user agents - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/S7evinK">S7evinK</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed in the reverse topological ordering algorithm which resulted in us giving up on inbound references after the first prev/auth event</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug with concurrent map writes in the rate limiting in the client API has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities and their previous events are now checked fully against the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typing events are now ignored if the sender domain doesn't match the origin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duplicate redaction entries no longer result in database errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some bugs in <code>/send</code> have been fixed where the full room state wasn't requested properly before sending a new snapshot to the roomserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The membership updaters now use database writers properly, which fixes some SQLite locking issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sync API no longer burns CPU processing unnecessary device key change notifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>QueryStateAfterEvents</code> now resolves state from multiple snapshots properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cumulative room state is now sent to the roomserver when creating rooms locally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missing auth events will now be retrieved from multiple servers in the room if necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation requests now have variable timeouts, allowing us to wait much longer for a remote server to process certain tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/send</code> endpoint now returns 500 errors far less often, reducing the frequency that other servers back off from sending to Dendrite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backfill no longer uses the request context for persisting events, which was resulting in us failing to store those events sometimes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite stripped state from the sync API now includes the stripped invite itself, so that Element Web can display who sent the invite properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The signing key fetch mechanism no longer gives up if it is unable to fetch specific keys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling of invalid display name or avatar URLs in membership events has been improved</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved a little:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 80%, up from 79% last week</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone, this week we merged the federation branch into master. It's not ready to be used properly yet, but we're merging it as it seems stable enough for now. We also improved performance of the federation branch a lot by turning off debug logs.</p>
<p>Other news:</p>
<ul>
<li>I opened two issues on element-ios which currently break register and login support on Conduit, making it completely unusable. Hopefully they can be resolved soon (https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3736, https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/3737)</li>
<li>I'm working on an MSC for threading. It's still WIP, but you can take a look here: https://demo.codimd.org/s/SykbuAUwP</li>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/stonking">Stonking</a> week for Synapse as we landed sharded event persisters and deployed to matrix.org. This is the last significant component other than the main process to go through the sharding process and a major hurdle in horizontal scalability of Synapse.</p>
<p>Initial results look good with event persistence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex">apdex</a> improving, however we think there are still some significant performance improvements available through configuration and will continue to experiment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We also moved off background processes from the main process. This is significant because it means that while the main process is not shardable it really doesn‚Äôt do anything anymore other than orchestration.</p>
<p>Again the initial impact looks very promising and we will continue to tune. Having moved the background processes away it also makes profiling the main process that much easier.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small bit of news I wanted to talk about from Bridge Island. My <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8437">implementation</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> has been merged which means appservices / bridges can now listen in for incoming presence, typing and read receipt events! This means that the Slack bridge can now reliably send your typing status to Slack, and Bifrost can reliably bridge your everything to XMPP. The MSC is still in flux and could change, but for now this could really improve the native feeling of bridges :)</p>
<p>(Oh and I should mention anyone using matrix-appservice-bridge v2.2.0+ can use this behaviour for free)</p>

<h3 id="mautrix-python-implements-half-shot-s-new-features">mautrix-python implements Half-Shot's new features</h3>
<p>Hot on his heels, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been adding support for the MSCs Half-Shot implemented in Synapse to my bridges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enabling end-to-bridge encryption now uses appservice login (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2778">MSC2778</a>), which means setting up the shared secret login module is no longer required for e2be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mautrix-python has support for receiving ephemeral events via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> in a branch, which will be merged once Synapse v1.22 is released. After it's merged, <code>/sync</code>ing with double puppets will no longer be necessary to bridge ephemeral events.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these will also be implemented in mautrix-go/whatsapp soon.</p>
<p>Now I just need Half-Shot to make synapse send to-device events to appservices, after which bridges won't need any hacky <code>/sync</code>ing at all.</p>

<p>Several releases this week (0.1.11 to 0.1.15) with lots of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>url-based navigation has landed! All navigation in the app is now done through urls, meaning you can also bookmark any UI state (e.g. grid configurations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed 2 memory leaks (exposed now because you can unload your session without refreshing the page)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixed an issue with libolm running out of memory if you send a message to more than 44 devices (see issue #150).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some logical additions now we have url navigation: restoring the last url when opening the app with the default route, and a button to close your session and go back to the picker.</p>

<p>the app now blocks concurrent access to the same session from different tabs (it just closes the session in the non-active tab). This will prevent multiple syncs tripping over each other writing to indexeddb (e.g. ConstraintErrors and friends).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>updates are announced in the app (for now through a confirm dialog, but will use an in app notification once we have it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fixes updates not installing on iOS, by having an update prompt. To get this update on iOS though, you'll need to unpin the app, and pinning it again. You'll need to login again after this. All future updates should be installable through the update prompt once you have 0.1.15 though, you won't have to do this again normally.</p>

<p>We are currently preparing the release of the version 1.0.9 of Element Android, which contain searching messages in clear rooms and a lots of other improvements and new features.</p>
<p>The SDK 1.0.9 will also be released, with an updated readme, and a brand new sample app, written by Ganfra. It will help developers to start using the new SDK and can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2-sample">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2-sample</a>. This sample app is able to let the user connects to an existing account on any homeserver with password login, display the room list, display a room timeline and send message to a room.

<blockquote>
<p>I published the first preview of my Sailfish client called Konheko. While you can run Android applications on Sailfish, they usually are a subpar experience, since they really don't fit the platforms design and style and also usually don't properly send notifications.</p>
<p>So about a year ago I started working on a Matrix client for SailfishOS, but I never really made much progress. Well, last weekend I did, and so it can now send plain text messages as well as various forms of media messages, I made a basic application icon and I've been using it this week already (for unencrypted rooms).</p>
<p>It is still missing a lot of features, but if you want you can install it from <a href="https://openrepos.net/content/deepbluev7/konheko">OpenRepos</a>. Sources are available <a href="https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/konheko">here</a>. Just be aware, that it currently stores all messages in RAM, so every restart will take forever to load your rooms and it may run out of RAM at some point. Storing messages in some database will come at some point. Also, a lot of menus may lead nowhere, since those are just placeholders for me atm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently, I tweaked Element-web to feature a few changes similar to SchildiChat for Android.</p>
<p>For now, it's probably best seen rather as a proof-of-concept than a finished product, as there are still some layout bugs, and no settings available for the added features (I know some people prefer separate lists for direct and group chats).
I consider it usable though.</p>
<p>Particular changes compared to upstream Element-web include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A common section for groups and direct chats in the overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message bubbles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bigger items in the room overview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A different dark theme, similar to SchildiChat for Android</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know how much I will work on this in the future, but I figured it might be interesting to share either way. Maybe even someone with more web-development skills than me might want to help improving it :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/08/dendrite-is-entering-beta">has officially entered beta</a>!</p>
<p>It aims to be an efficient, reliable and scalable alternative to Synapse.</p>
<p>We encourage early adopters to try it out starting with v0.1.0 in Monolith/Postgres mode.</p>
<p>Dendrite supports a large amount of the Matrix spec including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All room versions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E2E encryption (but not cross-signing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation</p>

<li>
<p>and many others!</p>

<p>We'll be hard at work in the coming weeks ironing out any issues that crop up as Dendrite enters the global</p>
<p>federation of Matrix servers. At present, Dendrite has not been optimised for memory/CPU usage, nor does it
fully support sharding, so there is still much scope to improve the already impressive resource usage whilst</p>
<p>heading towards 100% spec compliance.</p>
<p>Spec compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 77%, same as last week</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week I worked on a new feature: the Admin Room. This is a room that is automatically created for the first user of a new homeserver. This room will be used to send warnings to server admins in the future and can be used to control Conduit (like querying information, running cleanup, banning servers, hiding public rooms or restarting Conduit). Power levels can be used to control who in the room has access to which commands. The admin room will work over federation, so it's easy to help someone fix his server.</p>
<p>Other news:</p>

<li>
<p>Federation is now disabled by default and can be enabled in the config</p>

<p>After a long and sometimes painful journey we plan to run sharded event persisters on matrix.org from Monday. All being well we will start running background processes on their own worker to free up the main process.
These two projects combined should noticeably improve performance of matrix.org and any large scale deployments.</p>
<p>Aside from that we are continuing to work on room knocking as a feature and have been considering ways to reduce load attributable to state resolution.</p>
<p>We will also dust off the notifications project.</p>

<p>FluffyChat now runs on native Linux desktop (x86).</p>
<p>You can download Linux tarballs from the CI and run them on any system which has sqlite3 installed (which all distros may have). If you have libolm3 installed, you can also use e2ee.
Oh and by the way. Its NOT electron or any html5 stuff! Its a native Linux app.

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we finally cleaned up the remaining parts of Chethans GSoC work and merged it. This means Nheko now has partial support for cross-signing. You can either start the verification from another client or when viewing the profile of a user. There are a few things still missing though:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko does not use the verification status at all at the moment. So while you can verify your master key and let others verify your master key, from Nhekos perspective there is not much benefit yet. You will however show up with a green checkmark in other clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While nheko supports verifying your own master key and after that will also let others verify your master key, it does not yet download the self and user signing keys. This means you won't be able to upload cross-signing signatures for your own devices and other users master keys yet. I'll see if I can implement in the next weeks or so (since literally only the private key download or sharing is missing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko can't bootstrap cross-signing yet. This means you need to bootstrap it from Element or another client once. That will probably take a bit until this is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UX is still WIP. Currently it shows a lot of unnecessary buttons, that are a bit confusing as well as not enough green checkmarks, so that needs some work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things that happened in the mean time or are work in progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decryption errors should be reduced by a bit now. This is still work in progress though. With device trust landed now, we should be able to do automatic key requests, sharing and key backup soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lurkki is currently cleaning up the design of the built in video player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manu_kamath is improving the design when showing images at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LorenDB has been updating our screenshots and working on an Esperanto translation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trilene has been ever busy improving edge cases around the Voip support in Nheko.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So far Hacktoberfest seems to be going well with quite a few people trying to clean up some of the rougher edges in Nheko. If you are using Nheko and think some things could be better, why not try to fix it yourself? October is the perfect time for that!</p>
<p>Featurework of this cycle is also slowly nearing its end. Once cross-signing, voip and the new event store are stable, we plan to improve the UX a bit more as well as some other annoyances and maybe we can do a new release then! A nice and spooky Hacktober everyone!</p>

<p><a href="https://fossil.nil.im/objmatrix">ObjMatrix</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ObjFW/ObjMatrix">GitHub</a>) is a new Matrix client library written in modern Objective-C for <a href="https://objfw.nil.im/">ObjFW</a>. Because it uses ObjFW, it is not limited to Apple platforms, and instead is <a href="https://objfw.nil.im/doc/trunk/PLATFORMS.md">extremely portable</a> and should run on basically everything.</p>
<p>This is currently in its very early stages and is intended to be suitable to develop bots and clients with very soon. Being suitable to develop bridges with it is another goal for later.</p>
<p>Since ObjFW also works on platforms that are usually hard to support or port software to (e.g. <a href="https://www.morphos-team.net/">MorphOS</a>), this will hopefully also bring clients for these less mainstream operating systems. I'm especially hopeful about MorphOS here, since ObjFW already runs quite well there (parts of it are included with the OS even!), and hardware on which MorphOS runs on is usually not powerful enough to run Element Web. And eventually, I will want to have a Matrix client on my Amiga, too üòâ (which this should enable).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite is nearing beta! Today we will be cutting a candidate 0.1.0rc1 version after a week of hunting and fixing bugs. We are on track to release version 0.1.0 next week, at which point we will be inviting people to try installing and using Dendrite!</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initial sync is fixed after a bug caused us to fall back on incremental sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP header is now handled properly when MIME-formatted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal API calls over HTTP in polylith mode now use their own HTTP client with higher timeouts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite now tries harder to find missing auth events, using fetcher workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite no longer falls back on <code>/state</code> unnecessarily, which was the cause of a major memory leak and high CPU usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation HTTP calls now include the <code>User-Agent</code> header</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The event <code>depth</code> field is now ignored in the federation API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We now report the password change capability properly (thanks <a href="https://github.com/bn4t">bn4t</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registration flows now include the <code>completed</code> field after a failure (thanks <a href="https://github.com/Lesterpig">Lesterpig</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug in the previous event updater in the roomserver has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where we didn't check our own old verify keys when verifying event signatures is fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug where we didn't handle event ID domains being different to the event origin in earlier room versions has been fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLS fingerprints have been removed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 77%, same as last week</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, we updated some of our documentation and created a whole new set of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">easy first issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted">medium to hard issues</a> for contributors.</p>

<h3 id="the-construct">The Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jason:zemos.net">Jason</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix Construct supports aarch64 (ARMv8) architectures. The experience has been phenomenal, with performance exceeding all expectations. Last week I wrote about all new vector code inside Construct using SSE through AVX-512 hardware acceleration in servers; that same code is now accelerated by SVE (Scalable Vector Extensions) on ARM architectures when you compile with clang.</p>
<p>This result is important: ARM virtual machines are offered at a significantly lower price compared to x86 from the same vendor. The systems are cheaper, require less power, but generally perform worse. The trick is to optimize the software for the weaker hardware. The benefit allows, for example, Matrix server hosts running Construct to make th eir profit margin from the lower TCO, getting more out of every computing cycle.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made a Signal bridge using <a href="https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald">signald</a>.</p>
<p>Currently it supports bridging messages, reactions and signal read receipts. End-to-bridge encryption also exists (mautrix-python does all the work there). The bridge can be linked as a secondary device and possibly even registered as the main device, but I didn't actually test registering yet. Setup instructions are currently somewhat non-existent, but it's mostly the same as my other bridges plus signald as a separate daemon.</p>

<p>Element Android: Version 1.0.8 is now available on the stores, it fixes issues with verification and PIN code among other issues (see <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/releases/tag/v1.0.8">https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/releases/tag/v1.0.8</a> for more details). Now we are working on improving performance when sending messages to rooms, and also improving global UX, especially of the home (rooms list). Search messages (in clear rooms for the moment) is coming soon, and it will be also possible to filter the room members list.</p>
<p>We will also spend some time on the new Android SDK, https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2, which is for the moment a quick extract of what we have in Element Android. We have to take care of it as a real product now: document it properly, set up CI, export Javadoc, develop a sample app, etc.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Signature verification has been updated to not fail if the event <code>origin</code> field is missing (although it still requires a signature from the domain of the <code>sender</code> field)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of places where we use SQL transactions have been updated with safe wrappers (thanks <a href="https://github.com/samcday">samcday</a>!)</p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/22/synapse-1-20-0-released">1.20.0</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.20.1">1.20.1</a>) highlights include shadow banning support and including unread message counts in the sync response. This will help client developers and is a precursor to improving notification support.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also been looking at adding monitoring to get a better sense of which rooms are most expensive from a state resolution perspective, we also want a better way to track federation lag.</p>
<p>Up next we‚Äôll move all background tasks away from the main process and try it out on matrix.org, we are hoping for a 10-15% saving in CPU. Event persistence sharding, specifically the new stream token format is on hold slightly while we work on a nasty race condition on start up of the event persister. We hope to get back to the main sharding project next week.</p>

<h3 id="the-construct">The Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jason:zemos.net">Jason</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix concludes a summer of Construct where several transformative rounds of optimization took place. I'd like to talk about these achievements and why they are important for
future directions.</p>
<p>Over the summer, Construct introduced new vector extensions to the project. As server software, our primary target is the datacenter which (for now) is dominated by x86 hardware. The latest features of x86 chips include AVX-2, AVX-512, and on-die GPU. These advancements are important because they help mitigate current limitations of hardware, such as the cubic relationship between a processor's frequency and its power consumption. These limitations mean that CPU cores aren't completing more cycles-per-second every iteration of their development -- they're not getting much faster.</p>
<p>The problem with threads is that they can introduce a lot of complications to a project. Construct is able to forego multi-threading as a network server because it is primarily IO-bound. The benefits to a single-thread design in both performance and simplicity cannot be overstated. This is why Construct stands to benefit the most from features which allow more work to be accomplished at every individual computing cycle.</p>
<p>Construct undertook several endeavors over the summer which directly leverage platforms featuring SSE, AVX, AVX-512, etc. As an added bonus, our approach is designed to effortlessly port to ARM's Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) as it becomes available (inside datacenters too!). Our focus has been JSON, Unicode, and finally Base64. Detailed explanations for each of these will need to be discussed in their own posts, but in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Matrix specifies a canonical form of JSON which is not necessarily the same as the JSON the server receives. Therefor it is imperative that Construct is liberal with what JSON it accepts and correct with its transformation into canonical JSON. Over the summer, a portion of Construct's canonical transform received some optimization to go beyond the default method of character-by-character read-modify-write. As seen in [1], a streaming hardware-accelerated transform now processes at least 16 characters at a time (with more possible) without forward branching except for the parts where transformation needs to occur. One of these transformations is UTF-16 to UTF-8 surrogate conversion, which leads into the second endeavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construct introduced a completely branch-free Unicode toolset in [2]. Among the functions offered is a custom transform of UTF-16 surrogate pairs to UTF-8 sequences. Using the new vector registers, Construct can transform two UTF-16 surrogates in parallel to output two UTF-8 sequences, or two UTF-16 surrogates in a pair to output one UTF-8 sequence. Unfortunately, these specific functions were written at fixed vector widths, so more work needs to be done to really take advantage of the widest hardware. Each surrogate is 6 bytes, and a surrogate pair is 12 bytes; therefor we cannot make use of the last 4 bytes of a 16 byte vector. However, with a little more work this approach can be extended to a 64 byte vector, capable of decoding 5 surrogate pairs and 10 individual surrogates in parallel!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professor Daniel Lemire recently published a paper about fast Base64 from hardware acceleration in [3]. This approach is extremely elegant on the 64-byte-wide AVX-512 system. Prior to Construct's implementation of this in [4], the Boost library base64 encoding and decoding took roughly 20 and 25 cycles per character respectively. Our implementation on the same system, an old system with only SSE2 (not even AVX-512!) yields 5 and 6 cycles per character!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this helps lay a foundation for Construct to introduce Federated Media Rooms sometime in the future. Currently, Construct stores media in a separate database. Recently there's been work on a separate branch at [5] which stores actual file block inside events using Base64. It is for this reason sub-cycle and branchless JSON parsing and Base64 encoding is essential for maximum performance. The result is worthwhile, as the latency for querying the media database is slower than parsing and decoding the event content already in-hand.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Construct is available at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct</a> and don't forget to idle and perform <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:maunium.net">#construct:maunium.net</a></p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I present you a new project I've been working on for some time. It's a bot that allows you to use the admin API through matrix, by typing commands to the bot. The inspiration comes from the OperServ-like bots that allow IRC operators to administrate an IRC server.</p>
<p>The bot exposes some of the available admin APIs and aims to provide some more high level commands by combining different APIs. There is currently one &quot;high level command&quot;, <code>!room garbage-collect</code>, which allow you to purge from your HS all rooms without local users.</p>
<p>The project is written in crystal and is my first project in this language. It should be stable in normal conditions, but don't hesitate to fill issues. A Docker image is provided for more convenience.</p>

<p>Please note that this is independent of any matrix client - you don't even need to run one to be able to use this!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked whether an <a href="https://bubu1.eu/openpush/">OpenPush</a>-like solution be
built on top of this , and Sorunome responded that someone had already
started working on just that! https://github.com/gotify/android/pull/115</p>
<p>This would allow other matrix clients on your phone to get their push
notifications through your gotify client, instead of needing to run a process
each. Great for battery life without proprietary Google blobs!</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the setup is a cigarette lighter to 2x 230V converter, one being used to power the RockPro64, the other being used to power my notebook. My notebook is connected to the hotspot from my phone, while also being connected to a USB ethernet, the other end of which is plugged into the RockPro64. </p>
<p>The notebook then acts as a gateway, as well as SSHing to a tiny VPS with -R, to get a public port, and forwarding that traffic to the RockPro64.</p>

<p>I have been through the perils of setting up a TURN server and having VoIP continue to fail, whilst spending hours scratching my head and staring at Wireshark without getting anywhere. When I was given free reign over project choice last year during my internship, I chose to start a tool that tests your homeserver's VoIP configuration, hoping it would be useful to both me and the community at large.</p>
<p>It saw some progress but I never managed to iron out some of the 'last few things' or put a pretty front on it ‚Äî until about 2 weeks ago, when I got some more time to do it.</p>
<p>There are known issues ‚Äî such as the scores being very arbitrary, wrong and misleading; it crashes Chromium every time (on my machine) and it completely misbehaves in Brave Browser (on my machine). It may also not be the prettiest (but hopefully it is at least somewhat inoffensive). I hope to work on these annoying issues soon.</p>
<p>I have deployed a test instance at <a href="https://test.voip.librepush.net">https://test.voip.librepush.net</a> ‚Äî it can be tried in a WebRTC-supporting browser (probably Firefox if you want half a chance). Please don't take it to heart if you get a Fail or Poor score ‚Äî it's probably not your fault. :)</p>

<p>Oliver was interning with us at Element this Summer. Fixing up and releasing
this VoIP tester was part of it, but he's still working on it in his spare
time even though his internship has finished :)</p>
<p>Through this I found out that I forgot to turn on my turnserver on my
homeserver again. Thanks Oliver!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome back! This week we made some groundbreaking progress - this is not a joke, we found a bug in Synapse while breaking multiple Matrix rooms, causing the Matrix team a lot of unnecessary stress. Let me explain:
The good news is that Conduit is starting to federate now. This means that you should be able to join all public rooms of the Matrix network and exchange messages. Note that Conduit does not do all the checks it should be doing yet making it stop sending messages from time to time as well as that advanced features like loading the history, syncing temporary data like read receipts or accepting invites are not implemented yet.</p>
<p>The bad news is that, while Synapse is happy to accept Conduit's messages when it is already part of the room, joining into one of the rooms Conduit servers are part of didn't work because of an event validation bug. The Matrix team did an excellent job at fixing this bug and releasing a Synapse patch the same day, but the damage has been done making a few rooms inaccessible to old Synapse servers.
Thanks to everyone who supports me on &quot;Liberapay&quot; (https://liberapay.com/timokoesters) or Bitcoin!</p>

<p>Hey bridge developer enthusiasts! Myself and ChristianP (bridge crew of matrix.org) have been working hard on freshening up the matrix-appservice-bridge library.

<p>Hi encryption fans. This week the bridge team has been churning away at adding support for encrypted rooms in the <code>matrix-appservice-bridge</code> library, to enable support in <code>matrix-appservice-irc</code>, <code>matrix-appservice-slack</code>, and anyone else using the library. This is probably the most exciting feature the library has seen in a long time! </p>
<p>The feature will be a simple config toggle, so existing bridges will have to do very little work to support it.</p>
<p>The first phase plans to use <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a> with bridge users syncing like real users, but eventually the hope is that this will be all built into the library.

<li>
<p>Add a <strong>system tray icon</strong>.</p>
<p>A left click will bring up the Mirage window, 
middle will quit the application and right will show a menu with these </p>
<p>options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>closeMimizesToTray</code> setting to the config file, defaults to <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Controls whether closing the Mirage window will leave it running in the 
system tray, or fully quit the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a discrete <strong>read marker indicator</strong> to messages, shows how many people </p>
<p>have this event as their last seen one in the room.<br />
A way to see who read the message and when will be added in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: add <code>chat.message.localEcho</code> and <code>chat.message.readCounter</code> color properties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>zoom</code> setting, defaults to <code>1.0</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a <code>lexicalRoomSorting</code> setting, to sort rooms by their name instead of</p>
<p>recent activity.<br />
A restart is needed to apply changes to this setting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restrict Mirage to a single instance per config folder, trying to launch a</p>
<p>new window will instead focus the existing one.<br />
The <code>MIRAGE_CONFIG_DIR</code> and <code>MIRAGE_DATA_DIR</code> environment variables can be</p>
<p>set to run different &quot;profiles&quot; in parallel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the visible lag when opening a chat page, switching rooms should be </p>
<p>a lot smoother</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When using the <code>focusPreviousMessage</code> and <code>focusNextMessage</code> keybinds, if no</p>
<p>message is focused and the timeline has been scrolled up, 
focus the message in the center of the view instead of returning to the </p>
<p>bottom of the timeline and focusing the last one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't re-center the room list on clicks by default.</p>
<p>This prevents the list from jumping around every time a room is selected.<br />

<p>Element Android 1.0.7 has been released (still stuck in Google pipes writing those lines), and will be quickly followed by 1.0.8 to fix a problem with cross signing verification.</p>
<p>We are working to implement search of messages in a room and we keep on fighting bugs and improving performance of the application.</p>
<p>We are also iterating on the home screen, to improve user experience, and try to satisfy users with a few rooms as well as users with several hundreds of rooms.</p>

<p>Hemppa the bot is a multi-purpose Matrix bot for writing new functionality easily with Python. </p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cos:hacklab.fi">Cos</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hemppa gained a small but big feature for making fediverse better: per-room Mastodon tooting support. This means that you can set up a Mastodon account in your room and anyone with moderator rights can toot to that account. This way you and your roommates can super easily send toots to the world directly from Matrix. Mastodon (unlike the big alternative) supports RSS feeds out of the box so it's very easy to subscribe to users and hashtags with stock RSS bot.  Toot #hemppathebot if you like it! Another new contribution worth mentioning is welcome which can send welcome messages to users registering on the server or joining a room. <a href="https://github.com/vranki/hemppa">https://github.com/vranki/hemppa</a></p>

<p>We fixed a bug where federation endpoints expected access tokens instead of server signatures for authentication. In the future, we may add an API that requires signatures on requests.</p>

<p>Normally the ping shows how long other servers take to receive the sending-server's message. Some servers receive it quickly, some take hours. All this flows into the statistic of the sending server. I wrote a small program that's the other way around. Instead of measuring the sending-server's ping, it associates each measurement with an echo-bot (instead of the sending server), so this plot shows which maubots are the fastest to respond (it's probably not accurate at all, because most of the pings were started on conduit servers this week, but it's interesting nevertheless):</p>

<p>Released 0.0.36 with end-to-end encryption enabled! üéâ<br />
Most of this week was spent on performance improvements for IE11, where asm.js runs quite slow. Decryption is run in parallel on 4 workers in that browser, giving a massive speed-up and added responsiveness (the UI would freeze for 7 seconds when opening a room prior to this). There is still some polishing to do on sharing room keys, which I will get to next week, but all in all, it should work well. Next week I also want to get started on supporting key backup, so you can also read your encrypted history from before you logged in.</p>

<p>Element v1.0.6 has been merged into SchildiChat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, following Schildi-specific fixes and improvements are included in the latest update:</p>

<li>
<p>Fixed message bubbles clipping italic text</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less wasted bubble space in some scenarios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deleted messages are now hidden by default in the chat overview</p>

Then, we started to update room creation flows with new icons and behaviors for creation buttons and a new screen for room creation.</p>

<h3 id="maunium-sticker-picker">Maunium sticker picker</h3>
<p>This isn't strictly a client, but it's in the clients section.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting stuff into the spec or even implemented in Elements is very slow, so while we wait for proper native sticker packs and pickers (i.e. not in an iframe/webview), I decided to make a better sticker picker widget: <a href="https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker">https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker</a></p>
<p>The goal is to be as fast and simple as possible. The picker and sticker packs are just some static files that can be served anywhere (no compilation required). It doesn't require self-hosting anything except said static files, and it has been confirmed to work on all three Elements.</p>
<p>There's a Telegram import script that's used to reupload stickers to Matrix and generate the static sticker pack files that the picker widget uses. It's technically also possible to make the sticker pack files yourself, but there's no easy way to do that yet.</p>
<p>Due to the simplicity of the picker there's no authentication, which also means everyone sees the same sticker packs. One way to get around that limitation is to have a unique URL for each user. I'll probably write a bot to manage copies of the picker for multiple users in the future.</p>
<p>Other future improvements include remembering frequently used stickers (surprisingly, all three Elements keep localStorage for widgets), importing Telegram animated stickers and searching for stickers by emoji/name</p>
</blockquote>
<p>later more words appeared from Tulir:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the initial announcement, my sticker picker has received some more features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a slider to configure the number of stickers shown per row</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequently used stickers now show up at the top</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imported all the packs from Scalar (the default integration manager)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A model of productivity, Tulir also announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>my sticker picker has dark theme support too now</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Erik has made an initial, naive implementation of a sharded Event Persister worker - the non-sharded version currently being one of the biggest bottlenecks on matrix.org right now. It still needs a bit of polish to be production ready, and Sytest will need some updating to support testing it, but otherwise progress is looking good!</p>
<p>Brendan is polishing his unread counts implementations, while Rich is writing up the push rules replacement tech in an MSC. Rich has also been optimizing the device code in Synapse to both simplify the code, as well as cut down on unnecessary device data being sent over federation.</p>
<p>Patrick has finished converting Synapse's database code to be fully async! This has the benefit of making profiling the matrix.org Synapse process much more sane, and we're already starting to find a few little places where Synapse is burning CPU unnecessarily! Now, Synapse won't be fully async'd until Twisted itself is, and we drop support for older Twisted versions that aren't, which is not <em>soon</em>. However the majority of the code that developers touch and that is executed being async has massive benefits either way üôÇ</p>
<p>Andrew has been working on having a confirmation pop up after users click the link in their email, to help prevent phishing scams. He's also trying to finally make Synapse spec-compliant in accepting identifier dictionaries during user-interactive authentication.</p>
<p>Olivier has been continuing to help Synapse recover missed messages better after it has been offline for an extended period of time, as well as various fixes to push. </p>

<p>Roomserver input events are now handled in FIFO order with per-room workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roomserver input, query and perform packages are now split up nicely</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federation sender and keyserver now delay some startup tasks to allow the HTTP listeners to start more quickly</p>

Editing old messages also supported: for example zabbix can send UID problem to this service and it is will edit old &quot;problem message&quot; to &quot;problem resolved&quot;.</p>

<p>Ditto development is back from hiatus! </p>
<p>I'm currently in the process of rebuilding Ditto - partly to incorporate rn-matrix, and partly to support a WEB VERSION </p>
<p>The new repo can be found <a href="https://gitlab.com/ditto-chat/ditto">here (https://gitlab.com/ditto-chat/ditto)</a> (there's a new repo mostly because getting react-native-web to play nicely with the rest of the app was a challenge, to say the least)</p>
<p>As a sneak peek, enjoy <a href="https://ditto-test.netlify.app">this rough version (https://ditto-test.netlify.app)</a> of Ditto for web :) </p>
<p>Expect to see what I'm calling Ditto's 2.0.0 drop on TestFlight and Google Play in a few weeks.</p>

<p>Lurkki added an emoji completer to the message area! This was a super requested feature and it is pretty awesome, that someone picked this up and implemented it! This means you can finally write <code>:fire:</code> and have it expand to üî•! Seems like this will also lead to a few more improvements to our other completers down the line (user, room, etc completions), so thank you very much Lurkki!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've been mostly reviewing PRs this week (and trying to get some other work in line, like MSCs, synapse stuff, etc). With this hopefully Chethans work on cross-signing will be merged soon, which will give us most of the building blocks to have cross-signing in Nheko (his work is basically only missing Secure Secret Storage and Sharing). We hope to fix the few remaining build issues in the next week or so.</p>

<li>
<p>On the side I have been cleaning some UI stuff to simplify our room settings dialog and allow advanced users to hide/show certain event types in the timeline. This will probably take a bit more time to be finished though.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has mostly been focused on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/milestone/8">beta milestone tasks</a> and bug fixes. Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Joining rooms which the server already belongs to when invited by a user from another homeserver is now significantly faster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client API no longer refers to the device DB directly, instead using the new user API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of locking issues have been fixed in the federation sender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>/join</code> endpoint now accepts <code>?server_name=...</code> query parameters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device list updater now obeys the backoff period and blacklisted status from the federation sender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uploaded media will no longer be truncated to 0 bytes when <code>max_file_size_bytes</code> option is set to 0 (for unlimited)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media API now correctly cleans up temporary directories when errors occur</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media API now returns unique media IDs and metadata when multiple users upload the same file, whilst maintaining deduplication on disk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rejecting invites over federation multiple times should now work properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redactions are now permanent and are committed to the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some caches have been added to the roomserver for room IDs, state key IDs and event type IDs to reduce pressure on the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The redaction endpoint is now spec-compliant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some places where global errors were overwritten have been fixed (thanks oliverpool!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some state key checks in the roomserver membership updaters have now been tidied up (thanks oliverpool!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 55%, up from 54% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 70%, down from 71% last week due to a single flakey test</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This week Erik has been working on sharding the Event Persister worker as we aim further for horizontal scalability for Synapse. Some of the complication comes from ensuring that sysadmin's don't misconfigure things where multiple event persisters persist events in the same room.</p>

<p>Patrick has been continuing on the async/await train and has just submitted the final PR which async's our <code>runInteraction</code> method - the one that most database calls go through. Synapse is nearly 100% async! He's also been submitting a flurry of shadow ban PRs, which will be another powerful tool for moderation.</p>
<p>Brendan and Rich are continuing to work on the Notifications rewrite, with Brendan finishing up unread counts, and Rich polishing up designs for the new replacement for push rules.</p>
<p>Andrew (<em>who dat? - ed.</em>) is continuing to work on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">knocking MSC</a> and has fleshed out the CS and SS details. There are still some open questions though, so please give feedback if you notice anything off!</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A multi-account Matrix client that allows you to authorize webapps to access parts of your account, designed with collaboration in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the webapp I've been talking about for a while that allows webpages limited access to your account. Currently, apps can view the name, avatar, alias, and type of a room that's been opened with the app, and that's just about it.</p>
<p>The big interesting thing about mxapps right now is the architecture. Just about all of the logic is running in a shared worker. This means that you can duplicate as many tabs as you want and it will all act as the same client. It also has multi-account support.</p>
<p>Features coming ~soon~ at some point will be full state event support and easy-to-follow docs on how to make an app, plus Vue plugins to make development really easy.</p>
<p>You can checkout the live version on <a href="https://mxapps.kb1rd.net/">mxapps.kb1rd.net</a>, but it is a bit useless...</p>
<p>There are some work-in-progress docs on the structure on <a href="https://docs.mxapps.kb1rd.net/">docs.mxapps.kb1rd.net</a></p>
<p>I'll post an example app in a bit ;)</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@miruka:privacytools.io">miruka</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small 0.6.2 release this week, mostly bug fixes:</p>
<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When replying to a message, you can now press enter without entering any</p>
<p>text to send it directly (useful to &quot;forward&quot; a message).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending a file while replying to a message will create a pseudo-reply,</p>
<p>consisting of an &quot;In reply to&quot; text message with no body, followed by the
actual file event.</p>
<p>This is a workaround to the reply restrictions imposed by the Matrix spec.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Composer aliases cannot contain whitespace anymore.</strong></p>
<p>This includes spaces, hard tabs or newline characters.
If an alias from your config still has whitespace, only the first word</p>
<p>will be taken into account (ignoring any leading or trailing space).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faster server browser loading, now gathers all needed data with a</p>
<p>single request instead of one for each server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-focus the &quot;Join&quot; button on invited room pages</p>
<p>((Shift+)Tab can be used to navigate between buttons)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-focus the &quot;Forget&quot; button on left room pages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes: modify <code>chat.message.styleSheet</code> to add some spacing between HTML </p>
<p>list items, see
<a href="https://github.com/mirukana/mirage/commit/48663ae8465e90646855435b47b89c01395ae4d9">48663ae</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fixed">Fixed</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix @username autocompletion closing if there's more than one character</p>
<p>after the @</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the partial text from IME (input method editors) and touch screen </p>
<p>autocompleting keyboards and for username autocompletion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reset IME state upon autocompleting a username</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix clicking on autocompletion list user not making the username a mention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix UI freezing when mentioning user lacking a display name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix mentioning users with blank display name (e.g. only spaces), mention</p>
<p>them by their user ID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix text fields/areas unable to be focused on touch screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix random chance of profile retrieval requests failing if one of the logged</p>
<p>in account doesn't federate with other servers (e.g. localhost synapse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix composer text saved to disk for the wrong account if that text begins</p>
<p>by an account alias</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Servers can potentially return an outdated member list for rooms on initial </p>
<p>sync, which is one of the possible cause of &quot;Members not synced&quot; error for 
encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>When loading the full room list, discard members from the initial sync list
that are absent from the full list.</p>
<p>For those not using the AppImage or Flatpak, this fix requires <strong>matrix-nio 0.15.1</strong> or later to take effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When erasing an account alias inside the composer, send a </p>
<p>&quot;x isn't typing anymore&quot; notification corresponding to that account </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix potential 403 error on chat pages for invited rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start loading room history immediately when the room join state changes,</p>
<p>e.g. when clicked &quot;Join&quot; for an invited room page.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Released 0.0.34 this week with some fixes to the room list sorting and fixing several crashes. If you clear your session, it will also sort low priority rooms at the bottom of the room list, even if unread, making it a bit more usable until we add more UX refinements to the room list. </p>
<p>Most of the effort this week however has gone into working on end-to-end encryption, having investigated using the rust-sdk for a couple of days, and now looking into a custom implementation based on libolm. This is well on its way with key upload working and device tracking nearing completion.</p>

<p>I just merged the new event store a few days ago. This means Nheko now doesn't keep messages in RAM! Everything is stored on disk and mapped into memory from disk. This may reduce memory usage a tiny bit, but may increase latency while scrolling a bit. Try it out and give your feedback!</p>
<p>For the developers reading this, I collected some ramblings on my blog here: <a href="https://blog.neko.dev/posts/nhekos-event-store-v2.html">https://blog.neko.dev/posts/nhekos-event-store-v2.html</a> . Yes, I designed that site when I was like 15, I know the dark theme is a bit too much... Just use Firefox and the alternate stylesheet for light mode! Anyway, I'm very interested to hear how other clients implement their event stores!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we have largely been working on bug fixes and performance issues.</p>
<p>Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The room server now handles input events for multiple rooms in parallel when running with PostgreSQL, which helps a lot with perceived latency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Device key queries now obey federation backoffs, so that we don't spend a lot of time making unnecessary requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key server now only emits changes for <code>/users/devices</code> which reduces database hits significantly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client API now tries to guarantee message ordering on a per-user basis (thanks Anand!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federated invites are now more reliable and are performed synchronously</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite room metadata is now sent correctly in all cases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting and rejecting invites is also now much more reliable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed that caused excessive memory usage in the sync API (bringing the memory usage of my own instance down to less than 100mb)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A massive amount of work has been done to reduce database locks in SQLite mode across the entire codebase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some unnecessary code has been removed from the roomserver updaters</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-Server APIs: 54%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-Server APIs: 71%, up from 70% last week</p>

<p>On the sharding side the last big milestone is to get the event persister to shard. I know this comes up every week, but we now have a rough working implementation for non-backfilled events. Next steps are to get backfill working, get the tests passing, go through review and then ship. I asked Erik if it would be live on matrix.org within 2 weeks. He didn‚Äôt say, at least I didn‚Äôt hear him say no‚Ä¶&gt;
Aside from that Rich is working on the push rules redesign, the next steps are to design the APIs in more detail and then make a formal spec proposal. Brendan is also in notifications land and his work on room unread counts is going through final review. </p>
<p>Finally, Andrew has been working with Sorunome to dust off the knock feature, both on the spec and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6739">the Synapse side</a>.</p>

<p>Hello! Just recently I made public an SELinux policy module I developed for Synapse. This policy is one I developed early on during my trip down the SELinux rabbit hole, and I have been using it in production for some time. At the moment, this policy module is built for the Gentoo SELinux policy (not RHEL/CentOS/Fedora) and does not currently have systemd support, nor has it been tested in all environments, i.e. with workers. I am publishing this policy in the hopes that it will be useful and I am open to any contributions, even those to help tighten the policy if possible. Finally, I have also made public a policy module for coturn, which I am also using in my own personal environment under the same conditions. Both the <a href="https://github.com/0xC0ncord/synapse-selinux">Synapse</a> policy and the <a href="https://github.com/0xC0ncord/turnserver-selinux">coturn</a> policy can be found on Github.

</li>
<li>
<p>If the address doesn't have a <code>scheme://</code>, auto-detect whether the server
supports HTTPS or only HTTP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the .well-known API if possible to resolve domains to the actual 
homeserver's URL, e.g. <code>matrix.org</code> resolves to 
<code>https://matrix-client.matrix.org</code></p>

connected to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Room members autocompletion</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Type <code>@</code> followed by one or more characters in the composer, 
or one or more characters and hit (Shift+)Tab to trigger username/user ID
autocompletion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only autocompleted names will be turned into mentions, unlike before
where any word in a sent message that happened to be someone's name would 
mention them</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full image viewer</strong> for matrix image messages and URL previews:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click on a thumbnail in the timeline to open the image viewer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middle click on a thumbnail (or use the option in the context menu)
to open the image externally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Left click on the image (mouse only): expand to window size if the 
image's origin size is smaller than the window, 
else expand to original size</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap on the image (touch screen/pen only): reveal the info and button bars
when auto-hidden (bars will auto-hide only when they overlap with a big 
enough displayed image)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any mouse movement: reveal auto-hidden bars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double click on the image: toggle full screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middle click anywhere: open externally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right click anywhere: close the viewer, back to chat</p>
</li>

and GIF speed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New keyboard shortcuts are available for all these actions, 
see <code>keys.imageViewer</code> in the config file (will be automatically updated 
when you start Mirage 0.6.1)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <code>media.openExternallyOnClick</code> setting to swap the new
click and middle click on thumbnails behavior </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room and member filter fields now support (Shift+)Tab navigation, in addition
to Up/Down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a colored left border to the currently highlighted item in list views 
(e.g. room list, members list, etc) to improve visibility </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>controls.listView.highlightBorder</code> and
<code>controls.listView.highlightBorderThickness</code> properties (can be set to <code>0</code>)</li>
<li>Add the <code>chat.userAutoCompletion</code> section</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Use a cleaner icon for the &quot;Copy text&quot; entry</p>

<li>
<p>Replace the confusing broken &quot;Copy media address&quot; entry with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Copy media address: visible for non-encrypted media, always
copies the HTTP URL</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Using the <code>openMessagesLinksOrFiles</code> keybind on a reply will now ignore the
matrix.to links contained in the &quot;In reply to XYZ&quot; header</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pressing Ctrl+C to copy selected/highlighted non-encrypted media messages 
will copy their HTTP URL instead of the filename</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retry downloading image thumbnails if they fail with a 404 or 500+ server 
error (uploads sometimes take a few seconds to become available on the 
server)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-encrypted media messages are now always downloaded on click and opened
with a desktop application (or the image viewer), instead of
being opened in a browser</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compress thumbnails and clipboard images in a separate process, to avoid
blocking every other backend operation while the compression is running</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the level of optimization applied to clipboard images, 
the previous setting was too slow for large PNG (10MB+)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase applied scrolling velocity when using the 
<code>scrollPageUp</code>/<code>scrollPageDown</code> keybinds, now similar to how it was before
Mirage 0.6.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't catch SIGQUIT (Ctrl+\ in terminal) and SIGTERM signals, exit immediately</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slightly increase the top/bottom padding to the multi-account bar in the 
left pane</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>We wanted to take a little bit of time to show off a state resolution library for Ruma, courtesy of @DevinR528 and @Timo. Ruma has a new crate to make resolving state easier, <a href="https://github.com/ruma/state-res">state-res</a>! The goal of this crate is to be the base for federation, it provides the necessary utilities to resolve state, sort power events (reverse topological ordering), sort events (based on mainline depth), and a lot of event authentication functions. It is still in the early stages of development, but will be hopefully proved out in <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit">Conduit</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.19.0rc1">a new RC out</a>, edited highlights include</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>lots</em> of async/await changes, 27 separate PRs (thanks Patrick)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improved logging performance, this is in part to reduce IO but also to reduce the total amount logged. We‚Äôd be really interested to get some feedback on if the changes help. You may also want to take a look at our new logging defaults to see if they would help reduce total disk space usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further improvements to the Admin API allowing admin to optionally purge rooms on deletion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect 1.19.0 to land early next week.</p>
<p>Aside from that Erik has been continuing with sharding the event persister, this is a big job, so we‚Äôre still a little way off having something to ship, but I‚Äôll keep you updated.</p>
<p>Big news this week, after spending a good chunk of time trying to rework notifications to make the UX more intuitive, we have decided that the best (and only) way forward is to completely rethink how the push rules work. Rich is currently redesigning the whole thing, and once done we‚Äôll resume on the client side.</p>
<p>Having spent much of the past 3 months trying to improve the performance of large scale instances we will soon start looking at improving the out of the box experience for smaller installs and are in the early stages of thinking about what that might look like. I‚Äôll update more over time, but the two obvious use cases to target are</p>
<ul>
<li>Federating instance, with 1-5 users, resource constrained.</li>
<li>Federating instance with a few hundred users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our (relatively small) changes to logging in 1.19.0 are the first signs of this shift. We still need to ship event persistence sharding and also move more functionality from the main process (dependent on async/await), but once done it clears the way for new projects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, we've been silent for a bit, but that doesn't mean we haven't been busy, so I have a little bit of a bigger announcement to make today:</p>
<p>Trilene implemented voice call support in Nheko! We just merged this and you can try it out now!</p>
<p>Some caveats apply at the moment, but will be resolved in the near future:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Currently you will need to have a patched version of GStreamer. The current releases of GStreamer have a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-bad/-/issues/831">bug</a> when your turnserver uses a password, that contains a ':'. Since this is the default for coturn, I'm guessing this affects everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will need to build Nheko yourself. Currently we do not have GStreamer available in our CI pipeline, so we disabled support for voice calls in those builds (apart from the flatpak build, but that also needs some further validation and a new GStreamer release). We will release proper builds with VOIP support once GStreamer is actually released and available with the fixes we need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are still some other issues, when relying on a turnserver to connect a call. We will fix them one at a time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Big shoutout to trilene for implementing all of this! I can finally call people from Nheko, which is super awesome!</p>
<p>This was the first of the bigger features, that have been cooking for a while, in the near future we should also finish the new event store, which reduced memory usage and provides some kind of offline support, and Chethan will probably finish the first iteration of cross-signing soon too. After that we'll focus on the smaller features again. ;-)</p>

<h3 id="hydrogen">Hydrogen</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some regular readers might remember, in the past I've put a few entries here about a side-project called <a href="https://github.com/bwindels/brawl-chat/">Brawl</a>. Two weeks ago, we took Brawl and started building a new client on top of it code-named Hydrogen.</p>
<p>As the name implies, Hydrogen tries to be the lightest Element. It is written entirely in vanilla javascript (no React, no Webpack) for complete control, structured as an MVVM app, leveraging the raw performance of indexeddb. On huge accounts where Element-web uses up to 1GB of heap memory, Hydrogen sips away with a mere 15mb. It is very early days though, and Hydrogen has very little features: you can receive and send unencrypted messages and that's it.</p>
<p>Hydrogen also aims to support a wider range of browsers, from IE11 (particularly for orgs with locked-down machines) all the way to a fully featured PWA that works well on mobile. We should also be able to easily add progressive loading, which <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/2498">proved hard in the past</a>.</p>
<p>Another goal is to make it easy to embed parts of the app (like the room view) into another app or website. It could also be really nice to have a place to play and experiment with new tech for element proper - much as Dendrite has influenced Synapse.</p>
<p>As mentioned, it's early days, and lots of things are missing or broken, so <strong>please don't file any issues yet</strong>. Feel free to play around with it at <a href="https://hydrogen.element.io/">https://hydrogen.element.io/</a> though!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lots of exciting things happened in Ruma this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have officially implemented over half (18/31) of the Federation API endpoints!</li>
</ul>
<p>Special thanks to @agraven and @q-b!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We've added the only new endpoint from r0.6.1 of the C2S spec.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have begun work on adding support for borrowed types for requests. This
should reduce the memory allocations required for clients to send requests to</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>a server.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exported some macros to make creating custom endpoints and events that</li>
</ul>
<p>much easier.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jan.christian:gruenhage.xyz">JCG</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's news from ansible land! Ansible recently introduced a new packaging format, the &quot;collection&quot;, and we've now started moving our ansible content into collections. This means the matrix modules I twim'ed a few months back are now easier to install than ever before, and the synapse/element roles are included in there as well (thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madonius:entropia.de">madonius</a> for the contributions there). The roles have been regularly updated for a while now, and the element role isn't even called riot anymore! You can get the collection on <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/famedly/matrix">Ansible Galaxy</a>, with the source being available over on <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/ansible/collections/matrix">GitLab</a>.

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I‚Äôve created a compact and portable home server based on Matrix protocol, it‚Äôs a piece of hardware which is easy to use and set up. I‚Äôm working on a new client APP similar to other typical messenger GUI, but this server we named it ‚ÄòPrivee‚Äô supports any messenger developed with Matrix protocol. I‚Äôve launched a campaign on Kickstarter this week, please come and support us! Thank you!

<p>Privee is an <em>interesting project</em> alright! The project creators are based in Hong Kong, and are working from a desire to have more control over their communications. The plan is to run homeservers on a small computer physically located with the user, similar to plans outlined by <a href="https://nova.chat/">NovaChat</a>.</p>
<p>This is an early-stage project (hence starting on KickStarter.) While exciting and ambitious, I encourage everyone to do their own research! Learn more and chat with terry_hello (who has done a good job handling questions already!) in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#Privee:matrix.org">#Privee:matrix.org</a>.</p>
