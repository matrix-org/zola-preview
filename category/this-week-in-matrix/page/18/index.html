<h3 id="dendrite">Dendrite</h3>
<p>We have a whole lot of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a> news this week! First, from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>, on the Matrix team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Progress has been picking up this week with some of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cnly:matrix.org">Cnly</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pulls/Cnly">many</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib/pulls/Cnly">PRs</a> finally getting merged! <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cnly:matrix.org">Cnly</a> is our resident <a href="https://www.matrix.org/blog/2019/05/07/welcome-to-the-2019-g-so-c-participants">Google Summer of Code</a> student this Summer and has been making strides ever since. We also finally fully migrated to BuildKite for Continuous Integration (which is much quicker than TravisCI) and have implemented golangci-lint as the project‚Äôs opinionated linter (catching some bugs in the process).</p>
<p>As part of CI, we‚Äôve set up <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/">Sytest</a> for Dendrite, which grants us a loose method of keeping track of progress as we go along. Currently the only way to do so is to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/testfile">testfile</a> which holds all the tests we know Dendrite to be passing, and cross-referencing that with the list of all sytests (which isn‚Äôt actually available anywhere). We‚Äôre hoping to make some nice way of visualizing progress over time with this data (and possibly break it down into Federation/Client/Application Service categories), but this will take some time.</p>
<p>We‚Äôd also like to thank some new contributors that have shown up since Matrix 1.0‚Äôs release. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jump_spider:matrix.spider.ink">serra-allgood</a> contributed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/702">a fix</a> for querying aliases when using at least one application service, while <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@drglitch:matrix.org">DrGlitchMX</a> sent a PR in for some database fixes. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@peekay_46:matrix.org">SUMUKHA-PK</a>‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/694">PR</a> to add room tags is still around and should see some love very shortly.</p>
<p>As far as the current goals of the project, we‚Äôre looking to primarily make Dendrite federate with Synapse, which will allow it to actually be usable for testing/basic day-to-day usage. We intend to have it done so in the next few months, so stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cnly:matrix.org">Cnly</a>, who is doing GSOCüéì on Dendrite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Dendrite, the first phase of GSoC has primarily seen improvements for the existing code including bug fixes, refinements for testing, and some refactoring that prepares Dendrite for later feature implementation. Among the changes, two important ones will be the initial support for EDUs in /sync responses as well as a federation destination cache that allows for more effective federation.</p>
<p>In the next phase, more focus will be put into feature completion, mainly for the Client/Server API component. Since this part of work covers various still-under-construction areas in Dendrite, it is foreseeable that more progress will actually be made than proposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ruma">Ruma</h3>
<p>This Week in Ruma: <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/this-week-in-ruma-2019-06-16/">https://www.ruma.io/news/this-week-in-ruma-2019-06-16/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Work is underway to bring Ruma up to date with version r0.5.0 of the Matrix specification. Starting with the most foundational libraries and working up towards the higher-level ruma-client, this work should be done in the next week or two. The bulk of the work since the last update has been on ruma-events, adding all of the events that were previously missing, and doing a full pass through existing events to make sure our definitions match the specification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can't wait to see more updates out of Ruma!</p>

<h3 id="matrix-appservice-discord-0-5-1">matrix-appservice-discord 0.5.1</h3>
<p>This announcement is nearly a week old from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>, coming in right after the previous TWIM was published:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've released v0.5.1 of the discord bridge today. It's mostly comprised of small bugfixes and features, but contains metrics support for tracking performance on the bridge. <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/releases/tag/0.5.1">https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/releases/tag/0.5.1</a></p>

<h3 id="mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mautrix-telegram got some bugs fixed and minor features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated to <a href="https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/compare/v1.8.0...master">Telethon 1.8</a></li>
<li>Option to limit maximum document size when bridging so it wouldn't download 1.5gb files and run out of ram</li>
<li>Made the state cache get updated when sending state events. Not doing this was causing some problems on t2bot.io, which has disabled echoing state events (probably for performance reasons)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="reliable-bridges-gsoc-mortar-board"><em>Reliable Bridges</em> GSOC üéì</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kai:nasnotfound.de">Kai</a> is working on bridging in Matrix, mentored by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first phase of GSoC is nearing its end and progress has been made on the <em>Reliable Bridges</em> project.<br />
The main focus of the work was on delivering a running implementation for the signaling of permanent errors. Work has been done on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> together with <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</a>. An internal version of the Discord bridge with the new feature is already running and the related <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/pull/111">PR for the bridge SDK</a> is in the state of being completed.<br />
The next phase of GSOC comes with new goals. First, the preparation of a MSC for the signaling of bridge errors, so that the feature can be discussed in the community and can become a part of The Spec. The second goal will be the modification of Riot Web, so that the user is notified when an error condition occurred.<br />
There also has been a slight change of plan: The work on notifying clients when parts of the system are temporarily unavailable needs reconsideration as not even the core Matrix network itself has this capability. The way forward here should probably be a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2094">unified solution</a>.</p>

<h3 id="new-typescript-puppeting-lib-mx-puppet-bridge">New TypeScript puppeting lib: mx-puppet-bridge</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Soru</a>, who you probably know from her work on <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord/">matrix-appservice-discord</a>, has started a new library:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soru started working on a new puppeting library, for a lack of a better name it is currently called <a href="https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-bridge">mx-puppet-bridge</a>.<br />
Unlike the existing puppet bridge, the focus of this one is to handle multiple users at once, all dynamically without needing to edit the configuration file over and over. Additionally the new codebase results in quite a few things smoothened out for easier protocol implementations.<br />
Furthermore mx-puppet-bridge is written in typescript and based on travis' <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a>.<br />
As protocol implementation for testing, soru also wrote <a href="https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-slack">mx-puppet-slack</a> (again, for the lack of a better name). Basic message sending in both directions is already fully functional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exciting stuff! And all the more so for the third-person announcement style!</p>

<h3 id="gomuks">gomuks</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gomuks had a bunch of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for rendering redactions and edits (rendering reactions coming up next)</li>
<li>Added commands to create rooms, start private chats and edit room tags</li>
<li>Rendered images now don't take up the whole width</li>
<li>Improved memory usage slightly</li>
<li>Broke everyones existing caches (<code>rm -rf ~/.cache/gomuks</code> should help if it panics at startup)</li>
</ul>
<p>The command for creating rooms and the image resolution limit were added by a new contributor, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jrswab:matrix.org">J. R.</a>, who is currently working on adding .well-known discovery support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been having a good play with this and like it at lot!</p>

<h3 id="continuum-javafx-client">continuum, JavaFX client</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uforia:matrix.org">yuforia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Improved support for more types of events in
<a href="https://github.com/koma-im/continuum-desktop">continuum</a> this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>invitation events are supported</li>
<li>support for events that typically appear when a room is being set up is in progress</li>
<li>events that are not yet supported are displayed with a fallback view. Blank rows in previous versions are now fixed. You could always right-click on any event to view the source, of course</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pattle-dart-client">Pattle, Dart client</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:pattle.im">Wilko</a> came in with this thorough update, <a href="https://pattle.im/">Pattle</a> development is MOTORING:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version of Pattle has been pushed to F-droid!</p>
<p>This release is mostly focused on bug fixing and bug reporting! This is why I urge <strong>all users who have been having problems before to try Pattle again!</strong> Chances are that your problem has been fixed, and if not, it will be reported with more information so I can fix it!</p>
<p>When an error is reported, this data is sent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating system version</li>
<li>Device model, brand, manufacturer and whether it's a simulator</li>
<li>A unique ID based on your device</li>
</ul>
<p>In some errors the homeserver domain is logged, I will try to prevent this in the future.</p>
<p>This release also includes preparation for an iOS release next week!</p>
<p>Fixes and other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle rooms that the user has left (a notice is shown that you can't send any messages)</li>
<li>Show a date header above the chat creation event (not the first known event in the list as before)</li>
<li>When an error occurs during sync, show a message, including the Exception name</li>
<li>Fix replies causing an error if the <code>formattedBody</code> does not adhere to the spec (thanks to Mathieu!)</li>
<li>Fix errors not showing when logging in</li>
<li>Fix loading spinner showing when checking username or logging in even if loading took less than 3 seconds</li>
<li>Fix direct chats not detected when adder after the initial sync</li>
<li>Some general syncing issues have been fixed (causing the dreaded infinite loading spinner).</li>
</ul>
<p>To install this release, add the following repo in F-droid:</p>
<p><a href="https://fdroid.pattle.im/?fingerprint=E91F63CA6AE04F8E7EA53E52242EAF8779559209B8A342F152F9E7265E3EA729">https://fdroid.pattle.im/?fingerprint=E91F63CA6AE04F8E7EA53E52242EAF8779559209B8A342F152F9E7265E3EA729</a></p>
<p>And install 'Pattle'.</p>
<p>Or <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app/releases">download the APK</a>.</p>
<p>If you stumble upon any issues, <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app/issues">please report them</a>!<br />
You can <a href="https://git.pattle.im/users/sign_in">login via GitHub and Gitlab.com</a>, so it's really easy to do! (Logging in via GitHub did not seem to work previously, but it will now!)</p>
<p>Follow development here: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#app:pattle.im">#app:pattle.im</a>!</p>
<p>If you would like to support me, you can now do so via <a href="https://liberapay.com/wilko/">Liberapay</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/pattle_app">Patreon</a>. I actually need money for the Apple Developer program, which costs 100 euros per year to release Pattle on the App Store and Testflight.</p>

Thanks to my GSoC mentors and Matrix and Quotient communities for support and solid groundwork. Long term goal is to provide modern Qt-based library to support full-featured matrix clients like Quaternion, Spectral or even to revive Telepathy IM connection manager <a href="https://github.com/TelepathyIM/telepathy-tank">https://github.com/TelepathyIM/telepathy-tank</a>! %)</p>
<p>P.S.: Maybe somebody reading this is brave enough to play with Qt-based server implementation too? :)</p>

<h2 id="matrix-1-0">Matrix 1.0</h2>
<p>The big news this week is that we declared ourselves to be out of beta. You'll want the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation">full post</a> for all details, but here's a taste:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are very excited to announce the first fully stable release of the Matrix protocol and specification across all APIs - as well as the Synapse 1.0 reference implementation which implements the full Matrix 1.0 API surface.</p>
<p>This means that after just over 5 years since the initial work on Matrix began, we are proud to have finally exited beta!! This is the conclusion of the work which we announced at <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019">FOSDEM 2019</a> when we cut the first stable release of the Server-Server API and began the Synapse 0.99 release series in anticipation of releasing a 1.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of the 1.0 we also announced the Matrix.org Foundation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the full update on the Foundation, please check out the new website content at <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">https://matrix.org/foundation</a> which should tell you everything you could possibly want to know about the Foundation, the Guardians, the Foundation‚Äôs legal Articles of Association, and the day-to-day Rules which define the Open Governance process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has stuck with us along the way to make this possible.</p>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>We released Synapse 1.0.0 this week to coincide with Matrix 1.0. As a release Synapse 1.0.0 focuses on security and stability which in turn builds a firm foundation for the performance improvements that you can expect to see over the Summer. Read all about it <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/synapse-1-0-0-released">here</a>.</p>

<p>Pattle is going great guns at the moment. Here's <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:pattle.im">Wilko</a>:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version of Pattle has been pushed to F-droid!</p>
<ul>
<li>Add ability to create group chats!</li>
<li>Show chat creation events ('Wilko has created this group')!</li>
<li>Show emote messages correctly!</li>
<li>Handle display name changes! Display names of messages will now be as they were at time of sending.</li>
<li>Don't show invite and join events in direct chats This is only happens for the two initial users in the direct chat. If someone invites someone else to the direct chat (trough another client), the invitation will show up in the timeline.</li>
<li>Use the timeout parameter while syncing. This means that receiving new messages should be way quicker! (Thanks Mathieu!)</li>
<li>Store messages retrieved remotely (thanks Mathieu!) This means that scrolling up in a chat will be faster now, because the messages are cached.</li>
<li>Always show a date header above the oldest event</li>
<li>Show replies correctly in chat overview</li>
<li>Show sent state icon next to own message in chat overview</li>
<li>Show newly joined rooms at the top in the chat overview</li>
<li>Use a bit bolder font for chat names in overview
To install this release, add the following repo in F-droid:</li>
</ul>

<p>And install 'Pattle'.</p>
<p>Or download the APK from the link.</p>
<p>If you stumble upon any <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app/issues">issues</a>, please report them! You can now login via <a href="https://git.pattle.im/users/sign_in">GitHub and Gitlab.com</a> , so it's really easy to do!</p>
<p>Follow development here: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#app:pattle.im">#app:pattle.im</a>!</p>

<p>Benoit, from the team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many things to announce this week on RiotX:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto is starting to work! We can now decrypt message and send encrypted messages. The whole feature is not implemented yet, but we will merge the PR at the beginning next week before going further. Thanks Fran√ßois for the great work!</li>
<li>On the timeline, message composed by only emoji are now displayed bigger (as in other Riot clients)</li>
<li>We can now see details and actions of each message, including state event.</li>
<li>We can also see the detailed list of reactions for a particular message, and reaction display rendering has been improved. More details of what has been improved by Valere can be found in this PR description: <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/pull/168">https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/pull/168</a>.</li>
<li>Local echo on message edition has been improved</li>
<li>The 3 main themes has been implemented (Light, Dark Black). Status theme is still there but has not been tested yet. There are still some little issues which will be fixed in the next coming days.</li>
<li>The new Home is on develop, composed by a catchup tab, a direct message tab and a group room tab. The drawer is now used to display the groups hierarchy.</li>
<li>A debug signature has been added to the git repository, so the APK built by buildkite can now be installed and replace a previously installed APK.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is still lots of work to do, but we are quite confident to deliver a first alpha version of RiotX to a larger audience at the end of June.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/">matrix-appservice-irc</a> got a release 0.12.0. This is a smaller release, as it's based upon 0.12.0-rc2 which was released back in March (when exams hit). In the meantime, working towards a speedy 0.13.0 release :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Changelog for 0.12.0:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>The bridge now supports upgrading rooms, and will follow room upgrades to the new room.
</span><span>Added support for the RoomLinkValidator, which allows admins to manually configure rules about plumbing rooms.
</span><span>A dockerfile is now included.
</span><span>Add support for &quot;feature flags&quot;, allowing users to dynamically enable/disable bridge features for their account.
</span><span>Add command &quot;!bridgeversion&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>High-level plan for 0.13.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fix the most serious P1 bugs like not dropping messages, handling PARTs better, dropping support for older versions of node, and generally better UX.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Main news in synapse-land this week is that we released Synapse v0.99.5.2, which fixes a big performance regression which was introduced v0.99.5. Folks who are currently on v0.99.5/v0.99.5.1 are advised to upgrade asap.</p>
<p>Otherwise, work has been continuing apace towards a v1.0 release on 10th June.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/">Construct</a> is a homeserver implementation in C++:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Construct has added support for Server Access Control Lists (m.room.server_acl). The exact behavior of the implementation is configurable by the server administrator, and is even more comprehensive than Synapse. In Construct, ACLs can be configured to cover incoming EDUs, outgoing events, and indirectly fetched events.</li>
<li>The GraphicsMagick library has been utilized to implement the media thumbnailing feature called for by the specification. This is an optional dependency written in C and offers a rich API which as been extremely fun to work with. In the future, expect your Construct to be capable of things like annotating images with the Server Command Line which can be used to generate memes in your chatroom or write custom text on top of stickers!</li>
<li>On the backend we have devoted significant effort to getting the most out of dynamic-linking to simplify the architecture of a large and modular free-software project. This effort makes adding features and contributions to Construct extremely straightforward. I will enumerate the basics for those familiar with developing C software: We are now loading all modules at runtime with the flags <code>RTLD_GLOBAL|RTLD_DEEPBIND|RTLD_LAZY</code> and we build with the flag <code>--weak-unresolved-symbols</code>; during execution we hook the error handling in <code>ld.so</code> to throw our own C++ exception directly from the PLT slot of a missing symbol. In summary this allows features to be added to Construct by simply creating an interface in a header and definitions in a loadable module, while still enjoying optional loading and unloading of the module at runtime. This is a significant feat that remains unrealized in most existing projects around the free software ecosystem!</li>

<p>Can you believe it, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> had a busy week working on his various bridges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> now has native Matrix edit support in both directions and basic Prometheus metrics. I'll probably start making 0.6.0 RCs after improving the metrics a bit.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts">mautrix-hangouts</a> got some bugfixes and options to configure the displaynames of the ghost users on Matrix (like adding <code>(FB)</code> or <code>(Hangouts)</code> suffixes).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a>'s Matrix puppeting was finished (meaning typing notifs, read receipts and presence updates can now be bridged to WhatsApp) and unexpected disconnection handling was fixed (automatic reconnections should now usually work again).
Backfilling needed some hacks to work with Matrix puppeting. The problem is that the real Matrix users have rate limits and can't send timestamp-massaged messages. I decided to just invite the default ghost user to the room while backfilling and make it leave afterwards so that private chat room names and such would stay intact. Some clients like Riot Android/iOS sometimes do weird things, such as moving the room out of &quot;People&quot;, but that shouldn't be too bad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> has seen some work in becoming more flexible.</p>
<p>Synapse is not a requirement anymore. People can now use the playbook to install any of the other services, wiring them to a Synapse instance installed in another way.
This is mostly useful for installing bridges or other auxiliary services without going &quot;all in&quot; on the playbook.
Not having Synapse as a fixed requirement also opens the door for installing alternative homeservers, when such become available in the future.</p>
<p>On a similar note, to ease maintanability, all bridges have been moved to separate Ansible roles (outside of the <code>matrix-synapse</code> role).
There have been lots of improvements related to bridge configuration with even more likely to come soon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neo now supports sending multiple images, videos and files at once. You'll get a bar with previews, and the option to remove them from the queue/add more.<br />
There's also been a bunch of changes to how events are handled. Images and videos should be much more robust against missing keys (no thumbnail, no information, etc), and there's basic displaying of the most common state events.<br />
I also added an experimental media repository fallback option, which is disabled by default, and only implemented for room avatars. This allows you to provide a list of alternative homeservers Neo is allowed to try when your own homeserver can't load a piece of media.<br />
Due to the loss of lain.haus, I lost admin access in the Neo room, so keep your eyes out for a new one when my infra is back.<br />
I'm currently not really versioning anything, but I do push significant commits to <a href="https://neo.lain.haus/neo">https://neo.lain.haus/neo</a> for people to try. Once it gets to a more useable state, I'll start adopting semantic versioning.</p>

<h3 id="major-whatsapp-bridging-update">Major WhatsApp bridging update</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> made great strides on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on mautrix-whatsapp to add history bridging and Matrix puppeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>New portals are populated with some history when creating them (exact count is configurable)</li>
<li>All messages missed during bridge downtime are backfilled</li>
<li>Creating portals is smarter now:</li>
<li>When logging in initially, it'll create portals for a few recent chats (count configurable).</li>
<li>It'll create portals when there are incoming messages as before, but it should no longer create portals for chats that only have old messages.</li>
<li>The missed message backfilling creates portals when necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Matrix puppeting isn't quite finished yet. It can already use your Matrix account to bridge messages sent from whatsapp mobile, but it doesn't use the account to bridge EDUs (typing notifs, presence, read receipts) yet.</p>
<p>To make the history bridging a bit nicer, I made a PR to fix timestamp massaging in synapse: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/5233. Timestamp massaging was removed from the spec in 1.0, but it wasn't intentionally removed from synapse, it just broke due to other changes. It was probably supposed to stay there as an easter egg until there's a proper solution for bridging history.</p>

<h3 id="gsoc-2019-reliable-bridges">GSoC 2019 ‚Äì Reliable Bridges</h3>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kai:nasnotfound.de">Kai</a> for this introduction to his project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>Reliable Bridges</em> GSoC project is about implementing a feedback mechanism for the Matrix network in cases where bridges are not able to properly handle messages. Currently clients are unable to know if a message was successfully sent over a bridge. With the new mechanism in place they get the information about errors happening at bridges and can behave accordingly by e.g. notify the user of the failed delivery.</p>
<p>The implementation is foremost focused on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-dicord</a> bridge which uses the underlying <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>. A JS bridge was chosen so that as much code as possible is brought into the SDK and other bridges can profit sooner from the work done.</p>
<p>The first step for implementing the new feature will be the signaling of permanent errors occurring at the bridge (in contrast to temporary failures). They might occur e.g. when the sending account was banned on the bridged foreign network. These permanent errors will be implemented as a new type of PDU originating from the bridge.</p>
<p>After permanent errors are done, the subsequent weeks will see work on temporary failures which might include work on Synapse as well as work on Riot Web to have a client which actually uses the new events. As these events are new features being introduced there will also be a MSC draft. There everyone can check out the proposed solution and tear it apart with their criticism (if applicable üòâ).</p>
<p>For discussions related to the GSoC project or when you have some opinions on how the MSC should look like, you are invited to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#reliablebridges:nasnotfound.de">Reliable Bridges Matrix room</a>.</p>

<p>This is great! All Rubyists should check it out. Ananace notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I still need to set up fixtures for all the API endpoints I'm exposing so I can verify every single API call as well, but I see that as a later thing as that relates mostly to how the other side (the HS) handles my input, not to how the SDK itself handles said input</p>

<p>This week Neil and Matthew are talking about recent security issues - this is a really long and detailed chat, but you can skip to around the 32 minute mark to hear about other news - including progress on reactions. Reminder that for a good &quot;big picture&quot; overview of the progress of Matrix, you can look at the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/9">Homeserver High Level Roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>Neil, Synapse-dev wrangler:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reactions continues at full speed, we have a draft PR and will be implementing over the coming week. The ability to blacklist IPs over federation will land imminently, as well as a nasty device management bug that led to a spate of E2E errors. Next week is all about Reactions, resuming work on the small homeserver project and finally getting back to Synapse 1.0 blockers following all the remediation drama of the past few weeks. With any luck we‚Äôll have a new Synapse release for you next week.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a> received a configuration file. The configuration file adds the ability to configure multiple Homeservers and pantalaimon will run having each Homeserver exposed on a different TCP port.</li>
<li>The panctl utility has received support for more commands, it now has the ability to accept SAS requests, confirm them, import/export keys, list pan users as well as list devices of users. Completions for the commands were also added.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the development pace has been reduced lately, the Fractal team managed to make significant progress towards the 4.2 release. More specifically since our previous news, Chris has landed much of his adaptive view work to get Fractal in a mobile friendly state so it‚Äôs ready to run on the Librem 5 once Purism starts shipping them. But he didn‚Äôt stop there: eager to see his awesome work in the hands of many people (figuratively, the literal application will have to wait for the phone to be out üòõ) as soon as possible, he tackled a few bugs that we really wanted to get sorted out before we got a new version out.</p>
<p>Alexandre also <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/commit/152255031400049a30667c581c0dc31a4ef03146">prepared the changelog</a> with a bird‚Äôs-eye view of all changes that happened since 4.0.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we had a few external contributions for features such as network proxy support and typing notifications.</p>

<h3 id="new-hangouts-bridge-from-tulir-mautrix">New Hangouts bridge from tulir / mautrix</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been using his <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python">mautrix-python</a> lib, which was recently used to enable his <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> bridge, to bring a new method for Matrix-Hangouts bridging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New bridge again, this time it's Hangouts: https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#hangouts:maunium.net">#hangouts:maunium.net</a>. As with the Messenger bridge, currently the main difference to matrix-puppet-hangouts is multi-user support (also no hacky JS/Python mixing).</p>
<p>Before making mautrix-hangouts, I put a bunch of the generic bridging parts of mautrix-facebook into mautrix-python's bridge module and used that in both bridges. After Debian 10 is released, I'll drop Python 3.5 compatibility in mautrix-telegram and move it to use mautrix-python and the bridge module too.</p>
<p>Next week I'm planning on adding a bunch of features to both my new bridges, such as bridging formatting and remaining media types (so no new bridges planned for now :D).</p>

<h3 id="qmatrixclient-is-now-quotient">QMatrixClient is now &quot;Quotient&quot;</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vote on a new name for the QMatrixClient project has been going on over the past week.<br />
<strong>We have a winner now, and the new name is &quot;Quotient&quot;!</strong> In the nearest weeks, expect changes in the library code (it's going to be libQuotient from the next release), room aliases (already ongoing), links to the repos etc. etc. Where possible, we're going to smoothen the migration path by providing legacy fallbacks (e.g., the new C++ namespace, Quotient, will be introduced but the old one, QMatrixClient, will stay its synonym, although deprecated).<br />
Just in case you missed all the previous mentions of the topic - it's only related to the overall project and the library, but not the client - its name remains Quaternion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why rename?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the previous name has been a bit clumsy and, most importantly, the project is no more focusing just on client-side but on a wider set of applications of Matrix (no homeserver in plans though). See also the recent backlog of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#qmatrixclient:matrix.org">#qmatrixclient:matrix.org</a> (now also <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#quotient:matrix.org">#quotient:matrix.org</a>) earlier this week for the whole discussion</p>

<h2 id="riot-android">Riot Android</h2>
<ul>
<li>New Riot.im application has been delivered to the PlayStore:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app. It replaces the previous app. More details here: https://medium.com/@RiotChat/riot-im-android-security-update-2b3f655ad739</li>
<li>Fran√ßois and Benoit were at AndroidMakers Paris on Tuesday and Wednesday. We‚Äôve seen plenty of interesting conferences and come back with many ideas to improve Riot UX/UI/Implementation/testing/etc.</li>
<li>SAS device verification review is over, will be merged once we have the tagged OLM library.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="riotx-android">RiotX (Android)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Valere has started working on reactions (which will be implemented only on RiotX for Android).</li>
<li>Fran√ßois has worked on merging membership Events in the timeline</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="crypto">Crypto</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg:matrix.org">uhoreg</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>olm 3.1.0 has been released. This release adds new functions to help with SAS-based key verification (a.k.a. emoji-based verification) and with cross-signing. The Python bindings are also now available on pypi, so you can install it using &quot;pip install python-olm&quot;, though you need the olm library and development files installed first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also</p>
<ul>
<li>Python-olm available on pypi.</li>
<li>Initial SAS verification support for nio.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spectral">Spectral</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> reports that:</p>
<p>Spectral's redesign continues, featuring a beautiful responsive UI(not kirigami yet, sorry) and more functionalities. Legacy UIs such as the room detail panel are changed to fit into redesigned UI better. Basic room upgrade support is added, allowing you to switch between the old room and the new room. Room settings and user detail dialogs are added. You can also ignore users in the user detail dialog.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> double header this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>matrix-nsfw has been ported from Golang to Rust. The backend machine learning framework is also switched to Tensorflow, giving a major performance boost. For anyone that doesn't know what matrix-nsfw is, it is a bot-like utility that detects NSFW images in a room. The new repo is at https://gitlab.com/b0/matrix-nsfw-rust</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of Ruma's libraries (but not yet the homeserver itself) are now targeting stable Rust!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="continiuum">Continiuum</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uforia:matrix.org">yuforia</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If a room member is not visible on screen, updating their name doesn't require switching to the main UI thread</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Apply formatting when viewing the json source of an event</li>
<li>Reuse GUI components to improve performance, update content of views instead of creating new ones</li>
<li>Use a hash set to avoid going through the list of room members in some cases * Move more of local storage into the database: names and avatars of users and rooms, room membership, recently used accounts, etc.</li>
<li>Placeholder avatars are made with GUI components and instead of generated bitmap images</li>
<li>Switch to gradle multi-project build to modularize</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>After switching from plaintext files to an embedded database, some components are still in the process of being rewritten, coming next week: load messages from server on demand when scrolling, if they are not yet stored in database; add support for invitations;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>The reactions and edits API is taking shape, we‚Äôre making progress on our small homeserver setup, and we‚Äôre hunting a new set of device key management bugs that came to light in the absence of matrix.org.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve been a bit disrupted these past few weeks, but work towards Synapse 1.0 continues and we‚Äôll soon be ready to offer a release candidate.</p>
<h2 id="minivector">miniVector</h2>

<h3 id="github-tokens">Github tokens</h3>
<p>jaywink:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to the security incident, all GitHub access tokens for the Scalar GitHub integration were cleared. This means that if you have a GitHub bot in the channel and want to use the !github bot commands, you need to re-login to github via the integration manager menu. Note, existing webhooks are untouched and should work fine without re-authenticating.</p>

<p>From the matrix.org bridge team, we are resurrecting bridges as fast as possible. Currently running are the freenode, slack, gitter and gimpnet (now hosted on gnome.org) with more to come today and next week.<br />
We have the snoonet and oftc irc bridges back. Mozilla is coming soon hopefully this weekend too!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a>:</p>

<p>A big release of Pattle has just been pushed to the F-droid repo! Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display names are now shown</li>
<li>You can now click on chats and view them!</li>
<li>Messages are grouped by time and sender (see screenshots)</li>
<li>Add fancy transition animation and ripples to chat messages (see video)</li>
<li>Use Sentry for error reporting (only Android version and device model is sent, along with the stacktrace of the error)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, please note that if you have a matrix.org you probably have reinstall the app if you're logged in because of the recent matrix.org incident (because there's no logout button yet and no detection for invalidated access tokens)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has actually been a release since, which includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>message sending and viewing image history!</p>

<h2 id="neo">neo</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I reimplemented the matrix sdk into Neo, so it works nicer. Colors and font look nicer (base16-tomorrow, Open Sans), and there's text message sending, with localecho!<br />
I also fixed a bug where react would recycle displayname-components across rooms, attributing them to the wrong messages</p>

<h2 id="matrix-registration-update">matrix-registration update</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@zeratax:dmnd.sh">ZerataX</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it's been a long while, but I've finally come around to improving on matrix-registration<br />
For those of you, who have forgotten what this project is about, it basically lets you invite people to your homeserver with tokens, e.g. https://homeserver.tld/register?token=DoubleWizardSky<br />
This whole update was about making the project more user friendly.<br />
I made a new default registration page that requires 0 setup and you can install the project right from pypi with pip, so you don't even need to clone the repo any longer.<br />
check a live example  here: https://chat.dmnd.sh/register<br />
and to play around with the api you can can go over to the github page: https://zeratax.github.io/matrix-registration/demo.html?token=ColorWhiskeyExpand<br />

<h2 id="matrix-media-repo-now-has-s3-support">matrix-media-repo now has s3 support</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a> now has s3 (and s3-like) support, making it easier to archive older media or use minimal disk space. See the new datastores option in the config and the admin docs ( https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/blob/master/docs/admin.md#datastore-management ) for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="dimension">Dimension</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dimension has been updated to more safely handle when upstream integration managers (like Scalar) are offline. Instead of crashing or breaking in various ways, it'll report which integrations are not accessible.<br />
As well, due to recent events, if you use matrix.org bots or bridges in Dimension then go the the admin section and log everyone out using the red button. Dimension caches upstream tokens and isn't smart enough to realize that they are no longer valid, which means they need clearing. Clients should automatically handle getting new tokens in the background.</p>
