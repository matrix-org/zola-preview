<p>Kudos to Aaron for adding a GitHub action to matrix.org's repository to check for typos, and taking the time to fix them all! Worry not fellow proofreaders, our post-publication TWIM proofreading tradition is not extinct: some typos are not caught by the CI, such as misspelling of proper nouns (e.g. <em>Devianart</em>) or articles (e.g. &quot;an proofreader&quot; won't make the CI upset)</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p>In terms of MSC updates this past week:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The release of Matrix v1.2 is right around the corner, and is expected to go out on <strong>February 2nd</strong>. This is in line with our quarterly release cycle for the spec going forwards.</p>
<p>Please reach out to us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> if there are any last-minute MSCs that haven't started/finished Final Comment Period that you believe should be included!</p>
<p>Otherwise there was a lot of discussion surrounding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2781">MSC2781: Remove the reply fallbacks from the specification</a>. I'll let the other spec updates in TWIM speak to that though :)</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2291">MSC2291: Configuration to Control Crawling</a>!</p>
<p>A concept similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard">robots.txt for the web</a>, but for Matrix! Currently the way to inform room-crawling bots in Matrix today is by banning/kicking them from the room. However, this doesn't allow you to blanket prevent bots from joining - nor does it only inform bots that they should access <em>some</em> of the room's data. It's a binary switch.</p>
<p>Consider if you wanted your room to be crawled, but the room topic to not be indexed. This MSC could help with that! Give it a read/review if you're interested.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever pinged someone by accident, because you replied to a message with their name in it or maybe even a whole room mention? Or are you avoiding replies for that reason? Did the quote of a messages suddenly vanish when someone edited their message in a client? Or are you just in general unhappy with replies only showing what type of message was replied to, instead of showing the actual image being replied to (on mobile for example)? Were you annoyed, that you could only reply with a text message, but not an emote message, an image, a sticker or even a video?</p>
<p>I spent a bunch of time trying to remove the blocker for that in the Matrix specification, you can find the proposal here: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2781</p>
<p>As it turns out, it is not quite as simple, because notifications for replies to your messages rely on a bunch of implicit interactions, which is why I also wrote another MSC to fix that: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3664</p>
<p>I'm a bit unhappy with replies across the matrix ecosystem at the moment and I hope this is a small step towards improving things. It's certainly not as exciting as spaces, voip, threads or stickers, but it is something which affects me every day and I think those small papercuts need some attention too.</p>
<p>I hope some of you share my love for the less exciting stuff!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jboi:jboi.nl">Jonathan</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To add onto Nico's efforts, I think that mentions today are based on too many &quot;false-positives&quot; (ping on displayname or username mention), and i kinda wish for the &quot;just mention them&quot; UX of discord, telegram, whatsapp, and so many other messengers.</p>
<p>So I've also made a proposal that tries to bring some explicitness in that, a new push rule that'll fire on &quot;mention&quot;; https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3517</p>
<p>It'll look for any <code>@</code>-MXID mention in the plaintext, or look for an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>-mention &quot;pill&quot; in the HTML. It is a hack, but it is the most correct way of determining if you've been pinged in matrix, at the moment.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In terms of reply fallbacks - the Spec Core Team gave an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2781#issuecomment-1016853716">overwhelming thumbs up</a> to removing reply fallbacks via MSC2781... but given practically this causes a cascade of other work (defining and implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3664">push_rules for replies</a>, and defining and implementing push_rules for threads (MSC TBD)) and so as a temporary transitional measure we've instead made reply fallbacks best effort (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc3676/proposals/3676-transitioning-away-from-reply-fallbacks.md">MSC3676</a>).  This means that clients can now reply using non-textual events, and we can use replies as a fallback for threads for non-thread-capable-clients/ASes once <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> lands.  To be clear, the intention is still to incorporate all of Nico's excellent contributions on MSC2781 and MSC3664 however.</p>

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello TWIM! Last week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/01/25/synapse-1-51-released">released Synapse 1.51</a>. This is a great release which includes lots of performance work around sending aggregations down /sync. It also makes Spaces much more reliable: we tracked down <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11773">a bug</a> with caching which could cause some sub-spaces to randomly appear empty when queried over federation. We also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11695">removed the 50 result limit</a> when listing the contents of a Space.</p>
<p>We're also starting to see some promising results experimenting with ways to make room joins faster (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775</a>). It's not <em>quite</em> ready to demo, but we should have something to show off before too long. 🤞</p>
<p>Last but not least, FOSDEM is in 8 days! The Synapse team will be giving a couple of talks during the day: <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/matrix_events_uninitiatied/">Events for the Uninitiated</a> by Shay at 10:10 UTC, and <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/matrix_extend_synapse/">Beyond the Matrix: Extend the capabilities of your Synapse homeserver</a> by Brendan at 15:40 UTC.

<h3 id="dendrite-website">Dendrite (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">neilalexander</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We know that it has been a while coming but today we have released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6">Dendrite 0.6</a>! This version contains a number of significant changes, including switching away from Kafka to NATS JetStream and refactoring a number of other components. We have been making architectural changes recently to help Dendrite scale better in the future and to fix a number of race conditions that were present before. Federation in particular is much smoother and better behaved in this release, with overall lower CPU and memory usage and less resource spikes.</p>
<p>The full changelog is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/master/CHANGES.md">available on GitHub</a> but the highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>NATS JetStream support, deprecating Kafka and Naffka</li>
<li>The roomserver now being responsible for fetching missing events and state instead of the federation API, which fixes some race conditions</li>
<li>Strict ordering and asynchronous input support in the roomserver input API, which smooths out incoming federation significantly</li>
<li>Consolidated federation API, including functionality from the now-deprecated federation sender and signing key server components</li>
<li>Database-backed device list synchronisation, which is now more reliable</li>
<li>Correct gap checking when fetching missing events and state</li>
<li>Better behaviour and lower resource usage by the <code>/event_auth</code> endpoint</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance, as measured by Sytest, currently sits at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 65%</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 94%</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a highly recommended update so if you are running a Dendrite server, please upgrade! As always, you can join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for Dendrite discussion and announcements.</p>

<p>Hey folks, no releases this week but a general update on a little project of ours. I've been working through the problem of making bridges easier to use and supplimenting our command interfaces with pretty buttons and forms.

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Next to spec work, progress on porting Nheko to 100% qml continues. This week I ported the login and registration pages. I also did some minor cleanups on them and prep work for future improvements (like buttons for each SSO provider or providing email address and registration token inline instead of in a separate popup, if the server requires it). Logging in or registering is often the first thing a user does on a client or maybe even the first thing they do on Matrix! As such I should really spend more effort optimizing that feature, that usually falls off the priority list because I don't use it often!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/qjaQfwuJRnkZxDdIpXYOqVhF.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Once Nheko is 100% Qml we should also see lower memory usage again, here is a screenshot from a Nheko instance with over 100 rooms, that's been running for a few days of active use on Windows:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/SWwRTvWLLmJeJrFDjvomjdXj.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where Nheko could crash the notification service, because it sent images not following the Freedesktop notification specification and tasty spent some time further improving the man page.</p>

<p>A decentralized and federated way of annotating the web based on Matrix.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@daniel:matrix.danilafe.com">Daniel</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrix highlight got experimental support for Firefox! It's still a bit crashy, but it shouldn't be much harder to stabilize it, and get the tool working properly there, too. Firefox is my personal browser of choice, and others have requested it, so it's nice that it's on the horizon :)</p>
<p>Also, after the discussion in Matrix Live and with some minor tweaks, I was able to get the extension to play nice with conduit! So that's now a viable alternative if you want to use Matrix Highlight with your own, self-hosted server.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cvwright:matrix.org">cvwright</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://kombuchaprivacy.com/circles">Circles</a> is a project to build a secure, end-to-end encrypted social network using Matrix technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This week the primary focus was on updating Circles to work with the latest Matrix iOS SDK.  I also successfully built and packaged the first beta release from an Apple M1 Mac.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next step is to develop and integrate a new, more secure password-based login based on the <a href="https://tobtu.com/blog/2021/10/srp-is-now-deprecated/">BS-SPEKE</a> protocol.  This will replace Circles' current approach, which is described in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3265">MSC3265</a>.  Hopefully the new login flow will also be of interest to the broader Matrix community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our search continues for an Android developer to help us bring Circles to the world's largest mobile device platform.  If you are excited about working with Matrix, Android Studio, and Jetpack Compose, send a resume and cover letter to jobs@futo.org.</p>

<ul>
<li>Added key backup support!</li>
<li>RoomService::getAll() returns a reactive list of reactive rooms instead of a reactive list of rooms. This allows to implement huge room lists without performance losses in the UI.</li>
<li>Some reactive data can be accessed in a non reactive way. Note that you will then only get a snapshot of the data.</li>
<li>Prevent sending room keys as to device messages, when they cannot be encrypted (e.g. due to missing one time keys).</li>

<p>https://github.com/elokapina/bubo</p>
<p>Bubo is a friendly little owl (bot) that helps maintain your community. It's been over a year since cutting the last release, so the changelog contains a bunch of things, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added command to set power levels in rooms.</li>
<li>Added users command to list and create users in a configured Keycloak. Optionally send invites via <a href="https://github.com/elokapina/keycloak-signup">keycloak-signup</a>, a web app that allows self-registering with Keycloak via short lived tokens.</li>
<li>Add logging to a Matrix room.</li>
<li>Bubo admins and coordinators can now be set based on room memberships.</li>
<li>Add command to make Bubo unlink and part itself from a room.</li>
<li>Add command to list rooms Bubo maintains but is not admin in.</li>
<li>Add command to recreate a room. This follows the upgrade room functionality, but does it without needing admin permissions (basically almost everything except a tombstone event). Useful if for example you have accidentally lost admin in a hundred or so rooms in your community. Which may have happened 😅</li>
<li>The communities command is now deprecated (support for spaces coming in the next version).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally some other changes and fixes, see changelog for full details.</p>
<p>Plans for next up features include syncing with Discourse to replicate spaces from Discourse groups and populate space members from Discourse group memberships (when Discourse shares the same Keycloak SSO provider with the homeserver).</p>

<blockquote>
<h2 id="reaching-another-feature-milestone-submitting-images-via-matrix-art">Reaching another feature Milestone – Submitting images via Matrix Art.</h2>
<p>Matrix Art now supports logging in with any account (well-known not supported yet. You need to provide the full server address) and submitting images through the interface.
You can now either just log in (No benefit though at this time as comments and follows are missing) or create a Matrix Art Profile.</p>
<p>An Account can also be created later. An Account would create a Profile room at <code>#&lt;mxid&gt;</code> on your server if it doesn't exist.
This currently is only possible by doing a logout and login in again with the box checked. A better way will be added soon.
Editing the Profile is not yet implemented at this time.</p>
<p>These 2 changes should allow some people to experiment with this. Mobile design is not tested at this time.
Submits should work. If you were previously logged in, you will need to log out and back in for some variables to get set correctly.</p>
<p>Registration is still WIP as there is some more moderation prep needed before the server accepts the registrations.</p>
<p>I hope people cheer in and post their images :)
(Also, please use the nsfw flag if required. This will make them hidden on the front page but shown in your profile page. I will block people that don't use it from the instance otherwise. Please be sensible.)</p>
<h2 id="other-changes">Other Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Form readability increased</li>
<li>Search engine getting filled in the background (Self hosted https://meilisearch.com instance gets used) when submitting</li>
<li>Loading indicator gets correctly positioned</li>
<li>Images without thumbnails or html caption don't break anymore</li>
<li>Directory Database was switched to SQLite</li>
<li>Roboto font was replaced with Inter font</li>
<li>Directory Endpoint got secured using the OpenID module in Matrix</li>
<li>&quot;Devianart&quot; typo got replaced with correct &quot;Deviantart&quot;</li>
<li>Logout state management got improved</li>

<p>Work on preparing the release of Matrix v1.2 is currently underway. As of today, the Spec Core Team is aiming for a release of Matrix v1.2 on <strong>February 2nd</strong>.</p>
<p>If you know of any MSCs which you believe should be included in Matrix v1.2, but haven't started/finished Final Comment Period yet, please bring them up in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a>, and we'll take a look. Thanks!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3635">MSC3635: Early Media for VoIP</a>!</p>
<p>When I first came across this MSC, I didn't know what &quot;Early Media&quot; as a concept referred to. Even after skimming the MSC... I still didn't really know. But I'll demystify it here in case it peaks your interest and you would like to learn more.</p>
<p>Early media is essentially any media that is exchanged between the moment you start a call, to the moment the other side picks up (a connection is established). For instance, the ringing you hear while waiting for someone to pick up (called &quot;ringback tones&quot;), or the &quot;busy&quot; tone you hear when the line is busy. Those audio bits are known as &quot;early media&quot;. Video can also fall into this category (though that's less common).</p>
<p>This MSC would essentially allow Matrix to introduce these concepts in Matrix-only calls (though these days the client just plays sounds while connecting), but more crucially would allow Matrix to interoperate with other protocols (like SIP) that expect to handle these features.</p>
<p>So yay, more interoperability and bridge compatibility!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After a somewhat bumpy process, we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/01/18/synapse-1-50-released">released Synapse 1.50</a> on Tuesday! The big thing you need to be aware of is that we're turning off support for Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6, including Linux distributions which ship with those versions by default (like Ubuntu 18.04 LTS). Please make sure your infrastructure is up-to-date.</p>
<p>I'm personally very excited that we tracked down <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11729">a bug</a> which could cause device list updates to get lost when being sent over federation. When device lists fall out of sync, it can cause failures when attempting to decrypt messages, since the keys may not have been sent to all of the user's devices.</p>
<p>We've also made quite a lot of progress in allowing Application Services to support end-to-end encryption via the still-experimental <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3202">MSC3202</a>.</p>
<p>For MSCs which <em>have</em> been merged into the Matrix Spec, we now implement <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a>, allowing guests to send state events into rooms, and we now use stable identifiers for cross-signing and fallback keys per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1756">MSC1756</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2732">MSC2732</a>. </p>
<p>Looking to the future: We're aiming to release 1.51 next week so it has plenty of time to burn in before we host <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/">FOSDEM 2022</a>. This is a pretty quick turnaround from 1.50, but we'll return to our usual fortnightly release cadence for subsequent releases. To that end, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.51.0rc1">1.51.0rc1</a> is out today; give it a shot. 😉</p>

<p>Hello again! In the last week we continued to optimize the rocksdb backend and Conduit in general, trying to get it as memory efficient as possible. Using valgrind we could see that memory was not getting released in some cases.</p>
<p>We found out that switching to the <code>jemalloc</code> allocator completely got rid of this problem and memory usage seems to be a lot more stable now!</p>
<p>All of this is currently available on the <code>next</code> branch. We are preparing to make a v0.3.0 release soon!</p>

<ul>
<li>Threads is already in Labs on Web, so go ahead and check it out!</li>
<li>For mobile, we’re hoping to release Threads to Labs in the next few weeks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Polls</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get ready to start asking more questions… Polls are nearly ready to go! You’ll be able to ask folks things like; their favourite superhero, which day you should grab lunch, or even the best way to make tea (milk first, always). ☕️
<ul>
<li>If you just can’t wait ‘til we’re ready to launch, you can enable Polls from Labs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Location Sharing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Location sharing is almost here! You’ll soon find a new setting to turn this on, which will give you the location sharing icon in your composer and can be used to tell people exactly where you are!
<ul>
<li>The setting will be in the next release on iOS and Android, and will start “off” by default. Once the feature is settled in, we’ll turn it on by default.</li>

<li>Analytics? Yes! Knowing how our users traverse our app, and understanding this cross-platform, will help us to tailor to your needs and make impactful improvements.

<p>Honoroit is a helpdesk matrix bot with end-to-end encryption support, that utilizes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440/">MSC3440 (Threading)</a> to act as a proxy between a customer (any matrix user) and your backoffice (users added in special room), each customer's room = thread in a backoffice room, where multiple operators can send messages to the same customer at once.</p>
<p>Pretty bad description, I know - check the source code to see screenshots.</p>
<p>Updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>the v0.9.2 release brings the fallback reply-to mode, so even on matrix clients that doesn't support threads yet you can use it with good ol' replies.</li>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Hot on the heels (relatively speaking) of v1.1 of the Spec being released in November, v1.2 is now on the horizon! As a reminder, we're working towards quarterly releases of the spec going forwards - no hard dates yet though.</p>
<p>While this is certainly an improvement in speed, when it comes to writing software and updating implementations: quarterly spec updates may actually seem <em>too fast</em>. This is OK; implementations of the spec are <strong>not</strong> expected to update as soon as a new spec release is published. Rather, it is more realistic to expect that the ecosystem updates gradually over the course of the next few months/year after the release.</p>
<p>Look forward to more concrete dates soon!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2702">MSC2702: Specifying semantics for Content-Disposition on media</a>!</p>
<p>This looks like a small, but useful improvement to the spec that never really received much love. Feel free to give it some!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy Friday everyone! Today the Synapse team has <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.50.0rc2">released Synapse 1.50.0rc2</a>. It fixes a particularly nasty federation-breaking regression that crept in during 1.50.0rc1. If you're currently running 1.50.0rc1, we implore you to update to 1.50.0rc2 as soon as possible!</p>
<p>In other news, a reminder that as of Synapse 1.50.0rc1, we have ended support for Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6 as per our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/deprecation_policy.html">dependency deprecation policy</a>, as upstream has marked them as end-of-life.</p>
<p>We'll let the community test 1.50.0rc2 over the weekend to ensure that no other regressions have emerged (please test if you can)! If not, expect Synapse 1.50 to land sometime early next week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has been a long time since my last TWIM post, so here's a summary of all exciting news:</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>We now support RocksDB as a backend. Migrating to RocksDB improved both my memory and IO usage a lot.</li>
<li>You can select the database backend at runtime. No need to recompile a special version anymore.</li>
<li>Lazy loading works. This means initial syncs are significantly faster (1-2 minutes instead of an hour!)</li>
<li>Voice calls are now supported (requires configuring a TURN server)</li>
<li>The report feature is now implemented and sends a report into the admin room</li>
</ul>
<p>Improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Much faster state resolution</li>
<li>Batch inserts for events</li>
<li>Better appservice docs</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is currently available on the <code>next</code> branch. We are preparing to make a v0.3.0 release soon!</p>
<p>Join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:fachschaften.org">#conduit:fachschaften.org</a> to help us test it.</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.10.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>RELAYMSG sending support 🚀</li>
<li>Allow forwarding all IRC noise to network room 🤫</li>
<li>Support ZNC self-message caps ✅</li>
<li>Support CHGHOST caps (prevents leave+join on host change) ✅</li>
<li>Fix owner auto-registration (regression) 🐛</li>
<li>Upgrade to Mautrix 0.14 ⬆️</li>
</ul>
<p>Sending RELAYMSGs have been requested for a while so now we do support that if the cap is added to request list. This makes plumbs on networks that support it work nicer. Receiving RELAYMSGs has not been implemented yet so they show up as external like before.</p>
<p>If you prefer keeping your IRC rooms clean without any IRC noise (mode changes etc.) you can now use a new FORWARD command in the network room to make all such events happen in the network room instead. This affects in-room commands as well.</p>
<p>ZNC users can now enjoy messages coming from your own clone in IRC rooms (including PMs!) if you wish so by keeping the znc.in/self-message cap enabled. This isn't extremely well tested yet but feedback welcome.</p>
<p>Not a breaking change but the caps support will cause connections to networks that ignore CAP requests take a few seconds longer unless you remove all the default caps for said network and it will never try requesting them again.</p>
<p>Mautrix 0.14 upgrade bumps the minimum version as well so packages beware.</p>
<p>Get some global warming from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>Hydrogen is a lightweight matrix client with legacy and mobile browser support</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're about to release 0.2.23 after somewhat of a release hiatus. We've been working on two fronts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the SDK out! Hydrogen was always meant to be easy to embedded, reuse in parts, and make customized versions of. But until now, actually doing that was quite challenging. Now that the SDK is out, you can use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hydrogen-view-sdk"><code>hydrogen-view-sdk</code></a> package in your projects and use parts of Hydrogen in your application. It's still early days, and we're still working out what symbols should be exported (finding a balance between APIs we want to support and utility), etc. Expect updates in the coming weeks. We're also not yet promising API stability for now, some APIs will very likely still change. Once we hit 1.0, we won't change things from underneath you anymore without increasing the major version. </li>
<li>Rich reply previews: as part of providing minimal support for threads (representing them as replies), we're switching from using the embedded reply fallback and actually looking up the replied-to message. One benefit is that reply previews will now updated when they are redacted (and edited, once we support that :).</li>
<li>Also fix some minor other things, like loading images when they are only partially visible, and a very basic location tile.</li>

<p>To try it out, add a widget to a room in the usual way, then look for the new &quot;maximise&quot; button in the room info panel's widget section. Please let us know in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#beyond-chat:matrix.org">#beyond-chat:matrix.org</a> or in issues if you have any feedback. 😄</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a> version 1.0.0 is out! I decided to make it 1.0.0 not because it is out of beta, but because it has most features you need to build a usable client.
That means: cross signing has landed into Trixnity! The next big features will be room key backup and push notification.</p>
<p>Here is the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>fully support cross signing</li>
<li>load members of rooms in an async way (you don't need to catch errors anymore)</li>
<li>reactive displayname and avatar url of the logged-in user</li>
<li>reactive avatar url for rooms</li>
<li>reactive is-direct-room state for rooms</li>
<li>better Android support for thumbnails</li>
<li>make part of device keys API public</li>
<li>merge SecureStore into Store (encrypt your database if you want to keep secrets secure)</li>
<li>move trixnity-client-api model-classes into separate module to use them e.g. for a matrix server implementation (thanks to <a href="https://gitlab.com/NicolasJouanin">@NicolasJouanin</a>)</li>
<li>fixed long standing bug of wrong room name calculation</li>

As of now, the bot supports webhooks from Github, Gitlab and Gitea (although support for this one is very light).
Some other projects might do that way better than this bot but this is a learning project, to learn step by step how client interact with servers.
The next step would be to add a CRT.sh integration to get notified when a certificate is issued for a certain range of domains (which is something we want since we saw an IRC bot do the same).</p>

<p>A Devianart Fork based on Matrix</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Matrix-Art is a new social network prototype on Matrix.</p>
<p>It is a direct Devianart style clone. It currently has a focus on only images but is going to get extended to other media types eventually.
I am doing this as a toy project, so it may sometimes have slow progress. The goal is covering the main functions Devianart provides (Posting, Sharing, Profiles, Following, Collections, Comments) as well as integrations to other social networks on matrix using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3639">MSC3639</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of things are currently still missing, but I am trying to get uploading working next :)</p>
<p>An instance is hosted at https://art.midnightthoughts.space/ and the code is at https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-art</p>
<p>Currently, the interface is limited to viewing basic data from a matrix room. In the future, there are plans to have an open registration as well as login with any account to use it. :)</p>
<p>Note however that I suggest against using your personal account just yet, even though the login works, as it may have unexpected room joins at this time. This is known and expected, but not production ready.</p>
<p>Also, at this time, there are no plans of e2ee support. This may get added after the main features are finished.</p>

<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for <del>this week</del> the last little bit, we've been working on getting MSCs merged into the formal spec itself in preparation for v1.2 this quarter. We expect the release to happen quite soon and to contain <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3610">Spaces</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3387">room versions 8 and 9</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">refresh tokens</a> (no spec PR yet) in addition to all the other wonderful stuff which has landed.</p>
<p>The merged MSCs can be seen over at <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/">https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/</a> where they're queued up for the next release. Look out for <code>Added in v1.2</code> labels throughout the spec, denoting what is new and exciting.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>The random MSC this week is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2192">MSC2192: Inline widgets</a> (I promise it was random, after a few re-rolls). Inline widgets are a concept that allows for rich functionality in the timeline without needing to necessarily specify an explicit event type. For example, video embeds, minigames, etc could all be represented by inline widgets instead of dedicated event types.</p>
<p>The MSC needs updating to handle <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767: Extensible Events</a> (and friends), but once there it could be a very powerful bit of functionality, with free fallback thanks to Extensible Events. </p>

<p>Sliding sync (aka sync v3) is described in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3575">MSC3575</a> - it's still very early days for the proposal which means a lot can change: and YOU can be a part of that. Please take a look at the MSC and provide any and all feedback, be it on the names of keys, format of JSON objects, or the kinds of operations that can be performed. I'm particularly interested in feedback from client developers who have complex room list sort orders or room list filtering requirements and bot/bridge developers who typically don't have a visible room list UI. Any and all feedback at this stage is welcome, visit <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sliding-sync:matrix.org">#sliding-sync:matrix.org</a> to join the discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Howdy folks, it is the time of the year where everyone scarpers! Anyway, perfect time to announce that <strong>matrix-hookshot has gotten it's first major release!</strong>. 1.0.0 is here!</p>
<p>For those not in the know, the hookshot bridge is used to bridge GitHub, GitLab, JIRA and Generic Webhooks into Matrix rooms. It doesn't just bridge into existing rooms, but can also spawn dynamic rooms based on aliases, send you your notifications in a DM and do lots of other wonderful things!</p>
<p>The notable changes from the 0.1.0 release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridge has now been renamed from matrix-github to matrix-hookshot.</li>
<li>Now supports JIRA and Generic Webhooks in addition to GitHub and GitLab.</li>
<li>Includes new commands and metrics reporting.</li>
<li>Includes <a href="https://half-shot.github.io/matrix-hookshot">complete documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get involved and start playing with it by checking out the release <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.0.0">here</a></p>
<p>And that will be my last TWIM entry of the year. Have a good one and stay safe all 🐶</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks! It was only last year we released the 1.0 release of hookshot, after many years of work to get it that far. I'm happy to announce that this week we've got <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.1.0">another release</a>. There are a number of buxfixes and improved documentation pieces landing (special shoutout to HarHarLinks for ensuring the docs are competent). The highlights are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Figma webhooks. this also means the archival of my old project <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-figma">matrix-figma</a></li>
<li>Support GitLab wiki page change events.</li>
<li>Added a new script <code>validate-config</code> which allows you to check your config file for simple errors. Handy for people writing ansible roles!</li>
<li>Add support for a html key on generic webhooks to set the HTML content of a Matrix message.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project can be found over at https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot/, with pretty pretty docs at https://half-shot.github.io/matrix-hookshot.

<blockquote>
<p>Heisenbridge roundup!</p>
<p>Release <del>v1.8.0</del> <del>v1.8.1</del> <del>v1.8.2</del> v1.9.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>Spaces support 🌃</li>
<li>Sort NAMES reply nicks 🔤</li>
<li><code>UNPLUMB</code> network command to force unplumbing without being in the room</li>
<li>Proper SASL external with CertFP with mechanism override option (see notes)</li>
<li>Disconnect and cleanup from networks that have no rooms open ♻️</li>
<li>Reply (and reject) DM requests to ghosts with <code>QUERY</code> command ↪️</li>
<li>Try to keep IRC users in the room at all costs if they are on the IRC channel</li>
<li>Fix assumption of all IRC replies to have arguments</li>
<li>Prevent accidental namespace changes to cause mayhem</li>
<li>Finally convert from homegrown Matrix API stuff to Mautrix</li>
<li>Bump Mautrix requirement to 0.12=&gt;0.14</li>
<li>Conduit support was broken in 1.8.x but fixed again in 1.9.0, sorry</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally there's network level spaces support with a new <code>SPACE</code> command. This creates a new bridge controlled space for the network and automatically manages rooms in and out. There's an issue/feature with Element that all rooms that have been converted to DMs with <code>/converttodm</code> will appear in all bridge spaces. The workaround is to convert them back to regular rooms.</p>
<p>CertFP SASL has been updated to do SASL external flow by default. If you are upgrading and have used CertFP with OFTC you need to run <code>SASL --mechanism=none</code> for it to connect again.</p>
<p>Abandoned networks where the user has left all rooms including the network room will now automatically disconnect and cleanup. This is more in line what people would expect and prevents idle connections from hanging around.</p>
<p>Get your third vaccination from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>This is a small bug fix release. If you reported an issue, there is a 15% chance it is fixed now! This release also supports pinned messages, although those will only show up after someone changed the pinned messages in a room currently (we didn't want to force a full resync just for such a small feature). The spaces list is also now nested, Nheko offers you quick access to your recently used reactions and Nheko will show you your direct chats in the sidebar. Apart from that there are quite a few bugfixes and smaller improvements, you can find the full changelog and downloads here: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases/tag/v0.9.1</p>
<p>Thank you everyone, who helped shape this release!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now is a lot more efficient. We now use one Threadpool instead of 3, got rid of more than 60% of the allocations when scrolling through messages, layout half as much content when scrolling, blurhashes decode in 10% of the time and jdenticons allocate ~10% as much temporary buffers. We also deleted around 1000 lines of unused code. Tooltips also shouldn't steal the mouse focus when scrolling anymore, which could lead to sudden stalls when scrolling.</p>
<p>Additionally edits now replace existing notifications, tastytea added a manpage and fixed blurry or incorrectly sized custom emoji, you can now send custom emotes via the inline completer using ~ and completers now show a scrollable list with more Elements than before. Advanced users can also now opt into an insecure client side secrets storage via a hidden setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're baaaaack! Anyway, last week Drake just translated all of Nheko into Spanish, you can now zoom in and pan in the image viewer, emojis shouldn't split up into their segments anymore and Nheko should always be sending the qualified version of it (according the to the unicode test files, not by just appending FE0F). Blurhashes should be even faster still and we now have support for running the call event loop on macOS and Windows (although call support is still disabled there for now). </p>
<p>We are also now working to restructure our README. It has a lot of outdated stuff in it and you really want to see screenshots pretty early in the README! You can sneak a peak here: https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/nheko/-/tree/README_updates</p>

But mainly, this release brings a bunch of CSS improvements: introducing automatic dark mode, and making it easier to change colors with CSS variables.</p>
<p>Here's the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relicense from GPLv3 to LGPLv3.</li>
<li>Rewrite large parts of the stylesheet to use flexbox.</li>
<li>Introduce CSS variables to the stylesheet.</li>
<li><code>.dark</code> and <code>.light</code> CSS classes with default values for dark/light mode.</li>
<li>Bugfix: &quot;View More&quot; button no longer blinks when auto-refreshing short comment sections.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> has had a v0.6.0-beta.3 release with beta support for crypto! It even includes documentation!</p>
<p>The crypto is considered beta quality at the moment: good enough to use for somewhat unimportant bots, but not fully recommended for production just yet. With that being said, I'm interested in bugs you run into - please use the issue tracker if you run into crypto not working.</p>
<p>Tutorials for the crypto setup are at https://turt2live.github.io/matrix-bot-sdk/tutorial-encryption.html</p>
<p>Note for appservice support to work then you'll need a Synapse with these PRs enabled (may require manual merge too):</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11538</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11617</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11215</li>
</ul>
<p>For non-linux platforms, the rust-sdk will try to build itself which means you might need a working Rust stack. The Rust SDK repo itself has more information: </p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/travis/node-bindings/crates/matrix-sdk-crypto-nodejs/README.md</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/travis/node-bindings/README.md</li>
</ul>
<p>Bots and appservices don't automatically support encryption, but adding encryption <em>should</em> be easy. The Rust SDK dependency is required in either case, sorry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don't think we've previously had any <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix/NixOS/nixpkgs</a> related entries in TWIM, so I'll start ^^</p>
<p>The current unstable channel has extended its Matrix ecosystem support to also include <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge">Heisenbridge</a> and <a href="https://conduit.rs/">Conduit</a> packages and modules. This makes it super easy to deploy any of those services: For example, my configuration for Heisenbridge is 21 lines long, and Conduit is only 11 lines. You can browse the available configuration options online: <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&amp;query=services.matrix-conduit"><code>services.matrix-conduit</code></a>, <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&amp;query=services.heisenbridge"><code>services.heisenbridge</code></a> (note that some of them are freeform and simply forward to the upstream configuration).</p>
<p>For those that are not into NixOS, a module is the code that turns the declarative configuration files into your running system setup. As an example, if you enable <code>services.heisenbridge</code> the following things are done for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new <code>heisenbridge</code> user and group for the service</li>
<li>Create and manage the registration file for the homeserver (i.e. automatically regenerate it after the configuration changed)</li>
<li>Create a systemd service that runs the <code>heisenbridge</code> command with the requested bridge configuration. The unit also sets a few systemd security hardening options.</li>
</ul>

<p>A supercharged episode this week with five super exciting demos!</p>
<h2 id="dept-of-spec-scroll">Dept of Spec 📜</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey all, it's me again, not-anoa, with your spec update. I don't have a graph for you this week, but I do have curated content which hopefully holds you over until next week 🙂 </p>
<p>This week we've seen a few new MSCs get opened up:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3567">MSC3567 - Allow requesting events from the start/end of the room history</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3570">MSC3570 - Room history visibility changes for relations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3571">MSC3571 - Relation aggregation pagination</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3572">MSC3572 - Relation aggregation cleanup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As demonstrated, a few of them are follow-on work from aggregations. A lot of the work is an effort to get <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675 - Serverside aggregations of message relationships</a> through FCP - it's changed quite a bit in the last week, so if you reviewed it before then please give it a quick read! </p>
<p>We're also gearing up for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767 - Extensible event types &amp; fallback in Matrix</a> receiving attention early next year. This is currently being evaluated by features like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3245">MSC3245 - Voice messages</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381 - Polls</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3488">MSC3488 - Static location sharing</a>. If all goes according to plan, the first pieces of Extensible Events will land soon.</p>
<p>Thib has caught me quite close to the deadline on TWIM, so while I don't have a random MSC for you this week I do recommend some light reading around aggregations and extensible events - these are both major features for Matrix and help shape the future for other, even more exciting, features.</p>

<h2 id="random-msc">Random MSC</h2>
<p>Since the script didn't run, I manually generated random numbers until I actually got one, that matches an MSC and is not a draft!</p>
<p>So the random MSC is: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2461">MSC2461: Proposal for Authenticated Content Repository API</a></p>
<p>The goal of this MSC is to restrict who can access files in your content repository, which is used to share files, images, voice messages and more on Matrix. Currently this is secured by using random identifiers, but this MSC wants to add a few more restrictions: A signed-in user can still access everything, but if you don't provide an access token, when downloading media, you either can access no media, only media that was sent from that server, only media which the server already downloaded or everything. The level of access can be set by the server admin.</p>
<p>I think this would be really nice to have, but it has various challenges when implementing it in clients and when it needs to work across federation. It could limit how much random users can fill up your disk though, which is especially important for small server admins!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy holidays! This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/14/synapse-1-49-0-released">released Synapse 1.49.0</a>, our last planned release of the year. This is the last release that supports Python 3.6 or PostgreSQL 9.6; if you've not upgraded, now is the time!</p>
<p>Most notably, this release includes stable support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a>. This is a more secure alternative to long-lived access tokens, and we'd encourage clients to implement support for refresh tokens as described in the MSC.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/releases/">Sygnal 0.11</a>, which includes <em>loads</em> of bugfixes. For the Element-managed Sygnal instances, this release has reduced our daily Sentry error rate by over 99%, dramatically improving the signal-to-noise ratio of our monitoring.</p>
<p>See you in January with Synapse 1.50! 🎄</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are planning to have a small release next week, that fixes a few issues with the 0.9.0 release. It would be lovely if some of you could test one of our <a href="https://matrix-static.neko.dev/room/!TshDrgpBNBDmfDeEGN:neko.dev/">nightlies</a> or could check if the translations for a language you speak are up to date in <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/#translations">our weblate</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the fixes this week include another crash fix for handling matrix links from your browser, notification bubbles that can show values over 9000(!), better preview images for sticker and emote packs created in Nheko, allowing you to click links in replies, a few layout and click area fixes. Nheko now also keeps track of your latest reactions and gives you easy access to them in the hover menu.</p>
<p>Nheko now also finally supports pinned messages! Most of you probably don't know, but that feature has pretty much always been in the matrix spec, but very few clients expose it. Today Nheko joins that rank! It's part of our goal to provide better support for building communities. Topics can be quite limiting, because they can only contain plain text. Pinned messages allow for much more creative freedom! They can also be encrypted, while state events currently never are, but the key for that isn't reshared, so currently experience in encrypted rooms is a tradeoff. Maybe we'll go for an encrypted description event in the future, but for now this seems to be a good solution to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Let's hope the current master branch is good and we'll have a release with ALL THE FIXES next week! And thank you everyone, who already translated and reported issues! It took less than 10 hours to have 5 languages updated to 100%! Last year we didn't even have that many languages at 100%! You guys are AMAZING! &lt;3</p>

<h3 id="matrix-highlight">Matrix Highlight <a href="https://github.com/DanilaFe/matrix-highlight">↗</a></h3>
<p>A decentralized and federated way of annotating the web based on Matrix.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@daniel:matrix.danilafe.com">Daniel</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a matrix-based tool for highlighting and annotating websites. By building on top of matrix, we can effectively have a decentralized, federated and collaborative way to leave notes and highlights on pages. I wrote a <a href="https://danilafe.com/blog/introducing_highlight/">brief introduction on my blog</a>, as well as made a little bit of a simple <a href="https://youtu.be/Q3h5A0DsE1s">demo video</a>. Here's a copy-pasted list of planned and existing features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Create and send website annotations over Matrix.</li>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Store data in a decentralized and federated manner.</li>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Share highlights with other users, including those on other servers.</li>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Group annotations together and create multiple annotation groups</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong>: Use Matrix's End-to-End encryption to ensure the secure transmission and storage of highlight data.</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong>: Leverage the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/gsouquet/threading-via-relations/proposals/3440-threading-via-relations.md">m.thread MSC</a> to allow users to comment on and discuss
highlights.</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong>: Use something like <a href="https://archivebox.io/">ArchiveBox</a> to cache the current version of a website and prevent annotations from breaking.</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong> Highlight PDFs in addition to web pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Come join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-highlight:matrix.danilafe">#matrix-highlight:matrix.danilafe</a>.com to receive updates about the project!</p>
<p>I haven't published the code just yet, but I'm going to as soon as the tool is in better shape.

<p>A Social Annotation Tool Powered by Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gleachkr:matrix.org">gleachkr</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been teaching a class this semester using a tool built on the matrix-js-sdk and tentatively entitled <a href="https://github.com/opentower/populus-viewer">populus-viewer</a>. Populus-viewer uses Matrix as a backend for the social annotation of PDFs, with the goal of helping matrix become a platform for teaching and scholarly collaboration. If you're interested in learning more, or adopting populus-viewer in your teaching, come visit <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opentower:matrix.org">#opentower:matrix.org</a>! </p>
<p>Populus-Viewer currently supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotation of PDFs with highlights and pin-drops</li>
<li>Matrix conversations based on annotations</li>
<li>Audio and video messages</li>
<li>Replies, reactions, and redactions</li>
<li>Markdown for rich text</li>
<li>LaTeX for mathematical notation</li>
<li>Typing notifications</li>
<li>Synchronized reading position across devices</li>
<li>SSO, with single-click links for embedding in an LMS like Canvas or Blackboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the project develops, I'm hoping to continue to polish the reading experience, and to add support for other mime types (audio and video especially).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TWIM I got started on the chat part of <a href="https://git.pixie.town/f0x/matrix-streamchat">matrix-streamchat</a>, to provide a lightweight embeddable Matrix client to be used alongside streams in Owncast and PeerTube. It will use guest access, and lots more features to come like extensive custom emote support. For now refactoring a bunch of things first before adding more flashy things, but who knows, you might see me do it live on https://stream.pixie.town</p>

<h2 id="version-2-5-0-released">Version 2.5.0 Released!</h2>
<p>simplematrixbotlib is an easy to use bot library for the Matrix ecosystem written in Python and based on matrix-nio. Version 2.5.0 adds improvements to the config feature.</p>
<h3 id="feature-changes">Feature Changes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add allow/block lists: This allows bot developers to specify allow/block lists of users who have permission to interact with the bot using regex.</li>
<li>Permissions can checked with <code>Match.is_from_allowed_user()</code>, which lets the bot developer choose which responses are restricted.</li>
<li>The allow/block lists can by modified at runtime via the <code>Config.add_allowlist()</code>, <code>Config.remove_allowlist()</code>, <code>Config.add_blocklist()</code>, and <code>Config.remove_blocklist()</code> methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>A thank you to HarHarLinks for their contributions to version 2.5.0!</p>

<p>An open source integration manager for matrix clients, like Element.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension">Dimension</a>, an integration manager alternative for Element, has received a bunch of updates over the last couple weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added (early) support for <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot</a>'s GitHub, Jira, and Webhooks bridging. </li>
<li>Most of a redesign complete to make it feel more like an Element UI rather than something special and third party.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in helping out in getting the redesign finished, please check out https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension/issues/458 which has reference mockups and linked issues. The major parts are the &quot;complex bots&quot; (Travis CI, RSS, etc) and the sticker integration. Unfortunately, I don't have enough free time to work on it myself in the near term, but will get back to it eventually 🙂 </p>
<p>And now, a complementary screenshot of the Good™ parts:

<p>I made this project a while ago to hack in a relay mode to the <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/facebook">mautrix Facebook bridge</a>. But as of this week, that bridge supports relaying natively! 🎉 Thus, my main motivation for maintaining imposter-bot is obsolete, and the project will be on indefinite hiatus.</p>
<p>With that said, it can (mostly) still be used to add relay support to any bridges that don't yet support a relay mode themselves--but native relay support is always better!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who's shown interest in the project, and to tulir  for making such great bridges!</p>

<p>A project has started to re-implement the venerable mIRCstats for Matrix!

However, we're moving quickly, and I hope to have some initial easy-to-use viz in place over the Christmas break.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo K.</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Board games are great. And Matrix and its widget api turned out to be an excellent environment to create collaborative board games. With some really impressive conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't have to maintain a server with a database.</li>
<li>I don't have to create a custom account systems user need to register. They play with their matrix account, which also makes accessibility great. Someone invites you in a room with the game and you can play!</li>
<li>I just need to host one static file and ppl will be able to play as long as that static site exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project tries to be two things. A tech demo and inspiration to what is possible with widgets (Especially, with the changes on how widgets can be displayed in element (Check the &quot;matrix live&quot; Demos! 😊) )
Second it should serve as source and resource. For ideas and solutions on how no trust games can be executed without server (third party) side logic. And, for the ones interested, also as a resource on how widgets are implemented.</p>
<p>Last but not least the game Saint Petersburg is really fun. It takes a couple of minutes to grasp the rules but it is one of those games where there are so many things that can be considered with simple rules that it becomes more and more exciting with each round. So I really invite you to check out the <a href="https://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/rules4/Saint%20Petersburg%20-%20rules.pdf">rules</a> and give it a try. Its best to start in the <a href="https://github.com/toger5/st-petersburg-widget">Git Repo</a> or join the this room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#st-petersburg-auth:matrix.org">#st-petersburg-auth:matrix.org</a></p>
<p>To put it simple, the widget works like this: The game state is stored in the room state and is updated through the widget directly.
This of course raises <strong>questions</strong>: How is it still possible to prohibit users from cheating and manually changing parameters like, how much money they own. Everyone (who has the permission) is always able to send whatever state events they want?
How is it possible to draw random cards if there is no third party involved. Could I not just send a state event with the cards that I hope are going to be drawn and are beneficial for me. Can we make card drawing deterministic? Not really since then everyone know what is going to happen. Which kind of breaks the game...</p>
<p>I would be super happy, if someone is interested and wants to find answer to the questions above by checking out the <a href="https://github.com/toger5/st-petersburg-widget/blob/main/README.md">README</a>.

<p>Last week the Matrix Scientists had turned this room into a portal to TWIM bot's ship tank so we could all fuel it with news about our work. The spec and hookshot news were reported late when the tank was already full, sending TWIM bot's ship into hyperspeed mode 🚀</p>
<p>We lost contact with the bot for a few days but managed to restore a connection with it. It appeared to have crashed on the green planet of Fuj'ehr. Its ship shattered in pieces at impact! 💥</p>
<p>The bot managed to find most of them, but some critical pieces of the engine were missing. We needed to find those pieces quickly before the mushy ground of Fuj'ehr swallows them forever! 😱</p>
<p>The Editor has asked the Matrix Scientists to reconfigure the room and bridge it to TWIM bot's navigation tools. Each news report highlighted the position of a piece of engine on its map. 🗺️</p>

<p>Extensible events are coming! With lots of potential usecases to be built on top of the concept (such as threading, polls, and any type of data one would like to through on top of existing room events), extensible events are finally getting some love. New MSCs are available above, which detail some of these usecases. Exciting times!</p>
<p>A small correction from last week's issue: the next aggregations MSC to be focused on (after <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (serverside aggregations) is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2677">MSC2677</a> (annotations and reactions), as it's a more pressing blocker for usecases such as threading and polls.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Spec Core Team is continuing to wind down in preparation for the holidays ☃️</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3015">MSC3015: Room state personal overrides</a>.</p>
<p>Quite a novel concept, and one that would enable many usecases, such as the ones described in the MSC itself.
Check it out if that's something that interests you!

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we cut Synapse release candidate <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.49.0rc1">1.49.0rc1</a> It includes a bunch of work to supporta plethora of MSCs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675/">MSC 2675</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/main/proposals/2918-refreshtokens.md#msc2918-refresh-tokens">MSC2918</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946</a>), a crop of bugfixes and improvements to our documentation which incorporate Synapse's old wiki. And as ever, there's a bunch of internal type hinting to keep the Synapse team's blood pressure at healthy levels.</p>
<p>The formal release of Synapse 1.49.0 is scheduled for the coming Tuesday. This will be the last Synapse release of 2021 as the Synapse team prepare for a break over the Christmas period. Releases will continue at the usual pace in the new year, with 1.50.0rc1 slated for 2022/01/04 and 1.50.0 for 2022/01/11.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Synapse 1.49 will be the last version to support Python 3.6, PostrgreSQL 9.6, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic): by our next release, these will have reached their upstream end-of-life. If you're reliant on any of these platforms, please ensure you have plans to upgrade.</p>
<p>In other news, we're <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#sygnal-0110-2021-12-09">preparing</a> to release a new version of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a> with a series of fixes for common errors.

<p>NeoChat version 21.12 is out! You may have noticed that this version number is roughly twenty times higher than the previous one. This means that NeoChat is now twenty times as good as the last version. Or it means that version numbers are utterly meaningless and we switched to a date-based version number system since NeoChat is now released together with many other plasma-mobile related apps. This also means that new versions will arrive monthly from now on. New features and fixes in this version include - but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spell checking while writing a message</li>
<li>Improved markdown to html conversion when sending a message</li>
<li>Built-in theme switching</li>
<li>Various fixes to login, logout and account switching</li>
<li>Support for custom emojis</li>

With the jump to date headers, that will be a thing of the past 😌.

<p>The members of the Federation have been very active and helped TWIM bot to find all the pieces of its ship! TWIM bot assembled everything together and put the engine back in its place... but at the last moment, as it was ready to take off, another bright spot appeared on the map following madlittlemods late report!</p>
<p>How could this happen? All the pieces of the engine were already there! Unsure of what to do, the bot asked Earth for directions. Earth confirmed: it was worth going to that new bright spot on the map.</p>
<p>The bot welded back the plate of the engine casing, made sure nothing could get into the ship in its absence, and started heading to the mysterious spot. The signal of our communication tools with TWIM bot weakens as it enters in the thick forest of Fuj'ehr…</p>

<p>One thing you might not know is that TWIM bot is a space traveler, sent by the Matrix scientists to explore that zone called &quot;The Possibilities&quot;. The <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> room is a portal to its energy tank, and we had received a distress signal!</p>
<p>To help the TWIM explorer fulfil its mission, we asked the Matrix community to fuel it with news before it crashed into space debris made of aggregated ignorance!</p>
<p>This week again, the community has been very active and explored many possibilities of the Matrix universe!</p>

<p>For this week's Matrix Live my guest is Amandine and we're discussing how Element and 50 other organisations are trying to shape the future of EU's law for more interoperability. Bonus point: we have a double bridge demo with Matrix, Slack and Telegram!</p>

<p>A group of Finnish Matrix admins have set up a free homeserver for Finnish public called pikaviestin.fi (literally instant messenger dot fi). It offers a bunch of bridges and registration requires an e-mail address in one of Finnish e-mail providers or organizations. We welcome all Finns to register there and help decentralize Matrix. Support room can be found at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#aula:pikaviestin.fi">#aula:pikaviestin.fi</a></p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The end of the year is drawing to a close. Thus many of the Spec Core Team members are focusing on implementation in order to meet deadlines. Review is still occurring though! As above, we have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a> (allow guests to send more event types). This was born out of next-generation VoIP work, but it should have a positive impact on improving the guest experience in Matrix on the whole.</p>
<p>Otherwise work is still ongoing by Bruno and others on untangling the aggregations MSCs, specifically <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2676">MSC2676</a>.</p>
<p>And finally, Alexandre Franke has <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3542">PR'd some work</a> to allow for matrix.org's OpenAPI spec to be widely available, meaning anyone with a <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> (or other <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> viewer) client can easily pull it and start sending requests against a Matrix homeserver. Fun times!</p>

<p>Goooood evening TWIM readers!</p>
<p>I want to start by drawing attention to a blog post which we published today: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/03/type-coverage-for-sydent-motivation">Type coverage for Sydent: motivation</a>. This the first in a series of three articles discussing what we've learned from making Sydent pass the <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/">mypy</a> type checker in strict mode. Improving type coverage across Synapse, Sygnal, and Sydent has been a major focus of the backend team at Element for the past few months, and we think we've learned a few useful things in the process.</p>
<p>This week we also <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/30/synapse-1-48-0-released">released Synapse 1.48</a> with loads of internal improvements, new Admin APIs, better alignment with the Matrix 1.1 spec, and more. We're planning one more release for the year, 1.49 on December 14th, and then we're taking a break until Synapse 1.50 on January 11th.</p>
<p>Importantly: Synapse 1.49 will be the last release to support Python 3.6, PostrgreSQL 9.6, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) — if you're reliant on any of these platforms, please ensure you have plans to upgrade.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think of the article (and the Synapse release!), and we'll see you next week!</p>

<h3 id="gitter">Gitter</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org">madlittlemods (Eric Eastwood)</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the vein of <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Gitter feature parity</a> on Matrix, we've made the first steps towards a better public static archive. We merged an experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> into <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> which lets you use the unstable <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> client API endpoint go from a given timestamp to the closest event ID. This will allow us to implement a calendar jump to date interface to be able to navigate to any day in the rooms history. Our first target to add the jump to date UI in is <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen</a> since we plan to server-side render Hydrogen for the actual public static archive as well.</p>
<p>To enable the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> unstable API endpoints in Synapse, add <code>experimental_features</code> -&gt; <code>msc3030_enabled: true</code> to your <code>homeserver.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/client/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/rooms/&lt;roomID&gt;/timestamp_to_event?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;
</span><span>{
</span><span>    &quot;event_id&quot;: ...
</span><span>    &quot;origin_server_ts&quot;: ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Also as part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>, when you use the client API endpoint, if your homeserver sees that the closest event it has locally in the database is next to a gap in the history, it will go out and ask other federated homeservers what they have as the closest event instead.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/timestamp_to_event/&lt;roomID&gt;?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;
</span><span>{
</span><span>    &quot;event_id&quot;: ...
</span><span>    &quot;origin_server_ts&quot;: ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>*--</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> to import batches of historical messages is still marching along getting some polishing passes and strengthening the assertions in the Complement tests to make sure things are going absolutely correctly. It's also good to see <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> utilizing it and catching a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11241">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11219">bugs</a> along the way 💪.</p>

<p>Stop the press. This is a last minute TWIM. We've been beavering away on <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot</a>. It's gained many features in the last week, but the big thing is that hookshot has gained the ability to provision connections over a provisioning API, which means it should hook nicely into Dimension (and other integration managers, in the future)!</p>
<p>Other notable features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple webhooks per room</li>
<li>Support for the username/text fields on an incoming webhook (slack style)</li>
<li>Named webhooks, so each hook now has a sensible displayname</li>
<li>The ability to spawn GitHub actions from rooms using the <code>!gh workflow run</code> command</li>
<li>Lots of new supported events from GitLab, such as reviews and tag pushes</li>
<li>Hosted documentation (so all of the above is easy to setup), it's a bit in progress atm.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're aiming for a release very very soon, hopefully in the next week or so!

<p>We finally figured out what caused the issues with the flatpak on GNOME, especially on Arm. It should now work properly, if you use Flathub. On the Pinephone (and other systems, that don't set a locale/use the C locale), timestamps should now not be needlessly long anymore. Redactions got a face-lift to distinguish them better from normal messages. We added a workaround for Synapse not allowing you to leave a banned room. We now delete the room from the room list permanently if Synapse returns &quot;unknown room&quot; when trying to leave it. Spaces can now show the entire hierarchy in the sidebar (if you pull it out) and you can navigate to subspaces by clicking on them in the roomlist, even if you collapsed the space hierarchy in the sidebar.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">Krille Fear</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we have released FluffyChat 1.0.0 with a whole new design, a lot of bug fixes and huge performance improvements.</p>
<h3 id="new-design">New design</h3>
<p>The new design has bigger message bubbles with fancy shadows and bigger fonts. The contrast has been improved and some elements, like the time on every single message bubble, are now hidden by default. But they are not gone! Detailed message information are now accessible in the new message info page, where we not also can see the message type and the timestamp, but also the whole JSON source code of each timeline event.</p>
<h3 id="spaces">Spaces</h3>
<p>Spaces have got a lot improvements and bug fixes. They have moved to the bottom bar of the chat list (while this bottom bar is still hidden if you have not joined any space yet). The multi account switcher have instead been moved to a top left drop-down menu. So we finally got rid of the drawer, which seems to be a deprecated material design feature anyway. This new UX makes spaces much easier to use. You can long press on them to go to the space settings and long press on any chat in the chat list, to add or remove a chat to (or from) a space.
We still have no support for the spaces summary API though so we don't have yet the ability to discover new rooms inside of a space but this feature might land soon in the Matrix Dart SDK.</p>
<h3 id="multi-account">Multi Account</h3>
<p>FluffyChats multi account is still in beta but got a lot of bug fixes as well. You are now able to sort your accounts in &quot;bundles&quot; which can be very handy. The new account switcher button gives you a much better overview over your connected Matrix accounts now.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>We did a lot refactoring under the hood in our Matrix Dart SDK and have improved our in-app database a lot. On the web it now uses IndexedDB natively while it tunes all database transactions on all platforms. This leads to the fastest FluffyChat experience we ever had and makes the app finally kinda usable with bigger accounts on all platforms. The room list is now lazy loaded which speeds up the app start (especially with multi account enabled) a lot.
Choose your own primary color
This was a long requested feature. You can now choose your favorite color to style your FluffyChat for your needs:</p>
<p>What will you choose? Let me know in the comments. I mostly like blue on my Ubuntu desktop.</p>
<h3 id="new-major-version">New major version?</h3>
<p>Ahhh by the way... What does it mean that we now have FluffyChat 1.0.0? It does NOT mean that the previous versions were not yet stable or ready for daily use. It just means that we make so many changes at once that we thought, bumping the first digit of our pseudo-semver version string might make sense. We totally messed up our versioning and are now going to do it better. Promised!!
What's next?
We are often asked: What is the roadmap of FluffyChat?
Well... we still don't have a clear roadmap and might never have. FluffyChat is completely driven by volunteers. But what I can say that we would like to do in the next months is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better QA -&gt; We would like to write some integration tests, push release candidates before new releases and involve everyone in testing them to offer the best stability possible.</li>
<li>Native video calls -&gt; Yes! There will soon land support for native video calls in the Matrix Dart SDK and we are going to implement this in FluffyChat.</li>
<li>Stories -&gt; Like you might know from SnapChat, WhatsApp or Instagram, stories are little messages you can send to all of your contacts and which will disappear after 24 hours. I would really like to implement this in FluffyChat!</li>
<li>Better notifications for iOS</li>
<li>Deeper support for spaces</li>
<li>Knocking feature</li>
<li>Drag&amp;Drop for web</li>
</ul>
<p>But as I said this is what we would like to do. We can't give any warranties on anything. We can only do our best. But you can help us if you like (You don't have to).</p>

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a>, a multiplatform Matrix SDK written in Kotlin, has grown up since the last release 6 month ago! It has it first release candidate for v1.0.0!</p>
<p>If you don't heard about Trixnity: Trixnity aims to be strongly typed, customizable and easy to use. You can register custom events and Trixnity will take care, that you can send and receive that type.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing is the new trixnity-client module. It provides a high level client implementation and allows you to easily implement clients for Desktop, Mobile and Web. You just need to render data from and passing user interactions to Trixnity. The key features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
exchangeable database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
fast cache on top of the database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
E2E (olm, megolm)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
verification</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
room list</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
timelines</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
user and room display name calculation</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
asynchronous message sending without caring about E2E stuff or online status</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
media support (thumbnail generation, offline &quot;upload&quot;, etc.)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
redactions</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, Trixnity only supports JVM in all modules, but JS and Native will follow soon (to be exact: when Kotlin 1.6.10 and ktor 2.0.0 is released). I also implemented the module trixnity-olm, which implements the wrappers of libolm for Kotlin JVM/JS/Native.</p>
<p>Cross signing is one of the next big features, I want to implement.</p>

<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (serverside aggregations) is getting lots of updates from Bruno in order to align the proposal with what is currently implemented in the wild (as it's easier to iterate on incremental improvements from a starting point grounded in reality). This MSC is a bit of a special case though, as it was implemented with stable prefixes before the MSC landed (in the before times...).</p>
<p>Regardless, thank you very much to Bruno for going through and finally untangling and help land aggregations in the spec! This MSC is one of four which describe how aggregations should work in Matrix, and it's great to see them finally being properly spec'd, especially as further features start to be built on top of them (such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440/">threading</a>!).</p>
<p>And finally, a further thank you to community members <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3509">an OpenAPI schema fix</a>!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a>!</p>
<p>This proposal aims to allow appservices to get ever greater visibility into what is happening on the homeserver, while still maintaining full process separation.</p>
<p>A lot of the time solutions to complex problems require knowing when a user has registered or logged in, with what name/3pids etc, when users change their emails, etc. Hooking into these non-room-based actions can help with developing useful features. Maybe you want an appservice that plays a sound effect whenever a user signs up to your homeserver!</p>
<p>These days, that is often achieved by homeserver implementation-specific solutions, such as <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/">modules</a> in Synapse. Being able to notify of these events using a standard API shape would be hugely beneficial to generalisation of projects.</p>
<p>So give the proposal a look over and review if that interests you!

<p>As predicted last week, we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/23/synapse-1-47-1-released">released Synapse 1.47.1</a> on Tuesday. This is a security release which fixes an issue with Synapse's built-in media repository. Admins are strongly encouraged to upgrade.</p>
<p>Otherwise, relatively slow week: a handful of of the team have been away (Happy Thanksgiving, Americans!), but we <em>did</em> release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.48.0rc1">Synapse 1.48.0rc1</a>. Most importantly, this release candidate includes changes to improve the efficiency of large background updates from past releases, which should significantly reduce database load when upgrading. It also adds support for the <code>/v3</code> APIs defined in version 1.1 of the Matrix specification.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about 1.48 when it's formally released next week, but as always, we appreciate folks trying out the release candidates and letting us know how they behave.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver">Matrix Webhook Receiver</a></p>
<p>Do you like to receive notifications in matrix?
Matrix Webhook Receiver (MWR) is an add-on for the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-webhooks">matrix-appservice-webhooks</a> bridge. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">Webhooks</a> are essentially web interfaces for applications to &quot;push&quot; data to.
The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.</p>
<p>This is where MWR comes in:
It can receive any (JSON) content, optionally reformat it nicely (customizable!), and forward it to the webhooks bridge which will post it to a room for you. If you are running any software service, there is a good chance it can notify you via webhooks!</p>
<p>Right now, several example configurations exist, ready for you to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>GitLab (including Community Edition/self hosted)</li>
<li>Ansible Tower/AWX</li>
<li>Grafana Alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here is the GitHub webhook as seen in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org">#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org</a>:
<img src="/blog/img/webhook_receiver.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>More examples of apps currently in development: Prometheus Alertmanager, Jellyfin</p>
<p>It is also easy to use to send messages from the commandline with standard tools (<code>curl</code>), e.g. for your cron jobs! See the README for an example.</p>
<p>Some other webhook matrix things exist, but often require</p>
<ul>
<li>➖ admin access to server (appservices)</li>
<li>➖ installing and running and maintaining a specific bot per service</li>
<li>➖ create and set up accounts and passwords for each bot to use</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, MWR requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>➖ matrix-appservice-webhooks set up on your server by your admin</li>
<li>➖ some knowledge of how to send POST requests for one time setup. I want to improve that, suggestions are welcome!</li>
<li>➕ MWR can be installed and run by anyone who can access the bridge</li>
<li>➕ one single MWR supports any amount of notifying apps!</li>
<li>➕ you don't need admin access to the server to add more apps</li>
<li>➕ no need to develop a bot/plugin to support new apps, just write a quick jinja template</li>
<li>➕ multiple people can use a single MWR instance by sharing HTTP basic auth credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>Other features:</p>
<ul>
<li>can post into encrypted rooms (see readme)</li>
<li>automatically generated API docs</li>
<li>message formatting presets including html markup or m.notice</li>
<li>arbitrarily customizable webhook URLs</li>
<li>list and manage currently installed webhooks in your browser (<a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver/blob/main/examples/GUI_screenshot.png">screenshot</a>)</li>

<p>Hey folks! Some exciting new news on the bridge front: I've renamed <code>matrix-github</code> to <code>matrix-hookshot</code> to better reflect it's not-just-GitHub-ness. That's not all though, as there are new features too:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridge now supports <strong>Rust</strong> as a companion language (we're aiming to rewrite critical sections in rust). Some parts of the formatting code have already been rewritten.</li>
<li>The bridge now supports JIRA (full puppeting!)</li>
<li>The bridge now supports generic webhooks too, with the ability to write <strong>custom handling code</strong> inside the state event to process these hooks into pretty messages.</li>
<li>Basic support for GitHub discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the works:</p>
<ul>
<li>A provisioning API to hook into integration managers</li>
<li>More GitLab support</li>
<li>Better GitHub discussions support</li>

<blockquote>
<p>After the 0.9.0 release last week, we have of course been busy fixing all the bugs different people reported. Messing around with the sticker pack editor and then leaving room should not make Nheko crash anymore. The problems where the flatpak has issues starting on Gnome systems are still under investigation. We thought we had a solution, but that seems to have broken other stuff! 💥</p>
<p>Apart from that we have been doing some after release party cleanup. Apart from some refactorings, you can now filter your rooms on whether they are a direct chat or not in the sidebar. This is in addition to the filters we already had for favourites, spaces and your other personal tags. User colors should also now be much less biased towards blue and jdenticons should have more variance. Expect the next release to be a much more colorful experience!</p>
<p>Speaking of colors, Twily made this awesome ZX Spectrum inspired logo after we changed our Gitlab bot to be more colorful! Check it out:

<p>maubot <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> was released last weekend. Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling encryption should be much easier: the device ID can be entered in the web UI or you can just do <code>mbc auth --update-client</code> to automatically log in and store the access token and device ID in maubot.</li>
<li><code>mbc auth</code> can now log in with SSO.</li>
<li>The standalone mode for running a single plugin with a static config is now mostly functional and <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/maubot/usage/standalone.html">somewhat documented</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I finally took a day to figure out Sphinx/autodoc and made some decent-looking autogenerated <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/python/latest/">docs for mautrix-python</a>. I'll probably extend that to generate maubot-specific API references too eventually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today is a good day for those calling me a spy, someone not wanting to care about privacy and for those who did publicly harass me for server_stats.</p>
<p>People using the API likely already noticed it wasn't reachable for a while. Effective immediately I am currently leaving all rooms  the bot is part of. This will take days or even months considering this are 6397 rooms at the time of writing. I am not going into the motives of why I am shutting it down. It comes down to personal reasons.</p>
<p>There won't be any dump of the data. The source will be kept public. Note though if anyone ever tries to run it that you need about 600GB of space for synapse, a lot of CPU, a lot of RAM and plenty of workers as this can easily crash synapse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Server_Stats was an incredibly useful project. It pains me a lot to see it go, but it pains me even further that its author got harassed. This is not an acceptable behaviour, and we are better than that as a community. Thanks for this incredible project MTRNord, it's been both exciting and useful.</p>

We needed witnesses to solve the case: did things really happen this week? And the witnesses showed up! A huge thanks to everyone in the Matrix community who reported their progress, and to everyone currently working on making awesome projects around Matrix!</p>

<p>A very very dense and exciting wrap up of what's happening these days in the Matrix space by Matrix Foundation co-founders Matthew &amp; Amandine! Matrix is stepping up a gear with blazing fast Sync v3, Threading Support, VoIP, VR, a new release of the Spec, always more monthly active users, a full security audit and progress on P2P.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>

<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>

<p>This week we finally, finally had one of the aggregation-related MSCs, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> (event relationships) enter final comment period! This MSC, along with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issue-406544216">several others</a>, document the stuff that powers message edit, reactions, the upcoming threading and polls MSCs, and much more! So it's really great to see the MSCs start to actually land.</p>
<p>Speaking of threading <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> has had a good amount of review from the Spec Core Team last week. Threading in Matrix has been a long awaited feature for chat applications - as well as helping extend the flexibility of Matrix as a data structure even further. The MSC relies on both <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (or a modified version of it), so the latter will be an area of focus for review for next week.</p>

<p>It seems that the recent <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">Matrix v1.1</a> has drummed up some more community support for spec PRs.

<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2867">MSC2867: Marking rooms as unread</a>!</p>
<p>This is definitely a feature that I would love to have for chat. Note that this MSC proposes marking <em>a room</em> as unread, rather than a specific point in the room's timeline. This is intentional as noted in the document, as the latter is more complicated, as it intersects with sending out read receipts to other users.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> we plan to release a <strong>security release, Synapse 1.47.1</strong> on the coming <strong>Tuesday, 23rd of November</strong>; see the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/18/pre-disclosure-upcoming-security-release-of-synapse-1-47-1">predisclosure</a>.</p>
<p>We released Synapse 1.47.0 after squashing a couple of problems related to database migrations remaining in 1.47.0rc2.  Briefly, this release includes</p>
<ul>
<li>new features for users of the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin</a> and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">module</a> APIs;</li>
<li>a number of long-standing bug fixes, including a thorny bug which prevented joining certain old rooms; and</li>
<li>continuing efforts to prototype new MSCs and improve type coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/17/synapse-1-47-0-released">blog post</a> has a better summary, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0">GitHub</a> has the full gory details.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.1">Sydent 2.5.1</a>, a minor release which improves the way we handle and log various error cases.</p>
<p>Thank you as ever to our community contributors, and everyone out there who's using Synapse to communicate!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> also reminds us</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we release the fix, the changes will be publicly known and bad actors will have the ability to deduce the vulnerability. Most servers don't run release candidates, so releasing the fix in an RC will mean there's a larger window for an attacker to exploit the problem. Internally, there will be an RC deployed to test homeservers and eventually matrix.org. This means we'll be able to confidently recommend the upgrade to server administrators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dkasak:termina.org.uk">dkasak</a> adds</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that's the very reason we have dedicated security releases, instead of just rolling the security fixes into a feature release. The security release doesn't contain anything new apart from the security fix so it minimizes the chance of things going wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep your servers up to date, and your users safe, administrators!</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.7.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement &quot;best effort&quot; basic IRC moderation in plumbed rooms if bot has ops on IRC</li>
<li>Allow configuring topic sync for plumbs (IRC&lt;-&gt;Matrix or one way)</li>
<li>Allow using forward slash (/) as MXID separator for IRC ghosts</li>
<li>Bump max mautrix version to &lt;0.12</li>
<li>Small fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Plumb moderation! If the bridge bot has ops on IRC it will do its best to map kicks and bans (regarding IRC users) from Matrix. This definitely isn't perfect and is meant as a convenience.</p>
<p>Topic synchronization is now configurable for plumbs as well to make it possible to share the same topic between an IRC channel and a plumbed Matrix room. Default is still off and it requires the bridge bot to have enough PL to work.</p>
<p>The separator for IRC ghosts can now be changed to forward slash (/) from the default underscore (_). This happens by modifying the regex in the registration file. Only do this for new installations and it will cause <em>all</em> IRC users to duplicate in rooms who you can't remove and probably other bad side effects as well. The default may be changed in the future.</p>
<p>There were lots of refactoring issues so I hope I fixed all of them 🙈.</p>
<p>Best effort your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>An important note on the interesting projects using Matrix for the login: those are community projects, and there are MSCs in the works to &quot;do it right&quot; at the Spec level!</p>
<p>As Matthew Hodgson <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29242445">reported in a comment on Hacker News</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The direction we're headed in the Matrix spec core team is instead towards replacing Matrix's current auth mechanisms with normal Open ID Connect (rather than wrapping our own OIDC-like thing, as we do today) - as per https://github.com/sandhose/matrix-doc/blob/msc/sandhose/oauth2-profile/proposals/2964-oauth2-profile.md The common login flow would then be for users to be authed by their server using a trusted OIDC identity provider, rather than ever trusting arbitrary clients with their credentials.</p>

<p>I have compiled <a href="https://austinhuang.me/matrix-homeservers.html">a list of public homeservers</a> available for registration, since previous such efforts to make these homeservers more discoverable fell through. This list serves as a sanitized version of the asra.gr list, with only homeservers intended for public consumption included. It is a static list and does not include pings, but rather than focusing on the technical aspect, my list has an emphasis on the written rules of a homeserver, which I believe to play a larger role in the Matrix experience. Hope this can spark other efforts in maintaining a better list!</p>

<p>This week my guest is Greg who's been organising the Ansible Contributor Summit on Matrix, and who is happy about it!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h3 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h3>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3480">MSC3480: Make device names private</a></li>

<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1">Matrix v1.1</a> was released! Read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">blog post here</a> if you missed it; it summarises everything that's new in v1.1, as well as plans for the future. Now that the new spec build pipeline and release infrastructure is in place, we're aiming for roughly quarterly releases going forward. Thank you all for being so patient in the meantime!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767: Extensible event types &amp; fallback in Matrix (v2)</a> (yes it really chose that).</p>
<p>Extensible events is something that has been a long time coming in Matrix. It unlocks so much potential, and is even currently being built on (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> (polls)). Definitely one of the next big ticket items to tackle in the medium term.

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dan (aka callahad) is away this week, so let me report on his behalf.</p>
<p>We cut a release candidate for Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0rc2">1.47.0rc2</a>, but see the changelog for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0rc1">rc1</a>). It exposes new functionality for <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">pluggable modules</a> and new endpoints to the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">Admin API</a>. We've fixed a bunch of long-standing bugs and continued to drive forward efforts to improve documentation and code quality. Thank you to all of our contributors!</p>
<p>With future releaes in mind, we've been continuing work to support threading and E2EE application services. We've also been prototyping a new Admin API to remove users from all rooms belonging to a certain space.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we've been doubling down on our effort to improve reliability and maintainability of our services as a whole. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent">Sydent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a> have a number of PRs in flight for both, aimed at improving type coverage and driving down error noise in the logs. We've drafted a blog post to summarise the process of type annotating mypy (keep your eyes out for that one). We also worked to make the matrix.org database more resilient, and made changes to improve the experience of rolling out upgrades to Synapse en masse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Päikky was created by a group of parents who wanted to make communication with daycare staff easier. They started a company and later sold it to Abilita. Päikky is currently used in 40+ municipalities in Finland and also in some private daycare companies too.</p>
<p>Päikky is also used for reserving daycare times for kids.</p>

<p>Release v1.6.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>Make reconnect loop more robust</li>
<li>Sensitive flag for MSG and NICKSERV to hide it from network room (for AUTOCMD)</li>
<li>Improved STATUS for admin room and simple STATUS for network rooms</li>
<li>Small fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Not much going on this week. Hopefully the reconnect refactor doesn't cause any breakage as it fixed multiple issues that have been around since the inception of Heisenbridge.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you love bugs as much as I do? ♥🐛♥</p>
<p>I guess not. For that reason bug fixing in Nheko for the next release continues. We fixed a super annoying issue, where loading keys from the online backup could make Nheko stuck in a flickering mode with no way to interact with it anymore. You can now also click anywhere on a read receipt to open someones profile instead of just their avaitar, edited messages now also show as redacted, if only the original message got redacted and don't lose the reply in encrypted rooms, if the edit was sent by a client, that is not Nheko. You also used to get logged out after registration, which should finally be resolved. There were also a bazillion translation updates! Thank you, everyone who contributed to those.</p>
<p>We also finally merged the prettier video player, which also fixes a video playback issue on macOS. Try it out and give us feedback on it!</p>
<p>We are still hunting down some last bugs, but expect the release soon now. In the meantime, I did start summarizing the changes, if you want to see what will be in the next release: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#090----unreleased</p>

<h3 id="threads">Threads</h3>
<ul>
<li>Message threading is coming to Element! If you haven’t yet, head to develop.element.io and ensure ‘Enable threading’ is turned on in Labs to test on the web.</li>
<li>We’re spinning up development on iOS &amp; Android as we speak. </li>
<li>We’ll also be running the first Threads community testing session next Thursday (18th Nov) at 17:00 GMT. Come join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#element-community-testing:matrix.org">#element-community-testing:matrix.org</a>!</li>

<h3 id="polls">Polls</h3>
<ul>
<li>We also recently started implementing Polls.</li>
<li>On the web/desktop, we’ve implemented poll creation and displaying them in the timeline. Next up is implementing voting.</li>
<li>Mobile development started recently too, with Android slightly ahead of iOS.</li>

<h3 id="element-web">Element Web</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the background, if you’ve been paying close attention to our issue tracker, you might have noticed lots of changes to our triage &amp; issue workflows over the past couple of months. We’re continuing to iterate on these, extending the best learnings to iOS &amp; Android too. </li>
<li>We recently started a project to improve the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-meta/issues/56">info architecture</a>/layout of our apps, starting on the web first. We’re merging our first tweaks and experiments soon, so expect exciting things to be landing on develop!</li>
<li>We’re continuing to implement more Space creation &amp; management support on iOS. We’ve added in Space creation screens (implemented in SwiftUI!) and we’re polishing inviting people to Spaces.</li>
<li>We’ve also been conducting user research to see what parts of the app are tripping users up, and working on fixes to various issues. Expect tweaks to land soon!</li>
<li>Otherwise, we’re also merging &amp; testing release candidates for upcoming releases, merging several branches.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="element-android">Element Android</h3>
<ul>
<li>We’ve been conducting the same user research on Android, watch this space for more tweaks &amp; improvements coming soon!</li>

<p>&quot;Sign in with Matrix&quot; is a web component, which developers can use to build a web login using Matrix account</p>
<p>it is similar to those &quot;Sign in with Google&quot; and &quot;Sign in with Facebook&quot; buttons you see on the internet
but now it's Matrix!</p>
<p>i invite you to take a look at the repository: https://github.com/mishushakov/signin-with-matrix
and experience a demo: https://mishushakov.github.io/signin-with-matrix/</p>
