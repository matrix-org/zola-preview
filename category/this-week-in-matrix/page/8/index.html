<p>One thing you might not know is that TWIM bot is a space traveler, sent by the Matrix scientists to explore that zone called &quot;The Possibilities&quot;. The <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> room is a portal to its energy tank, and we had received a distress signal!</p>
<p>To help the TWIM explorer fulfil its mission, we asked the Matrix community to fuel it with news before it crashed into space debris made of aggregated ignorance!</p>
<p>This week again, the community has been very active and explored many possibilities of the Matrix universe!</p>

<p>A group of Finnish Matrix admins have set up a free homeserver for Finnish public called pikaviestin.fi (literally instant messenger dot fi). It offers a bunch of bridges and registration requires an e-mail address in one of Finnish e-mail providers or organizations. We welcome all Finns to register there and help decentralize Matrix.

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The end of the year is drawing to a close. Thus many of the Spec Core Team members are focusing on implementation in order to meet deadlines. Review is still occurring though! As above, we have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a> (allow guests to send more event types). This was born out of next-generation VoIP work, but it should have a positive impact on improving the guest experience in Matrix on the whole.</p>
<p>Otherwise work is still ongoing by Bruno and others on untangling the aggregations MSCs, specifically <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2676">MSC2676</a>.</p>
<p>And finally, Alexandre Franke has <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3542">PR'd some work</a> to allow for matrix.org's OpenAPI spec to be widely available, meaning anyone with a <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> (or other <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> viewer) client can easily pull it and start sending requests against a Matrix homeserver. Fun times!</p>

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Goooood evening TWIM readers!</p>
<p>I want to start by drawing attention to a blog post which we published today: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/03/type-coverage-for-sydent-motivation">Type coverage for Sydent: motivation</a>. This the first in a series of three articles discussing what we've learned from making Sydent pass the <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/">mypy</a> type checker in strict mode. Improving type coverage across Synapse, Sygnal, and Sydent has been a major focus of the backend team at Element for the past few months, and we think we've learned a few useful things in the process.</p>
<p>This week we also <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/30/synapse-1-48-0-released">released Synapse 1.48</a> with loads of internal improvements, new Admin APIs, better alignment with the Matrix 1.1 spec, and more. We're planning one more release for the year, 1.49 on December 14th, and then we're taking a break until Synapse 1.50 on January 11th.</p>
<p>Importantly: Synapse 1.49 will be the last release to support Python 3.6, PostrgreSQL 9.6, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) ‚Äî if you're reliant on any of these platforms, please ensure you have plans to upgrade.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think of the article (and the Synapse release!), and we'll see you next week!</p>

<p>Sydent is the reference Matrix Identity server. It provides a lookup service, so that you can find a Matrix user via their email address or phone number (if they have chosen to share it).</p>

<p>I've just published a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/03/type-coverage-for-sydent-motivation">blog post</a> (part one of three) about our efforts to improve Sydent's type coverage. It should hopefully be of interest to anyone who works with Python or is interested in static analysis more generally.</p>

<h3 id="gitter">Gitter</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org">madlittlemods (Eric Eastwood)</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the vein of <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Gitter feature parity</a> on Matrix, we've made the first steps towards a better public static archive. We merged an experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> into <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> which lets you use the unstable <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> client API endpoint go from a given timestamp to the closest event ID. This will allow us to implement a calendar jump to date interface to be able to navigate to any day in the rooms history. Our first target to add the jump to date UI in is <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen</a> since we plan to server-side render Hydrogen for the actual public static archive as well.</p>
<p>To enable the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> unstable API endpoints in Synapse, add <code>experimental_features</code> -&gt; <code>msc3030_enabled: true</code> to your <code>homeserver.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/client/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/rooms/&lt;roomID&gt;/timestamp_to_event?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;
</span><span>{
</span><span>    &quot;event_id&quot;: ...
</span><span>    &quot;origin_server_ts&quot;: ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Also as part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>, when you use the client API endpoint, if your homeserver sees that the closest event it has locally in the database is next to a gap in the history, it will go out and ask other federated homeservers what they have as the closest event instead.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/timestamp_to_event/&lt;roomID&gt;?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;
</span><span>{
</span><span>    &quot;event_id&quot;: ...
</span><span>    &quot;origin_server_ts&quot;: ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> to import batches of historical messages is still marching along getting some polishing passes and strengthening the assertions in the Complement tests to make sure things are going absolutely correctly. It's also good to see <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> utilizing it and catching a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11241">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11219">bugs</a> along the way üí™.</p>

<p>Half-Shot reports very late, to the great despair of TWIM's editor:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="hookshot-gets-provisioning">Hookshot gets provisioning!</h3>
<p>Stop the press. This is a last minute TWIM. We've been beavering away on <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot</a>. It's gained many features in the last week, but the big thing is that hookshot has gained the ability to provision connections over a provisioning API, which means it should hook nicely into Dimension (and other integration managers, in the future)!</p>
<p>Other notable features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple webhooks per room</li>
<li>Support for the username/text fields on an incoming webhook (slack style)</li>
<li>Named webhooks, so each hook now has a sensible displayname</li>
<li>The ability to spawn GitHub actions from rooms using the <code>!gh workflow run</code> command</li>
<li>Lots of new supported events from GitLab, such as reviews and tag pushes</li>
<li>Hosted documentation (so all of the above is easy to setup), it's a bit in progress atm.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're aiming for a release very very soon, hopefully in the next week or so!

<blockquote>
<p>We finally figured out what caused the issues with the flatpak on GNOME, especially on Arm. It should now work properly, if you use Flathub. On the Pinephone (and other systems, that don't set a locale/use the C locale), timestamps should now not be needlessly long anymore. Redactions got a face-lift to distinguish them better from normal messages. We added a workaround for Synapse not allowing you to leave a banned room. We now delete the room from the room list permanently if Synapse returns &quot;unknown room&quot; when trying to leave it. Spaces can now show the entire hierarchy in the sidebar (if you pull it out) and you can navigate to subspaces by clicking on them in the roomlist, even if you collapsed the space hierarchy in the sidebar.</p>

<h3 id="fluffychat">FluffyChat <a href="https://fluffychat.im">‚Üó</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">Krille Fear</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we have released FluffyChat 1.0.0 with a whole new design, a lot of bug fixes and huge performance improvements.</p>
<h3 id="new-design">New design</h3>
<p>The new design has bigger message bubbles with fancy shadows and bigger fonts. The contrast has been improved and some elements, like the time on every single message bubble, are now hidden by default. But they are not gone! Detailed message information are now accessible in the new message info page, where we not also can see the message type and the timestamp, but also the whole JSON source code of each timeline event.</p>
<h3 id="spaces">Spaces</h3>
<p>Spaces have got a lot improvements and bug fixes. They have moved to the bottom bar of the chat list (while this bottom bar is still hidden if you have not joined any space yet). The multi account switcher have instead been moved to a top left drop-down menu. So we finally got rid of the drawer, which seems to be a deprecated material design feature anyway. This new UX makes spaces much easier to use. You can long press on them to go to the space settings and long press on any chat in the chat list, to add or remove a chat to (or from) a space.
We still have no support for the spaces summary API though so we don't have yet the ability to discover new rooms inside of a space but this feature might land soon in the Matrix Dart SDK.</p>
<h3 id="multi-account">Multi Account</h3>
<p>FluffyChats multi account is still in beta but got a lot of bug fixes as well. You are now able to sort your accounts in &quot;bundles&quot; which can be very handy. The new account switcher button gives you a much better overview over your connected Matrix accounts now.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>We did a lot refactoring under the hood in our Matrix Dart SDK and have improved our in-app database a lot. On the web it now uses IndexedDB natively while it tunes all database transactions on all platforms. This leads to the fastest FluffyChat experience we ever had and makes the app finally kinda usable with bigger accounts on all platforms. The room list is now lazy loaded which speeds up the app start (especially with multi account enabled) a lot.
Choose your own primary color
This was a long requested feature. You can now choose your favorite color to style your FluffyChat for your needs:</p>
<p>What will you choose? Let me know in the comments. I mostly like blue on my Ubuntu desktop.</p>
<h3 id="new-major-version">New major version?</h3>
<p>Ahhh by the way... What does it mean that we now have FluffyChat 1.0.0? It does NOT mean that the previous versions were not yet stable or ready for daily use. It just means that we make so many changes at once that we thought, bumping the first digit of our pseudo-semver version string might make sense. We totally messed up our versioning and are now going to do it better. Promised!!
What's next?
We are often asked: What is the roadmap of FluffyChat?
Well... we still don't have a clear roadmap and might never have. FluffyChat is completely driven by volunteers. But what I can say that we would like to do in the next months is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better QA -&gt; We would like to write some integration tests, push release candidates before new releases and involve everyone in testing them to offer the best stability possible.</li>
<li>Native video calls -&gt; Yes! There will soon land support for native video calls in the Matrix Dart SDK and we are going to implement this in FluffyChat.</li>
<li>Stories -&gt; Like you might know from SnapChat, WhatsApp or Instagram, stories are little messages you can send to all of your contacts and which will disappear after 24 hours. I would really like to implement this in FluffyChat!</li>
<li>Better notifications for iOS</li>
<li>Deeper support for spaces</li>
<li>Knocking feature</li>
<li>Drag&amp;Drop for web</li>
</ul>
<p>But as I said this is what we would like to do. We can't give any warranties on anything. We can only do our best. But you can help us if you like (You don't have to).</p>

<p><strong>Threads</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On Web, work continues on notifications and integration with homeserver APIs to improve user experience.</li>
<li>On Mobile, link sharing has been added and work is about to start on notifications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Polls</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Polls are nearly ready!  If you enable this feature in labs, you can create a poll with several options, and people can vote on it.</li>
<li>We‚Äôre working on the finishing touches, and the first version of polls will be available in a release (on Element Desktop, Web, Android and iOS) within a few weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community testing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We closed 34 encryption bugs which had been resolved by improvements to the workflows and user interfaces.</li>
<li>Due to the overwhelming success with bug squash sessions in the last few weeks, we are making these a regular feature. Our next session will be on Thursday 9 December at 17:00 UTC.</li>

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a>, a multiplatform Matrix SDK written in Kotlin, has grown up since the last release 6 month ago! It has it first release candidate for v1.0.0!</p>
<p>If you don't heard about Trixnity: Trixnity aims to be strongly typed, customizable and easy to use. You can register custom events and Trixnity will take care, that you can send and receive that type.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing is the new trixnity-client module. It provides a high level client implementation and allows you to easily implement clients for Desktop, Mobile and Web. You just need to render data from and passing user interactions to Trixnity. The key features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
exchangeable database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
fast cache on top of the database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
E2E (olm, megolm)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
verification</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
room list</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
timelines</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
user and room display name calculation</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
asynchronous message sending without caring about E2E stuff or online status</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
media support (thumbnail generation, offline &quot;upload&quot;, etc.)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
redactions</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, Trixnity only supports JVM in all modules, but JS and Native will follow soon (to be exact: when Kotlin 1.6.10 and ktor 2.0.0 is released). I also implemented the module trixnity-olm, which implements the wrappers of libolm for Kotlin JVM/JS/Native.</p>
<p>Cross signing is one of the next big features, I want to implement.</p>

<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (serverside aggregations) is getting lots of updates from Bruno in order to align the proposal with what is currently implemented in the wild (as it's easier to iterate on incremental improvements from a starting point grounded in reality). This MSC is a bit of a special case though, as it was implemented with stable prefixes before the MSC landed (in the before times...).</p>
<p>Regardless, thank you very much to Bruno for going through and finally untangling and help land aggregations in the spec! This MSC is one of four which describe how aggregations should work in Matrix, and it's great to see them finally being properly spec'd, especially as further features start to be built on top of them (such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440/">threading</a>!).</p>
<p>And finally, a further thank you to community members <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3509">an OpenAPI schema fix</a>!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a>!</p>
<p>This proposal aims to allow appservices to get ever greater visibility into what is happening on the homeserver, while still maintaining full process separation.</p>
<p>A lot of the time solutions to complex problems require knowing when a user has registered or logged in, with what name/3pids etc, when users change their emails, etc. Hooking into these non-room-based actions can help with developing useful features. Maybe you want an appservice that plays a sound effect whenever a user signs up to your homeserver!</p>
<p>These days, that is often achieved by homeserver implementation-specific solutions, such as <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/">modules</a> in Synapse. Being able to notify of these events using a standard API shape would be hugely beneficial to generalisation of projects.</p>
<p>So give the proposal a look over and review if that interests you!

<blockquote>
<p>As predicted last week, we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/23/synapse-1-47-1-released">released Synapse 1.47.1</a> on Tuesday. This is a security release which fixes an issue with Synapse's built-in media repository. Admins are strongly encouraged to upgrade.</p>
<p>Otherwise, relatively slow week: a handful of of the team have been away (Happy Thanksgiving, Americans!), but we <em>did</em> release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.48.0rc1">Synapse 1.48.0rc1</a>. Most importantly, this release candidate includes changes to improve the efficiency of large background updates from past releases, which should significantly reduce database load when upgrading. It also adds support for the <code>/v3</code> APIs defined in version 1.1 of the Matrix specification.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about 1.48 when it's formally released next week, but as always, we appreciate folks trying out the release candidates and letting us know how they behave.</p>

<p>An add-on for the matrix-appservice-webhooks bridge. Webhooks are essentially web interfaces for applications to &quot;push&quot; data to. The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver">Matrix Webhook Receiver</a></p>
<p>Do you like to receive notifications in matrix?
Matrix Webhook Receiver (MWR) is an add-on for the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-webhooks">matrix-appservice-webhooks</a> bridge. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">Webhooks</a> are essentially web interfaces for applications to &quot;push&quot; data to.
The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.</p>
<p>This is where MWR comes in:
It can receive any (JSON) content, optionally reformat it nicely (customizable!), and forward it to the webhooks bridge which will post it to a room for you. If you are running any software service, there is a good chance it can notify you via webhooks!</p>
<p>Right now, several example configurations exist, ready for you to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>GitLab (including Community Edition/self hosted)</li>
<li>Ansible Tower/AWX</li>
<li>Grafana Alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here is the GitHub webhook as seen in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org">#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org</a>:
<img src="/blog/img/webhook_receiver.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>More examples of apps currently in development: Prometheus Alertmanager, Jellyfin</p>
<p>It is also easy to use to send messages from the commandline with standard tools (<code>curl</code>), e.g. for your cron jobs! See the README for an example.</p>
<p>Some other webhook matrix things exist, but often require</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ûñ admin access to server (appservices)</li>
<li>‚ûñ installing and running and maintaining a specific bot per service</li>
<li>‚ûñ create and set up accounts and passwords for each bot to use</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, MWR requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ûñ matrix-appservice-webhooks set up on your server by your admin</li>
<li>‚ûñ some knowledge of how to send POST requests for one time setup. I want to improve that, suggestions are welcome!</li>
<li>‚ûï MWR can be installed and run by anyone who can access the bridge</li>
<li>‚ûï one single MWR supports any amount of notifying apps!</li>
<li>‚ûï you don't need admin access to the server to add more apps</li>
<li>‚ûï no need to develop a bot/plugin to support new apps, just write a quick jinja template</li>
<li>‚ûï multiple people can use a single MWR instance by sharing HTTP basic auth credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>Other features:</p>
<ul>
<li>can post into encrypted rooms (see readme)</li>
<li>automatically generated API docs</li>
<li>message formatting presets including html markup or m.notice</li>
<li>arbitrarily customizable webhook URLs</li>
<li>list and manage currently installed webhooks in your browser (<a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver/blob/main/examples/GUI_screenshot.png">screenshot</a>)</li>

<p>A multi purpose multi platform bridge, formerly known as matrix-github</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks! Some exciting new news on the bridge front: I've renamed <code>matrix-github</code> to <code>matrix-hookshot</code> to better reflect it's not-just-GitHub-ness. That's not all though, as there are new features too:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridge now supports <strong>Rust</strong> as a companion language (we're aiming to rewrite critical sections in rust). Some parts of the formatting code have already been rewritten.</li>
<li>The bridge now supports JIRA (full puppeting!)</li>
<li>The bridge now supports generic webhooks too, with the ability to write <strong>custom handling code</strong> inside the state event to process these hooks into pretty messages.</li>
<li>Basic support for GitHub discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the works:</p>
<ul>
<li>A provisioning API to hook into integration managers</li>
<li>More GitLab support</li>
<li>Better GitHub discussions support</li>
</ul>
<p>We're not quite ready for a 0.2.0 release, but please check us out at https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the 0.9.0 release last week, we have of course been busy fixing all the bugs different people reported. Messing around with the sticker pack editor and then leaving room should not make Nheko crash anymore. The problems where the flatpak has issues starting on Gnome systems are still under investigation. We thought we had a solution, but that seems to have broken other stuff! üí•</p>
<p>Apart from that we have been doing some after release party cleanup. Apart from some refactorings, you can now filter your rooms on whether they are a direct chat or not in the sidebar. This is in addition to the filters we already had for favourites, spaces and your other personal tags. User colors should also now be much less biased towards blue and jdenticons should have more variance. Expect the next release to be a much more colorful experience!</p>
<p>Speaking of colors, Twily made this awesome ZX Spectrum inspired logo after we changed our Gitlab bot to be more colorful! Check it out:

<blockquote>
<p>Today is a good day for those calling me a spy, someone not wanting to care about privacy and for those who did publicly harass me for server_stats.</p>
<p>People using the API likely already noticed it wasn't reachable for a while. Effective immediately I am currently leaving all rooms  the bot is part of. This will take days or even months considering this are 6397 rooms at the time of writing. I am not going into the motives of why I am shutting it down. It comes down to personal reasons.</p>
<p>There won't be any dump of the data. The source will be kept public. Note though if anyone ever tries to run it that you need about 600GB of space for synapse, a lot of CPU, a lot of RAM and plenty of workers as this can easily crash synapse.</p>

<p>Server_Stats was an incredibly useful project. It pains me a lot to see it go, but it pains me even further that its author got harassed.

                <p>Friday already? Did this week already happen? It looked like the spacetime continuum was broken and we didn't know who did it. We needed witnesses to solve the case: did things really happen this week? And the witnesses showed up! A huge thanks to everyone in the Matrix community who reported their progress, and to everyone currently working on making awesome projects around Matrix!</p>
<p>The case is closed: the week has not been stolen from us. Time appears to have wings, and flies faster than we had anticipated.</p>

<p>A very very dense and exciting wrap up of what's happening these days in the Matrix space by Matrix Foundation co-founders Matthew &amp; Amandine! Matrix is stepping up a gear with blazing fast Sync v3, Threading Support, VoIP, VR, a new release of the Spec, always more monthly active users, a full security audit and progress on P2P.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h3 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h3>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3489">MSC3489: Sharing streams of location data</a></li>

<li><em>No MSCs entered proposed FCP state this week.</em></li>

<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3283">MSC3283: Expose capabilities for profile actions</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>This week we finally, finally had one of the aggregation-related MSCs, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> (event relationships) enter final comment period! This MSC, along with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issue-406544216">several others</a>, document the stuff that powers message edit, reactions, the upcoming threading and polls MSCs, and much more! So it's really great to see the MSCs start to actually land.</p>
<p>Speaking of threading <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> has had a good amount of review from the Spec Core Team last week. Threading in Matrix has been a long awaited feature for chat applications - as well as helping extend the flexibility of Matrix as a data structure even further. The MSC relies on both <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (or a modified version of it), so the latter will be an area of focus for review for next week.</p>
<h3 id="spec-prs">Spec PRs</h3>
<p>It seems that the recent <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">Matrix v1.1</a> has drummed up some more community support for spec PRs. Thank you to everyone who's sent in clarifications, changes and even typo fixes. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aankur12-1610">fixes to the OpenAPI fields, and for typo corrections in the spec copy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for helping review them. Thank you both! </p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2867">MSC2867: Marking rooms as unread</a>!</p>
<p>This is definitely a feature that I would love to have for chat. Note that this MSC proposes marking <em>a room</em> as unread, rather than a specific point in the room's timeline. This is intentional as noted in the document, as the latter is more complicated, as it intersects with sending out read receipts to other users.

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">‚Üó</a></h3>
<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> we plan to release a <strong>security release, Synapse 1.47.1</strong> on the coming <strong>Tuesday, 23rd of November</strong>; see the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/18/pre-disclosure-upcoming-security-release-of-synapse-1-47-1">predisclosure</a>.</p>
<p>We released Synapse 1.47.0 after squashing a couple of problems related to database migrations remaining in 1.47.0rc2.  Briefly, this release includes</p>
<ul>
<li>new features for users of the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin</a> and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">module</a> APIs;</li>
<li>a number of long-standing bug fixes, including a thorny bug which prevented joining certain old rooms; and</li>
<li>continuing efforts to prototype new MSCs and improve type coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/17/synapse-1-47-0-released">blog post</a> has a better summary, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0">GitHub</a> has the full gory details.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.1">Sydent 2.5.1</a>, a minor release which improves the way we handle and log various error cases.</p>
<p>Thank you as ever to our community contributors, and everyone out there who's using Synapse to communicate!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> also reminds us</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we release the fix, the changes will be publicly known and bad actors will have the ability to deduce the vulnerability. Most servers don't run release candidates, so releasing the fix in an RC will mean there's a larger window for an attacker to exploit the problem. Internally, there will be an RC deployed to test homeservers and eventually matrix.org. This means we'll be able to confidently recommend the upgrade to server administrators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dkasak:termina.org.uk">dkasak</a> adds</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that's the very reason we have dedicated security releases, instead of just rolling the security fixes into a feature release. The security release doesn't contain anything new apart from the security fix so it minimizes the chance of things going wrong.</p>

<p>Keep your servers up to date, and your users safe, administrators!</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.7.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement &quot;best effort&quot; basic IRC moderation in plumbed rooms if bot has ops on IRC</li>
<li>Allow configuring topic sync for plumbs (IRC&lt;-&gt;Matrix or one way)</li>
<li>Allow using forward slash (/) as MXID separator for IRC ghosts</li>
<li>Bump max mautrix version to &lt;0.12</li>
<li>Small fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Plumb moderation! If the bridge bot has ops on IRC it will do its best to map kicks and bans (regarding IRC users) from Matrix. This definitely isn't perfect and is meant as a convenience.</p>
<p>Topic synchronization is now configurable for plumbs as well to make it possible to share the same topic between an IRC channel and a plumbed Matrix room. Default is still off and it requires the bridge bot to have enough PL to work.</p>
<p>The separator for IRC ghosts can now be changed to forward slash (/) from the default underscore (_). This happens by modifying the regex in the registration file. Only do this for new installations and it will cause <em>all</em> IRC users to duplicate in rooms who you can't remove and probably other bad side effects as well. The default may be changed in the future.</p>
<p>There were lots of refactoring issues so I hope I fixed all of them üôà.</p>
<p>Best effort your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>The moderation bot for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dotyoric:matrix.org">Yoric</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="mjolnir-v1-2-1-released">Mj√∂lnir v1.2.1 released</h3>
<ul>
<li>New feature: if a user on your homeserver reports abuse, Mj√∂lnir may now show the abuse report in your moderation room and offer you two-click moderation options. This feature is considered a preview for the time being.</li>
<li>Performance improvements for protections that need to lock back in the history of a room, decreasing the number of cases in which we could end up timing out.</li>
<li>Many improvements to testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Any rumor of a v1.2.0 Docker image borked by yours truly is sadly true. There should be no risk in 1.2.0 but, to be on the safe side, if you have updated to 1.2.0, please update to 1.2.1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's one feature I've wanted for a while, and it's going to make moderation a lot easier! Thanks Mjolnir teams for keeping us safe!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>An important note on the interesting projects using Matrix for the login: those are community projects, and there are MSCs in the works to &quot;do it right&quot; at the Spec level!</p>
<p>As Matthew Hodgson <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29242445">reported in a comment on Hacker News</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The direction we're headed in the Matrix spec core team is instead towards replacing Matrix's current auth mechanisms with normal Open ID Connect (rather than wrapping our own OIDC-like thing, as we do today) - as per https://github.com/sandhose/matrix-doc/blob/msc/sandhose/oauth2-profile/proposals/2964-oauth2-profile.md The common login flow would then be for users to be authed by their server using a trusted OIDC identity provider, rather than ever trusting arbitrary clients with their credentials.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have compiled <a href="https://austinhuang.me/matrix-homeservers.html">a list of public homeservers</a> available for registration, since previous such efforts to make these homeservers more discoverable fell through. This list serves as a sanitized version of the asra.gr list, with only homeservers intended for public consumption included. It is a static list and does not include pings, but rather than focusing on the technical aspect, my list has an emphasis on the written rules of a homeserver, which I believe to play a larger role in the Matrix experience. Hope this can spark other efforts in maintaining a better list!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's one very useful list of hand curated servers! The transparency about the inclusion criteria is very much appreciated. Good job!</p>

Now that the new spec build pipeline and release infrastructure is in place, we're aiming for roughly quarterly releases going forward. Thank you all for being so patient in the meantime!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767: Extensible event types &amp; fallback in Matrix (v2)</a> (yes it really chose that).</p>
<p>Extensible events is something that has been a long time coming in Matrix. It unlocks so much potential, and is even currently being built on (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> (polls)). Definitely one of the next big ticket items to tackle in the medium term.

<p>Dan (aka callahad) is away this week, so let me report on his behalf.</p>
<p>We cut a release candidate for Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0rc2">1.47.0rc2</a>, but see the changelog for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0rc1">rc1</a>). It exposes new functionality for <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">pluggable modules</a> and new endpoints to the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">Admin API</a>. We've fixed a bunch of long-standing bugs and continued to drive forward efforts to improve documentation and code quality. Thank you to all of our contributors!</p>
<p>With future releaes in mind, we've been continuing work to support threading and E2EE application services. We've also been prototyping a new Admin API to remove users from all rooms belonging to a certain space.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we've been doubling down on our effort to improve reliability and maintainability of our services as a whole. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent">Sydent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a> have a number of PRs in flight for both, aimed at improving type coverage and driving down error noise in the logs. We've drafted a blog post to summarise the process of type annotating mypy (keep your eyes out for that one). We also worked to make the matrix.org database more resilient, and made changes to improve the experience of rolling out upgrades to Synapse en masse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you love bugs as much as I do? ‚ô•üêõ‚ô•</p>
<p>I guess not. For that reason bug fixing in Nheko for the next release continues. We fixed a super annoying issue, where loading keys from the online backup could make Nheko stuck in a flickering mode with no way to interact with it anymore. You can now also click anywhere on a read receipt to open someones profile instead of just their avaitar, edited messages now also show as redacted, if only the original message got redacted and don't lose the reply in encrypted rooms, if the edit was sent by a client, that is not Nheko. You also used to get logged out after registration, which should finally be resolved. There were also a bazillion translation updates! Thank you, everyone who contributed to those.</p>
<p>We also finally merged the prettier video player, which also fixes a video playback issue on macOS. Try it out and give us feedback on it!</p>
<p>We are still hunting down some last bugs, but expect the release soon now. In the meantime, I did start summarizing the changes, if you want to see what will be in the next release: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#090----unreleased</p>

<p>The time command, but it sends the output to a Matrix room</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc">Aine</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's time! time-to-matrix (ttm) v1.2.0.</p>
<p>A <code>time</code>-like command that will send end of an arbitrary command output and some other info (like exit status) to matrix room. Useful when you need to run something in terminal and get a ping when it's done.</p>
<p>Since the last ttm news in TWIM new options were added:</p>
<ul>
<li>matrix auth with access token - useful for SSO when you don't have actual login/password pair</li>
<li>skip <code>time</code> info</li>
<li>skip html formatting (doubles allowed log size in message)</li>
<li>post full log output to matrix (with auto-shrinker to avoid &quot;message is too big&quot; error)</li>

<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3217">MSC3217: Soft kicks</a>!</p>
<p>Other than this sounding like something out of a workout routine, soft kicks are proposed as a hint to clients that the user has been kicked from the room, but that it was not out of moderation, but for a technical reason (the example given disconnection from an IRC network). The client can then present a different UX as opposed to a normal, &quot;hard&quot; kick.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.46.0">Synapse 1.46</a>! This release includes a fix for the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> from 1.44 which could cause smaller hosts to lock up when clients reconnected after some time offline.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.46 also includes experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440: Threading via <code>m.thread</code> relation</a>, a big step toward threaded messaging in Matrix. It's otherwise mainly a bugfix release, as we've spent much of our time reviewing infrastructure and making plans to improve our resilience should we experience hardware failures similar to what took out matrix.org two weeks ago.</p>
<p>We continue working toward a prototype implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775: Lazy loading over federation</a>, starting with setting up automated infrastructure to repeatedly measure the join speeds of assorted large, public rooms. Our goal is to have a rough proof of concept for lazy room joins by the end of the year.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.0">Sydent 2.5.0</a>! In addition to fixing bugs, this release passes <code>mypy --strict</code>, uses Jinja2 for templates, and supports the <code>room_type</code> field from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3288">MSC3288</a> to better differentiate between invitations to rooms and invitations to Spaces.</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.5.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow opening multiple simultaneous connections to the same network</li>
<li>New STOP/STAHP ROOM command to end a long paste flood</li>
<li>Clear channel send queue if the user gets kicked to prevent continuing flood on rejoin</li>
<li>New KB ROOM command to do a proper kick &amp; ban (contributed by GitHub user @blastrock, thanks!)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most useful feature this week is having the ability to open multiple connections to the same network. This can be used to plumb channels with a secondary connection while using the bridge as yourself with the main one. You can also STAHP long pastes from being actually sent out completely to a channel if you weren't careful enough on Matrix side.</p>
<p>Upgrading from previous version to v1.5.0 will cause a small migration for every channel/pm that is open so it might take a little longer for the first startup to complete. If no multiple network connections are opened it is safe to downgrade but if someone uses the feature it will cause shenanigans for the duplicate networks in the older version.</p>
<p>Inject your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>We are preparing for a release! That means, if you are translator, we could use your help to get our translations <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/">updated</a> and if you want to have a bug fixed before release, now is the time to report it or complain about it! Please come and see us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> for complaints and questions!</p>
<p>We saw a lot of translation updates by Linerly, Priit and Thulinma already. The click ghosting issue in the room list should be fixed as well as the crash when accepting an invite from your browser. You can now register on matrix.org again, after fighting with some... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3471">reality deforming wording in the spec</a>. Notifications on macOS now use the &quot;modern&quot; API for notifications, including grouping notifications by room. (Expect more fancy improvements there in the future!) The warning about mentioning the whole room now vanishes properly, hiding space children from the roomlist now doesn't hide them from the space itself anymore, the loading spinner shouldn't show in a fully loaded room again, the room directory search bar is now focused by default and a few smaller fixes.</p>
<p>We also completed the bootstrapping UI now. This means you get prompted for unverified devices, when your device isn't verified or when cross-signing isn't configured for your account yet and you are given ways to remedy that.</p>
<p>We have a few more bug fixes we want to land before the release, so don't expect it tomorrow, but we have the featureset down now. And if you thought the changes listed in this snippet are long, wait for the full release changelog. It will probably take a few days for me to tidy that up and I think this will be our biggest release yet! Happy testing, everyone!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: Europe is close to officially regulating big corporations and forcing them to open their silos via the Digital Markets Act. Element joined forces with other companies to make sure that the members of the European Commission about to vote on the regulation knew how important it is.</p>
<p>Matrix was created to break the silos, as an interoperable layer for all communications. We wanted to ensure people had the ability to choose where their data is stored, and had the choice of interface to access them. This was also a good way to enable better competition and innovation in the communication space, forcing the players to compete on value add. But whilst Matrix is already a 39M users open network in itself, it could be even better if the bigger silos decided to open up and participate into it.</p>
<p>In December last year, as part of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Commission proposed to update the competition law for digital markets with rules mandating ‚Äògatekeeping‚Äô platforms to open up, in order to enable innovation and data sovereignty. </p>
<p>This move is so aligned with Matrix and Element‚Äôs mission, that Element joined over twenty other organisations to launch the Coalition for Competitive Digital Markets on Tuesday the 26th. The coalition supports stronger rules for large online platforms in the DMA, calling for amendments to it to make sure that major services offer a public API to interact with their core services and to ban the pre-installation and default setting of core platform apps.</p>
<p>Matrix is a perfect example of how technology can thrive through openness and collaboration. We will bring our experiences of using federated and decentralised technologies to MEPs and Council members, in the hope for a regulatory framework which supports European innovation, competition and interoperability. </p>

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the weekend, one of the servers backing matrix.org suffered a hardware failure, leading to around half an hour of downtime as we failed over to another system. Remediating and monitoring that has been the focus of much of the Synapse team over the past week.</p>
<p>We also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.46.0rc1">shipped a release candidate</a> for Synapse 1.46, due for formal release next week. Notably, we believe this solves a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> which was introduced in Synapse 1.44. If you've been experiencing long hangs or other periods of unresponsiveness, please try upgrading to <code>1.46.0rc1</code> and let us know if it resolves your issues.</p>
<p>The Synapse team has also decided to aim for building a rough prototype of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775: Lazy loading over federation</a> by the end of the year, in hopes that this will pave the way to extremely fast joins of large rooms.</p>
<p>We're also continuing to work on static type checking in our projects: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/448">As of today</a>, Sydent passes <code>mypy --strict</code>! We hope to write about what we've learned in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's an addendum about Sydent. We can see the results of our efforts visually, thanks to mypy's reporting options. Two different metrics show increasing coverage since our typing efforts began in the summer. The grey strip shows the last fortnight's sprint in particular.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca">uhoreg</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the shortfalls facing XMPP users of the Bifr√∂st Matrix bridge is the lack of support for <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html">Message Archive Management (MAM)</a>, which allows XMPP users to retrieve messages sent when they are offline, when they come online next time. Sunday Nkwuda and Olatunji Ajayi, with help from Pirate Praveen, are planning on writing support for MAM in XMPP.js (the XMPP library that Bifrost uses), and then adding MAM support to Bifr√∂st. Since this requires some dedicated full-time effort, they are fundraising to support this project at https://opencollective.com/mam-plugin-for-xmppjs. Many thanks to the XMPP Standards Foundation for serving as fiscal host for the fundraising.</p>

<p>A smaller release this time around which consists mostly of QoL stuff to make things a little easier. <a href="https://idlerpg.lolhosting.net/">IdleRPG</a> users can now rejoice and login to your character automatically with channel AUTOCMD when joining on reconnect as what's more important: running a bridge to engage in deep conversations or sit in a channel doing nothing?</p>
<p>Plumb users need to use the new generic ROOM command in network rooms to configure plumbs now that PLUMBCFG has been removed.</p>

<p>I work on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs">Collabs</a>, a library for making decentralized collaborative apps, and we have some demos that run on Matrix!  E.g., in a widget-capable client like Element, send the message:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>/addwidget https://compoventuals-tests.herokuapp.com/host.html?network=matrix&amp;container=demos/rich-text/dist/rich_text.html
</span></code></pre>
<p>to add a collaborative text editor widget.  (Fair warning: loading and saving is flaky, so don't type anything you can't afford to lose.)</p>
<p>All collaboration happens using messages sent to the Matrix room.  So, you're not dependent on any external service provider, and the document is end-to-end encrypted if your room is.</p>
<p>We have more demos <a href="https://compoventuals-tests.herokuapp.com/">here</a>, with instructions on how to use them in a widget.  You can follow those same instructions to run your own Collabs apps (<a href="https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/blob/master/collabs/docs/getting_started_guide.md">Getting Started Guide</a>), without needing to host any servers yourself!</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Collabs and see an app running on Matrix, check out my Strange Loop talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exr0iY_D-vw&amp;t=3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exr0iY_D-vw&amp;t=3s</a>.

Game creates a chat. Any message with 'boom' posted into there spawns the Red Triangle of malice.

<h3 id="sync-v3">Sync v3</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> shared very exciting news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a brand new <code>/sync</code> mechanism, dubbed sync v3, for the past few months. This is a complete overhaul of how clients live-stream sync data from homeservers, and fixes numerous pain points with <code>/sync</code> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syncs taking minutes to complete.</li>
<li>Syncs sending back vast quantities of data (e.g read receipts for every room you're in).</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, this new API is designed around the idea of having dynamic sliding windows around a sorted room list for a user's account. The room list can be sorted in different ways and <em>only rooms in the window are returned to the client</em>. The room list can also be filtered down based on various criteria (e.g only rooms in these spaces, with events newer than this timestamp, etc) and a subset of current room state can be requested with each returned room.</p>

<p>This list is kept sorted on the server and deltas are communicated to the client as a series of delta operations (e.g INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE). Multiple non-overlapping windows can be requested and the windows can also change their size dynamically.</p>
<p>This work is still currently in the pre-MSC stage as it's a huge undertaking, but an early, runnable, implementation lives at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sync-v3">sync-v3</a> repo. This works by setting up a proxy sync server which will make <code>/sync</code> requests to a target homeserver, and storing the data in a useful form for sync v3 queries. It then exposes the sync v3 API which can then actually show you real data from your account.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span> +---------+                     +--------------+                                 +----------------+
</span><span>
</span><span> | sync v3 | &lt;-- sync v3 API --&gt; |   sync v3    | &lt;--- normal /sync requests ---&gt; | Any Homeserver |
</span><span> | client  |                     | proxy server |                                 |      Impl      |
</span><span>
</span><span> +---------+                     +--------------+                                 +----------------+
</span></code></pre>
<p>The proxy server also hosts a barebones web client which talks sync v3 at http://localhost:8008/client/ - to get started just point the proxy server to any HS and then paste in your access token to the web client. The web client is <strong>just a test jig</strong> so only has a <em>read-only</em> view of your account and lacks any scrollback, only showing live data. IMPORTANT: generate a new access token before using this client. Do NOT use the token from an existing client (e.g Element web) or else you risk being unable to decrypt E2EE messages.</p>
<p>Intrepid people are encouraged to run a server and see how fast sync on their own account could possibly be in the future. Note that the <em>first</em> sync will be slow as it has to fetch all the user's data via v2 <code>/sync</code>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the Spec Core Team has been busy reviewing MSCs as can be seen from the above list of MSCs that have entered FCP this week. Particularly exciting is to see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> (event relationships, aka the stuff that powers message edits and reactions) coming close to merging! It's been a long time coming. Thanks to Bruno and everyone else who's reviewed it so far.</p>

<p>MSC3214 looks like an MSC that's been somewhat abandoned by everyone involved... But since there are already implementations out in the wild, it may be a simple one to get through!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/20/synapse-1-45-1-released">released Synapse 1.45</a> this week!</p>
<p>This is the first release to support oEmbed autodiscovery, leading to richer link previews for many sites. See the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/20/synapse-1-45-1-released">release announcement</a> for an example.</p>
<p>We also believe that we've <em>finally</em> fixed stuck messages! A <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9424">race condition</a> would occasionally prevent your sent events from syncing back  down to all of your clients. This caused messages to look like they were stuck at the bottom of the room, waiting to finish sending, even though other users would receive and see them normally.</p>
<p>Please shout loudly in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9424">this GitHub issue</a> if you see a stuck message on a server running 1.45 or later. üòâ</p>
<p>We've merged a further 9 pull requests to Sydent, making even more modules pass mypy --strict. We're not quite <em>all</em> the way there, but we're close! Most of the &quot;leaf&quot; modules are done, with the bulk of the remaining work to be done is on <code>sydent.http</code>. This is trickier because it's more exposed to the machinery of Twisted, but we'll get there.</p>
<p>We're already much more confident working in Sydent, and hope to apply these lessons to Synapse soon.</p>
<p>(Well, one lesson that won't apply is that type hints are <em>especially</em> valuable in codebases you don't touch as often... but we have no intention of slowing down on Synapse any time soon!)</p>

<li>
<p>Compatibility/workaround for Dendrite and Conduit registration configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>README has been improved</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Big ticket items this time around for privacy concerned users are connectivity improvements when using Tor/VPN with built-in SOCKS proxy support and CertFP authentication. Some WHOIS and CTCP has also been thrown in the mix for good measure!</p>
<p>Lately there has been quite a lot of people who are testing Dendrite or Conduit which has led to recurring support issues around some limitations they currently have with appservices. Heisenbridge now supports using and generating a &quot;compatible&quot; registration file (<code>--generate-compat</code>) for them that shouldn't be needed in the long run. I hope to drop this feature as soon as possible! üçª</p>
<p>While Heisenbridge somewhat intentionally has very little documentation due to not having a refined UX yet the README has been updated with some frequently asked questions about installing and configuring it to the point you can talk with the appservice bot. A self-contained docker-compose setup has also been added to the repository to help testing it without installing anything on your system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last Saturday we had an improvised NeoChat mini development sprint in a small hotel room in Berlin in the occasion of the 25th anniversary of KDE. In a good KDE tradition, Carl spent this time on improving NeoChat settings. He ported both the NeoChat general settings and the specific room settings to the new Kirigami.CategorizedSetting component. Tobias fixed a lot of papercuts and now the power level should be fetched correctly, we show the number of joined users instead of joined+invited users in the room information pane, the user search is now case insensitive. Nicolas focused on fixing our Android build by making the spellchecking feature compile on Android.</p>
<p>Aside from the mini-sprint, we also made a few more improvements during the week. Tobias fixed the flicking of the timeline on mobile and Carl made it possible for the user to resize the room information drawer.</p>

<p>Thulinma added device management to Nheko. You can now also view your devices, that don't support encryption, delete devices, rename them and see their ip address. Additionally there were a few refactorings and code improvements. Most notably blurhashes should now decode twice as fast. Additionally there were a few small fixes to displaying hidden space rooms (we were checking the wrong power level, so in some cases fewer rooms got shown in a space, if they only had a parent set). That's all, was a busy week with lots of lasers!</p>

<p>Element One is here! We‚Äôre giving TWIM a sneak preview of the new Matrix hosting service from Element in advance of the official launch next week. Element One* is a consumer-focused hosting option which gives you an individual Matrix account on our shiny new one.ems.host homeserver (with a matching Element Web at one.element.io). However, in addition to being a fast, snappy Matrix account, it also comes with unlimited personal bridging to Whatsapp, Signal and Telegram thanks to mautrix-whatsapp/signal/telegram!</p>
<p>Hopefully this is good news for those of you who have chats with friends and family on these other platforms, as you can now chat with them in one place from Element without having to mess around having to run your own bridge - and accounts cost just $5 per month.</p>
<p>Right now this is a (relatively) private / limited beta intended for the TWIM and EMS inner circle, and we'll be announcing more generally in the next few days / weeks. So, if you are interested, please check it out and sign up at https://ems.element.io/element-one :)</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3442">MSC3442: move the prev_content key to unsigned</a></li>

<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>The actual spec changes for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2844">MSC2844: Global version number for the whole spec</a> have now been merged [<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3420">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3421">two</a>]. You can take a look at <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/#specification-versions">this section</a> of the unstable spec to now see an explanation of the Matrix spec version numbering scheme.</p>
<p>Additionally, take a look at the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/client-server-api/#rooms-1">Client-Server API</a>, where all current APIs have been bumped from <code>/r0/...</code> to <code>/v3/...</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/old_master/proposals/2844-global-versioning.md#endpoint-versioning">this bit of MSC2844</a> for the rationale behind this change.</p>
<p>The pieces are starting to fall into place for the upcoming Matrix 1.1 spec release!</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1840">MSC1840: Typed rooms</a>!</p>
<p>This is a concept that was used in the Spaces MSCs to allow servers and clients to denote a room as a Space vs. a typical Matrix room (and set up their UI appropriately). Only the type for a Space has been specified so far, but there are many different applications room types could serve; for example profile rooms!</p>
<p>This MSC aims to create a general concept for a typed room, whereas future MSCs would identify those types and their meaning.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happy Friday! The Synapse team has been sorting out what we hope to accomplish before the end of the year, and it's looking like our main focus will remain research and experimentation towards making large room joins go very fast. We don't yet see an incremental path from where we are now to where we want to end up, so progress will likely come as a few discrete milestones, rather than a gradual acceleration over time.</p>
<p>Aside from room joins, we expect to spend a good bit of time time on bug fixes and preventative maintenance. For example, we hope to get Sydent passing <code>mypy --strict</code> by this time next week. Doing so would have prevented recent production issues, including one which caused phone number verification to silently fail.</p>
<p>Preparations for releasing 1.45.0 continue apace; I'm loking forward to telling you about it next week!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Making steps towards stable E2EE, we have now implemented bootstrapping cross-signing on a new account. This allowed me to finally enable cross-signing on my Nico (nheko.im) account (which I intended to only use with Nheko). Thulinma also added a way to refresh the current device list as well as highlighting your current device in the device list, which should make it easier to recover, if a misscommunitcation with the server lead to an outdated device list. Meanwhile LorenDB has been plugging away on converting more dialogs to Qml and we merged like 3 converted dialogs!</p>

<p>Can you believe we didn‚Äôt have a dept. of Widgets yet? We do now!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks! This week I took a bit of time out of my day to create a new widget for Matrix. We have the concept of &quot;Spanners&quot; at Matrix where one person wants to take control of a resource, and they will say &quot;I am taking the spanner&quot;. This prevents other people (verbally at least) from trying to use the resource at the same time.</p>
<p>For years we have been getting by with sending messages into Matrix, but no more! For now anyone can use the Spanner widget to set up a similar system in their room.</p>
<p>You can try this out now with <code>/addwidget https://half-shot.uk/spanner?spannerName=YourSpannerName</code> (although no promises about the uptime of half-shot.uk)</p>
<p>The repo can be found https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-spanner-widget.</p>
<p>You will need to ensure that all users who plan to use it must be able to send state events of type <code>uk.half-shot.spanner</code>. Otherwise, it should be ready to go!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rager is a CLI tool for matrix client developers to easily view and parse rageshake logs. It handles syncing (with many parameters to sync only the logs you want), searching through downloaded logs, and paging through any log on your device (with peudo-syntax highlighting to make it easier to understand), right from the comfort of your terminal. It has been in development for a few months (being used/tested by devs at <a href="https://www.beeper.com">beeper.com</a>) but I feel like it's now in a good enough state to release for everyone else to use. If it's something that may help you, try it out and let me know if it works for you!</p>

<p>We believe that having your own homeserver should be easy and require little technical knowledge. That's why we launched <a href="https://hingst.net">Hingst</a>, a privacy focused Matrix hosting service which takes care of (almost) everything for you. </p>
<p>Our goal is that our users spend no time whatsoever on maintaining the actual server so they can focus on what matters - chatting with friends and colleagues. </p>
<p>All servers are located in Sweden and of course they run entirely on renewable energy! </p>
<p>That's all for now. Thanks for reading :)</p>

<p>This week, I had the great pleasure of chatting with a lovely bunch from Element about Spaces. <a href="https://element.io/blog/spaces-blast-out-of-beta/">This feature just got out of beta</a> and they tell us all about it.</p>
<h2 id="dept-of-spec-scroll">Dept of Spec üìú</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello TWIM, it's me, not-anoa, again with your weekly spec update. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to figure out how to run the tooling which generates fancy graphs, but it looks like you'll have a more qualified person next week üòá</p>
<p>This week we saw a couple new MSCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a> - Letting guests do more things (which is needed for things like full mesh conference calling)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3429">MSC3429</a> - A room preview API. Turns out this is more or less a duplicate of another MSC, but has a different approach. Be sure to check both out üôÇ</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also been making progress on trying to get the spec release out by formally specifying all the new global version numbering and new endpoint versioning (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3420">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3421">this</a>), and have been <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3432">experimenting</a> with how room versions are represented by the spec.</p>
<p>From page 6 of the open MSCs there's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2723">MSC2723</a>. The MSC is relatively small, but solves a fairly important problem with forwarded messages in Matrix: where were they forwarded from? From a glance, it has minor technical feedback and could do with an implementation (psst: client authors, this should be easy and fit well into a North American Long Weekend project üòá).</p>
<p>That's all I have for you today, but if I've missed something: sorry, and you should be in capable hands next week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week I have completely rewritten the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone">Pinecone</a> router with the aim of improving code quality and boosting performance. It now uses significantly less resources, making it much easier to simulate larger networks and using less battery power on mobile devices.</p>
<p>While there is still some work to be done to ensure the Pinecone network gracefully handles large-scale mobility events, protocol development is slowly progressing and we will soon be looking at how Matrix federation can be made more efficient by using routing intelligence from the overlay network.</p>
<p>If you have a passion for routing protocols and/or peer-to-peer systems, we're looking to hire engineers to work in the P2P Matrix space ‚Äî get in touch by <a href="mailto:elementio@jobs.workablemail.com">emailing your resume to us</a>!</p>
<p>We also have our very own <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#p2p:matrix.org">P2P Matrix</a> room where you can follow along with the latest discussions and also occasionally pick up experimental iOS and Android builds of Element with an embedded P2P-enabled Dendrite homeserver.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/05/synapse-1-44-0-released">released Synapse 1.44</a> this week! The release was mainly focused on bug fixes and internal cleanups. In particular, we've made significant strides toward enforcing static type annotations across several more Synapse modules, we continue to remove &quot;magic&quot; code from our configuration handler, and we've landed significant refactors to both the user directory and federated event authentication. These changes pay off significant technical debt, reduce Synapse's maintenance cost, and ease future bug fixes.</p>
<p>But that's not all. This release also includes performance improvements around JSON serialization, new capabilities for extension modules, and better metrics around cache evictions. See <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/05/synapse-1-44-0-released">the announcement</a> for more details.</p>

<p><a href="https://schildi.chat/">SchildiChat</a> is a fork of Element that focuses on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list for both direct messages and groups, which is a more familiar approach to users of other popular instant messengers.</p>
<p>Both the Web/Desktop and the Android variant have received a couple of new features during the last weeks, so it's time again to share some of the highlights with you!</p>
<h4 id="web-desktop">Web/Desktop</h4>
<p>The Web/Desktop variant has received plenty of love for the last few weeks, so best to list some of the bigger changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a setting for the room list style: you can now choose between &quot;roomy&quot; with big avatars and two-line previews, &quot;intermediate&quot; for a smaller avatar and a single line preview, or &quot;compact&quot; to get a tiny avatar and the room preview in the same line of the room name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a setting how to color usernames in the chat: either uniform, based on the MXID, or based on the user's power level (Android has this feature for some time already, too!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a setting to not open automatically the most recent chat when switching spaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved theme settings: you can now choose custom themes independently for both light and dark mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workaround for switching between light and dark mode together with the system on Linux</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>macOS builds are now signed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>... and many more (read the release announcements on <a href="https://github.com/SchildiChat/schildichat-desktop/releases">GitHub</a> or join our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#schildichat-web-announcements:matrix.org">announcement room (#schildichat-web-announcements:matrix.org)</a> to stay informed)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A CLI tool for creating and revoking tokens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hooks for new messages, message edits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hooks for room invites, and leaving rooms</p>

Those URLs are not quite following the RFC but are accepted widely enough to warrant a fix, and a new release. Get 0.6.11 from <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.6.11">here</a> (or better, just checkout the respective Git tag).</p>

Instead of asking you about each part of the standup post individually, it creates threads for each of the parts that you can fill in. Your replies get added to the standup post like before, but it's a bit more interactive of a process. Here's a picture of how it looks (ignore all the display bugs due to Element).</p>

<h4 id="an-unofficial-matrix-server-for-the-newgrounds-community">An (unofficial) Matrix server for the Newgrounds community.</h4>
<p>Since I was pressed for time last week, I didn't go much in depth on how this server works. Here is a brief overview of its components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>https://app.ngmvs.one: A self-hosted Element Web with some theming tweaks, and the easiest way to visit the server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>https://matrix.ngmvs.one: the homeserver itself (Synapse). It has open registration, but only for <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/supporter">Newgrounds Supporters</a> (ie. patrons) via SSO logins with Newgrounds accounts. But Newgrounds doesn't have its own &quot;Log in with Newgrounds&quot; capability, so that leads me to the next component:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs/ng-saml-idp">ng-saml-idp</a>: middleware built on <a href="https://pysaml2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PySAML2</a> for using Newgrounds logins as a SAML2 Identity Provider. The code is tailored for my Synapse installation, but it can easily be tweaked to allow Newgrounds SSO logins to any SAML2-compatible service!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs/wbot">W-Bot</a>: a Matrix appservice/bot built on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python">mautrix-python</a> that serves two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Creates Matrix rooms for Newgrounds movie/game submission pages (ie. maps <code>#portal_view_&lt;ID&gt;:ngmvs.one</code> to <code>https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/&lt;ID&gt;</code>), and adds a widget containing the submission itself to these rooms (but only if it's a movie--widgets for games will only have a link)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restricts membership of any room it moderates to logged-in Newgrounds Supporters. Users without a :ngmvs.one account can authenticate to the bot via the &quot;login&quot; bot command, which lets them log into their Newgrounds account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Point 2 also means that anyone on the Matrix network can make a room that's restricted to Newgrounds Supporters. Just make sure the bot has a high enough power level to kick users!</p>
<p>Public (and federation-accessible) instance is at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@w-bot:ngmvs.one">@w-bot:ngmvs.one</a>.</p>
<p>(PS: The &quot;W&quot; stands for &quot;double&quot;--because of its job of &quot;copying&quot; rooms into Matrix.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/newgrounds-mvsx/">MVSX</a>: a Firefox extension that, when visiting a Newgrounds movie/game submission page, puts a button in the URL bar that sends you to the Matrix room created for that submission by W-Bot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This week's updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>W-Bot now has the <code>inviteme</code> command to invite the issuing user to the invite-only space room for logged-in Newgrounds Supporters. (Users should be invited there automatically, but this command is for people who leave / reject invites to that space &amp; want to re-join it later.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MVSX extension has been updated to allow joining rooms with Matrix clients other than <a href="https://app.ngmvs.one/">app.ngmvs.one</a>. Right-clicking the URL bar icon now shows a drop-down list of alternative clients, and lets you set which one to use by default (on left-clicks of the icon).</p>

<p>This week in Matrix, William tells us about the State Compressor he wrote during his internship to reduce the size of Synapse's database, and so much more. William being a former intern of the backend team, who else than his mentor Brendan could lead the interview?</p>

<h3 id="the-spec">The Spec</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! It is not-anoa here with the spec update this week, which unfortunately means no pretty graph of MSCs (sorry). I do however have some curated updates to the spec for you:</p>
<p>This week we saw a couple new MSCs get opened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3417">WIP: MSC3417: Call room room type</a> from SimonBrandner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3414">WIP: MSC3414: Encrypted state events</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Though WIP, both are exciting steps towards much larger goals - looking forward to see how they progress! We also saw FCP finish on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC3231: Token authenticated registration</a>, part of Callum's <a href="https://calcuode.com/matrix-gsoc/">GSOC project</a> this summer - congratulations! <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a> also finished FCP this week, making it a good time for clients to consider that access tokens might expire or appear in a different format in upcoming versions of the spec. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2582">MSC2582: Remove mimetype from EncryptedFile object</a> was also merged to the spec - thanks Sorunome for finding the duplicated field which was duplicated!</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the Spec Core Team (SCT) has been thinking about how we can release the spec as we've been talking about doing so for months. We're declaring a bit of a freeze on new things entering the spec for the time being, but that doesn't stop MSCs from completing FCP or being opened - they just might miss the v1.1 cut (sorry). Most of the work needed to release is deployment stuff rather than Matrix stuff, so the hope is is we can get it all worked out soon.</p>
<p>I don't have the random MSC script on hand, but I do have access to the MSC list and found <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">WIP: MSC3030: Jump to date API endpoint</a>. It's listed as work in progress, but is one of the MSCs I personally look forward to being accepted in time!</p>
<p>That's all for spec this week. I'm not sure about next week, but you might be stuck with me again. Maybe I can find those fancy graph tools in time...</p>

<p>Thanks a lot not-anoa, that was a great spec update!</p>

<h3 id="slack-bridge-1-9-0-rc1-with-a-psa">Slack bridge 1.9.0-rc1, with a PSA</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks, it's been a while since we released changes to the Slack bridge but here we are on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/1.9.0-rc1">our next RC</a>. This one includes a few new things, most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The bridge now automatically invites users to private rooms if there is a message and they are not joined. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/613">#613</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update bridge to matrix-appservice-bridge 3.1.0 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/614">#614</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, a PSA: If you were struggling to bridge your rooms to matrix while using the matrix.org bridge, this should now be fixed. An update made to the Slack APIs silently broke the oauth flow, which has since been fixed. This was a misconfiguration-gone-unnoticed in our Slack app configuration, so self hosters don't need to upgrade. The details are in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/617#issuecomment-932047990</p>

<h2 id="dept-of-clients-iphone">Dept of Clients üì±</h2>
<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I am a bit busy at the moment, Nheko is getting a lot of valuable smaller contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Updated the emoji pickers to Unicode 14, so that you can properly troll people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pasting images should now work properly again on Windows and macOS, including pasting SVGs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The help and version command line parameters now work properly, even if an instance of Nheko is already running.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There has also been a lot of progress on the translations! We just cracked 50% translated, but since that includes a lot of languages with only a few percent, this is actually much more than it sounds! We actually have 8 languages with over 90% translations now. If you speak one of the languages at 70% or so, any help translating the remaining bits is very much appreciated. You can easily translate without an account here: https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/#translations If you want to translate without having to rely on the upvote mechanism, feel free to ask for translation permissions directly in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a>. That is also the right room to ask questions about the translation process or translations themselves.</p>
<p>Nheko is also participating at Hacktoberfest this year. Translations done using the webinterface won't get counted for that though, you would need to submit a pull request manually for that. If you always felt like contributing to Nheko would be fun, but you had no reason to, now you can do it to let someone plant a tree for you (or get a T-shirt)!</p>
<p>That's all, I need to get back on my train!</p>

<h3 id="hydrogen">Hydrogen</h3>
<p>A minimal Matrix chat client, focused on performance, offline functionality, and broad browser support. https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hydrogen saw a few bug fixes (<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.14">0.2.14</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.15">0.2.15</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.16">0.2.16</a>) this week again, and also gained the possibility to recover from low-storage scenarios where the browser would clear indexedDB.</p>
<p>One of the bugs fixed might have caused a timeline corruption, so when you get the 0.2.16 update the history cache will be cleared and you'll notice a bit of delay as you do an initial sync again.</p>
<p>Aside from working on Hydrogen as a standalone app, I'm also making it easier to embedded in other projects. More info to come on that!</p>
<p>We've also had a priority planning this week, which spawned an updated backlog. <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/projects/1">Have a look</a> if you're interested what can be expected next (although be aware that the backlog has proven volatile in the past üôÇ).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hydrogen embedded! I'm looking forward to that. Great work Bruno!</p>

<h3 id="matrix-email-bot">matrix-email-bot</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 4 years, <a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-email-bot">matrix-email-bot</a> finally got an update. Now at v2, the bot has been rewritten using TypeScript and matrix-bot-sdk (farewell, js-sdk from 2017). It still requires manual setup and the behaviour overall should be the same as before, though the amount of testing is somewhat minimal - please complain in #email:t2bot.io if something goes wrong. </p>
<p>The bot also now supports encrypted rooms out of the box, including on the t2bot.io instance. Check out <a href="https://t2bot.io/emailbot/">t2bot.io/emailbot</a> for information on how to get the bot set up in your room.</p>
<p>The full changelog is available on the repo: https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-email-bot/releases/tag/v2.0.0</p>

<h3 id="newgrounds-mvs-matrix-advancement-server">Newgrounds MVS (Matrix adVancement Server)</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mr_johnson22:matrix.org">mr_johnson22</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An (unofficial) Matrix server by and for the <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a> community.</p>
<p>This is a Matrix server with membership restricted to <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/supporter">Newgrounds Supporters</a>. Newgrounds is an independent arts &amp; entertainment site that has been around for over 20 years, and I felt that its spirit of independence is a perfect match with the openness of Matrix!</p>
<p>The most notable feature of the server is <em>comment rooms for Newgrounds submissions</em>. Unlike other content-sharing sites, Newgrounds submissions don't have comment sections, but <em>review</em> sections, which let you post a single comment (and optional rating) for a submission. This encourages reviews to be focused on providing constructive feedback instead of being a place for off-topic discussions. With that said, open comment systems are nice too, so this Matrix server provides it! Simply visit <code>#portal_view_SUBMISSION_ID:ngmvs.one</code> to view!</p>
<p>These comment rooms are world-visible, but (at least for the time being) only Newgrounds Supporters may join these rooms &amp; post comments in them.</p>
<p>To help along with this, I made a Firefox extension to make joining these rooms a breeze: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/newgrounds-mvsx/">NG MVSX</a>. Simply view a Newgrounds submission page, and click on the icon that appears in your URL bar!</p>
<p>Code for all components is open-sourced on <a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs">GitLab</a>.</p>
<p>This is all very new, so things might break! If they do, tell me in <code>#ngmvs-public-discussion:ngmvs.one</code></p>
