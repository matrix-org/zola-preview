<p>At first when I read the headline I was scared - <em>explodes</em>? How can I protect myself from this explosion? After a <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-raises-30m-as-matrix-explodes/">moment of reading this huge news</a>, however, I was relieved - Matrix has <em>exploded in popularity</em>, and <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> have all new funding to keep driving the ecosystem forward. Let's go!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>There were no new MSCs created this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs entered proposed FCP state this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs are in FCP.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083: Restricting room membership based on membership in other rooms</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>While a quiet week for MSC state changes (shown above), there's still plenty of work and collaboration happening!</p>
<p>Spaces work marches forward as MSC3083 has been merged - allowing for users to join a room in a space based on their membership in a space. We think this will really help with the management of Spaces that contain lots of rooms that are otherwise invite-only.</p>
<p>Otherwise <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3291">MSC3291</a> (Muting in VoIP calls) has been receiving positive feedback this week!</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289</a> (room v8) is ticking along as the implementation is tested in Synapse and Complement tests.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/29/synapse-1-39-0-released">Synapse 1.39.0</a> is out! </p>
<p>Of all the pull requests we landed, my hat is off to MadLittleMods and his Graphviz prowess in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10250">#10250</a>, which moves us one step further down the path toward <em><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a>: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms.</em> Mmm. Graphs.</p>
<p>But back to Synapse! You should check out the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/29/synapse-1-39-0-released">release announcement</a>, but the bulk of the work this cycle went into internal cleanups. Synapse should also be slightly more performant, reliable, and should log fewer spurious errors. Of note, ShadowJonathan did a lot of work with <code>pyupgrade</code> and <code>com2ann</code> to move the entire codebase to more modern Py3.6+ conventions and inline type annotations; thanks, ShadowJonathan!</p>
<p>Synapse 1.39 also continues our march toward unifying Synapse's interface for extension modules, and we've now exposed plugin hooks for the <code>account_validity</code> option, and experimentally implemented hooks for third party event rules.</p>
<p>Lastly, special thanks to kroeckx who has submitted 17 pull requests against our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">SyTest test suite</a> in the past month, mainly arising from running SyTest against <a href="https://conduit.rs/">Conduit</a>. Thank you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello! This week, I created a <a href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/matrix-synapse-backend">matrix 1-click app</a> on the DigitalOcean marketplace. It's basically a pre-baked droplet image that is pre-configured with synapse, element-web, caddy, postgres, plus some setup and moderation tools. My intent was to make self-hosting a Matrix system as easy as pointing some DNS records and running a single script. It makes a lot of sense for smaller, more casual Matrix homeservers, and can serve as a good starting point! It also includes some small utility scripts - <code>./reset-password</code>, <code>./new-user</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Secrets like the postgres password and registration password are generated on first boot, there's no sensitive data baked into the image. Of course, it would be nice to be able to verify this - the source code used to build the image is being open sourced. I'm just waiting for some internal processes to finish. It will show up at https://github.com/digitalocean/marketplace-matrix somewhat soon!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heisenbridge roundup!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/">Heisenbridge</a> is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lazy joining of IRC users (see below)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep nick feature has been added</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridge aliveness can be tracked from bridge bot presence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ident replies can be customized by the admin for all users, default to mxid hash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pillifying IRC nicks has been improved</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest impact feature this time around is configurable lazy joining IRC users which improves the experience of joining massive IRC channels by not flooding the homeserver with join events. This is now the default and can be changed globally by the bridge admin or overridden per room by users.</p>
<p>Many fixes here and there. Still a few issues left before 1.0 and a lot of testing.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h3 id="announcing-matrix-client-cinny-1-0-0">Announcing Matrix client <a href="https://cinny.in/">Cinny</a> 1.0.0</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ajbura:matrix.org">ajbura</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cinny is a web-based matrix client focusing primarily on simple, elegant and secure interface.</p>
<p>The story started when a friend of mine introduced me to matrix and even after his help it was too difficult for me to get around with Element. I guess it was because Element is too different from other popular chat apps. Then I tried to find a good alternative for web but no success.</p>
<p>That's when me and my friend thought about creating Cinny. For the few weeks we were doing it for fun but when we shared a screenshot of the prototype, the response from people was surprising and that's when things got interesting. We got to know that a lot of people out there are looking for a simple and modern client and so we started building it.</p>
<p>Screenshot on Chrome desktop (see below)</p>
<h4 id="features">Features</h4>
<p>Cinny support the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Login/logout and registration of accounts</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This summer's gone by so fast it feels like it's only been a week! Here's a summary of what's happened with Ruma the past few weeks:</p>
<p>We have had a productive summer with our two Google Summer of Code students, Adam Blanchet and Devin Ragotzy. Adam finished implementing the last of our Identity Service API endpoints, bringing us to 100% implementation of all the Matrix API endpoints! (And we promise there are no bugs because &quot;Rust,&quot; right?)</p>
<p>Besides improving the Matrix ecosystem, Devin has been helping the Rust ecosystem at large by writing some Clippy lints to improve our codebase and upstreaming his additions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I made <a href="https://github.com/davidmehren/maubot-ldap-inviter">maubot-ldap-inviter</a>, a maubot plugin that (surprisingly) invites users into Matrix rooms, according to their membership in LDAP groups.</p>
<p>We are switching from RocketChat to Matrix in the next round of a software engineering course where students work on software projects in small groups.</p>
<p>RocketChat has a LDAP sync, which we previously used to auto-add students and tutors to the chatrooms they need to be in (global announcement room, helpdesk, chat for their group etc.).
As there was no such feature for Matrix, I built the bot over the last few days.</p>
<p>It's still somewhat specific to our LDAP setup, but if anyone wants to use the bot and has questions, just open an issue in the repo!</p>

<p>No more suffering! Because now the <a href="https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/miounne">Mother Miounne</a> exists and it does 2 things (for now): handles of web/html forms (sends it to matrix room) and handles invite tokens (integrates with <a href="https://github.com/ZerataX/matrix-registration">matrix-registration</a>)</p>
<p>We use it as backend of etke.cc service for some time, but still consider it as unstable, so try it yourself, hope it can help you üòâ</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a personal project I started a couple of weeks ago. I was dreaming of a good open source solution for OneNote or GoodNotes far a long time. There are already great projects, like<a href="https://xournalpp.github.io/">Xournal++</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lovasoa/whitebophir">Whitebophir</a>. But, they do not include the extent of possibilities to flexible host, collaborate and structuring the notes I have wished for.</p>
<p>Recently, I was thinking about the exact requirements I wanted for such a whiteboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Real time synchronization (cloud storage)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authentication/account infrastructure (to invite and collaborate on one whiteboard)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding/Removing ppl to a whiteboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliable hosting (when having cloud storage, I don't want to trust a one-man project to continue hosting. And a lot of ppl won‚Äôt self-host.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structuring whiteboards in categories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Viewing history and display which part has been drawn by which person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annotating other whiteboards with new layers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hosting for media like PDF's and images</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at this list, Matrix was such an obvious choice. I could comment every point but basically with: &quot;A whiteboard should be a Matrix room&quot; everything is said.</p>
<p><strong>TheBoard (probably not the final name) is exactly that.</strong> The frontend is not done yet, but already in an okay looking and usable state.</p>
<p><strong>Before trying it out:</strong> It takes really long to log in with an account with lots of rooms. So, I highly recommend to NOT use your main Matrix account.
Additionally, it is necessary to tag rooms as whiteboards. (really un-intuitive UX that will be improved) But for now the + button needs to be pressed and a (empty (not necessary but recommended) AND UNENCRYPTED) room needs to be selected.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I just (on Friday) finished initial spaces support to categorize the whiteboard in notebooks (aka spaces). They can only be create within a matrix client that supports spaces. But they will be displayed properly in TheBoard. (see screenshot)</p>
<p>Any problems, ideas and feedback is highly welcome as a github issue or in the matrix channel #TheBoard:matrix.org.</p>
<h4 id="tldr">TLDR:</h4>
<p>This project is whiteboard (similar to OneNote) which is</p>
<p>using Matrix as its backend. All your drawings are stored in matrix rooms
on your matrix server and are accessible to anyone who is invited.</p>

<p>A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<hr />
<p>This week brings plenty of usability improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is now the <code>list-contacts</code> bot command to--you guessed it!--list the Matrix puppets of all of your contacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's now possible to sync a chat with a LINE user by inviting their Matrix puppet to a DM, instead of having to wait for someone to send you a message in LINE for the bridge to auto-sync it. This is especially useful with <code>list-contacts</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LINE group chats that haven't been used recently are now included in the set of chats that get bridged on a <code>sync</code> operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of chats to sync at startup time &amp; on-demand is now configurable, as a bridge config setting &amp; a parameter to the <code>sync</code> command, respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes make it possible to sync LINE chats/groups that previously may not have gotten synced, due to the intricacies of how LINE on Chrome handles chat history (especially on first use of the bridge).</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LorenDB has rewritten the invite dialog as well as the memberlist in Qml. This means they work now much more reliably and show the users in appropriate colors and a few other small improvements.</p>
<p>Apart from that, Nheko now has support for sending stickers! This is based on Sorunome's awesome <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2545">MSC2545</a>, so no integration manager is needed and it is trivially easy to share your sticker packs (just invite someone into the same room!). You can use stickers from your account data or upload stickers into a room so every room member can use it. If you found a sticker pack you like, you can enable a pack from a room globally by going into Nheko's room settings. You can check my current preferred set of stickers here: matrix:r/nico's-stickers:neko.dev</p>
<p>Currently you can't edit a sticker pack yet from Nheko. Support for that will come in the near future. Until then you can use either FluffyChat, Element's DevTools or <a href="https://github.com/deepbluev7/stickerpicker">my hack to import Telegram sticker packs into a room</a>. Note that Nheko's sticker pack support is incompatible with integration server based sticker packs like the one Element uses. On the other hand, you don't need an integration manager to use them! Custom emote support based in the image packs MSC is coming in the future to Nheko too.</p>
<p>Furthermore we fixed some bugs to move E2EE in Nheko out of Beta. We are close now and we have a plan!</p>
<p>That's all, don't get your hands too sticky!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/02/this-week-in-matrix-2021-07-02">three weeks already since our last update</a> and we have a fair amount of new things to report.</p>
<p>As I write this, our interns Alejandro and Kai are at GUADEC, the annual GNOME conference, presenting during the interns lightning talk. The former has submitted a couple of merge requests (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/793">!793</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/794">!794</a>) that were necessary for the UI to accommodate his upcoming multi-account work. The latter has provided <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/788">a view for when no room is selected</a>. As for their mentor, Julian, he changed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/795">member loading so it only happens once a room is opened</a>, to improve performances. He also changed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/796">Matrix event handling to use <code>SyncRoomEvent</code></a>, which paves the way for display of various message types in the timeline of a room.</p>
<p>Giuseppe offered two nice additions to the login view:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in the form, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/783">one can now type enter to login</a> (it previously required to click on the button in the headerbar)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/791">errors are now displayed</a>, providing useful feedback on why the login may have failed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And to conclude this summary, we welcome üéâ newcomer Veli Tasalƒ± who fixed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/issues/802">a papercut I reported</a>: <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/787">when typing long messages, buttons next to the message entry were expanding along with the entry and now they keep nicely aligned</a>.</p>

<h4 id="desktop">Desktop</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New keyboard shortcuts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigating room list with arrow keys when there's no room open (and esc to close the current room)</li>
<li>Global shortcut to open Beeper</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rooms are opened where you left off (like Telegram, WhatsApp, etc) instead of at the bottom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated unread room indicators: a colored circle around the room avatar <em>(screenshot here)</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bridges">Bridges</h4>
<h4 id="linkedin">LinkedIn</h4>
<p>We've integrated the LinkedIn bridge into Beeper. The bridge is in beta and is generally ready for use. Since the last update, we moved it to <a href="https://gitlab.com/beeper/linkedin">GitLab</a>, added a Docker image, and implemented reaction and redaction handling in both directions! We also fixed a bunch of bugs across the board to improve reliability.</p>
<h4 id="android-sms">Android SMS</h4>
<p>The Android SMS bridge mentioned in the last update is progressing. It should be ready for self-hosted use in a few weeks, so our next update will probably include that.</p>
<p>Related to the SMS bridge, I've made <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-syncproxy">mautrix-syncproxy</a>, which is a microservice to do the <code>/sync</code>ing required for end-to-bridge encryption (to-device events and such) in the cloud and forwarding the data to the normal appservice transaction endpoint. When combined with <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-wsproxy">mautrix-wsproxy</a>, it allows the SMS bridge to only have a websocket connection, which uses significantly less battery than a HTTP request every 30 seconds. The sync proxy partially implements <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3202">MSC3202</a> and the to-device part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> (partially because it only does individual users rather than all appservice-owned users).</p>

<p>Several GNOME contributors and I have been following TWIM and really enjoyed the concept. Since open source is about <del>stealing</del> sharing ideas, we wanted to deploy something similar for GNOME.</p>
<p>I gave this room's beloved <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/twim-o-matic">twim-o-matic</a> a try and fiddled a bit with the code. But I soon found that it is too specialised for matrix.org. That's when I decided to write a project agnostic TWIx bot based on matrix-rust-sdk called <a href="https://github.com/haecker-felix/hebbot">Hebbot</a>!</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://thisweek.gnome.org/posts/2021/07/twig-1/">how it looks in practice with a companion website for GNOME</a>. If you‚Äôre interested in how it looks behind the scenes, <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/haeckerfelix/2021/07/16/introducing-this-week-in-gnome/">have a look at this blog post which explains how it works</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week I have developed a new plugin for <a href="https://octoprint.org/">OctoPrint</a> which is a tool for controlling and monitoring 3D printers, which sends notifications about your prints and status of your 3D printer to matrix. The existing OctoSlack plugin also has Matrix support but fell foul of the /sync response changes in Synapse 1.38, and also sent the images from the camera to Matrix as inline images rather than m.image events, so they didn't render on some clients.</p>
<p>My new plugin can send messages on most events supported by OctoPrint, but the core events which are configurable through the OctoPrint web UI are print started, paused, completed and failed as well as print progress notifications. If you want Matrix notifications for your 3D prints, you can install the plugin through the official <a href="https://octoprint.org/">OctoPrint plugin repository</a> or by installing from the <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/octoprint-matrix-notifier-plugin">GitHub repository</a>. If you have any feature requests or pull requests, contributions to the plugin are very welcome.</p>
<p>Here is a preview of a print progress notification from something I was printing last night:</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, we <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.0">released Dendrite 0.4.0 on Monday</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/12/dendrite-0-4-0-released">wrote a blog post about it</a>! It's taken us a little while to get to this release, but it includes a number of quality-of-life improvements and changes that will significantly reduce the amount of resources needed to run a Dendrite server. The full changelog is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.0">available on GitHub</a> and many juicy details in the aforementioned blog post, but at a high level this release includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All-new state storage, designed to reduce the amount of disk space that the roomserver takes up to store room state by aggressively deduplicating state blocks and snapshots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved appservice support, with a number of bridges now working with Dendrite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared secret registration (using the same API shape as Synapse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimisations in the federation API <code>/send</code> and <code>/get_missing_events</code> endpoints to reduce memory usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved state resolution v2 performance when dealing with power level events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per-room queuing to reduce head-of-line blocking on the roomserver input API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of bug fixes around invites, registration, sync and media, and 5 panics fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the release, we've been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Completing key notary support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing <code>state_default</code> for power levels in gomatrixserverlib</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolving some issues around rejecting invites, particularly when the remote server is not available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the cost of checking if the local server is in a given room</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since our last update, our Sytest compliance numbers have been on the rise again, taking us ever closer to our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 61%, up from 60% last time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 92%, up from 80% last time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appservice APIs: 52%</p>

<p>But that's not the only thing new in Synapse 1.38. We also landed the ability to set an expiry time on cache entries, allowing you to reclaim memory from infrequently accessed caches.

<p>A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Docker is now supported, via Dockerfiles that actually work now! But for the time being, Docker images must be built manually, as I am yet to deploy a Docker registry for prebuilt images.</p>
<p>Also, sample systemd service unit configuration files are now available, courtesy of @lecris:lecris.me üôÇ</p>
<p>For more info on all of this, see <a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line/src/branch/master/SETUP.md">SETUP.md</a>.</p>
<p>What I'm working on next is a bot command to list all of your LINE contacts &amp; groups (similar to <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a>'s <code>list &lt;contacts|groups&gt;</code>), and the ability to sync a LINE DM by inviting a contact to a Matrix DM. This will allow messaging LINE contacts that the bridge didn't yet create a portal for.</p>
<p>And please, <em>feel free to try out this bridge!</em> It should be serviceable for day-to-day usage now. I still won't be able to host a public instance of it for a while, though (as it is fairly hefty due to having to run Chrome), so you'll have to self-host if you want to try it.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we fixed bugs. Switching room should now be quite a bit faster again and once Qt 6.3 is released with some important bugfixes, scrolling in Nheko should be super smooth. (We can't enable that flag yet, because of 3 bugs in the item pooling code in Qt.)</p>
<p>Other bugfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inline images sometimes wouldn't show, but now inline emotes and images should render once they are loaded! (This took me a year to figure out)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now send edits in encryted rooms again, if they are a reply to an event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No more reply fallback in the room list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At some point timed out verification requests started showing up on startup. That regression is fixed now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix rooms not showing up after login because we were off by one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix some cases where the loading spinner wouldn't stop animating and as such consistently use CPU, when a room is open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cache db transactions to reduce allocations and memory zeroing when loading a room or scrolling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix some edge cases in the blurhash decoding, that could lead to brownish image previews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix accepting an invite not placing you in the joined room.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nik:matrix.teckids.org">Nik</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the first weeks of July, <a href="https://teckids.org">Teckids e.V.</a> held their annual summer camp for kids between 9 and 15 years. This year, after we started introducing Matrix and Element as a chat platform from September 2020 onwards, the camp was heavily relying on the platform for various parts.</p>
<p>Before the camp started, we invited all 90 participants to a chat room to get together, share a bit about what they expect, already did with coding and technical stuff, talk about what food they'd like to have for the barbecue, and stuff like that. Many of them engaged in the discussion, and started exploring Element (before you ask, yes, we hat a lot of snow and party poppers üòõ!). Some got really excited that they could even change or add features to Element, or ask for such changes ‚Äì we had to promise to hold a session where we find out how to add one new animation to Element. Unfortunately, Element is developed on GitHub, so the potential young contributors are locked out by the exclusive Terms of Use there. We are trying to reach out to Element HQ to find a solution.</p>
<p>During the camp, verifying crypto sessions using emojis again made for a good party game to get to know each other (like, find the kid a nickname belongs to on the camp site, start verification, and compare emojis ‚Äì a lot of fun that we, again, did not even have to start, because someone always finds out about it and asks what it is about).</p>
<p>Now that everyone got to know Matrix for chatting, in one of our workshops, the participants discovered that not only people, but also devices can send messages, and react to replies ‚Äì in that workshop, the kids built a chat-ops IoT door beel (for their tent on site, or room at home). They soldered a circuit board to fit an ESP (MicroPython) micro controller on, and coded a small program (using templates with differing complexity levels), defining what the door bell should send when a button is pressed, on what messages to react, and the like. We produced a fun video about the project (German audio, English subtitles): https://eduvid.org/videos/watch/20a50c25-ecb4-48c0-9b13-de2548f290d4?subtitle=en . The (minimal and somewhat buggy) MicroPython client library is published as <a href="https://edugit.org/hacknfun/thema-mechatronik/mytrix">¬µtrix</a>.</p>
<p>Now, sadly, the event is over, and we slowly see (as expected, only a part of the) participants moving over to our long-term project chatrooms; we will start clearing the virtual camp site chatroom during the weekend to make room for a new group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asked about the regularity of these events, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nik:matrix.teckids.org">Nik</a> replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are still experimenting with our new camp formats. As bad as it all is, COVID caused a lot of innovation here because we were forced to leave the known roads we normally travelled, and now we are starting to integrate all that new stuff (like really embracing Matrix) into outdoor and presence events. I think we are on a really good way with it, and surely I will keep posting updates that might be of interest for the greater community.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big(int) news! This week Matrix.org processed its 2^31st event, exceeding the range of a PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-numeric.html">integer column</a> for the first time. This caused a bit of a scramble in the aftermath of last week's spam attack, as we had a few <code>integer</code> columns in our schema which we needed to convert to <code>bigint</code>. Fortunately, we were able to complete the change sufficiently in advance (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8255">#8255</a>), and also took the opportunity to audit other columns and sequences in the database which could conceivably overflow. Synapse 1.38, due out next week, will automatically migrate homeservers when they upgrade. We run the migration as a background task, so homeservers should continue functioning as normal throughout, though they may use a bit more disk and memory, especially when rebuilding indexes for the new <code>bigint</code> column.</p>
<p>We're also starting to hone in on our team's goals for this quarter, and it's looking like our primary focus will be on improving room join speeds. Wish us luck!</p>
<p>Lastly, we're overjoyed to announce that <a href="https://github.com/reivilibre">@reivilibre</a>, a former intern on the backend team, joined Element this week! We can't wait to see where he helps us take Synapse!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>SchildiChat for Android is back in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.spiritcroc.riotx">Google Play Store</a>! Users who have previously installed the release using our own F-Droid repo will be able to update without the need to re-install.

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spaces work is making progress. Some rooms can now be previewed. To improve that situation, I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3266">MSC to preview specific rooms</a>. Alternatively we will try to get the previews for the few rooms you aren't joined to from the space summary API, currently we are just fetching the existing state. You can also now join previewed rooms and the design of joining invites was adapted to match it.</p>
<p>red_sky‚òÑÔ∏è went through the pain of fixing the Windows builds after we changed our http backend last week. So if you want to try it out, you can test it on Windows. We also replaced the old, boring spinner with an animated Nheko logo. If you see that a lot and think it is Nheko's fault, don't hesitate to open an issue! But in most cases it will probably be your server. Sadly no screenshot of how the spinner looks like, my server is too fast and taking a proper screenshot is too much effort because of that. ;p</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue with updating device lists in the develop version of Nheko. If you were using the nightlies, now is a good time to update! In more E2EE news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3270">symmetric megolm backup</a> fixes the issues I had with the online key backup, so looking forward to implementing that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The latest release of opsdroid is out with various fixes which can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/releases/tag/v0.23.0">the changelog</a>. The main point to note for matrix users is that older versions of matrix-nio (the matrix client library used by opsdroid) did not support the synapse change to omit <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10214">optional fields from sync</a>. Therefore if you are using our docker images you will need to update to 0.23 to get a container with the newest matrix-nio included.</p>
<p>The other change which is relevant to matrix users is that Oleg has added support for version 2 of the <a href="https://rasa.com/">Rasa NLU</a> framework, so you can once again do open source, self hosted natural language bots.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's been a month since our last update. A lot of the work since then has been on making everything more reliable, but we've also added new features to our clients and started making some new bridges.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added thread UI for Slack-bridged rooms. Internally they're just replies like before, but the client will intelligently collapse replies in Slack rooms into threads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merged upstream Element additions like voice messages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also merged some features that aren't in Element yet, like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/5814">Giphy integration</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Released Beeper iOS to Testflight.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added grouping rooms by chat network based on the <code>m.bridge</code> state event. The UI is similar to spaces, but they're not actual Matrix spaces (yet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for Android 11's &quot;conversation&quot; notifications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bridges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Android Messages is turning out difficult to reverse-engineer to a sufficiently reliable level, so we're building a new SMS bridge into our Android app. It'll also be available as a standalone open-source app, which already exists at https://gitlab.com/beeper/android-sms (but doesn't have any setup instructions yet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've funded development of a LinkedIn bridge. sumner will post a more detailed update about that.</p>

Development is being funded by Beeper, and is being designed with integration into Beeper as it's primary goal. However, the bridge is open source (Apache 2.0) and will be available to self-host. The source code is here: https://github.com/sumnerevans/linkedin-matrix.</p>

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line/">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Better LINE-&gt;Matrix read receipt bridging is now supported in the <code>testing</code> branch! The bridge now checks all LINE chats (not just the most recently-used one) to see if messages you sent have been read (in LINE). This works by cycling through all LINE chats where the final message is posted by you and doesn't have a &quot;Read&quot; marker on it yet (or for multi-user chats, if your last message hasn't been read by everyone in the room).</p>
<p>With that, I'll consider the bridge to be in Early Beta! üéâ I'm now testing the bridge for myself to iron out a few kinks, and am preparing a PR to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/">matrix.org</a> webpage to have this listed on https://matrix.org/bridges/.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello World! I am here to bring you Nheko news!</p>
<p>We merged the Spaces branch, which means Nheko master can now show some spaces. Peeking unjoined rooms, nesting spaces and creating them should be coming soon. We are also looking into how to fit knocking into the UI (we already rendered incoming knocks in the timeline for a while).</p>
<p>You can also now edit still pending messages, which should help if your server is slow and you notice a typo. The edit will then get queued and be sent as soon as the server acknowledges they received the original message. Apart from that there have been some improvements to the readability of the room list and some other UI elements.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we switched out our entire http backend from Boost to Curl. For that I wrote a <a href="https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/coeurl">simple wrapper around Curl</a>. This fixes about 10 issues around connection shutdown, brings proxy support, http/2 and http/3 support and in general makes Nheko crash less and reduces latency a LOT! This will obviously cause some pain for packagers, but I hope it isn't too bad. Some of the issues this fixes only had 2 digits in our bugtracker and one was even filed by benpa!</p>
<p>Have a nice weekend everyone! ‚ô•</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>Spaces work continues with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083</a> (Restricted room memberships), which will include a new room version due to the new <code>join_rule</code> of `restricted. On the other side of things, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3245">MSC3245</a> (voice messages) and by extension extensible events, is moving as the implementation work is pushed forward. Lots of activity on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3215">MSC3215</a> (improved moderation tooling) as well which will no doubt prove to be invaluable as the Matrix network continues to grow.</p>

<p>Knock, knock TWIM! It's a new week, and I'm filling in for Dan today to bring you an update on Synapse's latest progress!</p>
<p>Hot off the heels of Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.36.0">1.36.0‚Äôs release</a> last week, we‚Äôve put out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.37.0rc1">1.37.0rc1</a>! It includes the long-awaited <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">‚Äúroom knocking‚Äù feature</a> (note that no clients currently support knocking), a completely reworked <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/modules.html">pluggable modules interface</a> and experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">backfilling history into rooms</a>. With knocking support in, this means Synapse now has support for <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/rooms/v7/">room v7</a>!</p>
<p>Among those exciting updates, we also have the usual churn of bug fixes and improvements across the board. Many updates to the documentation as well as we lean into using the new <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse">Synapse documentation site</a> more and more.

The first one was about creating a library with shared chat visual components for KDE's chat apps: NeoChat for Matrix, Tok for Telegram and Kaidan for XMPP, KDE Connect and Spacebar for SMS, ... The second BoF was more about NeoChat and Quotient and we discussed how to move forwards with some problems (e.g. non-hacky text input auto-completion) but also the roadmap around E2EE, Spaces and Widgets support. Speaking about E2EE, we will have some very good news to announce next week, stay tuned!</p>

<p>Newcomer Giuseppe De Palma removed bashisms from our git hook because they were preventing him from contributing. They then went on to <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/775">tweak the history style to remove the grey background around it</a>. They also got rid of a papercut from the login form: before his intervention, users needed to provide the full homeserver URL with the <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> scheme prefix. It will now <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/780">default to HTTPS</a>.</p>
<p>We also did some housekeeping work that should improve the experience for people joining us on the Fractal Next fun.

Julian cleaned up the pseudo-milestone description that we had in the README, now that we have a proper <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/milestones/18">Gitlab milestone</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>Hello dear Synapse Admins, <code>synadm</code> v0.30 is out. lt seems I was in &quot;story telling mode&quot; already when I wrote the release notes yesterday. That should perfectly suit a TWIM article as well üôÇ So there you go, copy/pasted from https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/releases/tag/v0.30 with love:</p>
<h4 id="new">New</h4>
<p><code>synadm</code> finally got some nicely rendered documentation pages hosted at https://synadm.readthedocs.io.</p>
<p>&quot;Login as a user&quot; admin API support:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm user login &lt;user id&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.user.html#synadm-user-login">Have a look at the new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>New subcommand <code>matrix</code>supporting execution of regular Matrix commands. As a first shot a command to issue any Matrix API call has been implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix raw endpoint/url -m post -f data.json</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix raw endpoint/url -m put -d '{&quot;key1&quot;: &quot;value1&quot;}' --prompt</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.matrix.html#synadm-matrix-raw">The new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that this is meant to be a convenience function in case a Synapse homeserver admin wants to quickly help users e.g set specific settings available via regular Matrix calls and not the Synapse admin API directly. Also note that it is not meant to replace the awesome Matrix CLI tools that are already out there. matrix-commander, matrixcli to mention just a few.</em></p>
<p>The second command below <code>matrix</code> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix login &lt;user id&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.matrix.html#synadm-matrix-login">The new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It implements a plain login on a Matrix server using username and password. It can even be used to retrieve a token for an admin user, e.g helpful for setting up fresh <code>synadm</code> installations. <a href="https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#getting-an-admin-token">Read about it here</a></p>
<h4 id="improved">Improved</h4>

<p>Improved AUTOCMD with multi-command support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved ZNC support with display of external messages by yourself</p>

<p>Currently working towards 1.0 release so mostly bug hunting and improving existing code and features.</p>
<p><strong>Call for mutual help!</strong> The plumb feature needs more testing on busy IRC channels. If you need to plumb public Matrix rooms and IRC channels on <em>any</em> IRC network that does not have a public bridge available or just want to use a relaybot on IRC side for some reason hit me up on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#heisenbridge:vi.fi">#heisenbridge:vi.fi</a> and we can setup a test plumb, free of charge! Only requirements are that I can lurk around to monitor how it works and there's nothing offensive on-topic.</p>
<p>In other news @warthog9 <a href="https://opensource.com/article/21/6/irc-matrix-bridge-znc">submitted an article to opensource.com</a> how to use ZNC and Heisenbridge together to keep using your existing IRC bouncer with Heisenbridge as a client for it. Pretty cool stuff!</p>

<p>Hola everyone! Today we're releasing the latest in bridge greatness, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.27.0">matrix-appservice-irc 0.27.0</a>. This release contains the bulk of our work done for libera.chat. As always, thanks to the community for testing, writing up issues and creating PRs so that we can build better bridges to our friends on other networks.</p>
<p>The highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Username/password SASL authentication support. The bridge now lets you set a !username.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridge operators can now choose to block messages in the I-&gt;M direction while Matrix users are not joined to IRC as a privacy preservation technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now configure the bridge to publish rooms to the public room directory (rather than the appservice directory). The bridge can now also use the whole alias namespace (e.g. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#foo:libera.chat">#foo:libera.chat</a> -&gt; #foo).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numerous bug fixes and quality of life fixes!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is now live on libera.chat, and will be live on the other bridges very soon!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Even more read receipt improvements are here! In summary, with the magic of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a>, the bridge shouldn't ever &quot;view&quot; a LINE chat on your behalf in order to sync a message (which would send a read receipt to your chat contacts, even though you didn't read the chat yourself). For LINE messages that require viewing its chat in order to be bridged, like images/stickers (to get the image) and messages in multi-user chats (to know who sent them), the bridge instead sends a &quot;placeholder&quot; message that gets updated with the real LINE message content when you view the placeholder. That way, the bridge will only view a LINE chat when you view its Matrix portal.</p>
<p>A few stability fixes have been pushed as well. Namely, <code>sync</code> should be less likely to accidentally skip chats.</p>
<p>Only one final read receipt improvement remains, for LINE-&gt;Matrix read receipt bridging (which I mentioned last week): to make the bridge check all LINE chats (not just the most recently-used one) to see if messages you sent have been read (in LINE). This will work by cycling through all LINE chats where the final message is posted by you and doesn't have a &quot;Read&quot; marker on it yet.</p>
<p>Once that is taken care of, I'll consider the bridge to be in beta! üéâ</p>

<p>I've been invited to appear in the latest episode of Clever Cloud's tech podcast Message √† Caract√®re Informatique, where we talked mostly about Matrix and decentralisation, but also about a bunch of other interesting things ranging from timbl minting his source code as an NFT to how to hack autonomous car with sound. It was loads of fun, thanks to them for the invite!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After some fixes the bot is now back in shape. This means that all Rooms should again have the correct names from now on and accept invites again. Be aware the bot currently doesnt support encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>As a side effect also https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/spaces now found 3x the rooms as before.</p>
<p>Also the webpage got a big overhaul which brings a lot more mobile phone friendliness :) So you can finally properly use it on your phone as well.</p>
<p>Another change is that tombstoned rooms now get filtered from the list to keep it clean.</p>
<p>For developers a API reference is now available at https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/api</p>
<p>Also if you use the apis please note that the content is gzip encoded. The server currently doesnt respect the <code>Accept-Encoding</code> Header.</p>
<p>On the side of internal changes is now that the retries are limited to 5 times instead the previously buggy amount. This should reduce join requests from my server drastically.</p>
<p>For people usings the /servers api endpoint there is also now a include_members option. This means https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/servers?include_members=true</p>
<p>now also gives unique servers based on known members.</p>

<p>After having tried to convince several people to join the Matrix, my main conclusion is that it's too difficult for people. Apps that big tech companies produce are so simple that having to choose a client, choose (or set up) a homeserver and building bridges is too much of a push factor from the Matrix.</p>
<p>To help those people, I've written a quick guide that should help people without a programming background join the Matrix. I'm using this as a reference when people ask how they could join the Matrix, feel free to do this yourself as well: https://noordstar.me/b/how-to-join-matrix.md</p>

This is a significant improvement to before! Keep an eye out for future P2P Matrix demo builds using these new protocol changes.</p>

<li>
<p>Nearly 6k Matrix users are now connected to IRC and growing by the minute.</p>

<p>I'm hoping we'll be nearing the end of our journey on this bridge, and it will settle into a natural stable state over the coming days! Anyway, thanks everyone for your patience and we hope to see you on Matrix or IRC!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi bridge followers, today we've released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.27.0-rc1">0.27.0-rc1</a> of the IRC bridge containing a huge number of changes following all the work we've been doing on libera.chat. Notable things to call out in this release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We've refactored the node-irc library to be typescripty and modern, rather than the quite old JS that it was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SASL support for username/password auth has landed, which hopefully means a smoother login process for many. (We're aware of some issues around setting usernames, watch this space)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing you to spin up the bridge with complete control over the alias namespace of a host (e.g. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libera:libera.chat">#libera:libera.chat</a> links to #libera).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally, a privacy feature to block incoming IRC messages when Matrix users are not all joined which is requested by some IRC networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please report bugs as you see them to https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc, and let's all pray this will be a smooth release :)</p>

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Read receipt improvements are here! They are in temporary branches until they've been tested for stability:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>better-receipts-dm</code> branch contains some smarts to prevent Puppeteer from having to &quot;view&quot; a LINE DM chat in order to sync it, which would make the contact you're DMing think you've read their messages when it was really Puppeteer that &quot;saw&quot; them. However, this doesn't work for non-text messages (like images) or messages in group chats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>better-receipts-msc2409</code> branch (which extends the above branch) uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> to detect when you read a bridged message on Matrix, so it can tell Puppeteer to view it on LINE on your behalf. This will let your LINE contacts know when you've read their messages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After this, only a few read receipt improvements are left to be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make Puppeteer check all LINE chats (not just the most recently-used one) to see if messages you sent have been read (in LINE). This will work by cycling through all LINE chats where the final message is posted by you and doesn't have a &quot;Read&quot; marker on it yet.</p>

<p>Use MSC2409 to avoid having to view a LINE chat when syncing non-text messages (like images). The idea is to send a placeholder message that will get replaced with the real message (which requires Puppeteer to view the LINE chat) only when you actually view the placeholder.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've been slowly refactoring the room and communities list to prepare it for spaces. This work is now mostly complete, changing ~4000 lines of code, of which 1500 just got deleted. All of the sidebars are now expandable and collapsible, so you can see the full name of your tags and communities and the lists should also update more dynamically now. Startup also only takes half as long as before on my system and Nheko uses 100MB less memory for my account. Next week I'll probably add spaces to the communities list as well as the room list.</p>
<p>Apart from that LorenDB has been rewriting the member list as well as the invite dialog in Qml and manu has been making progress on the room directory. All of that seems to be coming along nicely and behave much more reasonably than the old versions. There has also been a lot of progress on the Italian and Esperanto translations as well as a few smaller bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>I hope we will make it to space next week!</p>

<p>This week was a busy week for NeoChat. We added tons of cool stuff! We rewrote the setting page to add a bit of organization in the settings. This also pushed us to add new appearance options. You can now add a blur effect as background, change the color scheme of NeoChat and switch between bubbles and a more compact layout as you wish.</p>

<p>This week the Spec Core Team has been reviewing various Spaces MSCs, most recently <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3230">MSC3230</a> (Space ordering). We're also hoping to square away the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issuecomment-655153491">aggregations MSCs</a> (message editing, reactions, etc) once and for all, though this will likely take a concerted effort from a few members to pull off.</p>
<p>Finally <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">MSC3231</a> is a (currently draft status) MSC from Callum, one of Matrix.org's <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021">GSoC students</a> this year! His project aims to allow native token-based registration to homeservers (the idea is so that you can generate a few tokens from your registration-disabled homeserver and hand them out to a few trusted friends and family members).</p>
<p>And finally, work still continues on finishing up the technical portions of the new release process for the spec. As mentioned last week, we've attempted to split the work up over multiple people in order to get it done quicker. Slowly but surely...</p>

<p>Another round of updates on my smart caching media proxy. After refactoring a lot (as always), I implemented <strong>thumbnailing</strong>! Now the only big feature left to add is url previewing.

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Send a bridge notice when getting unexpectedly logged out of LINE, to warn you to log in again.</li>
<li>Improve resiliency of LINE user avatar syncing.</li>
<li>Properly support syncing LINE rooms with participants who aren't in your LINE friends list (This was harder than it sounds...!)</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes (and ones before it) will be merged to <code>master</code> once I reorganize some messy commits.</p>
<p>The next big task is still to fix outbound read receipts (i.e. to make it so that the bridge syncing a message doesn't make your &gt; LINE contacts think you actually read that message). Once that is done, I'll consider the bridge to be in beta.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@freaktechnik:humanoids.be">freaktechnik</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://thunderbird.net">Thunderbird</a> now has Matrix support based on <code>matrix-js-sdk</code> enabled in the Nightly builds.</p>
<p>The star feature is probably that we support multiple Matrix accounts in the same client. Right now all your unencrypted rooms with text messages should work fine. While we think we won't destroy your account's state, it's still recommended to use a testing account with it. During account setup, it will ask you for a password, even if the homeserver supports SSO. If you intend to log in through SSO, just leave the password field blank.</p>
<p>We're not quite at the point where we support all the things you love about chatting with Matrix. Many of the missing features and polish to make communication successful are tracked in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1712710">this meta bug</a>. The goal for that milestone is to enable Matrix in our Beta builds.</p>
<p>You can get a Thunderbird Nightly build at the bottom of <a href="https://thunderbird.net/#channel">thunderbird.net</a> by switching from &quot;Beta Channel&quot; to &quot;Nightly Channel&quot;. If you run into bugs with the Matrix integration, please report them through <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Chat%20Core&amp;component=Matrix">this form</a>. When filing a bug, please include debug logs. You can copy the debug logs for the account by going to the &quot;Show Accounts&quot; dialog, right clicking the account and selecting &quot;Copy Debug Log&quot;. Note that the debug log may contain information from any of your conversations, so you might want to check the contents before posting it anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Callum, our GSoC student, after spending some time on Synapse, had now his first go at Nheko's codebase. He implemented, that you can now just enter the server name on registration instead of the full URL. This means entering conduit.rs or matrix.org works now nicely, since those servers are actually hosted at a different URL. He's now working on the Token Registration MSC, which he will implement in Synapse and Nheko, so exciting times ahead!</p>
<p>We also had a small contribution from pcworld, who fixed that if you only viewed the room list in the narrow layout, you would not get notifications for the last selected room.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with some words, that you may have heard a few times already: &quot;Watch this space for next weeks update!&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a smart media worker/proxy, to offload initial spikes in traffic for homeservers behind slower network uplinks.</p>
<p>There's a <code>&lt;remote&gt;</code> component that sits on a small vps, handling the upload and download endpoints (and soon, thumbnails), with an in-memory cache to quickly respond to requests.
Media still gets forwarded to the <code>&lt;local&gt;</code> component where it gets stored in Synapse's media folder with an accompanying database entry, so all media is still stored long-term in the way Synapse expects it to be, so the proxy can be removed at any point. </p>
<p>Currently not production ready but you're welcome to snoop around the repo :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks, some of you (well, frankly most of you) wanted to hear about our plans for libera.chat. I've been hard at work
this week building a brand new bridge which is hosted on the libera.chat homeserver and it's nearly ready to go. We're just making a few final
preparations before taking it out of beta, but it's currently available as a portaling bridge. You can currently reach any channel on libera.chat by joining
<code>#&lt;channel_name&gt;:libera.chat</code>. You can also add the homeserver to your room directory in your Matrix client to search all the bridged rooms.</p>
<p>We're also hanging out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libera-matrix:libera.chat">#libera-matrix:libera.chat</a>, if you have any questions. Of course, the bridge is proving to be very popular so please be patient :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definitely one of the most sought-after Matrix bridges lately.
Props to Half-Shot, Libera.Chat and everyone else for getting
it all together in such short notice.</p>

<h4 id="plumbing-irc-channels-older-wrench">Plumbing IRC channels üßë‚Äçüîß</h4>
<p>Somewhat experimental feature that has landed this week is the ability to use single puppeting in a public Matrix room to bridge IRC channels.</p>
<p>This support comes through a new <code>PLUMB</code> admin command for network rooms that will ask the bridge bot to join a public Matrix room and an IRC channel.</p>
<p>On IRC side there will be only a single user/bot that will relay messages from Matrix users. This is a stop-gap between fully puppeting Matrix users on IRC and doesn't need explicit permission from an IRC network to use by channel operators as long as bots are allowed.</p>
<p>On Matrix side puppets will join and leave based on their presence on the IRC channel. The bridge bot does not need any special permissions in a room as it doesn't do permission synchronization so it can be kept without any power levels.</p>
<p>Unplumbing a room is as simple as kicking the bridge out and it will take the puppets with it.</p>
<p>As this is a fairly new feature it does have some rough edges so feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>With all this said, if you're in the need to bridge any IRC channel on any network with little friction, Heisenbridge should have you covered!</p>
<h4 id="sasl-support-unloc">SASL support üîí</h4>
<p>If you're using Heisenbridge to connect to Libera.Chat from a network block that has SASL enforcement enabled (like some VPS providers) you can now configure SASL credentials to authenticate at connection time to bypass this restriction.</p>
<p>This only implements SASL PLAIN for now. Certificate authentication may be looked at in the future.</p>
<h4 id="but-that-s-not-all">But that's not all</h4>
<ul>
<li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week brings a variety of assorted bugfixes &amp; feature improvements in the <code>testing</code> branch. Included are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for <code>m.sticker</code> events for LINE stickers (with an option to use <code>m.image</code> if preferred)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear resolution of LINE emojis, and a config option to scale them (since they're tiny by default)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less frequent re-downloading of already-seen LINE stickers/emoji (there are limits to this, but it's still an improvement)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Option to disable syncing LINE stickers/emoji (in case re-hosting LINE imagery is a liability)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More reliable message syncing (should never get &quot;Decrypting message...&quot; or invisible images/stickers/emoji anymore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix crashes during inbound message &amp; read receipt syncing of multi-user rooms</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like last time, testing is much appreciated üòÄ</p>
<p>Remaining big tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rework message syncing so that receiving a message doesn't require &quot;viewing&quot; the LINE chat in the Puppeteer-controlled browser, which will make LINE send a read receipt even though you may not actually have read the message yourself (I mentioned this a while ago; it's still a todo)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for multiple bridge users at once (A public instance of the bridge will only be considered once multi-user support is ready)</p>

<ul>
<li>Element Android 1.1.8 has been released on the beta track of the Google PlayStore. It will probably be pushed to production at the beginning of next week. The Android matrix SDK2 has also been released.</li>
<li>This week, we implemented the ability to change the network when looking in the room directory. Also gitter.im has been added to the default network list. See some screenshots in <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/3419">https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/3419</a> </li>
