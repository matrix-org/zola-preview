<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs entered proposed FCP state this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a> (merge)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2582">MSC2582: Remove mimetype from EncryptedFile object</a> (merge)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2582">MSC2582</a> (Removing mimetype from EncryptedFile object) was one of those MSCs that were relatively small, but had been languishing for <em>ages</em>. Partly because it required client implementations to update, but also partly because one needed to go in after a while and actually confirm that all known clients had updated. @uhoreg took up the mantle on his own to do so, and as a result this MSC has hit FCP and is soon to be merged. Thank you!</p>
<h4 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h4>
<p>The random MSC of the week is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3262">MSC3262: aPAKE authentication</a>!</p>
<p>Alongside <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2957">MSC2957</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3265">MSC3265</a>, this MSC is requesting a better way of communicating one's password to the homeserver without sending it in plaintext (over TLS, hopefully).</p>
<p>Remember that this is only done in exchange for an access token, which is then used for all subsequent requests. Still though, I can see the merit!</p>

<p>Synapse 1.41.0 is out!

As mentioned in last week's TWiM, Synapse 1.41 uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: Room version capabilities</a> to tell clients that they can and should use Room Version 8 when creating <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>. The future is here!</p>
<p>We've also stopped publishing Debian packages for Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy).</p>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è We expect to publish a <strong>security release</strong> Synapse 1.41.1 on Tuesday, 31 August which fixes two moderate severity issues.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Synapse team would like to extend a warm welcome to Sean Quah, who joined Element's backend team this week. Welcome, Sean!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el">Ement.el</a>, a Matrix client for Emacs, gained some more improvements this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multi-account support was merged, so you can now use multiple accounts at the same time.  You can even be in the same room in two different accounts, at the same time, in side-by-side windows (which is useful for testing).  (Note that existing users will need to log in again, because the format of the saved-session file changed.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rooms you have been invited to now show up in the rooms list, and you can join them by clicking a button in the room's buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypted rooms now display a warning in the header and suggest that users consider using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon/">Pantalaimon</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Membership events are now formatted more usefully, similar to Element's style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completion for room and user names and IDs is implemented using standard Emacs commands and bindings (i.e. <code>C-M-i</code> by default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last-read marker may be jumped to, even if it's at an earlier event that has not yet been retrieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emotes (i.e. <code>/me</code>-style messages) can be sent by pressing <code>e</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timestamps in the room list are shaded according to how &quot;hot&quot; (i.e. recently updated) the room is (see screenshot).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various small fixes and enhancements.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now supports uploading to online key backup and warns you before enabling it, that we don't recommend using the asymmetric version. If you update to one of the current builds (and or the next version), you will also experience a bit longer load times on first startup. That is because we force-cleared the cache to be able to handle the new goodies like spaces and sticker/emote-packs. In the best case, everything is seamless.</p>
<p>We also had contributions by various people:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>resolritter cleaned up that while tab moved you down most popup lists, it didn't move up when shift was pressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harmathy extended the FAQ to answer commonly asked questions like &quot;Does Nheko support E2EE&quot; or &quot;What commands are supported&quot;. Don't worry, we know most of you won't read that and will still answer that question when you undoubtedly come asking it again. We just can now be even more passive aggressive than just pointing at the right wiki page. Instead we will point at the FAQ now, which will point at the wiki!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thombles made the emoji completer behave more nicely. Instead of jumping to the bottom left corner before closing, it will now just close. It should also now behave correctly when selecting text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alfasi updated the install instructions for Gentoo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure we have ever seen that many new faces contributing to Nheko in a week, I'm pretty happy to see that!</p>

On Kai‚Äôs side, the long awaited <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/789">Room details</a> are finally here. Alejandro, on the other hand, landed code to <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/802">get display name and avatar of accounts at startup</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>Fixed a bug that prevented some new users from registering.  If you tried to sign up last week but the email validation failed, please give it another try with the latest build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cleaned up the &quot;Home&quot; tab for a simpler, cleaner look.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug where the summary of recent activity was failing to load on app startup.  Also added a manual &quot;refresh&quot; button as a fallback.</p>

<ul>
<li>Room version 8 was marked as the preferred version for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083 restricted rooms</a> on matrix.org and in Synapse 1.41, released this week. This means Element clients can now show UI to create restricted rooms within a Space, and prompt users to upgrade rooms if necessary when making them restricted.</li>
<li>Improvements to the performance of the room summary API.</li>
<li>Lots of testing of Spaces in anticipation of it leaving beta.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ruma">Ruma</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ruma.io/">Ruma</a> is a set of Rust library crates around Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org">jplatte</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been so long since our last update that I couldn't possibly list all of the individual changes, but here's a rough overview of the work since then (three months ago):</p>
<p>There's been loads of bug fixes, many compatibility improvements and at least one large refactoring. We've been much faster about releasing changes to crates.io after ruma 0.1.0, now we're already at ruma 0.4.0 (!);  the changes needed to upgrade are really not that significant though. Notable areas of improvement are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UIAA: No more stringly-typed auth type + map of properties. The <code>AuthData</code> enum that holds the authentication information clients send to servers now has one variant for every auth type defined in the spec.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event relations: These used to be serialized wrongly for encrypted events and were only (de)serializable as part of a larger event (making using them in custom ways impossible). Both of these issues were fixed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the GSoC coding period is over and our students have both written a blog post summarizing their work: <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/gsoc-coverage/">API Coverage project (Adam Blanchet)</a>, <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/gsoc-tools/">Tooling project (Devin Ragotzy)</a></p>
<p>If you want more detailed updates about Ruma, please watch <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">our repository</a>'s GitHub releases, since nobody in the project currently wants to write regular blog posts or TWIM updates (if you are interested in changing that, get in touch over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a>).</p>

<p>This week a new stable version of libQuotient, 0.6.8, has been <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.6.8">released</a>. While the main focus has been fixing bugs and sustaining the codebase, one significant highlight is that read receipts and fully read markers are distinguished now, which should improve interaction with other clients that has been treating them differently for quite some time now. This version is anticipated to become the base of the upcoming Quaternion 0.0.95.</p>

<p>This week, we tagged the v0.5.0 release candidate, which contains two major advancements on the encryption front: support for server-side key backups and support for cross-signing. The addition of these features makes Dendrite significantly more user-friendly, as it is now possible to log out or share keys across devices without losing your conversations.</p>
<p>We'll be aiming to finalise this release next week. Stay tuned in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for more details.</p>

<p>This strikes a balance between the broad compatibility of an older default room version, while still making newer features available <em>when requested</em> at room creation time. However, from next week you are more likely to encounter v8 rooms, so please do ensure your homeserver is running at least 1.40.</p>
<p>I'd also like to tip my hat to Element employee Olivier, who has put in the work to ensure that tagged Sygnal releases are automatically built and uploaded to Docker Hub via GitHub Actions. Thanks, Olivier!</p>

Version <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/3.0.0-rc1">3.0.0-rc1</a> is out and with it comes the migration from the matrix-js-sdk to the matrix-bot-sdk. This is a massive change underneath that should result in faster performance, better typings and hopefully lower memory footprints too.</p>
<p>I'd encourage everyone using this library to update and see how well it works for you! The IRC and Gitter bridges have already experimented with this change and have seen good results, so I look forward to hearing feedback :)</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now shows you the verification status of all devices in a room as well as in the memberlist. This is important so you can tell, if an unverified device may get access to a message, if you send it. You can always disable sending messages to unverified devices for extra peace of mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>callum's work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">Token Authenticated Registration</a> got merged! üéâ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manu's room directory (finally) got merged. This means you can now discover public rooms on your server and join them by clicking the room directory button, that Nheko had for 3 years but was disabled until now! Support for the room directories of other servers as well as filtering by network should come in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is now an &quot;Allow them in&quot; button on pending knocks in the timeline, joins via room membership in a different room now tell you, what user's server was used to sign off on the join and you can set a room to restricted or knock only. (You currently can't change the list of allowed servers though).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dialogs should now have a close button again on Windows, the emoji search field now clears on closing the emoji picker and we added a workaround for stickers not showing on Element iOS, because iOS can't display stickers without a thumbnail, even if a thumnail makes no sense for stickers. (We just copy the sticker url into the thumbnail url.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko can now download encryption keys from online key backup. Uploading to online key backup will come soon(tm).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are interested, I will talk about Nheko tomorrow (21.08. starting 16:10) at FrOSCon in the Matrix dev room. Make sure you check out the other talks too, if you speak German! https://programm.froscon.de/2021/events/2706.html</p>

<p>Updates from the teams</p>
<p><strong>Delight team</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This week, our web, iOS and Android engineers are all enjoying some time off. </li>
<li>On backend, we‚Äôve completed pagination of the Spaces Summary. This week, we‚Äôve been looking at performance improvements to the Summary API.</li>
<li>We intend to mark room Version 8 as the preferred version for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083 restricted rooms</a> on matrix.org and in Synapse 1.41 (due for release next week) via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244</a>. Once this change is made, Element clients will show UI to create restricted rooms within a Space, and prompt users to upgrade rooms if necessary when making them restricted.</li>
<li>Our design team is exploring some tweaks on how to make Spaces a little bit clearer and easier to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Web</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We released 1.8.1 which fixed some regressions with calls - sorry for any failed calls!</li>
<li>Work on our threads prototype continues. We‚Äôre hoping to have something to look at internally next week.</li>
<li><a href="https://sentry.matrix.org/sentry/riot-web/">Sentry</a> submission support has been added to Rageshakes. We expect to enable this on https://app.element.io next week.</li>
<li>We‚Äôve been fixing some bugs around cross-signing, Windows font rendering, and image blur hashing.</li>
<li>Our new triage process has been published <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/wiki#issue-triage">on the wiki</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Element Alpha work is complete. This is a new app for internal testing. A QR code is available on every PR like this <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/pull/4635">one</a> to install the build on a device. Only devices registered in the Element Apple Developer account can install this app. </li>
<li>Improved notification content: No more ‚ÄúMessage‚Äù notification.</li>
<li>Fixed some timeline layout issues.</li>
<li>Media upload sizing: We added a prompt when sending video to select the resolution of the sent video. Media size prompt can be disabled in settings.</li>
<li>URL preview work has started.</li>
<li>App Navigation improvement: Working on room navigation to prepare the ground for threading.</li>
<li>On the performance side, we are working on room messages lazy loading to improve application speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix authenticated jitsi not working in release (proguard issue)</li>
<li>Handle call ended reasons (busy, invite timeout).</li>
<li>Working on Olm fallback key support</li>
<li>Work on call ui and call tiles is finished, waiting to be reviewed</li>

<p>Polyjuice Client v0.4.2 has been released.  This release features more functions for creating messages, including file and media messages (thanks to multi prise), replies, reactions, and edits.  Polyjuice Client can also now be considered a serious Matrix library as it has a new function to generate rainbow-coloured messages! üåà  Multi prise has also added support for registering a new user, redacting messages, and searching the user directory.</p>
<p>Polyjuice Util v0.2.1 (an Elixir library for Matrix features that can be used on both the client-side and server-side) was also recently released.

<tr><td><code>bot.add_message_listener(example_handler)</code></td><td><code>@bot.listener.on_message_event</code><br />or<br /><code>@bot.listener.on_custom_event</code></td><td>In version 1, each the <code>bot.add_message_listener</code> method was used on message handler functions for them to react to messages. In version 2, this has been replaced by a decorator, <code>@bot.listener.on_message_event</code>. A similar decorator, <code>@bot.listener.on_custom_event(event)</code> can be used to react to other events. For information on supported events, refer to the <a href="https://matrix-nio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nio.html#module-nio.events.room_events">matrix-nio docs</a>.</td></tr>

In version 2 it is also possible to login using a SSO login token as well. As before, the homeserver argument is required, and the session_stored_file argument is optional.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>match.args #For message &quot;one two three&quot;, returns &quot;two three&quot;</code></td><td><code>match.args #For message &quot;one two three&quot;, returns [&quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;]</code></td><td>In version 1, <code>match.args</code> returned a string. In version 2, <code>match.args</code> returns a list of strings.</td></tr>

<blockquote>
<p>Since element now landed voice message support I build a small maubot plugin which prevents audio and voice messages as those cannot yet get restricted by power level.</p>
<p>It starts by warning you via replies, after a configured amount of warnings goes over to kicking and after a certain amount of kicks it will ban you in the room the event was sent in.</p>
<p>The counter is global so if a user in room A runs out of warnings and the same user sents a voice message in room B where the bot is present the bot will ban the user also in room B without further warnings.</p>

I present to you <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-poweredup">matrix-poweredup</a>! This is a little bot that connects to any LEGO PoweredUp devices (using the node-poweredup library). You can then start controlling the motors via Matrix, and have the sensors report back into the Matrix room. It's currently limited to a RC buggy I picked up over the weekend but it's very extendible. It also includes a web application to control things via a gamepad, if that's your bag.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/circles-ios">Circles</a> is an iOS app for end-to-end encrypted secure social networking and sharing, built on top of Matrix.  Its goal is to provide a safe and convenient way for close friends and families to share things that they wouldn't post publicly -- e.g. for parents to safely share pictures of their kids.  You can also use it to share updates with your friends, without a creepy advertising company data mining every word.</p>
<p>Circles features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social &quot;wall&quot;-like functionality and timeline of friends' posts for each of your social circles, e.g. Friends, Family, Neighbors, Coworkers, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypted photo galleries</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recent updates to the Circles beta include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for use with any Matrix homeserver, including a new encrypted recovery and key backup mechanism that should be compatible with other Matrix clients like Element.  (<strong>Please note</strong>: For use with standard Matrix accounts, be sure to select &quot;Advanced options&quot; at login and enter your passphrase for key backup / recovery.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emoji reactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown formatting for text posts and image captions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better support for larger screens (iPad)</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>Work on Spaces continues with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946</a> (Space Summary API), specifically revolving around how to paginate the summary. This has called into question how <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1898#issuecomment-896717689">pagination across Matrix works in general</a>, which is a prime target for refactoring - perhaps an upcoming consistent pagination MSC? :)</p>
<p>Otherwise, as listed above, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289</a> (room v8) has merged! It brings with it the ability to grant the ability to join a room based on one's membership in another room. While the was originally conceived for allowing users that are part of one Space to be allowed to join rooms, it has been built upon in other creative ways. Such as in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3325">MSC3325</a>, where it could be used to make room upgrades more seamless!</p>
<p>And finally, a special thanks to Lukas Lihotzki for all of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Alukaslihotzki+sort%3Aupdated-desc+">their spec PRs</a> this week. They're been stellar!</p>

<p>Big news! <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/08/10/synapse-1-40-0-released">Synapse 1.40 is out</a> and it comes with support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">Room Version 8</a>! Version 8 includes &quot;<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>&quot; which are only visible and joinable by members of a specific Space (or via direct invitation). This finally makes it <em>useful</em> to use Spaces as containers for private rooms, like you might with a company, guild, or open source community. Once invited to the parent Space, members can join and discover the otherwise private rooms within. No more <code>/invite</code> spam every time you bring someone on board!</p>
<p>Also: If you've received any push notifications in Element Android or Element iOS this week, they've come via our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/releases/tag/v0.10.0">shiny new stateless release of Sygnal</a>!

All of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10245">big</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10498">pieces</a> are now merged for full-fat federated historical messages in Synapse üí™</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> was also consolidated and updated to propose the <code>/batch_send</code> implementation we're using in Synapse. There is also a plan for how this can be backwards compatible with existing room versions so no need for those pesky room upgrades. This will help us be able to jump in early and use this for Gitter as soon as the new event types become stable.

<h3 id="ement-el">Ement.el</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alphapapa:matrix.org">alphapapa</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el">Ement.el</a>, a Matrix client for Emacs, continues to improve.  Some of the changes in the past week:</p>
<p><em>Additions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Messages may now be written in Org-mode syntax (a format similar to but more powerful than Markdown).  Internally, it's automatically converted to HTML and sent as the message's formatted body.  This supports nearly any HTML feature that Org-mode can export to, including rich text, bulleted and numbered lists, and even tables (this message is being written directly in Org syntax; see a table of new bindings at the end of this list).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An optional pop-out compose buffer makes writing and editing long messages easier (also being used for this message).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read/fully-read marker lines are now displayed after the last read message, and these are synced with the server and other clients.  These lines can also be placed with a command, making it easy to return to a certain event later, even on other clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usernames at the beginning of messages may optionally be colored to match the addressee's username.  This especially helps following conversations in busy rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ement.el is confirmed to work with Pantalaimon, the E2EE-aware reverse proxy, making encrypted rooms work transparently.  Once Pantalaimon is installed and configured, connecting through it with Ement.el is trivial, and this step is documented in the readme.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Improvements</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Per-user displayname and message colors have improved (and configurable) contrast ratio with the background color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reactions are sorted by the number of users who have sent each one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unread rooms are displayed more prominently in the room list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New default bindings make it quick to jump to the mentions and notifications buffers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync timeouts are handled more gracefully and Ement.el re-syncs automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various minor fixes and enhancements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And here's the new-bindings table, written directly in Org syntax and sent automatically as HTML:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Binding</th><th>Command</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>S-SPC</td><td>Scroll up</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-SPC</td><td>Move to last-read marker</td></tr>
<tr><td>C-k</td><td>Delete message</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-g M-l</td><td>Switch to room list buffer</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-g M-m</td><td>Switch to mentions buffer</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-g M-n</td><td>Switch to notifications buffer</td></tr>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You now get notified, if someone reuses a megolm session index, because that in theory could be used by an attacker to send seemingly verified messages. We also now render decryption errors more nicely and users can now explicitly request decryption keys (in addition to the automatic key requests in the background that already existed). We also fixed an issue, that could corrupt the database when using the flatpak and if you lost your network connection, Nheko should now reconnect faster instead of potentially waiting 17 minutes for a TCP timeout. The storage for cross-signing secrets should now be more reliable, you can close image popups with the &quot;Escape&quot; key, close the current room by double clicking it and a few more miscellaneous bugfixes.</p>
<p>You can track the remaining E2EE bits, before we declare our E2EE support as stable, in this comment now: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/23#issuecomment-894689158</p>

<p>I find &quot;read it later&quot; services like Pocket extremely useful, but fail hard at actually keeping my read it later list at a sane level. For me it's hard to maintain the list and actually read through things as choosing which one to process feels overwhelming due to the amount of items.</p>
<p>Randomization to the rescue! I made a Pocket plugin for Maubot which gives me a random article from my list and allows me to easily archive it. Now I don't need to decide which article to pick, the computer does that for me!</p>

<p>It's demo week again this week! We've got three great demos to share with you this month:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robert, the latest addition to the Matrix VoIP team, gives us a sneak peek at his experiments with implementing native full mesh video calls in Matrix</li>
<li>Gil, from the Element iOS team, gives us an update on the implementation of Spaces in the app</li>
<li>and finally Ryan, who's been exploring ways to use Matrix beyond chat, shows us his shiny new full stack integration test solution for Matrix client and servers</li>
</ul>
<p>And I hear there might also have been a bonus demo that managed to sneak its way lower down this post üòâ</p>

<p>Today in not-Synapse news, we're getting ready for a new release of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a>, our reference implementation of a Matrix push notification gateway, early next week. The most significant change is that Shay, one of our Outreachy interns, has determined that Sygnal can function completely statelessly, removing the need for a SQLite or PostgreSQL database. This clears the path for proper horizontal scaling and high availability deployments of Sygnal.</p>
<p>On the Synapse side of the world, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289: Room version 8</a> entered Final Comment Period (FCP) and we expect it to be merged into the Matrix spec over the weekend.

<p>State res has been tested a lot, so it's okay to join any public rooms (room version 6 preferred).</p>
<p>The barebones DEPLOY.md is the easiest and most tested way to install Conduit. We also have docker images, but I think the documentation still needs to be improved (please contribute if you can!)</p>

<p>Heya, we are very grateful for all the awesome translators helping us translate FluffyChat! Unfortunately, we aren't the best at managing such a huge effort as translating such a large app into so many different languages. As a result, suggestions went un-reviewed on weblate for long, people weren't able to submit translations, etc. We are very sorry for that, but want to work on fixing that! As, well, we are only really programmers with little time, we thought of asking for help from the community (you all!)! That is why we are looking for a translation manager for FluffyChat. No programming experience at all is required, it'd mostly be about managing our weblate and answering translation-related questions. If you are interested, please plop into our room <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fluffychat:matrix.org">#fluffychat:matrix.org</a> and say so! (And ping <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a> if you don't get answers). Looking forward to a where translations are managed better, and thank you again for everyone who did bite through all this and contributed translations so far!</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I added a sticker/emoji pack editor to Nheko. This means you now don't need to create packs manually in /devtools anymore, but you can create and edit packs much more conveniently. There are still some rough edges, but we expect to sort those out in the near future. Make sure you check out the demo video I recorded!</p>
<p>Furthermore LorenDB has been busy porting more of the remaining dialogs to Qml, dialogs should now float properly on Wayland and have a proper close button on KDE. We also fixed a few more encryption bugs, which means we should be able to mark E2EE as stable in Nheko soon and we cleaned up old cruft in the codebase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if that's not enough for you, since it's demo week, Nico's also showing off Nheko's brand new sticker goodness!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo K.</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A collaborative whiteboard based on the [matrix] protocol. <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard">github</a></p>
<p>A lot has happened this week. The biggest task was the switch to a proper build system (the project now is based on yarn and webpack). This gave the opportunity to do lots of refactoring and code cleanup. Additionally there is now a spec for the whiteboard events which got implemented this week. For the ones who are curious, here is the file: <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard/blob/main/spec.md">spec</a></p>
<p>There are also a couple of new features and fixes. Most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Text tool</strong> was added. Text in different colors and sizes can be added to the whiteboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Image tool</strong> was added. Images are uploaded and than rendered on the canvas (not yet published but will be available in a couple of days)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The styling was improved. There are less gray areas which I did not like and the corners are less round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the repository got a lot of love with more details in the <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard/blob/main/readme.md">readme</a> and better code/folder structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is now also a matrix room for feedback, issues and ideas: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TheBoard:matrix.org">#TheBoard:matrix.org</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to try it at: https://toger5.github.io/TheBoard/ (preferable not with your main matrix account)</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cvwright:matrix.org">cvwright</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/circles-ios">Circles</a> is an iOS app for end-to-end encrypted secure social networking and sharing, built on top of Matrix.  Its goal is to provide a safe and convenient way for close friends and families to share things that they wouldn't post publicly -- e.g. for parents to safely share pictures of their kids.</p>
<p>Recent updates to the Circles beta include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for use with any Matrix homeserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emoji reactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown formatting for posts and photo captions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better support for larger screens (iPad)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The latest beta build of Circles (v0.90) is available from Apple on <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/cWuDwqpG">TestFlight</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've also added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE 1</strong> - If you're using an existing account, you'll need to tap the &quot;Advanced Options&quot; on the login screen so you can give it your password for SSSS / encrypted key backup / recovery / etc.  Otherwise Circles will try to use a login password that it generates with <a href="https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/matrix-doc/blob/single-password-SSSS/proposals/3265-login-and-ssss-with-single-password.md">MSC 3265</a> so it can do everything safely using just a single password.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 2</strong> - Circles is NOT RECOMMENDED for use on an account that you're already using for Matrix chat, for the above reason and more.  If you do this, prepare to see lots of extra, weird rooms in Element / Fluffy / Nheko / whatever chat client you're using.  Also if you decide to try this anyway, please let me know how it goes.  :-)</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 3</strong> - Circles is not available yet in France.  Sorry.  I gotta update my encryption compliance documentation with Apple.</p>

<p>Of all the pull requests we landed, my hat is off to MadLittleMods and his Graphviz prowess in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10250">#10250</a>, which moves us one step further down the path toward <em><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a>: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms.</em> Mmm. Graphs.</p>
<p>But back to Synapse! You should check out the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/29/synapse-1-39-0-released">release announcement</a>, but the bulk of the work this cycle went into internal cleanups. Synapse should also be slightly more performant, reliable, and should log fewer spurious errors. Of note, ShadowJonathan did a lot of work with <code>pyupgrade</code> and <code>com2ann</code> to move the entire codebase to more modern Py3.6+ conventions and inline type annotations; thanks, ShadowJonathan!</p>
<p>Synapse 1.39 also continues our march toward unifying Synapse's interface for extension modules, and we've now exposed plugin hooks for the <code>account_validity</code> option, and experimentally implemented hooks for third party event rules.</p>
<p>Lastly, special thanks to kroeckx who has submitted 17 pull requests against our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">SyTest test suite</a> in the past month, mainly arising from running SyTest against <a href="https://conduit.rs/">Conduit</a>. Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello! This week, I created a <a href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/matrix-synapse-backend">matrix 1-click app</a> on the DigitalOcean marketplace. It's basically a pre-baked droplet image that is pre-configured with synapse, element-web, caddy, postgres, plus some setup and moderation tools. My intent was to make self-hosting a Matrix system as easy as pointing some DNS records and running a single script. It makes a lot of sense for smaller, more casual Matrix homeservers, and can serve as a good starting point! It also includes some small utility scripts - <code>./reset-password</code>, <code>./new-user</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Secrets like the postgres password and registration password are generated on first boot, there's no sensitive data baked into the image. Of course, it would be nice to be able to verify this - the source code used to build the image is being open sourced. I'm just waiting for some internal processes to finish. It will show up at https://github.com/digitalocean/marketplace-matrix somewhat soon!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Lazy joining of IRC users (see below)</p>

</ul>
<p>The biggest impact feature this time around is configurable lazy joining IRC users which improves the experience of joining massive IRC channels by not flooding the homeserver with join events. This is now the default and can be changed globally by the bridge admin or overridden per room by users.</p>
<p>Many fixes here and there. Still a few issues left before 1.0 and a lot of testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ajbura:matrix.org">ajbura</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cinny is a web-based matrix client focusing primarily on simple, elegant and secure interface.</p>
<p>The story started when a friend of mine introduced me to matrix and even after his help it was too difficult for me to get around with Element. I guess it was because Element is too different from other popular chat apps. Then I tried to find a good alternative for web but no success.</p>
<p>That's when me and my friend thought about creating Cinny. For the few weeks we were doing it for fun but when we shared a screenshot of the prototype, the response from people was surprising and that's when things got interesting. We got to know that a lot of people out there are looking for a simple and modern client and so we started building it.</p>

<p>This summer's gone by so fast it feels like it's only been a week! Here's a summary of what's happened with Ruma the past few weeks:</p>
<p>We have had a productive summer with our two Google Summer of Code students, Adam Blanchet and Devin Ragotzy. Adam finished implementing the last of our Identity Service API endpoints, bringing us to 100% implementation of all the Matrix API endpoints! (And we promise there are no bugs because &quot;Rust,&quot; right?)</p>
<p>Besides improving the Matrix ecosystem, Devin has been helping the Rust ecosystem at large by writing some Clippy lints to improve our codebase and upstreaming his additions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I made <a href="https://github.com/davidmehren/maubot-ldap-inviter">maubot-ldap-inviter</a>, a maubot plugin that (surprisingly) invites users into Matrix rooms, according to their membership in LDAP groups.</p>
<p>We are switching from RocketChat to Matrix in the next round of a software engineering course where students work on software projects in small groups.</p>
<p>RocketChat has a LDAP sync, which we previously used to auto-add students and tutors to the chatrooms they need to be in (global announcement room, helpdesk, chat for their group etc.).
As there was no such feature for Matrix, I built the bot over the last few days.</p>
<p>It's still somewhat specific to our LDAP setup, but if anyone wants to use the bot and has questions, just open an issue in the repo!</p>

<h3 id="theboard">TheBoard</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a personal project I started a couple of weeks ago. I was dreaming of a good open source solution for OneNote or GoodNotes far a long time. There are already great projects, like<a href="https://xournalpp.github.io/">Xournal++</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lovasoa/whitebophir">Whitebophir</a>. But, they do not include the extent of possibilities to flexible host, collaborate and structuring the notes I have wished for.</p>
<p>Recently, I was thinking about the exact requirements I wanted for such a whiteboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Real time synchronization (cloud storage)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authentication/account infrastructure (to invite and collaborate on one whiteboard)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding/Removing ppl to a whiteboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliable hosting (when having cloud storage, I don't want to trust a one-man project to continue hosting. And a lot of ppl won‚Äôt self-host.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structuring whiteboards in categories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Viewing history and display which part has been drawn by which person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annotating other whiteboards with new layers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hosting for media like PDF's and images</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at this list, Matrix was such an obvious choice. I could comment every point but basically with: &quot;A whiteboard should be a Matrix room&quot; everything is said.</p>
<p><strong>TheBoard (probably not the final name) is exactly that.</strong> The frontend is not done yet, but already in an okay looking and usable state.</p>
<p><strong>Before trying it out:</strong> It takes really long to log in with an account with lots of rooms. So, I highly recommend to NOT use your main Matrix account.
Additionally, it is necessary to tag rooms as whiteboards. (really un-intuitive UX that will be improved) But for now the + button needs to be pressed and a (empty (not necessary but recommended) AND UNENCRYPTED) room needs to be selected.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I just (on Friday) finished initial spaces support to categorize the whiteboard in notebooks (aka spaces). They can only be create within a matrix client that supports spaces. But they will be displayed properly in TheBoard. (see screenshot)</p>
<p>Any problems, ideas and feedback is highly welcome as a github issue or in the matrix channel #TheBoard:matrix.org.</p>
<h4 id="tldr">TLDR:</h4>
<p>This project is whiteboard (similar to OneNote) which is</p>
<p>using Matrix as its backend. All your drawings are stored in matrix rooms
on your matrix server and are accessible to anyone who is invited.</p>

<p>üö® Yesterday we published Synapse 1.38.1 which <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10456">mitigates a client bug</a> triggered by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9919">changes to /sync responses</a> in 1.38.0. Specifically, new Element Android sessions were unable to decrypt messages in end-to-end encrypted conversations.</p>
<p>‚öôÔ∏è Otherwise, we've been doing quite a lot of internal / infrastructure work. Notably, we've completed the move from three separate CI systems to just one: GitHub Actions. We're also, for the first time, publishing Debian packages for our Release Candidates. We hope these changes move us towards a more reliable and seamless release process.</p>

<p>A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<hr />
<p>This week brings plenty of usability improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is now the <code>list-contacts</code> bot command to--you guessed it!--list the Matrix puppets of all of your contacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's now possible to sync a chat with a LINE user by inviting their Matrix puppet to a DM, instead of having to wait for someone to send you a message in LINE for the bridge to auto-sync it. This is especially useful with <code>list-contacts</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LINE group chats that haven't been used recently are now included in the set of chats that get bridged on a <code>sync</code> operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of chats to sync at startup time &amp; on-demand is now configurable, as a bridge config setting &amp; a parameter to the <code>sync</code> command, respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes make it possible to sync LINE chats/groups that previously may not have gotten synced, due to the intricacies of how LINE on Chrome handles chat history (especially on first use of the bridge).</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LorenDB has rewritten the invite dialog as well as the memberlist in Qml. This means they work now much more reliably and show the users in appropriate colors and a few other small improvements.</p>
<p>Apart from that, Nheko now has support for sending stickers! This is based on Sorunome's awesome <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2545">MSC2545</a>, so no integration manager is needed and it is trivially easy to share your sticker packs (just invite someone into the same room!). You can use stickers from your account data or upload stickers into a room so every room member can use it. If you found a sticker pack you like, you can enable a pack from a room globally by going into Nheko's room settings. You can check my current preferred set of stickers here: matrix:r/nico's-stickers:neko.dev</p>
<p>Currently you can't edit a sticker pack yet from Nheko. Support for that will come in the near future. Until then you can use either FluffyChat, Element's DevTools or <a href="https://github.com/deepbluev7/stickerpicker">my hack to import Telegram sticker packs into a room</a>. Note that Nheko's sticker pack support is incompatible with integration server based sticker packs like the one Element uses. On the other hand, you don't need an integration manager to use them! Custom emote support based in the image packs MSC is coming in the future to Nheko too.</p>
<p>Furthermore we fixed some bugs to move E2EE in Nheko out of Beta. We are close now and we have a plan!</p>
<p>That's all, don't get your hands too sticky!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs been <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/02/this-week-in-matrix-2021-07-02">three weeks already since our last update</a> and we have a fair amount of new things to report.</p>
<p>As I write this, our interns Alejandro and Kai are at GUADEC, the annual GNOME conference, presenting during the interns lightning talk. The former has submitted a couple of merge requests (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/793">!793</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/794">!794</a>) that were necessary for the UI to accommodate his upcoming multi-account work. The latter has provided <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/788">a view for when no room is selected</a>. As for their mentor, Julian, he changed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/795">member loading so it only happens once a room is opened</a>, to improve performances. He also changed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/796">Matrix event handling to use <code>SyncRoomEvent</code></a>, which paves the way for display of various message types in the timeline of a room.</p>
<p>Giuseppe offered two nice additions to the login view:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in the form, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/783">one can now type enter to login</a> (it previously required to click on the button in the headerbar)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/791">errors are now displayed</a>, providing useful feedback on why the login may have failed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And to conclude this summary, we welcome üéâ newcomer Veli Tasalƒ± who fixed <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/issues/802">a papercut I reported</a>: <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/787">when typing long messages, buttons next to the message entry were expanding along with the entry and now they keep nicely aligned</a>.</p>

<h4 id="bridges">Bridges</h4>
<h4 id="linkedin">LinkedIn</h4>
<p>We've integrated the LinkedIn bridge into Beeper. The bridge is in beta and is generally ready for use. Since the last update, we moved it to <a href="https://gitlab.com/beeper/linkedin">GitLab</a>, added a Docker image, and implemented reaction and redaction handling in both directions! We also fixed a bunch of bugs across the board to improve reliability.</p>
<h4 id="android-sms">Android SMS</h4>
<p>The Android SMS bridge mentioned in the last update is progressing. It should be ready for self-hosted use in a few weeks, so our next update will probably include that.</p>
<p>Related to the SMS bridge, I've made <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-syncproxy">mautrix-syncproxy</a>, which is a microservice to do the <code>/sync</code>ing required for end-to-bridge encryption (to-device events and such) in the cloud and forwarding the data to the normal appservice transaction endpoint. When combined with <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-wsproxy">mautrix-wsproxy</a>, it allows the SMS bridge to only have a websocket connection, which uses significantly less battery than a HTTP request every 30 seconds. The sync proxy partially implements <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3202">MSC3202</a> and the to-device part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> (partially because it only does individual users rather than all appservice-owned users).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several GNOME contributors and I have been following TWIM and really enjoyed the concept. Since open source is about <del>stealing</del> sharing ideas, we wanted to deploy something similar for GNOME.</p>
<p>I gave this room's beloved <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/twim-o-matic">twim-o-matic</a> a try and fiddled a bit with the code. But I soon found that it is too specialised for matrix.org. That's when I decided to write a project agnostic TWIx bot based on matrix-rust-sdk called <a href="https://github.com/haecker-felix/hebbot">Hebbot</a>!</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://thisweek.gnome.org/posts/2021/07/twig-1/">how it looks in practice with a companion website for GNOME</a>. If you‚Äôre interested in how it looks behind the scenes, <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/haeckerfelix/2021/07/16/introducing-this-week-in-gnome/">have a look at this blog post which explains how it works</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week I have developed a new plugin for <a href="https://octoprint.org/">OctoPrint</a> which is a tool for controlling and monitoring 3D printers, which sends notifications about your prints and status of your 3D printer to matrix. The existing OctoSlack plugin also has Matrix support but fell foul of the /sync response changes in Synapse 1.38, and also sent the images from the camera to Matrix as inline images rather than m.image events, so they didn't render on some clients.</p>
<p>My new plugin can send messages on most events supported by OctoPrint, but the core events which are configurable through the OctoPrint web UI are print started, paused, completed and failed as well as print progress notifications. If you want Matrix notifications for your 3D prints, you can install the plugin through the official <a href="https://octoprint.org/">OctoPrint plugin repository</a> or by installing from the <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/octoprint-matrix-notifier-plugin">GitHub repository</a>. If you have any feature requests or pull requests, contributions to the plugin are very welcome.</p>

Otherwise <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3245">MSC3245</a> (voice messages via extensible events) is moving along with final comment period proposed this week. The implementation in Element Web in reportedly working well, helping to prove the spec in practice. And finally, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3277">MSC3277</a> (scheduled messages) which appeared over the weekend to try and allow for scheduling events to send later in Matrix (and all the fun edge cases that come with it).</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, we <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.0">released Dendrite 0.4.0 on Monday</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/12/dendrite-0-4-0-released">wrote a blog post about it</a>! It's taken us a little while to get to this release, but it includes a number of quality-of-life improvements and changes that will significantly reduce the amount of resources needed to run a Dendrite server. The full changelog is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.4.0">available on GitHub</a> and many juicy details in the aforementioned blog post, but at a high level this release includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All-new state storage, designed to reduce the amount of disk space that the roomserver takes up to store room state by aggressively deduplicating state blocks and snapshots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved appservice support, with a number of bridges now working with Dendrite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared secret registration (using the same API shape as Synapse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimisations in the federation API <code>/send</code> and <code>/get_missing_events</code> endpoints to reduce memory usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved state resolution v2 performance when dealing with power level events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per-room queuing to reduce head-of-line blocking on the roomserver input API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of bug fixes around invites, registration, sync and media, and 5 panics fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the release, we've been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Completing key notary support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing <code>state_default</code> for power levels in gomatrixserverlib</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolving some issues around rejecting invites, particularly when the remote server is not available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the cost of checking if the local server is in a given room</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since our last update, our Sytest compliance numbers have been on the rise again, taking us ever closer to our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 61%, up from 60% last time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 92%, up from 80% last time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appservice APIs: 52%</p>

<p>The big news of the week is the release of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/13/synapse-1-38-0-released">Synapse 1.38</a>, which converts several integer columns to <code>bigint</code>, allowing Synapse to process more than 2 billion (231) events. Which, incidentally, matrix.org did last week üìà:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But that's not the only thing new in Synapse 1.38. We also landed the ability to set an expiry time on cache entries, allowing you to reclaim memory from infrequently accessed caches. Configuring this to &quot;1h&quot; on matrix.org has already yielded a noticeable reduction in overall memory use üìâ:</p>

This will allow messaging LINE contacts that the bridge didn't yet create a portal for.</p>
<p>And please, <em>feel free to try out this bridge!</em> It should be serviceable for day-to-day usage now. I still won't be able to host a public instance of it for a while, though (as it is fairly hefty due to having to run Chrome), so you'll have to self-host if you want to try it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we fixed bugs. Switching room should now be quite a bit faster again and once Qt 6.3 is released with some important bugfixes, scrolling in Nheko should be super smooth. (We can't enable that flag yet, because of 3 bugs in the item pooling code in Qt.)</p>
<p>Other bugfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inline images sometimes wouldn't show, but now inline emotes and images should render once they are loaded! (This took me a year to figure out)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now send edits in encryted rooms again, if they are a reply to an event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No more reply fallback in the room list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At some point timed out verification requests started showing up on startup. That regression is fixed now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix rooms not showing up after login because we were off by one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix some cases where the loading spinner wouldn't stop animating and as such consistently use CPU, when a room is open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cache db transactions to reduce allocations and memory zeroing when loading a room or scrolling.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nik:matrix.teckids.org">Nik</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the first weeks of July, <a href="https://teckids.org">Teckids e.V.</a> held their annual summer camp for kids between 9 and 15 years. This year, after we started introducing Matrix and Element as a chat platform from September 2020 onwards, the camp was heavily relying on the platform for various parts.</p>
<p>Before the camp started, we invited all 90 participants to a chat room to get together, share a bit about what they expect, already did with coding and technical stuff, talk about what food they'd like to have for the barbecue, and stuff like that. Many of them engaged in the discussion, and started exploring Element (before you ask, yes, we hat a lot of snow and party poppers üòõ!). Some got really excited that they could even change or add features to Element, or ask for such changes ‚Äì we had to promise to hold a session where we find out how to add one new animation to Element. Unfortunately, Element is developed on GitHub, so the potential young contributors are locked out by the exclusive Terms of Use there. We are trying to reach out to Element HQ to find a solution.</p>
<p>During the camp, verifying crypto sessions using emojis again made for a good party game to get to know each other (like, find the kid a nickname belongs to on the camp site, start verification, and compare emojis ‚Äì a lot of fun that we, again, did not even have to start, because someone always finds out about it and asks what it is about).</p>
<p>Now that everyone got to know Matrix for chatting, in one of our workshops, the participants discovered that not only people, but also devices can send messages, and react to replies ‚Äì in that workshop, the kids built a chat-ops IoT door beel (for their tent on site, or room at home). They soldered a circuit board to fit an ESP (MicroPython) micro controller on, and coded a small program (using templates with differing complexity levels), defining what the door bell should send when a button is pressed, on what messages to react, and the like. We produced a fun video about the project (German audio, English subtitles): https://eduvid.org/videos/watch/20a50c25-ecb4-48c0-9b13-de2548f290d4?subtitle=en . The (minimal and somewhat buggy) MicroPython client library is published as <a href="https://edugit.org/hacknfun/thema-mechatronik/mytrix">¬µtrix</a>.</p>
<p>Now, sadly, the event is over, and we slowly see (as expected, only a part of the) participants moving over to our long-term project chatrooms; we will start clearing the virtual camp site chatroom during the weekend to make room for a new group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asked about the regularity of these events, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nik:matrix.teckids.org">Nik</a> replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are still experimenting with our new camp formats. As bad as it all is, COVID caused a lot of innovation here because we were forced to leave the known roads we normally travelled, and now we are starting to integrate all that new stuff (like really embracing Matrix) into outdoor and presence events. I think we are on a really good way with it, and surely I will keep posting updates that might be of interest for the greater community.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big(int) news! This week Matrix.org processed its 2^31st event, exceeding the range of a PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-numeric.html">integer column</a> for the first time. This caused a bit of a scramble in the aftermath of last week's spam attack, as we had a few <code>integer</code> columns in our schema which we needed to convert to <code>bigint</code>. Fortunately, we were able to complete the change sufficiently in advance (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8255">#8255</a>), and also took the opportunity to audit other columns and sequences in the database which could conceivably overflow. Synapse 1.38, due out next week, will automatically migrate homeservers when they upgrade. We run the migration as a background task, so homeservers should continue functioning as normal throughout, though they may use a bit more disk and memory, especially when rebuilding indexes for the new <code>bigint</code> column.</p>
<p>We're also starting to hone in on our team's goals for this quarter, and it's looking like our primary focus will be on improving room join speeds. Wish us luck!</p>
<p>Lastly, we're overjoyed to announce that <a href="https://github.com/reivilibre">@reivilibre</a>, a former intern on the backend team, joined Element this week! We can't wait to see where he helps us take Synapse!</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spaces work is making progress. Some rooms can now be previewed. To improve that situation, I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3266">MSC to preview specific rooms</a>. Alternatively we will try to get the previews for the few rooms you aren't joined to from the space summary API, currently we are just fetching the existing state. You can also now join previewed rooms and the design of joining invites was adapted to match it.</p>
<p>red_sky‚òÑÔ∏è went through the pain of fixing the Windows builds after we changed our http backend last week. So if you want to try it out, you can test it on Windows. We also replaced the old, boring spinner with an animated Nheko logo. If you see that a lot and think it is Nheko's fault, don't hesitate to open an issue! But in most cases it will probably be your server. Sadly no screenshot of how the spinner looks like, my server is too fast and taking a proper screenshot is too much effort because of that. ;p</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue with updating device lists in the develop version of Nheko. If you were using the nightlies, now is a good time to update! In more E2EE news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3270">symmetric megolm backup</a> fixes the issues I had with the online key backup, so looking forward to implementing that.</p>

<p>The latest release of opsdroid is out with various fixes which can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/releases/tag/v0.23.0">the changelog</a>. The main point to note for matrix users is that older versions of matrix-nio (the matrix client library used by opsdroid) did not support the synapse change to omit <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10214">optional fields from sync</a>. Therefore if you are using our docker images you will need to update to 0.23 to get a container with the newest matrix-nio included.</p>
<p>The other change which is relevant to matrix users is that Oleg has added support for version 2 of the <a href="https://rasa.com/">Rasa NLU</a> framework, so you can once again do open source, self hosted natural language bots.</p>

<p>Hi everyone! Did you ever feel lost in the Matrix world? The room directory is big, but it's still hard to find something you like. Or are you a room moderator, but there is not much activity in your room because it doesn't have enough users?</p>
<p>This is why I want to share rooms (or spaces) I find interesting.</p>

<h3 id="beeper-update">Beeper update</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">Tulir</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been a month since our last update. A lot of the work since then has been on making everything more reliable, but we've also added new features to our clients and started making some new bridges.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added thread UI for Slack-bridged rooms. Internally they're just replies like before, but the client will intelligently collapse replies in Slack rooms into threads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merged upstream Element additions like voice messages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also merged some features that aren't in Element yet, like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/5814">Giphy integration</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Released Beeper iOS to Testflight.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added grouping rooms by chat network based on the <code>m.bridge</code> state event. The UI is similar to spaces, but they're not actual Matrix spaces (yet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for Android 11's &quot;conversation&quot; notifications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bridges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Android Messages is turning out difficult to reverse-engineer to a sufficiently reliable level, so we're building a new SMS bridge into our Android app. It'll also be available as a standalone open-source app, which already exists at https://gitlab.com/beeper/android-sms (but doesn't have any setup instructions yet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've funded development of a LinkedIn bridge. sumner will post a more detailed update about that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We're hiring React, iOS, Android and SRE/Devops engineers. If you're interested, check out https://angel.co/company/beeperhq or DM <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@eric:beeper.com">Eric Migicovsky</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm excited to announce that I started working on a new bridge for bringing LinkedIn messages to Matrix! It's currently in the early stages of development and not production-ready. The current feature set includes: backfill from LinkedIn, user name and profile picture sync, message sending from Matrix -&gt; LinkedIn, and real-time message puppetting from LinkedIn -&gt; Matrix. There's much more to come, and you can join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#linkedin-matrix:nevarro.space">#linkedin-matrix:nevarro.space</a>  for updates. Development is being funded by Beeper, and is being designed with integration into Beeper as it's primary goal. However, the bridge is open source (Apache 2.0) and will be available to self-host. The source code is here: https://github.com/sumnerevans/linkedin-matrix.</p>

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line/">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Better LINE-&gt;Matrix read receipt bridging is now supported in the <code>testing</code> branch! The bridge now checks all LINE chats (not just the most recently-used one) to see if messages you sent have been read (in LINE). This works by cycling through all LINE chats where the final message is posted by you and doesn't have a &quot;Read&quot; marker on it yet (or for multi-user chats, if your last message hasn't been read by everyone in the room).</p>
<p>With that, I'll consider the bridge to be in Early Beta! üéâ I'm now testing the bridge for myself to iron out a few kinks, and am preparing a PR to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/">matrix.org</a> webpage to have this listed on https://matrix.org/bridges/.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello World! I am here to bring you Nheko news!</p>
<p>We merged the Spaces branch, which means Nheko master can now show some spaces. Peeking unjoined rooms, nesting spaces and creating them should be coming soon. We are also looking into how to fit knocking into the UI (we already rendered incoming knocks in the timeline for a while).</p>
<p>You can also now edit still pending messages, which should help if your server is slow and you notice a typo. The edit will then get queued and be sent as soon as the server acknowledges they received the original message. Apart from that there have been some improvements to the readability of the room list and some other UI elements.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we switched out our entire http backend from Boost to Curl. For that I wrote a <a href="https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/coeurl">simple wrapper around Curl</a>. This fixes about 10 issues around connection shutdown, brings proxy support, http/2 and http/3 support and in general makes Nheko crash less and reduces latency a LOT! This will obviously cause some pain for packagers, but I hope it isn't too bad. Some of the issues this fixes only had 2 digits in our bugtracker and one was even filed by benpa!</p>
<p>Have a nice weekend everyone! ‚ô•</p>

The first one was about creating a library with shared chat visual components for KDE's chat apps: NeoChat for Matrix, Tok for Telegram and Kaidan for XMPP, KDE Connect and Spacebar for SMS, ... The second BoF was more about NeoChat and Quotient and we discussed how to move forwards with some problems (e.g. non-hacky text input auto-completion) but also the roadmap around E2EE, Spaces and Widgets support. Speaking about E2EE, we will have some very good news to announce next week, stay tuned!</p>

<p>Newcomer Giuseppe De Palma removed bashisms from our git hook because they were preventing him from contributing. They then went on to <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/775">tweak the history style to remove the grey background around it</a>. They also got rid of a papercut from the login form: before his intervention, users needed to provide the full homeserver URL with the <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> scheme prefix. It will now <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/780">default to HTTPS</a>.</p>
<p>We also did some housekeeping work that should improve the experience for people joining us on the Fractal Next fun.

The usual stabilisaton/bug fixing work, no new features compared to betas. This version is considerably better, and more stable, than 0.0.9.4 - packagers are welcome to push it as if it were the final release.

Following that, they come up with their own decentralized protocol, including a security and performance analysis. They improve asymptotic complexity when compared to Olm/Megolm, and the assumptions on the underlying communication layer are easily fulfilled by Matrix. They also discuss that the very good asympotic complexity of MLS cannot be reached for a decentralized end-to-end cryptography protocol.</p>

<p>Last week's news actually, but libQuotient master branch can built with Qt 6 now, laying ground for the GSoC works on PyQuotient - Python bindings for libQuotient. The library has also been updated to follow the latest CS API specification, which means basic low-level support for knocking, with higher-level library API for it coming later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello dear Synapse Admins, <code>synadm</code> v0.30 is out. lt seems I was in &quot;story telling mode&quot; already when I wrote the release notes yesterday. That should perfectly suit a TWIM article as well üôÇ So there you go, copy/pasted from https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/releases/tag/v0.30 with love:</p>
<h4 id="new">New</h4>
<p><code>synadm</code> finally got some nicely rendered documentation pages hosted at https://synadm.readthedocs.io.</p>
<p>&quot;Login as a user&quot; admin API support:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm user login &lt;user id&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.user.html#synadm-user-login">Have a look at the new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>New subcommand <code>matrix</code>supporting execution of regular Matrix commands. As a first shot a command to issue any Matrix API call has been implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix raw endpoint/url -m post -f data.json</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix raw endpoint/url -m put -d '{&quot;key1&quot;: &quot;value1&quot;}' --prompt</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.matrix.html#synadm-matrix-raw">The new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that this is meant to be a convenience function in case a Synapse homeserver admin wants to quickly help users e.g set specific settings available via regular Matrix calls and not the Synapse admin API directly. Also note that it is not meant to replace the awesome Matrix CLI tools that are already out there. matrix-commander, matrixcli to mention just a few.</em></p>
<p>The second command below <code>matrix</code> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix login &lt;user id&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.matrix.html#synadm-matrix-login">The new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It implements a plain login on a Matrix server using username and password. It can even be used to retrieve a token for an admin user, e.g helpful for setting up fresh <code>synadm</code> installations. <a href="https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#getting-an-admin-token">Read about it here</a></p>
<h4 id="improved">Improved</h4>
<p>The README has been updated to point to the nicely rendered docs recently published at https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html</p>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>Update via PyPI or git as described in the update chapter: https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#update</p>
<p>Thanks to the friendly people in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at">#synadm:peek-a-boo.at</a> for reviewing, testing, discussing functionality and giving advice. And for this release, a special thanks to @hpd:hpdeifel.de https://github.com/hpdeifel</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@thib:ergaster.org">Thib</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>with the change of policy we deployed on GNOME's Matrix instance, it occurred to me that we had overlooked an important aspect in our relationship with Matrix: do we own our Matrix account? And the answer is... maybe! In this post I cover the differences between personal account, organisation-owned account, the importance of segregating activities on Matrix... and why this <em>may</em> change with Portable Identities in the future</p>

<p>I know this isn't TWIM-worthy, but I figured people in this room would find it interesting: yesterday there was a very popular post on reddit about how we don't appreciate email enough, and in the comments there were some mentions of matrix as the counterpart for messaging:</p>
