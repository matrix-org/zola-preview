<blockquote>
<p>I made a few spec proposals: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2244">MSC2244: Mass redactions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2246">MSC2246: Asynchronous media uploads</a>. Mass redactions are useful for fighting spam (and bridging telegram deletions) more efficiently. Asynchronous media uploads would make it possible for bridges (like telegram) to handle messages synchronously and thus keep message ordering without blocking all messages behind some media upload.</p>

<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p>Jason from Construct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct added support for server notice rooms. As the server administrator I've placed quick access to the server control room for myself in this section.</p>
<p>Construct has also added support for the server-side commands <code>\\read &lt;room-tag&gt;</code>, for example <code>\\read m.low_priority</code> will mark all low-priority tagged rooms as read. The command <code>\\read *</code> also will mark all rooms as read.</p>
<p>Also, we now allow users to configure whether they transmit typing events by setting state events in their home-room. If a user creates an event with the <code>type</code> of <code>ircd.typing.disable.send</code> and the <code>state_key</code> of the room_id, typing events will not be sent to that room for them. Further variations exist, such as <code>ircd.typing.disable.sync</code> to prevent the client from receiving typing events for a particular room or all rooms.</p>

<p>For all those who want a new emailbridge, I have great news for you! The new bridge supports sending and writing emails, using multiple rooms for multiple email-addresses.

<h3 id="big-news-for-the-slack-bridges">Big news for the Slack bridges</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Slack bridge has had a whole week of care applied to it. We've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/152">switched the bridge entirely over to Typescript</a>, and overhauled large parts of the codebase to make future work easier (for ex, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/185">using the Slack node library rather than request calls</a>). If that's not exciting enough, we've also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/164">added support for the RTM API</a>, which means the bridge can use websockets when talking to slack. This gives us nice things like typing updates, and the ability to deploy without needing a webserver to listen for events. Release 1.0 is imminent, but before then we are hoping to land <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/186">Postgresql support</a> so that the bridge can scale up to meet the high demands placed upon it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we‚Äôve been working on getting our brand new room directory implementation ready, creating a new Synapse installer, and creating a TURN server testing tool. We‚Äôve also been pushing on with the privacy project and fixing up some bugs and perf issues.<br />
Next week it‚Äôs all about getting the room directory out of the door, shipping the installer and continuing on with the privacy project. We are in the early stages of a project designed to reduce the load caused by outbound SSL connections, it is looking very promising. We‚Äôre also going to give the sqlite-&gt;postgres porting script some love as well as working on some message retention ideas, and also ways to reduce the meta data we store.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> got some fixes to bugs that appeared during the move to mautrix-python. It also got a <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram/wiki/Manhole">manhole</a> similar to the one in synapse, which gives admins access to an interactive Python shell inside the bridge while it's running.
The main part of the manhole (server and repl) is <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python/blob/master/mautrix/util/manhole.py">in mautrix-python</a>, so you can expect the feature to appear in mautrix-facebook, mautrix-hangouts and possibly maubot in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> and mautrix-hangouts can now automatically add rooms to a user-specific community to help with filtering. mautrix-facebook is also getting that feature in the near future.</p>

<p>Since the coming 1.3.0 release is bringing along a whole bunch of perf improvements, (and I want to test them out on my IO starved setup) I'm building K8s optimized images of the RCs. Only the debian version of the image though.</p>

<p>It's basically the regular docker image, only with some changes to make it fit nicer in Kubernetes<br />
And there's no Helm chart at the moment, was poking at that for a bit but took a break from building one as I - back then - had trouble with the amount of data that had to be generated<br />
You can only have one Synapse pod at any given time, as it's not scalable. Though you can scale it with workers (as I do myself)<br />

<p>Huge update from Andrew:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week‚Äôs stats for Dendrite are in! <strong>4 authors</strong> have pushed <strong>11 commits</strong> to master and <strong>11 commits</strong> to all branches. On master, <strong>48 files</strong> have changed and there have been <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/compare/master@%7B1564757067%7D...master">676 additions and 146 deletions</a>.</p>
<p>Of note are the following merged PRs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/693">Implement client single event retrieval - #671</a>
<ul>
<li>You can now request a single event from Dendrite‚Äôs DB, assuming you have permission to view it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/513">Account data events filtering database API</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/438">State events filtering database api</a>
<ul>
<li>Very old PRs from CromFR have been updated and finally merged! These lay the groundwork for providing filters across various API endpoints (used in search, /sync, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/692">Add typingserver service to docker-compose</a>
<ul>
<li>Another fairly old PR by <a href="https://github.com/viccuad">viccuad</a> (their first for Dendrite!) finally reviewed and merged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/706">Fix permission and 404 response for alias deletion - #654</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/774">Replace membership and visibility values with constants</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/726">Implement profile retrieval over federation - fixes #651</a> (this one is very useful), and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/772">Fix transaction IDs in transaction cache have global scope</a>
<ul>
<li>A myriad of changes and fixes by cnly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have a number of PRs that were moved forward but not merged. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/405">Add auth fallback endpoint</a> (our oldest PR at the moment!) which we mentioned last week is so very close, but not quite there in time for this TWIM.</p>
<p>In terms of passing Sytests, Dendrite now passes <strong>172 tests</strong>, up from <strong>167</strong> last week. This is out of <strong>761 tests</strong> in total. So just a small bump (0.6%), but note that things that are crucial for Dendrite development at the moment, such as federating, only cover a small subset of tests, so each passing one can bring us much closer to getting Dendrite usable day-to-day.</p>

<p>From Neil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The big news this week we‚Äôve landed some massive DB improvements (https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/5706) which should make message sending on matrix.org (and any other server) feel noticeably snappier. :) It'll be in the next release.</p>
<p>Outside of perf, we‚Äôve also been continuing with our privacy project, sydent now supports hashing third party identifiers instead of storing the raw form, and in the coming week we‚Äôll look at minimising the meta data we store. You can track our progress across the full project here (<a href="https://vector-im.github.io/feature-dashboard/#/plan?label=privacy-sprint&amp;repo=matrix-org/synapse&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-web&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-ios&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-android&amp;repo=vector-im/riotX-android&amp;repo=matrix-org/matrix-doc&amp;repo=matrix-org/sydent">https://vector-im.github.io/feature-dashboard/#/plan?label=privacy-sprint&amp;repo=matrix-org/synapse&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-web&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-ios&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-android&amp;repo=vector-im/riotX-android&amp;repo=matrix-org/matrix-doc&amp;repo=matrix-org/sydent</a>)</p>
<p>Work continues on our installer to make it easier to configure Synapse and we‚Äôll be looking for some community feedback rsn. The room directory revamp is now very close and we hope to have something live on matrix.org in about a week.</p>
<p>Finally we‚Äôre working on improving the efficiency of smaller instances sending messages into large rooms, we‚Äôre still at the design stage, but it will make a huge difference for anyone self hosting.</p>

<p>If you fancy running highly experimental software on your homeserver which might break things, I have two things for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-key-server">matrix-key-server</a> ( #matrix-key-server:t2bot.io ) is an implementation of a Matrix key server with notary support. Although it follows the specification, it has not been tested against Synapse. It is however fully featured: check it out on the federation tester ( <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/#keys.t2host.io">https://federationtester.matrix.org/#keys.t2host.io</a> ) or by querying it yourself ( <a href="https://keys.t2host.io/_matrix/key/v2/query/matrix.org">https://keys.t2host.io/_matrix/key/v2/query/matrix.org</a> ).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-room-directory-server">matrix-room-directory-server</a> ( #matrix-room-directory:t2bot.io ) is less experimental than the key server but is still very early days.

Check it out by searching the t2bot.io room directory from your client.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been making big updates to two of his bridges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> can now bridge formatting, mentions, replies and reactions in both directions.</p>

<p>There is also a logout command now.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>'s switch to <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python">mautrix-python</a> is nearly finished (i.e. it didn't cause any errors for the past few days when testing in production). The main reason for the switch is using one Matrix library for all my python bridges. It also means the bridging code like double puppeting and command handling I shared between mautrix-facebook and mautrix-hangouts is now also used in mautrix-telegram.</p>
<p>Visible changes directly caused by using mautrix-python:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logs are now colorful.</li>
<li>Python 3.5 is no longer supported.</li>
<li>The bridge will refuse to start without access to the base config file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes that happened during the switch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telegram &quot;Saved Messages&quot; can now be bridged even when using double puppeting.</li>
<li>Mentions on Telegram are marked as read when using double puppeting (messages were already being marked as read, but mentions weren't).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, this actually happened last week and the week before that, but anyway: I've moved the CI and docker registry of my active projects to a self-hosted GitLab at <a href="https://mau.dev">mau.dev</a>.
Specifically, the CI/docker registry for all four mautrix bridges and maubot and automatic builds for gomuks have been moved. My maubot plugins also have automatic .mbp builds in the CI. For the docker registry, prepending <code>dock.mau.dev/</code> to the existing image names will work.
The old places (docker hub, dl.maunium.net) won't get new builds anymore. The repos on GitHub are still the &quot;canonical&quot; repos, but they're mirrored more or less instantly with <a href="https://github.com/tulir/maumirror">maumirror</a>.</p>

<p>I've just released <a href="https://github.com/devture/email2matrix">Email2Matrix</a> - an SMTP server that can relay incoming messages over to Matrix based on mappings defined in a configuration file.</p>
<p>While it can also be installed standalone and work with any Matrix homeserver (see its documentation), the simplest way to install it is using <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-email2matrix.md">guide for Email2Matrix installation</a>.</p>
<p>The configuration process (users, rooms, mappings) is quite manual, but it's simple and has worked well for me for the past year and a half.
I've only just polished it up a bit, released and integrated with the Ansible playbook, so others could benefit from it too.</p>

<p>Lots of news about <a href="https://neo.pixie.town/app/">Neo</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li>There's now an additional maintainer (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@joepie91:pixie.town">joepie91</a>)!</li>
<li>A lot of the internals have been refactored, so they should be more maintainable and reliable going forward. Also some future work planned on refactoring the state handling using Redux, which should make it <em>much</em> faster to fix issues and add new features in the future. There are even some ideas already for a future plugin API!</li>
<li>Display has been improved in a lot of places. Error messages are now more clearly formatted, images in reply-quotes are now shown as thumbnails rather than just a filename, and the reply-to popup now shows the full event that you're replying to properly. The chat window now correctly sticks to the bottom when you're scrolled to the end and receive new messages, even when an image or video loads - though per-room scroll position restoration isn't done yet.</li>
<li>There's now an experimental compact mode! It uses a more IRC-client-like layout for messages, and generally just fits more content onto the screen. It can be enabled with an <a href="https://git.pixie.town/neo/neo#experimental-features">experimental flag</a>. A screenshot of the compact mode can be found <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2dLyQ49.png">here</a>.</li>

<p>We had a great demo session this afternoon, unfortunately the recording quality for some of the items was not good enough to share - and it was interesting stuff too! I cut everything from the RiotX and Riot iOS sections - but we'll make it up to you by getting more news from those projects soon.</p>

<p>Matthew informed the community:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're getting more and more folks reaching out for paid help setting up smaller self-hosted Matrix deployments. The core team has its hands full currently with helping out with larger deployments; so if anyone reading this wants to offer paid support to those getting up and running on Matrix then please make us aware so we can potentially route inquiries to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great step for Matrix, and a great opportunity for you the reader! There are already several people prepared to start work on Matrix-related endeavours, but the fact that there is <em>more work coming in than we can currently route</em> is amazing. If you'd like to be on an informal shortlist, <a href="mailto:support@matrix.org">contact support@</a>, or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">come chat to me directly</a>.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>So said Neil, who oversees the Synapse-makers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we shipped two new versions, 1.2 (<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/25/synapse-1-2-0-released">https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/25/synapse-1-2-0-released</a>) and 1.2.1(<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/26/critical-security-update-synapse-1-2-1-released">https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/26/critical-security-update-synapse-1-2-1-released</a>). 1.2.1 contains critical security updates, the bugs are long lived and not regressions introduced in 1.2 so all admins are encouraged to upgrade asap.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also been having some success in improving database performance and hope to ship that rsn so everyone can benefit.</p>
<p>Next week</p>
<p>We‚Äôll continue on db perf, improving logging verbosity (through recategorising some log lines) and generally looking to improve the experience for those admins running on smaller instances.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The GSoc project ‚ÄúMatrix Visualisations‚Äù has continued its progression during the second period:</p>
<p>A ‚Äúmulti-view‚Äù has been implemented for the frontend application. It means that it is now possible to independently view multiple DAGs at the same time in the same canvas. It can be useful for observing the same DAG but on different HS‚Äôs, at the same time. The only current limitation is that you have to use the same backend for every view (with CS API or with the backend talking to a Synapse PostgreSQL database). This change took a long time as it required to make a lot of changes in the code.</p>
<p>The implementation of the support of the Federation API within the backend is in progress. It is slowly progressing as it needed some discussion before starting the work on it and its implementation requires me to become familiar with a lot of new things, regarding the federation process and the authentication of requests between HS‚Äôs.</p>

<p>I've been playing with Pattle 0.10 and have to say, it feels silky smooth to scroll with. It's really making me look again at Flutter development.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a>, project lead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version has been pushed to F-droid and TestFlight!</p>
<p>Note that for TestFlight the new version will be available in a few days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve scrolling through chat messages!
<ul>
<li>Messages are now paginated under the hood, before the whole message list was rebuild when loading more messages, causing a jittery scrolling experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support typing notifications!
<ul>
<li>Typing notifications are shown and send while typing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add chat settings screen
<ul>
<li>Currently you can see the chat name, avatar, description and members. More will be added in the future.</li>
<li>You can go to the chat settings screen by clicking on the title of the chat. This'll probably change in the future (at least to be easier).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reverse swipe direction of images (thanks Nathan!)</li>
<li>Fix ripple not showing on send button</li>
<li>Make UI refreshing more efficient</li>
<li>The App Store (iOS) name is now 'Pattle' instead of 'Pattle IM'</li>
<li>When a chat is open, the UI will only be rebuild if <em>that</em> chat has updates.</li>
<li>Lot's of code clean ups and improvements, mostly in the SDK</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What's coming up?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A release on Google Play!</li>
<li>A release on the official F-droid repo!</li>
<li>Remove Cupertino specific styling on iOS
<ul>
<li>Will now use Material Design, but altered for iOS. Having the discrepancy between Cupertino and Material was also the reason why some things didn't show up in iOS or why some things would be blue instead of the Pattle red.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@SolarDrew:matrix.org">SolarDrew</a> and I have been working on re-writing our <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/skill-picard">Picard Bot</a> for a conference next week. Picard helps you bridge between a slack team and a matrix community.</p>
<p>This second version of Picard adds support for reacting to creation of new rooms on slack in real time as well as implementing a set of commands for creating new bridged rooms from either matrix or slack. In addition to this, Picard has matrix commands for inviting you to all the bridged rooms in the communtiy and automatically inviting you to new rooms as they are created. Finally, we have added support for sending welcome messages to all new members of your slack team or matrix community in a DM with the bot, which we are using to explain the chat setup to users and giving them a private place to issue commands.</p>
<p>This is uses <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/skill-picard">matrix-appservice-slack</a> for actually sending events in bridged rooms, and PIcard itself is a skill for the <a href="https://opsdroid.readthedocs.io/">opsdroid</a> bot framework #opsdroid-general:matrix.org  and uses the <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/database-matrix/">matrix-database</a> plugin for opsdroid which uses matrix room state to back the opsdroid memory.</p>

<p>It's all coming together now. While all pieces of the puzzle were roughly there, now they are put into the big picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/pull/111">bridge SDK PR</a> has been merged to develop, now providing bridges the benefit of error reporting. The modifications to the SDK are non-breaking, but activation of the feature requires small changes to the bridge using it. But be warned, everything is still under an unstable prefix and rightly so ‚Äì the implementation is still subject to change.
&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The MSC didn't get much love in public, but the concepts required to evolve it are taking shape. It was contemplated to piggyback on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1410">MSC 1410: Rich Bridging</a> and to add a retry mechanism. So heads up for more to come on this front.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3246">display of bridge errors</a> in Riot Web is now a PR and in the state of getting its last few kinks removed. It will start to be available under a lab flag soon.</p>
<p>With everything getting to play together nicely, there will be the first rooms enabling bridge errors to test the code in the wild. Stabilizing the code for everyday use and getting the MSC into a respectable form are the next goals for the project. Those will help in fostering broader adoption among bridges and clients.</p>

We have a number of community PRs still with active members, but most are waiting for reviews, which <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> is working towards.</p>
<h4 id="the-plan">The Plan</h4>
<p>A couple TWIMs ago we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/05/this-week-in-matrix-2019-07-05">teased</a> that Dendrite had a plan in the works. Well one meeting later and here is the proposal:</p>
<p>It will take a while for Dendrite to become feature complete with Synapse, but we‚Äôd like people to be able to actually use Dendrite before then. Instead of waiting for feature-completeness, we propose a set of milestones for Dendrite development to reach and prioritize development for.</p>
<p>These milestones are currently listed on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/milestones">Dendrite‚Äôs github</a>. The first is ‚ÄúBot Hosting‚Äù, which means, once complete, Dendrite would be suitable as a ‚Äúbot hub‚Äù, allowing server admins to run massive bridges on top of Dendrite while taking advantage of its horizontal-scaling capabilities. As written in the description, this goal includes basic CS API support, as well as federation with other homeservers. At this stage Dendrite should already be usable in rooms with other Synapse servers, which should make it a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>After that is several more milestones, each representing another use case that Dendrite can fill.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt be alarmed at the currently quite small percentage of completeness, as these milestones have just been built from the open issue list. We‚Äôre actually quite far along to #1 already :)</p>
<p>We also want to mention that the milestones aren‚Äôt completely built yet - there‚Äôs still a few more issues to comb through. It‚Äôs taken a few days as <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> can‚Äôt help himself to fix things as he goes along. A few open issues have also been closed as they had already been fixed earlier.</p>
<p>This is all mentioned in this week‚Äôs Matrix Live above by the way, so be sure to catch for some extra details if you‚Äôre interested.</p>
<p>We look forward to shipping you a working Dendrite soon‚Ñ¢. And as always feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!yjVgJUsMLYLAONsoii:jki.re?via=matrix.org&amp;via=privacytools.io&amp;via=ru-matrix.org">#dendrite-dev:matrix.org</a> for discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we‚Äôve been working on improving database performance, shipping the new small hosted homeserver instances - expect a lot of improvements to come that will benefit the whole community and merged our recent OpenTracing support. We‚Äôve also made some changes to how Sydent processes and stores email - more details here <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/19/privacy-changes-to-new-vector-identity-servers">https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/19/privacy-changes-to-new-vector-identity-servers</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Work continues on the major revamp of ruma-events mentioned in the last update.<br />
...<br />
There are also a few modules that are somewhat blocked on an issue in ring. Some of the types in ruma-events contain types from ruma-signatures which don't implement Clone and PartialEq because they contain types from ring which don't.<br />
...<br />
Rust 1.36 was released, and it includes stabilization of the Future trait, one of the long-awaited building blocks for first-class async support in Rust. [...] the biggest reason for Ruma's development hiatus is waiting for async networking in Rust to mature, and this is one of the final pieces of foundational support we've been waiting for. The remaining pieces are async/await syntax, which is expected in either the next version or the one following it, and finally, waiting for important libraries like Hyper and Tokio, as well as web frameworks, to adopt the new stuff.</p>

<p>Hi folks, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack">the slack bridge</a> has had another RC release this week 0.3.0-rc2 which has been deployed onto matrix.org :). In other news, we are nearly done with the port of the bridge to Typescript (slated for the 0.4 release) which has allowed us to clean up the codebase significantly and <strong>splat</strong> a lot of bugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm for any movement toward TypeScript - seems to be a winner in the JS-world. Says Half-Shot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm a bit fanatical about Typescript, it's objectively better to write things in TS than JS if you have the freedom to do so. It's also allowed us to keep the bug count down on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">Discord bridge</a>, so I'm starting to look at the other bridges for typescript support too.</p>

<p>In spite of being a relatively small proposal, there were already a lot of suggestions and directions in which it can evolve. Shoutout and thanks to everyone who already contributed to it with their comments!</p>
<p>Meanwhile on the more practical front a <a href="https://github.com/V02460/matrix-react-sdk/tree/reliable_riot">fork of Riot Web</a> was extended to now support the actual visual display of bridge error markings on messages.</p>

<p>I had/stole the idea to create a bot which uses message edits to send frames of an ASCII-art animation. I indeed created the bot, which works to a degree, but is quickly punished by rate-limiting, which limits the effectiveness. Still it's quite fun, you can <a href="https://github.com/benparsons/matrix-ascii-bot">check out the code here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>'s work on <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> is interesting for bot or other client devs, and there is a new guide available: <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-matrix-bot-sdk">http://matrix.org/docs/guides/usage-of-matrix-bot-sdk</a></p>
<p>A few weeks ago I mentioned <a href="https://play.matrix.org/matrix-enact/">matrix-enact</a>, which uses Web Audio API to play back room history. There is a guide to how it was built, looking at the <code>/context</code> endpoint now available: <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/creating-a-simple-read-only-matrix-client">https://matrix.org/docs/guides/creating-a-simple-read-only-matrix-client</a></p>

<p>This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/04/synapse-1-1-0-released">shipped v1.1.0</a>, which provides an overhaul of docker configuration, more authentication options and improved db io. It‚Äôs worth noting that v1.1.0 is the first Synapse release to drop support for Python 2 (and Postgres 9.4), this paves the way for using Python 3 only functionality.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve been working on supporting soft logout, more edits and reactions support, open tracing support not to mention a complete rewrite of the push server Sygnal. We‚Äôll be rolling out new Sygnal gradually over the next week or two.</p>
<p>Finally, aided by dropping Python 2 support, we‚Äôve been putting in a bunch of work to improve Synapse in resource constrained environments. This will be a constant theme over the coming months.</p>

<ul>
<li>Make api calls suspendable functions (which are like Kotlin's flavor of async). This way, the caller don't need to worry about forgetting to call await or a coroutine being left unstarted.</li>
<li>Borrowing from functional programming, model the outcome of a call as a discriminated union, which can be either a success or a failure. The successful case is optimized with inline classes, an experimental feature in Kotlin 1.3, and wrapping is avoided.</li>
<li>Make MatrixError a subclass of HttpError, because the http status code can be handy</li>

<p>Another week, which means more work on the mx-puppet-bridge ecosystem! A new &gt; bridge has been added, mx-puppet-discord. Soru finally added license files &gt; (Apache-2-0) and some readmes.</p>
<h4 id="mx-puppet-bridge"><a href="https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-bridge">mx-puppet-bridge</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>bugfixes</li>
<li>implement optional double-puppeting (also logging into your matrix acc)</li>
<li>relate remote event IDs to matrix event IDs</li>
<li>handle edits in both directions</li>
<li>handle redactions in both directions</li>
<li>initiating conversations from matrix! Invite a ghost for 1:1 or follow a &gt; room alias for rooms</li>
<li>bot provisioning: list users and rooms</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mx-puppet-slack"><a href="https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-bridge">mx-puppet-slack</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>add linting</li>
<li>map channels and slack pills</li>
<li>handle message edits</li>
<li>handle message deletions</li>
<li>properly handle /me messages</li>
<li>handle ghost invites</li>
<li>handle room joins via alias</li>

<p>This is the new puppeting bridge! The idea is that, in the long run, this will &gt; be run in conjunction with <a href="https://github.com/">matrix-appservice-discord</a> Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord), where mx-puppet-discord handles DM &gt; puppeting and matrix-appservice-discord the remaining. For this, the message &gt; parsing was split in a new repository, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-discord/matrix-discord-parser">matrix-discord-parser</a>. The idea is that, in the &gt; future, when inviting a ghost on matrix-appservice-discord it'll initiate &gt; conversation within mx-puppet-discord</p>
<ul>
<li>basic text messages</li>
<li>handle files</li>
<li>handle edits, deletes</li>
</ul>
<p>mx-puppet-discord does only DMs, for non-DMs please use matrix-appservice-discord</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Here's Neil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With 1.0 shipped we are now starting to take a closer look at Synapse performance more generally and this will be a theme for us over the coming months. We want to improve not only large scale deployments such as Matrix.org but also optimise for smaller instances.</p>
<p>You may have seen a few trial servers run by core team members in matrix.org community rooms popping up and this is a precursor for a broader effort to make synapse more manageable on less powerful infrastructure. My own instance has been sat at a pretty steady 256MB of RAM.</p>
<p>Other than that, based on 1.0 feedback, we have been working on improving the Synapse upgrade path and expect to put out a new release next week containing the tweaks. Specifically this means improving configuration for Docker installs, and configuration management for sending emails.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre also implementing open tracing into Synapse, initially to help with e2ee debugging, but it will make tracking down strange behaviour easier more generally.</p>
<p>Finally we‚Äôre bringing our push server Sygnal kicking and screaming into 2019 and will upgrade to Python 3, drop gevent for twisted and update our vendor specific libraries, not mention improving the monitoring and alerting. We‚Äôll also add in open tracing which will help hunt down push failures.</p>
<p>Finally finally, look out for a DAG visualisation tool written by GSOCer Eisha referenced elsewhere in TWIM  - we consider this to be seriously cool, and can‚Äôt wait to start using it in anger.</p>
<p>Note: 1.0 is the last release to support python 2 and postgres 9.4, the next Synapse release will drop support for both, see <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/04/08/synapse-deprecating-postgres-9-4-and-python-2-x">https://matrix.org/blog/2019/04/08/synapse-deprecating-postgres-9-4-and-python-2-x</a> for more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week was spent working on a big revamp of <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma-events">ruma-events</a>, the library that defines Rust types for the &quot;events&quot; used in Matrix.
After some discussion in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a>, I decided to make a move towards treating ruma-events as a higher-level library. Previously, ruma-events has more or less offered Rust types that are exact representations of the JSON structures used by Matrix. However, by representing events this way, it would be possible for users to easily create values that, while valid JSON, would be invalid events according to the specification.
The way we're approaching this problem is by separating serialization/deserialization of JSON from validation of events.</p>

<h3 id="gsoc-project-matrix-visualisations-mortar-board">GSOC project: Matrix Visualisations üéì</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@eisha:matrix.org">Eisha</a> appeared with this terrific GSOC update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The GSoC project ‚ÄúMatrix Visualisations‚Äù has made good progress during this first period:</p>
<ul>
<li>The implementation of the CS API backend has been completed to properly retrieve events from a room in real time.</li>
<li>Many features have been added to the UI, here are some of them:
<ul>
<li>The DAG is displayed vertically, every node of the same ‚Äúdepth‚Äù are on the same level in the graph and each node has outgoing arcs for each of its previous events (if they have already been retrieved).</li>
<li>The node at the top of the DAG allows to fetch earlier events by selecting it.</li>
<li>Each node can have two different colors whether its ‚Äúorigin‚Äù is the HS the application is currently talking to or not.</li>
<li>The full JSON body of an event can be displayed by double clicking on its node.</li>
<li>It is possible to select which fields of the events will be directly included in the labels of the nodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A (server-side) backend has been implemented so that the application can directly talk to the PostgreSQL database of Synapse. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend">this repo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the support of the Federation API has been postponed so I could work on this Synapse database backend.
The UI of the application isn‚Äôt very beautiful or well-organised yet, as the effort is focused on the backends and core functionalities for now, but improvements will be made once these functionalities will be completed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/koma-im/continuum-desktop">continuum</a> tweaked the appearance of placeholder avatars. To make most users appear visually distinct, continuum has always used colors based on checksums and usernames to generate placeholders if any user doesn't have an image as avatar. In previous versions, it always used two characters of the name. In the new version, if the username contains ideographic (usually east-asian) characters, a single character would be used. The reason is that the number of ideographic characters is vast and duplicates are less common, and most of them are close to a square or circle in shape so a single one would fit the GUI component better.</p>

<p>Following the announcement that <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/blob/master/EOL.md">mxisd would not longer be worked on</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> has stepped up to provide support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I forked mxisd (<a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/mxisd">https://github.com/ma1uta/mxisd</a>) and will provide support this project. You can ask about help in a new room <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ma1sd:ru-matrix.org">#ma1sd:ru-matrix.org</a>
A new temporary name will be <code>ma1sd</code> (thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dandellion:dodsorf.as">Dandellion</a> ).
Due to changing maintainers I start to prepare the new 2.0.0 release and should audit code and dependencies.
Also I forked matrix-synapse-rest-password-provider (<a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-synapse-rest-password-provider">https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-synapse-rest-password-provider</a>) because it often uses with mxisd.
Docker image, ansible support, debian, nixos and archlinux packages are temporary unavailable due to code auditing and changing maintainers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I made a Matrix bot that uses reactions to do polls! The code is available at <a href="https://github.com/babolivier/matrix-poll-bot">https://github.com/babolivier/matrix-poll-bot</a> (with a screenshot of how it works) and you can invite <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@poll-bot:abolivier.bzh">@poll-bot:abolivier.bzh</a> in your room if you want to try it out üôÇ</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bot works by taking a list of emoji + responses from a user, then makes a new message event with those emojis each voted for once. In this way, you can quickly make a reaction-based poll.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>, never enough <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubots</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/maubot/reactbot">reactbot</a> I announced last week has been updated to support arbitrary response content instead of just reactions. As examples, the repo now has a stallman interjection bot (ported from <a href="https://github.com/interwho/stallman-bot">this</a> and a replacement for <a href="https://github.com/maubot/jesaribot">jesaribot</a>. Reactions as responses are still supported and the repo still has the TWIM cookie bot example too.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts-thought-balloon">Final thoughts üí≠</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ananace/">Ananace</a> has been looking again at a release tracker they'd previously been working on.</p>
<p>kernel.org have set up an ActivityPub instance (see <a href="https://people.kernel.org/about">https://people.kernel.org/about</a>.) Not strictly Matrix but interesting that they decided to move to a federated platform.</p>
<p>First GSOC evaluation submissions were due this week, all four Matrix projects are proceeding well. See Eisha's update above, and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/21/this-week-in-matrix-2019-06-21">the other three last week</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@red_sky:ocean.joedonofry.com">red_sky</a>, nheko maintainer, was seen to say: &quot;I know there hasn't been much activity from me lately. I was on vacation last week. I'll be getting back to work on 0.7.0 today&quot;</p>
<p>The Europas awards ceremony was held at a venue next to my old flat. Small world! Small flat too.</p>

<p>See you next week, and be sure to stop by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> with your updates!</p>
