<p>Quiet week, not much happening, the only real progress has been shipping a Synapse 1.0 release candidate :) Joking aside we‚Äôd really appreciate your help in testing it ahead of the full release next week. Get the RC here <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.0.0rc1">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.0.0rc1</a></p>
<p>Also friends don‚Äôt let friends operate a Synapse install without a valid certificate on the federation API. Post 1.0, servers that are not compliant will be locked out of the federation.

<p>[I] wrote a proof-of-concept load balancer for synchrotron workers....well, proof-of-concept because it isn't tested much, yet!</p>
<p>It routes users to synchrotrons based on their user ID to maximize performance, as per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/workers.rst#synapseappsynchrotron">worker docs</a> and, if a synchrotron catches fire it'll also automatically start shuffling workers around.<br />

<p>Are you in the know about Matrix? If not, prepare to learn about <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/">RiotX</a>, a <em>completely re-written</em> Matrix client for Android. This new version has a Kotlin SDK.</p>
<p>Benoit, from the team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many things to announce this week on RiotX:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto is starting to work! We can now decrypt message and send encrypted messages. The whole feature is not implemented yet, but we will merge the PR at the beginning next week before going further. Thanks Fran√ßois for the great work!</li>
<li>On the timeline, message composed by only emoji are now displayed bigger (as in other Riot clients)</li>
<li>We can now see details and actions of each message, including state event.</li>
<li>We can also see the detailed list of reactions for a particular message, and reaction display rendering has been improved. More details of what has been improved by Valere can be found in this PR description: <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/pull/168">https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/pull/168</a>.</li>
<li>Local echo on message edition has been improved</li>
<li>The 3 main themes has been implemented (Light, Dark Black). Status theme is still there but has not been tested yet. There are still some little issues which will be fixed in the next coming days.</li>
<li>The new Home is on develop, composed by a catchup tab, a direct message tab and a group room tab. The drawer is now used to display the groups hierarchy.</li>
<li>A debug signature has been added to the git repository, so the APK built by buildkite can now be installed and replace a previously installed APK.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is still lots of work to do, but we are quite confident to deliver a first alpha version of RiotX to a larger audience at the end of June.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The symptom is syncing forever on startup and never actually syncing. The commit introducing the borkage is <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/commit/250376a7bd953d480d0d50eabb39ed0e891f9d84">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside Synapse‚Äôs 1.0 release, the Matrix Specification is also getting a 1.0 on June 10th. In practice this means a fresh release of the Client-Server, Server-Server, Application Service, and Identity Service specifications. The Push Specification is just so simple it hasn‚Äôt needed an update yet.</p>
<p>Work has been happening to get all the specs in shape for 1.0 - follow along at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/2?fullscreen=true">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/2?fullscreen=true</a></p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Main news in synapse-land this week is that we released Synapse v0.99.5.2, which fixes a big performance regression which was introduced v0.99.5. Folks who are currently on v0.99.5/v0.99.5.1 are advised to upgrade asap.</p>
<p>Otherwise, work has been continuing apace towards a v1.0 release on 10th June.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/">Construct</a> is a homeserver implementation in C++:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Construct has added support for Server Access Control Lists (m.room.server_acl). The exact behavior of the implementation is configurable by the server administrator, and is even more comprehensive than Synapse. In Construct, ACLs can be configured to cover incoming EDUs, outgoing events, and indirectly fetched events.</li>
<li>The GraphicsMagick library has been utilized to implement the media thumbnailing feature called for by the specification. This is an optional dependency written in C and offers a rich API which as been extremely fun to work with. In the future, expect your Construct to be capable of things like annotating images with the Server Command Line which can be used to generate memes in your chatroom or write custom text on top of stickers!</li>
<li>On the backend we have devoted significant effort to getting the most out of dynamic-linking to simplify the architecture of a large and modular free-software project. This effort makes adding features and contributions to Construct extremely straightforward. I will enumerate the basics for those familiar with developing C software: We are now loading all modules at runtime with the flags <code>RTLD_GLOBAL|RTLD_DEEPBIND|RTLD_LAZY</code> and we build with the flag <code>--weak-unresolved-symbols</code>; during execution we hook the error handling in <code>ld.so</code> to throw our own C++ exception directly from the PLT slot of a missing symbol. In summary this allows features to be added to Construct by simply creating an interface in a header and definitions in a loadable module, while still enjoying optional loading and unloading of the module at runtime. This is a significant feat that remains unrealized in most existing projects around the free software ecosystem!</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you believe it, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> had a busy week working on his various bridges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> now has native Matrix edit support in both directions and basic Prometheus metrics. I'll probably start making 0.6.0 RCs after improving the metrics a bit.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts">mautrix-hangouts</a> got some bugfixes and options to configure the displaynames of the ghost users on Matrix (like adding <code>(FB)</code> or <code>(Hangouts)</code> suffixes).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a>'s Matrix puppeting was finished (meaning typing notifs, read receipts and presence updates can now be bridged to WhatsApp) and unexpected disconnection handling was fixed (automatic reconnections should now usually work again).
Backfilling needed some hacks to work with Matrix puppeting. The problem is that the real Matrix users have rate limits and can't send timestamp-massaged messages. I decided to just invite the default ghost user to the room while backfilling and make it leave afterwards so that private chat room names and such would stay intact. Some clients like Riot Android/iOS sometimes do weird things, such as moving the room out of &quot;People&quot;, but that shouldn't be too bad.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> has seen some work in becoming more flexible.</p>
<p>Synapse is not a requirement anymore. People can now use the playbook to install any of the other services, wiring them to a Synapse instance installed in another way.
This is mostly useful for installing bridges or other auxiliary services without going &quot;all in&quot; on the playbook.
Not having Synapse as a fixed requirement also opens the door for installing alternative homeservers, when such become available in the future.</p>
<p>On a similar note, to ease maintanability, all bridges have been moved to separate Ansible roles (outside of the <code>matrix-synapse</code> role).
There have been lots of improvements related to bridge configuration with even more likely to come soon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neo now supports sending multiple images, videos and files at once. You'll get a bar with previews, and the option to remove them from the queue/add more.<br />
There's also been a bunch of changes to how events are handled. Images and videos should be much more robust against missing keys (no thumbnail, no information, etc), and there's basic displaying of the most common state events.<br />
I also added an experimental media repository fallback option, which is disabled by default, and only implemented for room avatars. This allows you to provide a list of alternative homeservers Neo is allowed to try when your own homeserver can't load a piece of media.<br />
Due to the loss of lain.haus, I lost admin access in the Neo room, so keep your eyes out for a new one when my infra is back.<br />
I'm currently not really versioning anything, but I do push significant commits to <a href="https://neo.lain.haus/neo">https://neo.lain.haus/neo</a> for people to try. Once it gets to a more useable state, I'll start adopting semantic versioning.</p>

<h3 id="major-whatsapp-bridging-update">Major WhatsApp bridging update</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> made great strides on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on mautrix-whatsapp to add history bridging and Matrix puppeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>New portals are populated with some history when creating them (exact count is configurable)</li>
<li>All messages missed during bridge downtime are backfilled</li>
<li>Creating portals is smarter now:</li>
<li>When logging in initially, it'll create portals for a few recent chats (count configurable).</li>
<li>It'll create portals when there are incoming messages as before, but it should no longer create portals for chats that only have old messages.</li>
<li>The missed message backfilling creates portals when necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Matrix puppeting isn't quite finished yet. It can already use your Matrix account to bridge messages sent from whatsapp mobile, but it doesn't use the account to bridge EDUs (typing notifs, presence, read receipts) yet.</p>
<p>To make the history bridging a bit nicer, I made a PR to fix timestamp massaging in synapse: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/5233. Timestamp massaging was removed from the spec in 1.0, but it wasn't intentionally removed from synapse, it just broke due to other changes. It was probably supposed to stay there as an easter egg until there's a proper solution for bridging history.</p>

<h3 id="gsoc-2019-reliable-bridges">GSoC 2019 ‚Äì Reliable Bridges</h3>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kai:nasnotfound.de">Kai</a> for this introduction to his project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>Reliable Bridges</em> GSoC project is about implementing a feedback mechanism for the Matrix network in cases where bridges are not able to properly handle messages. Currently clients are unable to know if a message was successfully sent over a bridge. With the new mechanism in place they get the information about errors happening at bridges and can behave accordingly by e.g. notify the user of the failed delivery.</p>
<p>The implementation is foremost focused on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-dicord</a> bridge which uses the underlying <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>. A JS bridge was chosen so that as much code as possible is brought into the SDK and other bridges can profit sooner from the work done.</p>
<p>The first step for implementing the new feature will be the signaling of permanent errors occurring at the bridge (in contrast to temporary failures). They might occur e.g. when the sending account was banned on the bridged foreign network. These permanent errors will be implemented as a new type of PDU originating from the bridge.</p>
<p>After permanent errors are done, the subsequent weeks will see work on temporary failures which might include work on Synapse as well as work on Riot Web to have a client which actually uses the new events. As these events are new features being introduced there will also be a MSC draft. There everyone can check out the proposed solution and tear it apart with their criticism (if applicable üòâ).</p>
<p>For discussions related to the GSoC project or when you have some opinions on how the MSC should look like, you are invited to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#reliablebridges:nasnotfound.de">Reliable Bridges Matrix room</a>.</p>

<p>This week we shipped <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/05/15/synapse-0-99-4-released">0.99.4</a>  - no stand out ‚Äòoh my gosh‚Äô headlines, just lot lot of bug fixes and perf improvements - get involved. We‚Äôve also been working hard to getting things like reactions and edits going, as well more prep for improving perf for small server instances.</p>

<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p>First <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/">Construct</a> update for a few weeks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/">Construct</a> has added a server command line available in any room when starting a line with a special character (by default it's '\'). The commands are private so the room doesn't actually see it. More on this next week, or check out <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net">#test:zemos.net</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-sdk-now-1-0">Ruby SDK now 1.0!</h3>
<p>Big news from <a href="https://github.com/ananace/">Ananace</a> this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finished getting the test coverage to a reasonable enough percentage to feel comfortable releasing the <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby Matrix SDK</a> as a nice and stable 1.0 (.0)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is great! All Rubyists should check it out. Ananace notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I still need to set up fixtures for all the API endpoints I'm exposing so I can verify every single API call as well, but I see that as a later thing as that relates mostly to how the other side (the HS) handles my input, not to how the SDK itself handles said input</p>

<p>Reactions continues at full speed, we have a draft PR and will be implementing over the coming week. The ability to blacklist IPs over federation will land imminently, as well as a nasty device management bug that led to a spate of E2E errors. Next week is all about Reactions, resuming work on the small homeserver project and finally getting back to Synapse 1.0 blockers following all the remediation drama of the past few weeks. With any luck we‚Äôll have a new Synapse release for you next week.</p>

But he didn‚Äôt stop there: eager to see his awesome work in the hands of many people (figuratively, the literal application will have to wait for the phone to be out üòõ) as soon as possible, he tackled a few bugs that we really wanted to get sorted out before we got a new version out.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been using his <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python">mautrix-python</a> lib, which was recently used to enable his <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> bridge, to bring a new method for Matrix-Hangouts bridging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New bridge again, this time it's Hangouts: https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts / <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#hangouts:maunium.net">#hangouts:maunium.net</a>. As with the Messenger bridge, currently the main difference to matrix-puppet-hangouts is multi-user support (also no hacky JS/Python mixing).</p>
<p>Before making mautrix-hangouts, I put a bunch of the generic bridging parts of mautrix-facebook into mautrix-python's bridge module and used that in both bridges. After Debian 10 is released, I'll drop Python 3.5 compatibility in mautrix-telegram and move it to use mautrix-python and the bridge module too.</p>
<p>Next week I'm planning on adding a bunch of features to both my new bridges, such as bridging formatting and remaining media types (so no new bridges planned for now :D).</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vote on a new name for the QMatrixClient project has been going on over the past week.<br />
<strong>We have a winner now, and the new name is &quot;Quotient&quot;!</strong> In the nearest weeks, expect changes in the library code (it's going to be libQuotient from the next release), room aliases (already ongoing), links to the repos etc. etc. Where possible, we're going to smoothen the migration path by providing legacy fallbacks (e.g., the new C++ namespace, Quotient, will be introduced but the old one, QMatrixClient, will stay its synonym, although deprecated).<br />
Just in case you missed all the previous mentions of the topic - it's only related to the overall project and the library, but not the client - its name remains Quaternion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why rename?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the previous name has been a bit clumsy and, most importantly, the project is no more focusing just on client-side but on a wider set of applications of Matrix (no homeserver in plans though).

<p>Just published version 0.1.0 of the <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby Matrix SDK</a>, and I've gotten enough testing written now where I feel comfortable not marking this as a pre-production release.

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://opsdroid.readthedocs.io/">Opsdroid</a> 0.15 has been released, with <em>a lot</em> of matrix focused updates. The biggest of which is support for sending and receiving images and files. There have also been a bunch of bug fixes such as clean exit of the matrix connector and correct handling of events which are not parsed. There are also a bunch of other not matrix specific changes like support for the awesome <a href="https://pypi.org/project/parse/">parse</a> library for string matching.

<p>Matrix (Synapse) jumps to second place in <a href="https://the-federation.info">https://the-federation.info</a> site, which lists servers of the federated social web.

You wouldn't have to be super active, however a few minutes per day would be greatly appreciated. You'd be responsible of reviewing PRs! Because of this not being afraid of Typescript and not being afraid of Discord is required - no need to be at pro-level!</p>

Currently the main difference to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-facebook">matrix-puppet-facebook</a> is multi-user support like my WhatsApp and Telegram bridges. The bridge is Python and the code structure is similar to <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>, so I'll probably eventually create a generic bridge library out of the common parts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Due to the security incident, all GitHub access tokens for the Scalar GitHub integration were cleared. This means that if you have a GitHub bot in the channel and want to use the !github bot commands, you need to re-login to github via the integration manager menu. Note, existing webhooks are untouched and should work fine without re-authenticating.</p>

<p>A big release of Pattle has just been pushed to the F-droid repo! Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display names are now shown</li>
<li>You can now click on chats and view them!</li>
<li>Messages are grouped by time and sender (see screenshots)</li>
<li>Add fancy transition animation and ripples to chat messages (see video)</li>
<li>Use Sentry for error reporting (only Android version and device model is sent, along with the stacktrace of the error)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, please note that if you have a matrix.org you probably have reinstall the app if you're logged in because of the recent matrix.org incident (because there's no logout button yet and no detection for invalidated access tokens)</p>

<p>it's been a long while, but I've finally come around to improving on matrix-registration<br />
For those of you, who have forgotten what this project is about, it basically lets you invite people to your homeserver with tokens, e.g. https://homeserver.tld/register?token=DoubleWizardSky<br />
This whole update was about making the project more user friendly.<br />
I made a new default registration page that requires 0 setup and you can install the project right from pypi with pip, so you don't even need to clone the repo any longer.<br />
check a live example  here: https://chat.dmnd.sh/register<br />

<p>Dimension has been updated to more safely handle when upstream integration managers (like Scalar) are offline. Instead of crashing or breaking in various ways, it'll report which integrations are not accessible.<br />
As well, due to recent events, if you use matrix.org bots or bridges in Dimension then go the the admin section and log everyone out using the red button. Dimension caches upstream tokens and isn't smart enough to realize that they are no longer valid, which means they need clearing. Clients should automatically handle getting new tokens in the background.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last week we carried on with Synapse 1.0 work, in particular <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4364">server key signing validity</a>, a config option to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4967">verify federation certificates</a> to support MSC1711 and support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4982">3PID unbinding APIs</a> (MSC1915). Outside of that we've been thinking about how to improve room upgrades for private rooms and landed the preparatory work for a refactor of the room directory.</p>
<p>Coming up next, we'll continue to bash out 1.0 blockers, Hawkowl has started work on optimising for small hosted homeservers, and anoa will be working on the new super fast room directory. Finally Erik has started work on aggregations support so clients will be able to offer things like edits and reactions ?</p>

<p>This weekend I took a brief pause from doing matrix work, and then went back into it by finishing the feature set for the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/synapse-netcore-workers/pull/48">.NET Core Synchrotron</a>. It's &quot;feature complete&quot; meaning all specced features of sync are in this branch, excluding legacy endpoints. There are a few bugs logged against it and it's really only useful as a super early test, while I fix some of the p1 bugs.</p>
<p>The federation sender continues to be reliable and stable, and we are prepping for the release of synapse 0.99.3 which made a few changes to the replication stream.

<h2 id="pattle-has-now-moved-to-flutter">Pattle has now moved to Flutter</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a> has officially discontinued the previous version of Pattle, and is focused on their Flutter SDK and new version of Pattle based on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After some silence here but a lot of development, Pattle has now moved to Flutter. The new app is available in the same F-droid repository, you can just update. Note that you will have to log in again. If there are issues with updating, try removing the old app and installing the new one.</p>
<p>Also note that this version is still very basic and does not have all features of the old Pattle unfortunately. The reason that I chose to already replace it on the repo is that the old app will not receive updates anymore.</p>
<p>The current features are logging in and an overview of all chats. What <em>is</em> new is that data is now stored locally, so you won't have to do an initial sync everytime you open the app (which was the case with old app). What's also new is that I've decided to use more red, because.. I like red.</p>
<p>There is still a lot to do! Please notify me of anything that you think is missing, even though some things may be obvious (sorting chats based on date, chat avatars), some may not be as obvious to me!</p>
<p>If you'd like to contribute, the new repo is <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app">here</a>. Note that many contributions will probably start at the SDK level. Pattle uses my own Dart SDK, which you can find <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/library/matrix-dart-sdk">here</a>.</p>
<p>There is at the moment a very specific bug in Flutter, where on Android 7.1 with release builds, the app crashes when building a list widget. If you use Android 7.1 (like me) and you crash after logging in, that's the reason. It seems I can't do anything about it, sorry.</p>

<p>The matrix.org homeserver will be down for essential database maintenance between 12:00 and 12:30 UTC on 2019-04-01</p>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Neil, Synapse overseer, reports on the acceleration towards <em>1.0</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have much improved sytest support for Synapse worker mode, Hawkowl landed a brand new super fast super shiny user directory implementation, Brendan fixed a bunch of niggles in <a href="/federationtester">the federation tester</a> and we <em>finally</em> got to the bottom of our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4956">sync caching bug that obscured accepting invites</a> (thanks richvdh for sticking with it). Erik solved our presence spamming bug and anoa fixed some LDAP auth bugs and submitted a PR for certificate checking - one of our final blockers for Synapse 1.0. For all the latest checkout out our latest release candidate <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.3rc1">0.99.3rc1</a>.<br />
Next week, we'll ship 0.99.3, we'll be looking at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4364">server key validity periods</a>, adding a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1915">3PID unbind API</a> and starting work on tuning low powered Synapse installations.<br />
<a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com/">https://www.arewereadyyet.com/</a> is still rising so keep banging to everyone you know that they ensure their federation certificates are valid.</p>

<h2 id="pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/poljar">poljar</a> gave this update on his new project <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a> is a new project that acts as a reverse proxy for clients to connect to. Once a client is connected Pantalaimon handles end to end encryption for the client transparently.<br />
The project is only a week old but already at a working prototype phase. A demo can be found here: <a href="http://webmshare.com/play/Qn4wg">http://webmshare.com/play/Qn4wg</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a huge gain! Use of this project, as you will see in the video, permits any Matrix client to support End-to-End encryption of messages, by handling encryption/decryption in a daemon rather than in the client.</p>
<p><a href="http://webmshare.com/play/Qn4wg">Watch the video</a>, and you'll see <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a>, which does not support encryption, chatting in an encrypted room. Also, go chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#pantalaimon:matrix.org">#pantalaimon:matrix.org</a> and get involved!</p>

<h2 id="construct">Construct</h2>
<p>Report from the Construct team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The matrix Construct server has made significant progress this week implementing the 1.0 specification and is very close to a 1.0 release! Special thanks to our star tester Yan Minari and expert Matrix consultants Tulir and Max and C++ developers Jason of Zemos and Mujx of nheko for all their hard work to make this happen. The Construct now fully supports IPv6 and is ready to participate in fully end-to-to-end encrypted ipv6 networks like <code>#yggdrasil:matrix.org</code> and <code>#cjdns:matrix.org</code>.<br />This week also saw additions for .well-known support, <code>m.fully_read</code> and even DNS caching inside a matrix room shared between servers (which is really cool if you ask me).</p>
<p>I'd like to recognize our testers for their invaluable contributions this week, only a fraction of which are documented here: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/issues">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/issues</a> leading to the 1.0 release.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Construct is written in C++ for maximum performance and scalability. It is the first fully federating server after the Synapse reference implementation. Your contributions in code and participation are essential to bring Construct to its upcoming release; get involved at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct</a> and in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#zemos-test:matrix.org">#zemos-test:matrix.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="riot-web">Riot Web</h2>
<p>From the team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've been upgrading and optimising our Jitsi instance so people should see more reliable video conference calls, especially if they avoid connecting from Firefox over poor connections.<br />We've been squashing scroll jumps (where the timeline pops out of position unexpectedly due to images loading, etc.). We've come up with a radical reimplementation of the timeline (which should be imperceptible, except it doesn't jump) - try it out on <a href="https://riot.im/develop">https://riot.im/develop</a> now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bruno, who has been working on scroll functional for Riot deserves a call-out - scrolling in new Riot web works great, and he may now be the most qualified dev on <code>scroll: anchor</code> outside of Mozilla or Google‚Ä¶</p>
<p>You can now get all Riot updates from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#riot-web-announcements:matrix.org">#riot-web-announcements:matrix.org</a>, the official room of Riot web announcements! You can especially get this update, which was also featured on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Attention Riot Web Admins! We reset Scalar tokens to address a potential security vuln. with some clients - if you run your own Riot instance please upgrade to at least v1.0.4 to keep using integrations (widgets, sticker picker, any bots and bridges configured through Scalar).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Please upgrade your Riot web instances!</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@pacien:pacien.net">Notkea</a> has <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/57838">packaged Riot desktop for NixOS</a>.</p>
<h2 id="riot-ios">Riot iOS</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Another case of UTD (<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-ios/issues/2320">https://github.com/vector-im/riot-ios/issues/2320</a>) has been fixed. Some logs have been added to track push notifications that disabled themselves. SAS verification implementation is still in progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UTD = &quot;Unable to Decrypt&quot;, messages as seen in Riot</p>
<h2 id="riot-android">Riot Android</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>Rework of EventStreamService, to fix many issues (crash) reported by users. The feature is available on the develop branch.</li>
 	<li>Also we are trying to upgrade Jitsi library, to fix other errors reported by users.</li>
 	<li>SAS verification implementation is still in progress.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, you may have already seen the use of Android 9-style notifications, featuring &quot;Mark as read&quot; + &quot;Quick reply&quot; buttons. This addition has started to make Riot Android my client of choice for burning through notifying rooms.</p>
<h2 id="riotx-android">RiotX (Android)</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>Phase 1 started!</li>
 	<li>Backporting RageShake feature, with better handshake detection.</li>
 	<li>We are still fighting bug on the timeline rendering.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="nheko-packaging">nheko packaging</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@adridg:matrix.org">@adridg:matrix.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quick note that nheko (v 0.6.3) is now packaged for FreeBSD as well. The C++ code was fine (we use Clang, that does trip up some people) but I have Opinions about the CMake code (in particular that the find code for nlohmann/json.hpp, lmdb++.h and tweeny.h could use a lot of work -- if I feel perky I may come up with a PR). Thanks for the good work!</p>

<h2 id="dart-sdks">Dart SDKs</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> has been using Dart and Flutter this week, and is making progress with an SDK and reference client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am trying to use libaqueous(Matrix Dart SDK) to create a cross-platform matrix client for Android and iOS.<br /><del>Almost nothing works except</del> Already a significant number of client features are available: <strong>login/logout, room list, basic timeline and message posting</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Flutter is quite good for rapidly building mobile apps. ? Strong-typed json serialization/deserialization in Dart is a bit difficult at first, but I managed to solve that.<br />the repo is <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/aqueous">here</a>, the SDK is <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/libaqueous">here</a>, and the room for discussion is at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libaqueous:encom.eu.org">#libaqueous:encom.eu.org</a></p>
