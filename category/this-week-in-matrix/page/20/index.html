<p>The Spec Core Team is going to try and select 3 MSCs to prioritise per week to work on, in order to not stretch resources too thin and to communicate clearly what it is we're actually up to. More details to follow.</p>
<p>Otherwise this week has been continuing to iterate on existing MSCs, as well as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2296">updating the MSC template</a> to rename the &quot;Tradeoffs&quot; section to &quot;Alternatives&quot;, and to get rid of &quot;Conclusion&quot; which was always just an unnecessary repeat of the introduction.</p>

<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p>Notes from Jason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct did a round of performance work and pursued some of the easier opportunities with the most effective returns. At present, the biggest performance bottleneck Construct experiences is with I/O, specifically latency from accessing disks in a random pattern. This week a few open opportunities for prefetch pipelines were taken, allowing the server to stream data directly from the disk to the client with minimal buffering. This was implemented in several places, mostly for the <code>/media/</code> system, and also for the <code>/members</code> lists, improving the performance of requesting the members of a room like #whalepool:ericmartindale.com .</p>
<p>There is one area though that requires a special mention for being an order of magnitude more impactful than any other area where a pipelined stream was placed. We have analyzed the way Riot conducts a room change, and by the simple placement of a prefetch operation when the server receives an <code>im.vector.breadcrumb_rooms</code>, which comes early during the room change, Construct is able to populate the room's timeline significantly faster. That has a compounding effect, as the browser initiates several requests based on (and after) the received timeline data- meaning those responses come significantly faster.</p>
<p>Construct is the community driven Matrix server written in C++ for maximum performance. Swing by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net">#test:zemos.net</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/</a> for more.</p>

This week, lots of hacking but not much in the way of news. We‚Äôve been focusing on more privacy improvements as well as polishing up the SAML integration.

<blockquote>
<p>Presenting <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/bridges/famedly-email-bridge">famedly-email-bridge</a>, a new email bridge! It is still early in development but can already send and receive emails.</p>
<p>Features so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receive emails by a prefix (e.g. <code>matrix_sorunome@myserver.com</code>, <code>matrix_otheruser@myserver.com</code>)</li>
<li>Send emails with said prefix</li>
<li>Receiving emails parses plain body, html body and attachments</li>
<li>Sending emails collects all messages for a given amount of time. After that it creates an email based on that! Supports edits, redactions and files (image, video, audio, file)!</li>
</ul>
<p>Things planned for the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Route emails to channels based on threading (reply-chain)</li>
<li>Send emails by making a new channel and inviting an email ghost and just sending messages!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="irc-bridge-progress-postgres">IRC bridge progress: postgres</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My other news that I forgot to mention is that I have a branch of the IRC bridge that runs off postgres, rather than flat file storage. It's much less memory/cpu intensive and might even offer a bit of a speedup :)</p>
<p>For ref: The current room/user store files for the freenode bridge take up 250MB when stored to disk. The existing storage system works on the principle of loading the whole datastore into memory and periodically saving to disk. Hopefully by <em>not</em> requiring the bridge to load all the state into memory, there are savings to be made.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>mautrix-telegram v0.6.1 has been released, no changes since the release candidates two weeks ago. mautrix-telegram v0.7.0 is scheduled to be released within 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Also, there's a WhatsApp business API bridge using Twilio in development, though I'm guessing most people won't have any use for that.</p>

<li>Scale avatar images when font size is increased/decreased with Ctrl and +/-. Below is a screenshot of Continuum with UI scaled to be 67% larger.</li>
<li>After signing-in, open the messaging view each time it's launched instead of showing the login view and requiring one extra click.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krombel:msg-net.de">krombel</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It might be interesting to some of you that the F-Droid repo for RiotX is finally working again.
There was an issue with buildkite which in the end led to the situation that the built apk had a lower versionCode as the apps already in the repo. The repo was then &quot;intelligent enough&quot; to no offer it as update.
benoit was able to resolve that so the repos are updating again.</p>

<p>MAJOR milestone for <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> this week!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Twimians! After many weeks of creativity, pain, and slack, the bridge team are proud to present our first release candidate for the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc1">slack bridge</a>. This release brings in a ton of new changes that should massively improve the slack&lt;-&gt;matrix experience. The headline features are Postgres support, Puppeting, RTM (websocket) support as well as an entirely refactored codebase written in Typescript.</p>
<p>This release has made heavy changes to the schema of the slack bridge and as such we are not recommending that anyone upgrade their existing slack bridge instances to 1.0.0-rc1. A migration script is currently being worked on, but for the time being <strong>existing installs</strong> should not be upgraded to 1.0.0 release candidates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi all! I haven't been around much because our homeserver chugs a little when federation is enabled, but I've got a few updates to share about Scylla, the Elm-based web client for Matrix:</p>
<ol>
<li>There have been a few optimization changes. The naive Elm approach leads to recomputing room names and usernames on every keystroke, which causes huge performance issues in rooms with many users (like #freenode_#haskell!). The new versions of Scylla avoid recomputing room names and message HTML, leading to much better performance in large rooms and rooms where a lot of history is loaded.</li>
<li>The recommended fixes in the spec regarding flickering have been implemented, and messages should no longer flicker.</li>
<li>&quot;m.notice&quot; and &quot;m.emote&quot; events are now supported</li>
<li>There has been a minor visual update to make the interface look a little more consistent and professional.</li>

<p>Had some free time and ideas this week, so I've improved my <a href="https://github.com/ananace/matrix-releasetracker">release tracking bot</a> to now correctly handle repos mixing full releases as well as tags (lightweight and/or annotated). GitHub's API really sucks in the tags department, so this required a rework to GraphQL queries instead, and it's looking good on that so far.
The bot currently still only handles tracking all starred repos of a given account on GitHub, but I'm working on GitLab support, as well as support for tracking arbitrary repos. And a provisioning API is also somewhere on the roadmap,</p>

<p>This week privacy items have dominated, but we‚Äôve also been edging towards getting our room directory improvements out, shipping a new configuration creator and making further progress on the federation side bus project to improve performance of smaller instances.</p>
<p>We also deployed open tracing on matrix.org, which will help a lot in tracking down all sorts of strange behaviour in the wild and fixing some bugs in the sqlite -&gt; postgres migrator.</p>

To find out the list of rooms for a user, simply open the room directory in Riot and type a user mxid starting with @...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Construct is implementing the concept of invisibility for users:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exact mechanism for invisibility is not completely finished but there are obviously some limitations for this feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only users who are local to the server can set any kind of invisibility. Remote users are always fully listed. One day when the spec has &quot;user's rooms&quot; we would be glad to adhere to an <code>m.user.invisible</code>-etc configuration state event in such a room</li>
<li>Since there is no federation support for user's rooms list publication, the rooms list for a user is limited to what the server knows (rooms it has seen the user in).</li>
</ul>
<p>Construct is eager to implement any MSC's regarding user room and group membership listing over the federation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Updated login page appearance</li>
<li>Added validation to user ID and server address fields</li>
<li>The server address gets automatically filled with <code>https://</code> followed by server name when user ID is being typed</li>
<li>After signing in, the token and server address are automatically saved</li>
<li>Added progress indicator when being signed in. It doesn't block user from controlling Continuum,  pressing Esc will cancel the signing-in process.</li>
<li>Speed up application start-up by drawing the window and opening the database in parallel. Now the window typically appears within half a second with its size and position on screen restored to be the same as the last time it was opened. The most recently used accounts get loaded and automatically filled within a second.</li>
<li>Added drop shadow effect to scroll-to-latest-messages button to increase contrast</li>
<li>Fix: Always retry synchronization after getting a network error. Previous versions didn't retrieve new messages in a timely manner when the network is unreliable. A delay is added if the error is not a time-out to avoid stressing the homeserver.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I made a few spec proposals: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2244">MSC2244: Mass redactions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2246">MSC2246: Asynchronous media uploads</a>. Mass redactions are useful for fighting spam (and bridging telegram deletions) more efficiently. Asynchronous media uploads would make it possible for bridges (like telegram) to handle messages synchronously and thus keep message ordering without blocking all messages behind some media upload.</p>

<p>Jason from Construct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct added support for server notice rooms. As the server administrator I've placed quick access to the server control room for myself in this section.</p>
<p>Construct has also added support for the server-side commands <code>\\read &lt;room-tag&gt;</code>, for example <code>\\read m.low_priority</code> will mark all low-priority tagged rooms as read. The command <code>\\read *</code> also will mark all rooms as read.</p>
<p>Also, we now allow users to configure whether they transmit typing events by setting state events in their home-room. If a user creates an event with the <code>type</code> of <code>ircd.typing.disable.send</code> and the <code>state_key</code> of the room_id, typing events will not be sent to that room for them. Further variations exist, such as <code>ircd.typing.disable.sync</code> to prevent the client from receiving typing events for a particular room or all rooms.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Slack bridge has had a whole week of care applied to it. We've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/152">switched the bridge entirely over to Typescript</a>, and overhauled large parts of the codebase to make future work easier (for ex, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/185">using the Slack node library rather than request calls</a>). If that's not exciting enough, we've also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/164">added support for the RTM API</a>, which means the bridge can use websockets when talking to slack. This gives us nice things like typing updates, and the ability to deploy without needing a webserver to listen for events. Release 1.0 is imminent, but before then we are hoping to land <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/186">Postgresql support</a> so that the bridge can scale up to meet the high demands placed upon it.</p>

<p>This week we‚Äôve been working on getting our brand new room directory implementation ready, creating a new Synapse installer, and creating a TURN server testing tool. We‚Äôve also been pushing on with the privacy project and fixing up some bugs and perf issues.<br />
Next week it‚Äôs all about getting the room directory out of the door, shipping the installer and continuing on with the privacy project. We are in the early stages of a project designed to reduce the load caused by outbound SSL connections, it is looking very promising. We‚Äôre also going to give the sqlite-&gt;postgres porting script some love as well as working on some message retention ideas, and also ways to reduce the meta data we store.</p>

<p>Huge update from Andrew:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week‚Äôs stats for Dendrite are in! <strong>4 authors</strong> have pushed <strong>11 commits</strong> to master and <strong>11 commits</strong> to all branches. On master, <strong>48 files</strong> have changed and there have been <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/compare/master@%7B1564757067%7D...master">676 additions and 146 deletions</a>.</p>
<p>Of note are the following merged PRs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/693">Implement client single event retrieval - #671</a>
<ul>
<li>You can now request a single event from Dendrite‚Äôs DB, assuming you have permission to view it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/513">Account data events filtering database API</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/438">State events filtering database api</a>
<ul>
<li>Very old PRs from CromFR have been updated and finally merged! These lay the groundwork for providing filters across various API endpoints (used in search, /sync, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/692">Add typingserver service to docker-compose</a>
<ul>
<li>Another fairly old PR by <a href="https://github.com/viccuad">viccuad</a> (their first for Dendrite!) finally reviewed and merged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/706">Fix permission and 404 response for alias deletion - #654</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/774">Replace membership and visibility values with constants</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/726">Implement profile retrieval over federation - fixes #651</a> (this one is very useful), and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/772">Fix transaction IDs in transaction cache have global scope</a>
<ul>
<li>A myriad of changes and fixes by cnly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have a number of PRs that were moved forward but not merged. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/405">Add auth fallback endpoint</a> (our oldest PR at the moment!) which we mentioned last week is so very close, but not quite there in time for this TWIM.</p>
<p>In terms of passing Sytests, Dendrite now passes <strong>172 tests</strong>, up from <strong>167</strong> last week. This is out of <strong>761 tests</strong> in total. So just a small bump (0.6%), but note that things that are crucial for Dendrite development at the moment, such as federating, only cover a small subset of tests, so each passing one can bring us much closer to getting Dendrite usable day-to-day.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>From Neil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The big news this week we‚Äôve landed some massive DB improvements (https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/5706) which should make message sending on matrix.org (and any other server) feel noticeably snappier. :) It'll be in the next release.</p>
<p>Outside of perf, we‚Äôve also been continuing with our privacy project, sydent now supports hashing third party identifiers instead of storing the raw form, and in the coming week we‚Äôll look at minimising the meta data we store. You can track our progress across the full project here (<a href="https://vector-im.github.io/feature-dashboard/#/plan?label=privacy-sprint&amp;repo=matrix-org/synapse&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-web&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-ios&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-android&amp;repo=vector-im/riotX-android&amp;repo=matrix-org/matrix-doc&amp;repo=matrix-org/sydent">https://vector-im.github.io/feature-dashboard/#/plan?label=privacy-sprint&amp;repo=matrix-org/synapse&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-web&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-ios&amp;repo=vector-im/riot-android&amp;repo=vector-im/riotX-android&amp;repo=matrix-org/matrix-doc&amp;repo=matrix-org/sydent</a>)</p>
<p>Work continues on our installer to make it easier to configure Synapse and we‚Äôll be looking for some community feedback rsn. The room directory revamp is now very close and we hope to have something live on matrix.org in about a week.</p>
<p>Finally we‚Äôre working on improving the efficiency of smaller instances sending messages into large rooms, we‚Äôre still at the design stage, but it will make a huge difference for anyone self hosting.</p>

<p>If you fancy running highly experimental software on your homeserver which might break things, I have two things for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-key-server">matrix-key-server</a> ( #matrix-key-server:t2bot.io ) is an implementation of a Matrix key server with notary support. Although it follows the specification, it has not been tested against Synapse. It is however fully featured: check it out on the federation tester ( <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/#keys.t2host.io">https://federationtester.matrix.org/#keys.t2host.io</a> ) or by querying it yourself ( <a href="https://keys.t2host.io/_matrix/key/v2/query/matrix.org">https://keys.t2host.io/_matrix/key/v2/query/matrix.org</a> ).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-room-directory-server">matrix-room-directory-server</a> ( #matrix-room-directory:t2bot.io ) is less experimental than the key server but is still very early days. Currently it only offers the ability to manipulate the federated public room directory for your server, but in future it is planned to be its own standalone directory server (room aliases without having to run a whole homeserver). Check it out by searching the t2bot.io room directory from your client.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been making big updates to two of his bridges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> can now bridge formatting, mentions, replies and reactions in both directions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also a logout command now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>'s switch to <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python">mautrix-python</a> is nearly finished (i.e. it didn't cause any errors for the past few days when testing in production). The main reason for the switch is using one Matrix library for all my python bridges. It also means the bridging code like double puppeting and command handling I shared between mautrix-facebook and mautrix-hangouts is now also used in mautrix-telegram.</p>
<p>Visible changes directly caused by using mautrix-python:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logs are now colorful.</li>
<li>Python 3.5 is no longer supported.</li>
<li>The bridge will refuse to start without access to the base config file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes that happened during the switch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telegram &quot;Saved Messages&quot; can now be bridged even when using double puppeting.</li>
<li>Mentions on Telegram are marked as read when using double puppeting (messages were already being marked as read, but mentions weren't).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, this actually happened last week and the week before that, but anyway: I've moved the CI and docker registry of my active projects to a self-hosted GitLab at <a href="https://mau.dev">mau.dev</a>.
Specifically, the CI/docker registry for all four mautrix bridges and maubot and automatic builds for gomuks have been moved. My maubot plugins also have automatic .mbp builds in the CI. For the docker registry, prepending <code>dock.mau.dev/</code> to the existing image names will work.
The old places (docker hub, dl.maunium.net) won't get new builds anymore. The repos on GitHub are still the &quot;canonical&quot; repos, but they're mirrored more or less instantly with <a href="https://github.com/tulir/maumirror">maumirror</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> will probably get some sort of history filling in the near-ish future</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm going to add some way to put bridged rooms into personal communities for filtering purposes. Not yet sure if it'll be fully built into the bridges or some kind of an external script</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've just released <a href="https://github.com/devture/email2matrix">Email2Matrix</a> - an SMTP server that can relay incoming messages over to Matrix based on mappings defined in a configuration file.</p>
<p>While it can also be installed standalone and work with any Matrix homeserver (see its documentation), the simplest way to install it is using <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-email2matrix.md">guide for Email2Matrix installation</a>.</p>
<p>The configuration process (users, rooms, mappings) is quite manual, but it's simple and has worked well for me for the past year and a half.
I've only just polished it up a bit, released and integrated with the Ansible playbook, so others could benefit from it too.</p>

Bot have such logic:</p>

<li>user add bot to room (for example room with whatsapp bridge users - now bridge support adding bot to such rooms)</li>
<li>bot listen room, and when get voice-message - send it to Yandex-cloud for translate (now support only Russian language).</li>
<li>When translating is success - bot get result text and show it in room as notice, such: &quot;Username said: text&quot;</li>

<h3 id="neo-huge-update">Neo huge update!</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@joepie91:pixie.town">joepie91</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lots of news about <a href="https://neo.pixie.town/app/">Neo</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li>There's now an additional maintainer (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@joepie91:pixie.town">joepie91</a>)!</li>
<li>A lot of the internals have been refactored, so they should be more maintainable and reliable going forward. Also some future work planned on refactoring the state handling using Redux, which should make it <em>much</em> faster to fix issues and add new features in the future. There are even some ideas already for a future plugin API!</li>
<li>Display has been improved in a lot of places. Error messages are now more clearly formatted, images in reply-quotes are now shown as thumbnails rather than just a filename, and the reply-to popup now shows the full event that you're replying to properly. The chat window now correctly sticks to the bottom when you're scrolled to the end and receive new messages, even when an image or video loads - though per-room scroll position restoration isn't done yet.</li>
<li>There's now an experimental compact mode! It uses a more IRC-client-like layout for messages, and generally just fits more content onto the screen. It can be enabled with an <a href="https://git.pixie.town/neo/neo#experimental-features">experimental flag</a>. A screenshot of the compact mode can be found <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2dLyQ49.png">here</a>.</li>

<p>We‚Äôve also been having some success in improving database performance and hope to ship that rsn so everyone can benefit.</p>
<p>Next week</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The GSoc project ‚ÄúMatrix Visualisations‚Äù has continued its progression during the second period:</p>
<p>A ‚Äúmulti-view‚Äù has been implemented for the frontend application. It means that it is now possible to independently view multiple DAGs at the same time in the same canvas. It can be useful for observing the same DAG but on different HS‚Äôs, at the same time. The only current limitation is that you have to use the same backend for every view (with CS API or with the backend talking to a Synapse PostgreSQL database). This change took a long time as it required to make a lot of changes in the code.</p>
<p>The implementation of the support of the Federation API within the backend is in progress. It is slowly progressing as it needed some discussion before starting the work on it and its implementation requires me to become familiar with a lot of new things, regarding the federation process and the authentication of requests between HS‚Äôs.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a>, project lead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version has been pushed to F-droid and TestFlight!</p>
<p>Note that for TestFlight the new version will be available in a few days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve scrolling through chat messages!
<ul>
<li>Messages are now paginated under the hood, before the whole message list was rebuild when loading more messages, causing a jittery scrolling experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support typing notifications!
<ul>
<li>Typing notifications are shown and send while typing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add chat settings screen
<ul>
<li>Currently you can see the chat name, avatar, description and members. More will be added in the future.</li>
<li>You can go to the chat settings screen by clicking on the title of the chat. This'll probably change in the future (at least to be easier).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reverse swipe direction of images (thanks Nathan!)</li>
<li>Fix ripple not showing on send button</li>
<li>Make UI refreshing more efficient</li>
<li>The App Store (iOS) name is now 'Pattle' instead of 'Pattle IM'</li>
<li>When a chat is open, the UI will only be rebuild if <em>that</em> chat has updates.</li>
<li>Lot's of code clean ups and improvements, mostly in the SDK</li>
</ul>

<p>What's coming up?</p>

<li>A release on Google Play!</li>
<li>A release on the official F-droid repo!</li>
<li>Remove Cupertino specific styling on iOS
<ul>
<li>Will now use Material Design, but altered for iOS. Having the discrepancy between Cupertino and Material was also the reason why some things didn't show up in iOS or why some things would be blue instead of the Pattle red.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@SolarDrew:matrix.org">SolarDrew</a> and I have been working on re-writing our <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/skill-picard">Picard Bot</a> for a conference next week. Picard helps you bridge between a slack team and a matrix community.</p>
<p>This second version of Picard adds support for reacting to creation of new rooms on slack in real time as well as implementing a set of commands for creating new bridged rooms from either matrix or slack. In addition to this, Picard has matrix commands for inviting you to all the bridged rooms in the communtiy and automatically inviting you to new rooms as they are created. Finally, we have added support for sending welcome messages to all new members of your slack team or matrix community in a DM with the bot, which we are using to explain the chat setup to users and giving them a private place to issue commands.</p>
<p>This is uses <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/skill-picard">matrix-appservice-slack</a> for actually sending events in bridged rooms, and PIcard itself is a skill for the <a href="https://opsdroid.readthedocs.io/">opsdroid</a> bot framework #opsdroid-general:matrix.org  and uses the <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/database-matrix/">matrix-database</a> plugin for opsdroid which uses matrix room state to back the opsdroid memory.</p>

<p>It's all coming together now. While all pieces of the puzzle were roughly there, now they are put into the big picture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/pull/111">bridge SDK PR</a> has been merged to develop, now providing bridges the benefit of error reporting. The modifications to the SDK are non-breaking, but activation of the feature requires small changes to the bridge using it. But be warned, everything is still under an unstable prefix and rightly so ‚Äì the implementation is still subject to change.
&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The MSC didn't get much love in public, but the concepts required to evolve it are taking shape. It was contemplated to piggyback on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1410">MSC 1410: Rich Bridging</a> and to add a retry mechanism. So heads up for more to come on this front.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3246">display of bridge errors</a> in Riot Web is now a PR and in the state of getting its last few kinks removed. It will start to be available under a lab flag soon.</p>
<p>With everything getting to play together nicely, there will be the first rooms enabling bridge errors to test the code in the wild. Stabilizing the code for everyday use and getting the MSC into a respectable form are the next goals for the project. Those will help in fostering broader adoption among bridges and clients.</p>

We have a number of community PRs still with active members, but most are waiting for reviews, which <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> is working towards.</p>
<h4 id="the-plan">The Plan</h4>
<p>A couple TWIMs ago we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/05/this-week-in-matrix-2019-07-05">teased</a> that Dendrite had a plan in the works. Well one meeting later and here is the proposal:</p>
<p>It will take a while for Dendrite to become feature complete with Synapse, but we‚Äôd like people to be able to actually use Dendrite before then. Instead of waiting for feature-completeness, we propose a set of milestones for Dendrite development to reach and prioritize development for.</p>
<p>These milestones are currently listed on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/milestones">Dendrite‚Äôs github</a>. The first is ‚ÄúBot Hosting‚Äù, which means, once complete, Dendrite would be suitable as a ‚Äúbot hub‚Äù, allowing server admins to run massive bridges on top of Dendrite while taking advantage of its horizontal-scaling capabilities. As written in the description, this goal includes basic CS API support, as well as federation with other homeservers. At this stage Dendrite should already be usable in rooms with other Synapse servers, which should make it a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>After that is several more milestones, each representing another use case that Dendrite can fill.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt be alarmed at the currently quite small percentage of completeness, as these milestones have just been built from the open issue list. We‚Äôre actually quite far along to #1 already :)</p>
<p>We also want to mention that the milestones aren‚Äôt completely built yet - there‚Äôs still a few more issues to comb through. It‚Äôs taken a few days as <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> can‚Äôt help himself to fix things as he goes along. A few open issues have also been closed as they had already been fixed earlier.</p>
<p>This is all mentioned in this week‚Äôs Matrix Live above by the way, so be sure to catch for some extra details if you‚Äôre interested.</p>
<p>We look forward to shipping you a working Dendrite soon‚Ñ¢. And as always feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!yjVgJUsMLYLAONsoii:jki.re?via=matrix.org&amp;via=privacytools.io&amp;via=ru-matrix.org">#dendrite-dev:matrix.org</a> for discussion.</p>
