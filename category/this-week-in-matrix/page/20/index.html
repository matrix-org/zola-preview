<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Working furiously towards an r0 spec release. Event ids as hashes (MSC 1659) and S2S API certificates (MSC 1659 ) are very close now - see <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8</a> to track our progress.</li>
 	<li>Since <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1711">MSC1711</a> is a breaking change, we will initially ship our next release (v0.35.0) with ACME support to make it easy to provision and renew certificates. The give everyone a month to upgrade and install a cert before we ship Synapse v1.0 which will require that servers have certificates in order to federate. Don't worry, there will be plenty of details on the steps necessary for admins when v0.35.0 lands - watch this space.</li>
 	<li>Finally a raft of db performance improvements, room version upgrade bug fixes, as well taking a look at room directory and user directory efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="matrix-puppet-slack">matrix-puppet-slack</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@root:thomasprofitt.com">tom</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack">matrix-puppet-slack</a> version 1.10.1 has been released, thanks again to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack/commits?author=twouters">@twouters</a></p>
<ul>
 	<li>The bridge could not create new Matrix rooms on versions of Synapse after a certain change, because it did not reserve the room alias prefix it used. That's been fixed, but anyone currently running matrix-puppet-slack will need to edit their slack_registration.yaml and restart Synapse. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack/releases/tag/1.10.1">the Release</a> for instructions on doing so.</li>
 	<li>The bridge will no longer send "Edit: " events when Slack sends it a "message_changed" message, if the message text has not actually changed (Slack sends these events for URL previews, for example, but this just causes duplicate bridged messages). This fix has been a long time coming.</li>

<h2 id="matrix-corporal">matrix-corporal</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal">matrix-corporal</a> <a href="https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal/releases/tag/1.3.0">1.3.0</a> was released.<br />It uses a new Matrix API for fetching account data (Synapse &gt;0.34.1 is required), so it performs reconciliation quicker than before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reconciliation is now much faster, due to the way we retrieve account data from the Matrix server (no longer doing <code>/sync</code>).<br />From now on, the minimum requirement for running matrix-corporal is Synapse v0.34.1, as it's the first Synapse release which contains the new API we require (<code>GET /user/{'{'}user_id{'}'}/account_data/{'{'}account_dataType{'}'}</code>).</p>

<h2 id="neo-client">Neo client</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:lain.haus">f0x</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://git.lain.haus/f0x/iris">Neo</a> is still in the GUI component design stage (the best stage to get involved with feedback!). I have implemented the jdenticon library for avatars, autoscrolling when there are new events, and I've added the Rust code of conduct. <a href="https://git.lain.haus/f0x/iris">https://git.lain.haus/f0x/iris</a><br />General vision for this project is to first get as much gui done as possible, before diving in the backend. This will be split into a separate module, with the gui component being as protocol-agnostic as possible, to allow different backend modules for XMPP or IRC as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> was recently updated to have support for Application Services, and is a lighter alternative to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">matrix-js-sdk</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cl-matrix">cl-matrix</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnu_ponut:matrix.org">Gnuxie</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/cl-matrix">cl-matrix</a> and I think now it might be in a good condition to talk about it.
<a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/cl-matrix">cl-matrix</a> is a WIP client library written in common lisp, most of the API endpoints have been covered using macros that allow you to copy straight from the spec, here is an example using the send event endpoint:</p>
<pre><code class="lisp language-lisp">(define-matrix-endpoint room-send-event (:put)
  ("rooms" room-id "send" event-type txn-id))
</code></pre>
<p>this will expand into a function with the signature:</p>
<pre><code class="lisp language-lisp">(PUT-ROOM-SEND-EVENT AUTHENTICATION ROOM-ID EVENT-TYPE TXN-ID CONTENT &KEY PARAMETERS)
</code></pre>
<p>it also has some basic events defined using <a href="http://shinmera.github.io/deeds/">deeds</a> that can be issued using the sync endpoint.</p>

<p>This week I chatted with Jason Robinson about all things decentralisation, especially his projects <a href="https://github.com/jaywink/socialhome">socialhome</a>, <a href="https://the-federation.info/">the-federation.info</a>, and <a href="https://feneas.org">feneas.org</a>. Jason has been interested in decentralisation for many years, and had a lot to say about how we can look forward to a more decentralised Internet.</p>

<p>It's a New Year and there have been a lot of improvements to the <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> playbook:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>there's now support for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/docs/importing-postgres.md">importing an existing Postgres database</a>, which should make it easier for people with another setup to migrate over.</li>
 	<li>there's now support for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/docs/configuring-playbook-ssl-certificates.md">manually-managed and self-signed certificates</a>, in addition to the Let's Encrypt support we've always had</li>
 	<li>the playbook now uses a much better (20x smaller, faster) riot-web Docker image (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/avhost/docker-matrix-riot/">avhost/docker-matrix-riot</a> -&gt; <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bubuntux/riot-web/">bubuntux/riot-web</a>). At least until <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/7771">vector-im/riot-web#7771</a> gets merged and official images become available.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#bc-break-mxisd-configuration-changes">completely redone</a> way of generating mxisd configuration, letting people unleash the full power of mxisd without us having to explicitly add support for new features</li>
 	<li>mxisd 1.3.0-ready. We default to a stable mxisd release still (1.2.2), but people can try the much-improved 1.3.0 alpha releases even now (e.g. <code>matrix_mxisd_docker_image: "kamax/mxisd:1.3.0-alpha.2"</code>).</li>
 	<li>we now utilize <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/blob/4185b644b7b69af36bb1fdc81976a36590b1b97f/docs/features/directory.md">mxisd's User Directory Search feature</a> to augment the results coming from Synapse</li>
 	<li>the playbook has been <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#splitting-the-playbook-into-multiple-roles">split into multiple roles</a> (one role per component) and the <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#bc-break-making-the-playbooks-roles-more-independent-of-one-another">roles have been made independent of one another</a>. People who want to re-use our roles in their own playbooks can now more-easily do so.</li>
 	<li>even more components have become optional and can now be turned off completely (coturn, mailer)</li>
</ul>
Lots of thanks go to Maximus, jcgruenhage and Cadair for helping out!

<p>libQMatrixClient 0.4.2 has been released, fixing a security issue (the library could be tricked into altering the local room state by fake state events - those without state_key). The master branch of the library is updated as well - it is strongly recommended to update to either 0.4.2 or master, depending on which branch you live on.</p>

<p>v1.10.0 fixes Matrix-to-Slack image upload, and no longer sends markdown-formatted @-mention links in the plaintext body of Matrix events; instead, it uses plaintext username the way text-only clients traditionally have it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The version bump is also the project's 100th commit, and I've updated the supported feature checklist in the README to paint a more comprehensive picture of what is and isn't supported, and link out to the GitHub Issues for some of the unsupported features, in hopes of making life easier for users and encouraging contributions.</p>

Migration is performed by uploading an exported copy of an existing HipChat workspace so that the tool can automatically re-create all of the users and rooms (including messages and attachments) on your new Matrix homeserver. Once the migration is complete all of the migrated users will be emailed with login instructions, so that they can seamlessly continue chatting where they left off in HipChat. If your organisation (or if you know of an organisation that) has not yet decided what to do when Stride &amp; HipChat is discontinued next month, come and try Modular!</p>

<p>People have been generally happy about the flood of new issues following the completion of the internal audit last week, and a few folks have been opening PRs addressing some of the “good-first-issues” labeled ones, which has been amazing to see, including fixing room joins and a couple of default variables.

<p>On my end, this week mainly consisted in reviewing most of these PRs (and merging them when that was possible), while <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> worked on making Dendrite's CI more complete and reliable, especially by configuring it to run <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">sytest</a> against Dendrite which will allow us to better track its compliance to the Matrix specification.</p>

<p>As noted in <a href="https://xmpp.org/2019/01/the-xmpp-newsletter-4-january-2019/">The XMPP Newsletter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today is Jabber's 20th anniversary! Jabber would later be standardized and renamed to XMPP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this subject, it's always worth thinking about the importance of openness and interoperability in messaging. This <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/lessons-vendor-lock-messaging">recent article in Linux Journal</a> is a reminder of the need to avoid proprietary vendor lock in, and mentions both XMPP and Matrix.</p>

<p>It's the 28th of December as I write this, and I hope you had a good year. Long as it is, I recommend reading <a href="/blog/2018/12/25/the-2018-matrix-holiday-special/">Matthew's write-up of the year</a>, as it covers a lot of ground!</p>
<p>Many of the core team have been out of the office this week, but there are still plenty of updates to share from the Matrix ecosystem!</p>
<h2 id="mxisd-v1-2-2">mxisd v1.2.2</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> released mxisd v1.2.2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a> had a Holiday-special release: <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.2.2">v1.2.2</a> before v1.3.0.</p>
<p>This release introduces two new big features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Username login rewriting via 3PID to allow advanced flows, like bypassing the synapse restriction of having numerical usernames for non-guest users</li>
 	<li>Support for multiple Base DNs for LDAP backends</li>
</ul>
Work has started on v1.3.0 so this is definitely the last release before a non-backward compatible release.

<p><a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma-desktop">koma-desktop</a> is updated to JavaFx 11 and installation is simplified. Dependencies, including native modules can be packaged into one single file, which only needs to be downloaded and run. Java Runtime 11 is the only runtime dependency. Now it's just cross-compilation that needs to be set up before packaged releases can be provided for Mac, Windows, and Linux users.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:feneas.org">Jason Robinson</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started work on a Prometheus Alertmanager bot for Matrix. The basic idea is that Alertmanager can send webhook alert events to the bot which will then send the formatted events to configured rooms based on the alert receiver. It works, but is still early work in progress. See code and info here: <a href="https://git.feneas.org/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager">https://git.feneas.org/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager</a>.</p>

<p><a href="@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre Franke</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As expected the Fractal team released 4.0 and is already hard at work on the next micro version. We recommend <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Fractal">getting it from Flathub</a> like we usually do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Enhanced history view with adaptive layout, day divider</li>
 	<li>Reorganised headerbar, app menu merged with user menu</li>
 	<li>Larger display of emoji-only messages</li>
 	<li>Some performance improvements</li>
 	<li>Opening a room jumps to first unread message</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The new command handling system in maubot is ready. The new system should be much nicer to use when developing plugins.</p>
<p>Previously <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a> had a system that was designed after the improved bot support spec proposal, but it wasn't very nice or pythonic. If/when the proposal or something similar goes through, I'll probably add support for it in the new command handling system.</p>
<p>Next I'll make some developer docs so that other people could actually make their own plugins.</p>
<p>The code is at <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">https://github.com/maubot/maubot</a> and you can ask about maubot in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#maubot:maunium.net">#maubot:maunium.net</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/apps/matrix-to">https://github.com/apps/matrix-to</a> is a Github App which makes use of their shiny and new Content Attachments API/Webhook. When a <code>matrix.to</code> or <code>view.matrix.org</code> URL is used this app is activated. It adds a little snippet with the Room Title and Topic (if the room is peekable from matrix.org). In future it'll work for event permalinks, but currently there is no support for peeking context/event in Matrix API.</p>

<p>You may have seen that <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> been working fearlessly and tirelessly on bridges for many, many months. In this episode of Matrix Live Half-Shot chats with Matthew about his work, progress and achievements, with a focus on recent <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a> and XMPP work. Audio is not amazing, but worth listening to get acquainted with recent work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a> bridge gained a XMPP specific backend for better performance when you want to do just xmpp bridging. It's rather quick right now, and needs dogfooding.</p>

<p>Just a head's up that I've increased the storage capacity of the database. With current projections, the server should be good for another year or two.</p>
<p>The database is also 1ms closer to Synapse and has a faster CPU in it. It probably won't make a dent in speed on federation, but it is a step forward.</p>

<h2 id="this-week-in-ruma">This Week in Ruma</h2>
<p>We don't often get to feature news from <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">Ruma</a>, but this week there is an updated <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/this-week-in-ruma-2018-12-09/">This Week in Ruma</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ruma is not dead, however, and small improvements have continued over the last year. The Matrix spec has advanced quite a bit and many of the blocking issues for Ruma have been resolved. Rust's maturity is another story. async/await is still under development and this is the most significant blocking issue to progress on Ruma.</p>

<h2 id="maubot-new-tooling">maubot new tooling</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been working on tooling for <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>maubot got a command-line tool for building plugins and managing maubot instances. I also added some server-side stuff for easy registration of accounts in the management interface using synapse shared secrets, but the UI for that isn't ready.
Also, I'm planning on adding some kind of small Matrix client in the management interface for manually managing the added bot clients. That might lead to a separate library that could be used in other projects or embedded in websites.</p>

<p>Purism announced they are sponsoring <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a> development, starting with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@iamjsparber:matrix.org">Julian Sparber</a> working last month to improve the message view. You can <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2018/12/03/better-room-history-in-fractal/">read about his progress here</a>. Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before, there was a jarring cut when new messages were loaded, but now you can just scroll upward and older messages are loaded continuously.<br />The part I'm most excited about is the new &quot;new message divider&quot;. When the user opens a room they can directly start reading the conversation from the last seen message and they don't need to search for the new message divider. Not only has the UX gotten a lot better, but also the underlying code is much cleaner now.<br />I also spent some time on making message rendering faster. I replaced the RegExp with more efficient code, this made the rendering much faster (from ~10ms to ~ 1ms) for every single message.<br />In summary, all of these things improve Fractal's UX a lot and make it feel more like a modern messaging app.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Work on the Informo specifications has slowed down a bit in the last couple of weeks, though since the last update we did manage to get some relatively big SCSs merged into the specs, including <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/9">SCS #9</a> (rendered <a href="https://specs.informo.network/information-distribution/article/">here</a>) which specifies how information sources must publish their information through the federation, and <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/11">SCS #11</a> (rendered <a href="https://specs.informo.network/information-distribution/source/">here</a>) which describes how sources must register themselves in order to be picked up by clients, and handle localisation. ?<br />There's still a couple of big items to take care of before we can cut a 1.0 release of the Informo specs but this is definitely a huge step towards this goal.</p>

<p>Beer! And pizza! And also Redecentralize<br />We chatted to a nice bunch of folks both demoing their decentralized projects and talked to the likes of scuttlebutt, BBC, IPFS and more. Was a interesting experience having around 8 minutes to quickly explain to newcomers what Matrix is and why they should use it in a speed dating format. We chatted (and demoed) bridges, <a href="https://riot.im/experimental/">new-riot</a> and generally how it all fits together. There were a lot of very interesting people with different profiles and backgrounds, and diversified questions which lead to a lot of interesting discussions.</p>

<p><small>Note for the confused: the <em>format of the meetup</em> was comparable to speed dating. There is no suggestion that Matrix should be used at regular speed dating.

<h2 id="zerophone">ZeroPhone</h2>
<p>This week we learned about ZeroPhone, a fairly mature project aiming to <a href="https://wiki.zerophone.org/index.php/Main_Page">build a working cellphone on top of a Raspberry Pi Zero</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an open-source smartphone that can be assembled for 50$ in parts. It is Linux-powered, with UI software written in Python.
Currently, ZeroPhone is based on Raspberry Pi Zero, SIM800L GSM modem and 1.3&quot; OLED screen and button interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@adam:thebeckmeyers.xyz">&amp;Adam</a> was the first to bring it to our attention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I stumbled across this blog post which mentions a matrix app in a project to create an open, hackable phone out of a raspberry pi. It's old news at this point I guess, but I don't think I've seen it mentioned here, so I thought it might be a neat thing worth featuring: <a href="https://zerophone.github.io/newsletter/ZeroPhone-Weekly-No.-16/">https://zerophone.github.io/newsletter/ZeroPhone-Weekly-No.-16/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creator of the Matrix app, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@derivmug:matrix.org">derivmug</a> also arrived to tell us about his work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey everyone, I have been suggested to post about the <a href="https://wiki.zerophone.org/index.php/Main_Page">Zerophone project here</a>. I have written a basic matrix client for it. It's basically a simple phone based on a raspberry pi zero, focused on privacy, security and hackability.</p>

<p>The client app is built using the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a>, I'm also hoping to chat to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@derivmug:matrix.org">derivmug</a> as part of a future Matrix Live. <a href="https://github.com/ZeroPhone/ZPUI/tree/devel/apps/matrix">Take a look at the code here</a>.</p>
<p>Just to prove it's running on real hardware!</p>

<h2 id="the-federation-the-federation-info">The Federation (the-federation.info)</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:feneas.org">Jason Robinson</a> is passionate about Federated technology, and has been working on his site at <a href="https://the-federation.info/">https://the-federation.info/</a> for some time. He recently added Matrix to the list of protocols he scrapes and lists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrix (or more specifically, Synapse) servers are now visible on the The Federation info website at <a href="https://the-federation.info/matrix%7Csynapse">https://the-federation.info/matrix%7Csynapse</a>. The website collects lists of servers for various federation protocols (like Matrix, ActivityPub, Diaspora, etc). If a server outputs usage information, it also shows some historical information for servers and projects. Currently the information available from Synapse on the site is just version, availability of registrations and (obviously) domain name. If you want to register your server, check https://the-federation.info/info for more details. Tips also welcome on how to register other Matrix server projects and how to get more data out of servers.</p>

Hopefully it's now generic enough so that when mautrix-telegram switches to mautrix-python, it can drop most of the built-in HTML parser.</li>

<p>Bridge-of-the-week this week is <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</a>. Anyone in the dev room (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discord:half-shot.uk">#discord:half-shot.uk</a>) will be very aware of this as <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a> have spent the day testing <code>@room</code> notifications.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>matrix-appservice-discord received a lot of work these past days.
Not only the usual small bugfixes, but also some rather big changes:
The parsers for both Discord-&gt;Matrix sending and Matrix-&gt;Discord sending were re-written completely to properly handle things (and thus, at the same time, crunch a bunch of edge-case bugs!).
In addition, the long-awaited highlighting issues with @ everyone and @ here (on discord) and @ room (on matrix) were addressed.
Some of these things are still in PR stage, but expected to be merged soon!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> also provided a great screenshot of everything working well:</p>

<h2 id="spec-foundation">Spec &amp; Foundation</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Two workshops happened with the Foundation lawyers to work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318">MSC1318</a> - basically fleshing out a proposal for the details of the foundation governance in terms of how the Guardians (i.e. directors of the foundation board) should interact with the Core Spec Team to act as a back-stop - and working out how to port the MSC (once finished) into formal Articles of Association & adjunct documents. We'll get the workshop notes written up as a rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318">MSC1318</a> very shortly.</li>
 	<li>New MSCs from vdH on:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1721">MSC1721</a> Rename m.login.cas to m.login.sso</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1730">MSC1730</a> Mechanism for redirecting to an alternative server during login</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>…and an alternate to MSC1730: MSC1731 Mechanism for redirecting to an alternative server during SSO login.</li>
 	<li>These three SSO-related MSCs are derived from work being done for a large-scale Matrix deployment for a New Vector customer which we should be able to talk about in future. Improving SSO and other auth/identity work in Matrix is vital, and needless to say we're trying to ensure all the resulting work ends up in the spec to the benefit of the whole ecosystem :)</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a> has received a lot of updates in the last few weeks. Although mostly bug fixes and improvements, there's added support for streaming downloads from remote servers. This is mostly useful when someone posts a 100mb video in a room: previously the media repo would download the entire thing then send it over to you. Now it'll send you the video while it also caches it.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</h2>
<p>Big update from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> has received some updates in the past few weeks - fixing minor bugs, improving documentation, adding support for additional <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a>/<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web">Riot</a> features, etc.</p>
<p>Most notably (in oldest to most-recent order):</p>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> heard you like playbooks, so he made it possible to <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/commit/67e2bf285d44c0cb392ba1e28e615053b748c03c">run the playbook from another playbook</a>. Thanks Cadair!</li>
 	<li>some <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#bc-break-renaming-playbook-variables">configuration renaming</a> to make things more consistent. Most people would likely be unaffected.</li>
 	<li>support has been added for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#postgres-11-support">Postgres 11</a>. Upgrading is possible and easy (as a related success story, Aaron Raimist shared that he recently upgraded his ~40GB database)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#ssl-protocols-used-to-serve-riot-and-synapse">more flexible and more secure-by-default TLS configuration</a>. Thanks Aaron Raimist!</li>
 	<li>the ability to <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#customize-parts-of-riots-config">customize more parts of riot-web</a>. Thanks Aaron Raimist!</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#ability-to-set-synapse-log-levels">better control over Synapse logging</a>. Thanks Aaron Raimist!</li>
 	<li>the ability to <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#support-for-controlling-public-registration-and-room-auto-join">set up a public server</a> and the ability to make use of Synapse's \\"auto-join\\" feature. Until now, the playbook was only suited for setting up a private server, but with this, setting up public servers is now a possibility. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/anadahz">@anadahz</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm quite happy that the playbook is getting more contributions from others now and is improving in such diverse ways!</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com">#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:devture.com</a> support room in Matrix is now bridged to the <code>#matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</code> IRC Freenode channel, making it easier for people to get support when they don't have a working homeserver.</p>

<h2 id="smsmatrix">SMSMatrix</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@swedneck:swedneck.xyz">swedneck</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tijder/SmsMatrix">SMSMatrix</a> now has a room (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#smsmatrix:matrix.org">#smsmatrix:matrix.org</a>). SMSMatrix is a simple bridge between Matrix and SMS, developed by tijder. You install an android app and register a bot account which will invite you to direct chats under the name of anyone who sends you an SMS, which will then act as a normal SMS conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had a very quick play with this tool and it works great - a good way to quickly bridge SMS to Matrix.</p>

<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-android-redesign-PoC/tree/develop">Android rewrite is continuing in Kotlin</a> - lots of infrastructure work over the last few weeks</li>
 	<li>E2E key backups landed in Riot/iOS develop (but no UI yet, as we finalise the implementation first on Riot/Web)</li>
 	<li>E2E key backups also landed in Riot/Web develop (but with placeholder UI)</li>
 	<li>E2E key backups in dev on Riot/Android too (using Realm for storage!)</li>
 	<li>Lots of work from uhoreg on E2E cross-signing
</li>
 	<li>Work on the Riot/Web redesign paused for a week due to other commitments but as of Nov 26th we're back on the case again, making up for lost time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Most of the focus from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">Synapse</a> team this week has been on the new version using Python 3:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Py3 is finished, other than Debian packages - ongoing debate on whether they should use a virtualenv or depend on debian dependencies, and who should maintain them in a Py3 world…</li>
 	<li>Lots of running around on final Py3 bugs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has continued work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a>.</p>
<h2 id="modular">Modular</h2>

<ul>
 	<li>Modular now has full support for Custom DNS (letting you point your own SRV records at it)</li>
 	<li>Lots of work on a migration tool to allow folks to easily shift Matrix accounts between servers, as well as (in future) migrations from HipChat, Slack & others.</li>
</ul>
