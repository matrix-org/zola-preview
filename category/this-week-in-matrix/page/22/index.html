<p>No Ben this week. I'm afraid this means no matrix live, but fear not your Ben orientated programming will resume next week.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-have-happened">Things that have happened</h2>
<h2 id="riot-android">Riot Android</h2>
<ul>
<li>New Riot.im application has been delivered to the PlayStore:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app. It replaces the previous app. More details here: https://medium.com/@RiotChat/riot-im-android-security-update-2b3f655ad739</li>
<li>François and Benoit were at AndroidMakers Paris on Tuesday and Wednesday. We’ve seen plenty of interesting conferences and come back with many ideas to improve Riot UX/UI/Implementation/testing/etc.</li>
<li>SAS device verification review is over, will be merged once we have the tagged OLM library.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="riotx-android">RiotX (Android)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Valere has started working on reactions (which will be implemented only on RiotX for Android).</li>
<li>François has worked on merging membership Events in the timeline</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="riot-ios">Riot iOS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Interactive device verification has been merged</li>
<li>Jitsi and WebRTC updates have been merged</li>
<li>Fix bugs in order to prepare a release</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="crypto">Crypto</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg:matrix.org">uhoreg</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>olm 3.1.0 has been released. This release adds new functions to help with SAS-based key verification (a.k.a. emoji-based verification) and with cross-signing. The Python bindings are also now available on pypi, so you can install it using &quot;pip install python-olm&quot;, though you need the olm library and development files installed first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also</p>
<ul>
<li>Python-olm available on pypi.</li>
<li>Initial SAS verification support for nio.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spectral">Spectral</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> reports that:</p>
<p>Spectral's redesign continues, featuring a beautiful responsive UI(not kirigami yet, sorry) and more functionalities. Legacy UIs such as the room detail panel are changed to fit into redesigned UI better. Basic room upgrade support is added, allowing you to switch between the old room and the new room. Room settings and user detail dialogs are added. You can also ignore users in the user detail dialog.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-nsfw">matrix-nsfw</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> double header this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>matrix-nsfw has been ported from Golang to Rust. The backend machine learning framework is also switched to Tensorflow, giving a major performance boost. For anyone that doesn't know what matrix-nsfw is, it is a bot-like utility that detects NSFW images in a room. The new repo is at https://gitlab.com/b0/matrix-nsfw-rust</p>

<h2 id="ruma">Ruma</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jimmycuadra:matrix.org">Jimmy</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of Ruma's libraries (but not yet the homeserver itself) are now targeting stable Rust!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="continiuum">Continiuum</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uforia:matrix.org">yuforia</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If a room member is not visible on screen, updating their name doesn't require switching to the main UI thread</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Apply formatting when viewing the json source of an event</li>
<li>Reuse GUI components to improve performance, update content of views instead of creating new ones</li>
<li>Use a hash set to avoid going through the list of room members in some cases * Move more of local storage into the database: names and avatars of users and rooms, room membership, recently used accounts, etc.</li>
<li>Placeholder avatars are made with GUI components and instead of generated bitmap images</li>
<li>Switch to gradle multi-project build to modularize</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>After switching from plaintext files to an embedded database, some components are still in the process of being rewritten, coming next week: load messages from server on demand when scrolling, if they are not yet stored in database; add support for invitations;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de">Sorunome</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>matrix-appservice-discord work has finally resumed! The PRs for both migrating the room and user store to SQL have been merged, and many awesome new things should follow up soon!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>The reactions and edits API is taking shape, we’re making progress on our small homeserver setup, and we’re hunting a new set of device key management bugs that came to light in the absence of matrix.org.</p>
<p>We’ve been a bit disrupted these past few weeks, but work towards Synapse 1.0 continues and we’ll soon be ready to offer a release candidate.</p>
<h2 id="minivector">miniVector</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wtp2018:matrix.org">Curious Cat</a> reports that:
&gt;miniVector 0.8.29 is available on Goldy and Froid (and are unaffected by the Riot/Android <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/riot-im-android-security-update-2b3f655ad739">re-release drama</a>).</p>
<h2 id="the-incident">The 'Incident'</h2>
<p>We know you'll have a bunch of questions, we'll be publishing a full post-mortem next week. Thanks for bearing with us.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>
<p>See you next week, it will be Bentastic I can assure you. Be sure to stop by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> with your updates!</p>

<h3 id="github-tokens">Github tokens</h3>
<p>jaywink:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to the security incident, all GitHub access tokens for the Scalar GitHub integration were cleared. This means that if you have a GitHub bot in the channel and want to use the !github bot commands, you need to re-login to github via the integration manager menu. Note, existing webhooks are untouched and should work fine without re-authenticating.</p>

<p>From the matrix.org bridge team, we are resurrecting bridges as fast as possible. Currently running are the freenode, slack, gitter and gimpnet (now hosted on gnome.org) with more to come today and next week.<br />
We have the snoonet and oftc irc bridges back. Mozilla is coming soon hopefully this weekend too!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A big release of Pattle has just been pushed to the F-droid repo! Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display names are now shown</li>
<li>You can now click on chats and view them!</li>
<li>Messages are grouped by time and sender (see screenshots)</li>
<li>Add fancy transition animation and ripples to chat messages (see video)</li>
<li>Use Sentry for error reporting (only Android version and device model is sent, along with the stacktrace of the error)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, please note that if you have a matrix.org you probably have reinstall the app if you're logged in because of the recent matrix.org incident (because there's no logout button yet and no detection for invalidated access tokens)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has actually been a release since, which includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>message sending and viewing image history!</p>

<h2 id="neo">neo</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I reimplemented the matrix sdk into Neo, so it works nicer. Colors and font look nicer (base16-tomorrow, Open Sans), and there's text message sending, with localecho!<br />
I also fixed a bug where react would recycle displayname-components across rooms, attributing them to the wrong messages</p>

<h2 id="matrix-registration-update">matrix-registration update</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@zeratax:dmnd.sh">ZerataX</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it's been a long while, but I've finally come around to improving on matrix-registration<br />
For those of you, who have forgotten what this project is about, it basically lets you invite people to your homeserver with tokens, e.g. https://homeserver.tld/register?token=DoubleWizardSky<br />
This whole update was about making the project more user friendly.<br />
I made a new default registration page that requires 0 setup and you can install the project right from pypi with pip, so you don't even need to clone the repo any longer.<br />
check a live example  here: https://chat.dmnd.sh/register<br />
and to play around with the api you can can go over to the github page: https://zeratax.github.io/matrix-registration/demo.html?token=ColorWhiskeyExpand<br />

<h2 id="matrix-media-repo-now-has-s3-support">matrix-media-repo now has s3 support</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a> now has s3 (and s3-like) support, making it easier to archive older media or use minimal disk space. See the new datastores option in the config and the admin docs ( https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/blob/master/docs/admin.md#datastore-management ) for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="dimension">Dimension</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dimension has been updated to more safely handle when upstream integration managers (like Scalar) are offline. Instead of crashing or breaking in various ways, it'll report which integrations are not accessible.<br />
As well, due to recent events, if you use matrix.org bots or bridges in Dimension then go the the admin section and log everyone out using the red button. Dimension caches upstream tokens and isn't smart enough to realize that they are no longer valid, which means they need clearing. Clients should automatically handle getting new tokens in the background.</p>

<p>Last week we carried on with Synapse 1.0 work, in particular <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4364">server key signing validity</a>, a config option to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4967">verify federation certificates</a> to support MSC1711 and support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4982">3PID unbinding APIs</a> (MSC1915). Outside of that we've been thinking about how to improve room upgrades for private rooms and landed the preparatory work for a refactor of the room directory.</p>
<p>Coming up next, we'll continue to bash out 1.0 blockers, Hawkowl has started work on optimising for small hosted homeservers, and anoa will be working on the new super fast room directory. Finally Erik has started work on aggregations support so clients will be able to offer things like edits and reactions ?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com/">https://www.arewereadyyet.com/</a> is now just shy of 64%, keep going.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/pull/541">Dockerfile for sytest</a> running against Dendrite approved. Close to being able to run Dendrite against sytest. Also using sytest's new test white/blacklist functionality to include a list of tests that Dendrite is known to pass in the repo. When people make new PRs that allow Dendrite to pass new tests, they can also append the names of the tests to the testfile to help automatically track Dendrite's improving progress. Look forward to seeing further progress post Synapse 1.0.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This weekend I took a brief pause from doing matrix work, and then went back into it by finishing the feature set for the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/synapse-netcore-workers/pull/48">.NET Core Synchrotron</a>. It's &quot;feature complete&quot; meaning all specced features of sync are in this branch, excluding legacy endpoints. There are a few bugs logged against it and it's really only useful as a super early test, while I fix some of the p1 bugs.</p>
<p>The federation sender continues to be reliable and stable, and we are prepping for the release of synapse 0.99.3 which made a few changes to the replication stream.

<h2 id="pattle-has-now-moved-to-flutter">Pattle has now moved to Flutter</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a> has officially discontinued the previous version of Pattle, and is focused on their Flutter SDK and new version of Pattle based on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After some silence here but a lot of development, Pattle has now moved to Flutter. The new app is available in the same F-droid repository, you can just update. Note that you will have to log in again. If there are issues with updating, try removing the old app and installing the new one.</p>
<p>Also note that this version is still very basic and does not have all features of the old Pattle unfortunately. The reason that I chose to already replace it on the repo is that the old app will not receive updates anymore.</p>
<p>The current features are logging in and an overview of all chats. What <em>is</em> new is that data is now stored locally, so you won't have to do an initial sync everytime you open the app (which was the case with old app). What's also new is that I've decided to use more red, because.. I like red.</p>
<p>There is still a lot to do! Please notify me of anything that you think is missing, even though some things may be obvious (sorting chats based on date, chat avatars), some may not be as obvious to me!</p>
<p>If you'd like to contribute, the new repo is <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app">here</a>. Note that many contributions will probably start at the SDK level. Pattle uses my own Dart SDK, which you can find <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/library/matrix-dart-sdk">here</a>.</p>
<p>There is at the moment a very specific bug in Flutter, where on Android 7.1 with release builds, the app crashes when building a list widget. If you use Android 7.1 (like me) and you crash after logging in, that's the reason. It seems I can't do anything about it, sorry.</p>

<p>Neil, Synapse overseer, reports on the acceleration towards <em>1.0</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have much improved sytest support for Synapse worker mode, Hawkowl landed a brand new super fast super shiny user directory implementation, Brendan fixed a bunch of niggles in <a href="/federationtester">the federation tester</a> and we <em>finally</em> got to the bottom of our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4956">sync caching bug that obscured accepting invites</a> (thanks richvdh for sticking with it). Erik solved our presence spamming bug and anoa fixed some LDAP auth bugs and submitted a PR for certificate checking - one of our final blockers for Synapse 1.0. For all the latest checkout out our latest release candidate <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.3rc1">0.99.3rc1</a>.<br />
Next week, we'll ship 0.99.3, we'll be looking at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4364">server key validity periods</a>, adding a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1915">3PID unbind API</a> and starting work on tuning low powered Synapse installations.<br />
<a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com/">https://www.arewereadyyet.com/</a> is still rising so keep banging to everyone you know that they ensure their federation certificates are valid.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/poljar">poljar</a> gave this update on his new project <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a> is a new project that acts as a reverse proxy for clients to connect to. Once a client is connected Pantalaimon handles end to end encryption for the client transparently.<br />
The project is only a week old but already at a working prototype phase. A demo can be found here: <a href="http://webmshare.com/play/Qn4wg">http://webmshare.com/play/Qn4wg</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a huge gain! Use of this project, as you will see in the video, permits any Matrix client to support End-to-End encryption of messages, by handling encryption/decryption in a daemon rather than in the client.</p>
<p><a href="http://webmshare.com/play/Qn4wg">Watch the video</a>, and you'll see <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a>, which does not support encryption, chatting in an encrypted room.

<h2 id="construct">Construct</h2>
<p>Report from the Construct team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The matrix Construct server has made significant progress this week implementing the 1.0 specification and is very close to a 1.0 release! Special thanks to our star tester Yan Minari and expert Matrix consultants Tulir and Max and C++ developers Jason of Zemos and Mujx of nheko for all their hard work to make this happen. The Construct now fully supports IPv6 and is ready to participate in fully end-to-to-end encrypted ipv6 networks like <code>#yggdrasil:matrix.org</code> and <code>#cjdns:matrix.org</code>.<br />This week also saw additions for .well-known support, <code>m.fully_read</code> and even DNS caching inside a matrix room shared between servers (which is really cool if you ask me).</p>
<p>I'd like to recognize our testers for their invaluable contributions this week, only a fraction of which are documented here: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/issues">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/issues</a> leading to the 1.0 release.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Construct is written in C++ for maximum performance and scalability. It is the first fully federating server after the Synapse reference implementation.

<p>Neil, Synapse-dev wrangler #1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Huge thanks to everyone who has helped increase the number of ‘1.0 ready' synapse installs. If you don't know what this means, <a href="/blog/2019/03/15/matrix-1-0-https-arewereadyyet-com/">see our blog</a>. <a href="https://arewereadyyet.com">https://arewereadyyet.com</a> reports &gt; 60% adoption on a per server basis, and high 90s on a per user basis. We are now really close to being able to ship a 1.0 release candidate and start the 2 week countdown before releasing 1.0 proper.</p>
<p>This week we have focussed on performance, richvdh has been working on batching of outgoing read receipts and hawkowl shipped a much more performant implementation of user search. Erik has been putting the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/rust-synapse-compress-state">state compressor</a> through its paces, he saw one room compress down to 1% of its original size. Andrew has been focusing on ensuring spec compliance on various Synapse endpoints and is currently looking at some bugs in the federation tester.</p>

<p>Lots of news from <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/android">Pattle</a>, the project aiming to create clients for multiple mobile platforms. All quotes below from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pattle for Android now has an F-droid repository: <a class="linkified" href="https://fdroid.pattle.im/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=E91F63CA6AE04F8E7EA53E52242EAF8779559209B8A342F152F9E7265E3EA729" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://fdroid.pattle.im/</a></p>

<p>As part of the project, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a> also announced the intention to create a Dart SDK:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm currently working on a <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/library/matrix-dart-sdk">Matrix SDK for Dart</a>, which will be used for the <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app">Pattle rewrite in Flutter</a>.
The reason for this is outlined <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/android#future">here</a>. To summarize: My goal for Pattle is to release for not only Android but also iOS and web, with a single code base. Other reasons include that Android native development is just bad, and the fact that I'm not too happy with the official Matrix Android SDK design and documentation.
I will maintain and also add some features to the current version of Pattle, to try things out. The Flutter version will replace the native one once the features are in sync.</p>

<h2 id="dimension-sticker-packs">Dimension sticker packs</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> has introduced sticker packs for <a href="https://dimension.t2bot.io/">Dimension</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dimension now has beta support for custom sticker packs. To create a sticker pack:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
 	<li>Start a conversation with @stickers:t2bot.io</li>
 	<li>Say <code>!stickers newpack</code> and follow the prompts.</li>
 	<li>Share the URL with your friends.</li>
</ol>
To add the sticker pack to your sticker picker:
<ol>
 	<li>Make sure you're using Dimension as your integration manager.
<ul>
 	<li>Not sure if you are? Click the 4 squares in the top right of the room in Riot - if the dialog is titled "Dimension", you're all set :)</li>
 	<li>If you aren't, check out <a href="https://dimension.t2bot.io">https://dimension.t2bot.io</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Click on the smiley face to the right of where you type messages then the Edit button in the top right.</li>
 	<li>Paste the URL of the sticker pack into the box and click "Add Stickerpack".</li>
 	<li>Start using your new stickers.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>These instructions are also available at <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension/blob/master/docs/custom_stickerpacks.md">https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension/blob/master/docs/custom_stickerpacks.md</a> as is the admin/operator guide for running your own sticker bot (you're not stuck with using t2bot.io unless you want to be).<br />Custom sticker packs are still beta while the proposals to share this with the wider Matrix ecosystem are still works in progress. This serves as a proof of concept to see how crazy of an idea it is to have stickerpacks-as-rooms (yes, they're just plain Matrix rooms under the hood) and what needs ironing out before moving ahead with the MSC.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-notification-profile-manager">matrix-notification-profile-manager</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a> has created a notification profile manager:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past few weeks, I grew a bit fed up of always having to turn on and off every notification rule each time I'm having a slight change in what I'm working on or depending on what mood I was in (e.g. want to focus only on work-related stuff and nothing else, don't want to hear about work at all, somewhere in the middle, etc.), so I built a <a href="https://github.com/babolivier/matrix-notification-profile-manager">notification profile manager for Matrix</a>. It's available both as a command line interface or a Go package in case people want to build on top of it.</p>
<p>It allows one to take a snapshot of their current notifications settings and save that as a profile, so that this profile can be applied later. It also allows one to delete a profile or list the existing profiles (more features to be added as time goes by). In order to make the whole thing interoperable with other projects building on top of the Go package, it also uses the user's account data on the user's Matrix homeserver to store profiles.</p>

<h2 id="neo-v4-iris">neo v4: iris</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:lain.haus">F0x</a> has recommenced development on the Matrix client Neo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After discussion following <a href="https://cyberia.social/@foks/101785513826000032">https://cyberia.social/@foks/101785513826000032</a> I've resumed development on Neo. Suggestions are very much welcomed on the pad and mastodon thread<br />I'm implementing components one by one now, with just mocked events. Actual Matrix integration will come when the gui components are ready.</p>
<p>Neo is now partly integrated with <code>matrix-js-sdk</code> because I grew tired of having to write my own mock events. There's a basic authentication flow, with 0 error handling, and parsing of <code>m.text</code> and <code>m.image</code> events</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it would be much appreciated to get some feedback on how I implemented matrix-js-sdk, had to do some weird stuff to make React update</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> 0.5.0 was released after I finally fixed the bug that was causing the bridge database to lock up. It turned out to be a single line of ORM usage that I had missed while converting everything to use SQLAlchemy Core.

I also released <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram/releases/tag/v0.5.1">v0.5.1</a> to fix a bug that made the DBMS migration script not work and Python 3.5 compatibility. I wouldn't recommend using Python 3.5 though, I'm going to drop support for it some time after Debian 10 is released</p>

<p>My pal Doug shared his frustration with the broader state of the chat ecosystem after <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/hottest-chat-app-teens-google-docs/584857/">reading that teens now use Google Docs for their chat needs</a> (and not the chat feature, the document itself!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love that you've got Amazon with their Alexa messaging, Apple in their own bubble with iMessage, Facebook doing chat 3-ways and Google trying 50 ways to do chat. And that's before you even get into things like Slack, Discord, Telegram, Riot, Line, WeChat etc etc. And then the current hot way to chat is in a document...
I mean, <strong>how much money is being invested in trying to create the perfect chat solution?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a> announced <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/android">Pattle</a>, a Matrix client for Android:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey all, I've been working on my Matrix Android app, Pattle! The goal of Pattle is to be an easy to use app for Matrix, with it's design inspired by popular apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram. <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/android">Development happens here</a>, and contributions are encouraged! The app is not currently suited for daily use, but some functionality is there, such as registering, logging in and viewing chats.
Currently it's an Android only app using the official Matrix Android SDK, but the plan is to support iOS and web too, in the future.
There's also a sort of <a href="https://docs.pattle.im/design/philosophy/">design document</a> available, stating how Pattle differs from standard Matrix apps and what it's goals are. The intent of the design document is to make development easier later on for other platforms</p>

Notably, Quaternion won't crash on upgraded rooms in some cases, and won't cry in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gsoc:matrix.org">#gsoc:matrix.org</a> and other v3 rooms. Translators are still strongly encouraged to push forward - due to all the features and fixes, there are many untranslated strings across the board! Also, some bugfixes are <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion/projects/2#column-4040192">still in order</a> before we can call the release RC, and some of them are really easy - so if you'd like to contribute, it's a great time to start!</p>

<p>From Neil of the Synapse-team</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Folks, in the run up to Synapse 1.0, if you are running your own homeserver now would be an excellent time to check that your TLS certificates are up to date. Point your server name at <a href="/federationtester/">https://matrix.org/federationtester/</a> and if there are errors check our handy FAQ on how to fix it. If you do not have valid TLS certificates Synapse 1.0 will refuse to federate with you.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">benpa</a> has put together a federation checker to quantify how many homeservers are 1.0 ready - <a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com">https://www.arewereadyyet.com/</a> - It currently stands at 50.5% let's try and get that to 60% over the weekend.</p>
<p>Aside from all that, the team have been working on preparing for Synapse 1.0, you can <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">track our progress here</a>. We promise not to just land 1.0 out of the blue - we'll give everyone a 2 week warning to give stragglers a chance to get their certificates in order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First Release Candidate of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">Jeon</a> Project with upcoming Client-Server API 0.5, Server-Server API 0.1.1, Application API 0.1, Identity API 0.2 and Push API 0.1.
Also the RC of the <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk">jmsdk</a> has been prepared with Java Matrix Client for Client-Server API 0.5.
Changes in the C2S: Added the <code>m.push_rules</code> event, removed presence list methods and other minor fixes.
Added S2S API of the 0.1.1 version.
I prepared a very simple page <a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/">https://ma1uta.github.io/</a> with links to the swagger schemas (json and yaml) for all Matrix API which generated from the Jeon code.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@pztrn:pztrn.name">pztrn</a> has created a new mechanism for relaying apps that use Slack webhooks into Matrix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To everyone who wonders how to connect his application to Matrix (at least for notifications of some kind) - use <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">OpenSAPS</a>! It just reached v0.1.0. <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">OpenSAPS</a> stands for Open Slack API Server and able to retransmit messages from applications (like Gitlab or everything that can send data to Slack) to somewhere else. Right now these &quot;somewhere else&quot; is a Telegram (with HTTP proxy support) and Matrix! Written in Golang to ensure minimal memory footprint. Take a look at <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps</a> Tested with Gitlab and Gitea but should work with almost any service. Join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opensaps:pztrn.name">#opensaps:pztrn.name</a> to talk with developers or get help. BTW, there is OpenSAPS instance in our room that transmits everything from gitlab.com into room! (almost) immediately after 0.1.0 comes <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps/tags/v0.1.1">0.1.1</a>, with fixed URLs parsing and fixed inability to login into servers which use .well-known for delegation. It should work [with other webhooks]. If something strange happens there is also a possibility to write own parser to make everything work :)‚ Tested with Gitlab and Gitea ATM. Share application names that work, I'll start to make a list of them. :D</p>

<p>Modular.im is a Matrix-as-a-SaaS offering. It's suitable for users who want the benefits of having their own Matrix homeserver, but don't want to host and run one.</p>
<p>There are some new announcements this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we are pleased to announce that you can now <a href="https://www.modular.im/custom-branding">customise your Modular hosted Riot</a> at the touch of a button, through the Modular host admin interface. Better yet, this is available to all Modular customers at no additional cost.<br />Today we are also <a href="https://www.modular.im/stickers">launching a proof of concept for purchasing additional content</a> via the Modular integration manager.<br />For the initial experiment we're offering a set of &quot;snazzy&quot;, limited edition Matrix stickers for the princely sum of $0.50. These are digital versions of the Matrix and Riot hexagons that some of you may have seen in real life.</p>

<h2 id="riotic-new-fork-with-updates">Riotic: new fork with updates</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aaron:raim.ist" rel="nofollow">Aaron Raimist</a> has made some updates to Riotic, which was a good chance for me to revisit it. It works nicely and is a great alternative to the Electron version of Riot. I also like being able to use <a href="https://riot.im/develop" rel="nofollow">https://riot.im/develop</a> as an app.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've slightly tweaked Joakim Ahlen's Riot wrapper for macOS, riotic, which uses the native WKWebView instead of Electron. I updated the app to be sandboxed so it has very limited access to your system. I also updated the interface to follow macOS conventions and updated it to use the latest version of Swift.</p>
<p>riotic does have some limitations though. Riot doesn't support VoIP on Safari so riotic can't support VoIP either and WKWebView doesn't support notifications as far as I can tell. Right now it uses a really old Riot icon, maybe I'll ask about using one of these community made icons <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/4474">https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/4474</a>.</p>
<p>It does have some advantages over the official Riot Electron app though. The app is only ~12 MB compared to Riot which is ~180 MB, it also uses significantly less RAM. riotic also allows you to pick what Riot URL to use so you can run /develop as a desktop app.</p>
<p>You can download riotic from <a href="https://github.com/aaronraimist/riotic/releases/tag/v1.1">https://github.com/aaronraimist/riotic/releases/tag/v1.1</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@red_sky:ocean.joedonofry.com">red_sky</a> has continued to work on nheko, and shared a general roadmap in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko-reborn:matrix.org">#nheko-reborn:matrix.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The remainder of 0.6.x is expected to be bug fixes. This includes bug fixes in mtxclient as well as nheko.<br />0.7.0 will be the next feature release. The end goal here is to add some of the capabilities that people have been requesting, and other things that people haven't been requesting.<br />AFTER 0.7.0 releases, I will then focus on updating the encryption to include more than just text messages.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has been writing the codes this week, <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> now supports room upgrades and more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Master branch of <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> can now store access token in your secure storage/keychain, better integrating into frameworks of GNOME and KDE, as well as macOS and Windows.<br />Also, you can see the room version and upgrade rooms in Quaternion (just like Matthew said on FOSDEM ;) ) - this feature is enabled by <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a>, so other clients are welcome to support room versions/upgrades too!</p>
<p>All this is within the work on the upcoming release of libQMatrixClient 0.5 and Quaternion 0.0.9.4 - stay tuned!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>What's new?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A whole bunch of small stuff I did, mostly just additional exposed methods and parameters, and some fixed issues as well. I did add support for HS URL discovery using both SRV and .well-known though, which I think is probably the largest new feature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As if all this wasn't enough, a room on Matrix!</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>Clean up c++ code</li>
 	<li>Make the c++ code less heavy, we should focus on speed</li>
 	<li>Offload js code to direct qml binding, with this i mean instead of having ablock if-else code that modifies qml object that runs on component load, we do this directly in qml: see 0a800fc and https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriksblob/0a800fcdc0af4fa2e08526dbff88e06bcb591779/uMatriks/componentsChatItem.qml as an example for a cleaner code</li>
 	<li>Make all ui depended calls async, we should NEVER block ui</li>
 	<li>Offload heavy js logic to c++</li>
 	<li>Cleaner UI, with less crust</li>
 	<li>Async everything</li>
 	<li>Merge our WIP call support</li>
 	<li>Finish impl of call support (maybe move to a standalone webrtc module)</li>
 	<li>Slowly start moving to QQC2</li>
 	<li>Implement reply</li>
 	<li>Implement sending of media</li>

<p>We <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/the-big-1-0-68fa7c6050be">linked to the announcement last week</a>, and have been using it for even longer, but somehow I missed a great labs feature that shipped with Riot 1.0: &quot;room breadcrumbs&quot;, which you can enable from the Labs page of Riot settings. This gives you a series of quick links with the history of rooms you were most recently in. So if you're like me, clicking between rooms all day, you can get where you're going a little faster.</p>
<h2 id="mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</h2>
<p>There is no big news about mautrix-whatsapp this week, other than that I installed it on my own server and found that it works really <em>really</em> well. I'd love to switch to this as a main interface for my less-decentralised friends, but like others, I've been stung by <a href="https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp/issues/98">this issue in an upstream project</a>. If there are go-fans reading (and I know there are), I wonder if it's an issue which can be fixed?</p>

<p>Brendan also said, regarding low-bandwidth:</p>

<p>Some of the week has been spent finalising the components used in <a href="https://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/matrix.webm">the low-bandwidth demo we did at FOSDEM</a>.

At the same time the feature branch to support room versions and room upgrades is at an advanced stage; expect the features to land in master next week.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been working on new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've paused porting Synapse to OpenBSD this week, while I attempt to both fix and <em>revert</em> some security issues caused by <code>sudo apt-key add</code> for Matrix.org and Riot.im packages for Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution users.<br /><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4609">matrix-org/synapse PR #4609</a> was my first attempt to fix the problem, however I fell short this time in ease-of-use and my implementation had other issues. (Read: The <code>repo-key.asc</code> downloaded from Matrix.org Debian repository should go to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>, and must not be added by <code>apt-key add</code> or added to <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d</code> directly. I attempted the latter with my first PR; but that would've allowed the Matrix.org signing key to also be used to verify packages from Debian's main repositories. Yikes!)<br />As my second attempt, I'm now creating a new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>. There's multiple things this package intends to do:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>A post-install script to remove any previously added Matrix.org package signing keys from <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg</code>. (This is the file <code>apt-key add</code> most commonly uses, and the most commonly found bad advice on the Internet.)</li>
 	<li>Convert <code>repo-key.asc</code> to a de-armorized <code>.gpg</code> format, understood better by apt(8). (Essentially, <code>gpg --dearmor</code>.)</li>
 	<li>Install the converted <code>.gpg</code> key to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>.</li>
 	<li>Make sure <code>apt(8)</code> uses the newly added key for Matrix.org repository only?</li>
 	<li>Deliver any updates to <code>repo-key.asc</code> directly to you via <code>apt upgrade</code>. Your operating system might then also do it automatically for you if <code>unattended-upgrades(8)</code> is installed on your system. ?</li>
 	<li>Make sure everything goes away when this keyring package is uninstalled. No more <code>sudo sh -c 'apt-key del C35EB17E1EAE708E6603A9B3AD0592FE47F0DF61; rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> to get rid of the repository.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I have one more interesting enhancement to disclose.<br />We can ask you with <code>debconf</code> if you want to install <code>deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian $(lsb_release -cs) main</code> to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> while you're installing the new keyring with <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code>.<br />You'll most likely notice the difference in install instructions, as a result of this package. Before and after:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># Before
sudo apt install -y lsb-release curl apt-transport-https
echo "deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian `lsb_release -cs` main" |
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list
curl "https://matrix.org/packages/debian/repo-key.asc" |
    sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
<pre><code># After
sudo apt install matrix-archive-keyring
sudo sh -c 'apt update && apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are a Debian or Ubuntu user and Synapse homeserver operator using Matrix.org repositories, I'll be towncrying when this package becomes available as much as I can. All you should need to do then is <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code> and it should patch the security holes in your operating system if you've formerly installed packages from Matrix.org or Riot.im! (The command may change a bit, because next Debian operating system release &quot;Buster&quot; has entered soft-freeze just today (2019-02-12) and not accepting new packages into that release.)<br />PS: I'm at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#debian-matrix:matrix.org">#debian-matrix:matrix.org</a>, please come talk to us if Debian packaging interests you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the eager early testers not afraid of building from source, <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code> version <code>2015.12.09+debian0.10</code> is available for early testing (attached).</p>
<pre><code># Something like this!
sudo apt install devscripts
tar -xfvJ matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10.tar.xz
cd matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10
debuild -us -uc
sudo dpkg -i dpkg -i ../matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10_all
</code></pre>
<p>Please follow <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=922155">Debian Bug#922155</a> for updates. Debian binary packages will be available later sometime this/next week from Debian's <code>unstable</code> distribution (<code>contrib</code>), if all goes well and there are no remaining Debian policy violations or serious bugs.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/kamax-io/grid/gridepo">Gridepo</a>, as a Matrix Homeserver, is gaining basic support for Matrix Client API. We have basic login, room creation, message sending and sync working! A little screen recording of the progress can be viewed <a href="https://kamax.io/_matrix/media/v1/download/kamax.io/EOMDDlNERTqalHvADhokyItG">here</a> for live action with Riot. As a reminder, Gridepo is a clean rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a>.</p>
<p>This is not usable yet outside of a dev environment but we should have a first usable version with federation in a couple of weeks!</p>
