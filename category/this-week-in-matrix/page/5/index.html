<p>This week Matthew gives us a general update on everything Matrix and Element. What is going on with Sliding Sync, OpenID Connect or P2P Matrix? Let's find out!</p>
<p>We're also pleased to announce the next episode of Open Tech Will Save Us has been scheduled. We will be talking live and interacting with you on July 27, 16:00 UTC (18:00 CEST) on the subject of platforms with people from GNOME, KDE and Element.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3847">MSC3847: Ignoring invites with policy rooms</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3846">MSC3846: Allowing widgets to access TURN servers</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3843">MSC3843: Reporting content over federation</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3786">MSC3786: Add a default push rule to ignore <code>m.room.server_acl</code> events</a> (merge)</li>

<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The Spec Core Team took a concentrated effort to work through our priority backlog of MSCs, resulting in the decent amount of MSCs hitting FCP this week!</p>
<p>Thankfully the community has nearly matched this number by adding quite a few more MSCs into the fray. But we're still up by 1!</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most exciting MSCs to move forwards is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676: Message editing</a>, which allows users to edit events (including messages) that they've previously sent. Part of the aggregations work, this functionality has been used extensively throughout the ecosystem. But only now is it making its way into the spec proper. I'm also personally excited about <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2285">MSC2285: Private read receipts</a>, which allows users to read a room's contents without advertising it.</p>
<p>Of course the above MSCs are still in Final Comment Period; a 5 day period where anyone can raise their concerns about an MSC before it is accepted. So if you have any last-minute comments, be sure to get them in now!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2666">MSC2666: Get rooms in common with another user</a>!</p>
<p>Another MSC I'm personally excited about! This MSC provides an endpoint on the homeserver to request the rooms (or spaces) you have in common with another user. I would find this useful for incoming DMs from users I may or may not know. Note that the client may not already have this information if it is making use of <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#lazy-loading-room-members">lazy loading room members</a>, so it needs a way to ask the server for this information.</p>
<p>Looks like the MSC is currently sitting in the Spec Core Team's review backlog. We'll get to it soon!</p>

<h3 id="synapse-website">Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org">Shay</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Synapse team has been hard at work! This week we published <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.63.0rc1">Synapse 1.63.0rc1</a>. Among the notable features are support for MSC3827: filtering <code>/publicRooms</code> by room type, allowing for better discovery of Spaces. You can read more about that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">here</a>. In addition, the release contains a number of bugfixes, updates to the documentation, and internal changes focused on reducing memory usage and increasing performance, as well as supporting the long-standing goal of faster room joins. More on these next week in the official release announcement!</p>

<p>Conduit is a simple, fast and reliable chat server powered by Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:conduit.rs">Timo on Conduit ‚ö°Ô∏è</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good news, as you might have noticed, conduit.rs is back online and better than ever! Matrix.org is so kind and donates this Linux server to me. I already host a discord appservice and handle 23k messages per day and, most importantly, now I'm at the top of both #ping rooms ;)</p>
<p>On the development side, I'm currently working on a big refactor, see https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit/-/merge_requests/365 and please give feedback if you have experience this is your chance to have a lasting impact.</p>

<h3 id="nheko-website">Nheko (<a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can now edit aliases in Nheko! This means you can publish your own aliases in the room directory as well as in the room. If an alias can't be used by people (because it isn't listed in the room directory), that alias is highlighted in red with an easy option to fix it (if you have permissions to do so). You can also easily switch the primary (canonical) alias of the room.</p>
<p>With this the feature set I wanted to have for the next release is complete. I wanted to focus on improving moderation and room management capabilities in Nheko and it does now have a very basic sets of capabilities to do so. I do already have plans to expand on them though!</p>
<p>So instead of working on new features, I will be focusing on bug fixes. For a start if someone has the username <code>room</code>, Nheko will now omit the reply fallback to prevent pinging the whole room. The verification window now also should always be big enough to show its contents and we now properly explain to users, why emojis might look different on different devices fixing an issue reported via Twitter... There is also a new icon for the room directory (it is now a building, very punny, huh?).</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tobias has done some internal refactoring, which will allow us to create more automated tests and prepare for the eventual Qt6 migration</li>
<li>Nvrwhere has improved NeoChat's Timeline layout: On a wide window, the bubbles will now be centered in the window, in order to better use the space while not stretching the timeline out too far</li>
<li>He's also fixed several papercut issues around the UI, for example editing and replying using the keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>The browser will now properly open when clicking on a link when using wayland</li>
<li>The first part of Snehit's GSoC project is almost ready to land: The room list is gaining a list of spaces, which can be used to filter for the rooms included in that space</li>
<li>We're also moving forward on the E2EE support, with NeoChat now allowing a user to send an encrypted message into a matrix room - provided libQuotient supports it üôÇ</li>
<li>Tobias is also working on improved Reaction &amp; Emoji pickers, which will allow users to select different variants like skin tones and which will behave better on mobile devices</li>

It is also the very first release for nodejs featuring the great new vodozemac core (replacement of libolm).  We've marked this as a beta release while we work out any remaining minor hickups or problems, so if you see something, say something! However, the main point of contact to it for most people is probably TravisR |s <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/matrix-bot-sdk">Nodejs Bot SDK</a>, which is already consuming that beta in its latest release.</p>

<p>matrix-bot-sdk v0.6.0</p>
<p>After a year of working on different ways to support encryption, the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">bot-sdk</a> has finally stabilized on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/tree/main/bindings/matrix-sdk-crypto-nodejs">rust-sdk crypto crate</a> for crypto bindings internally. Tutorials on how to get your bot/appservice set up and working with the new crypto code are <a href="https://turt2live.github.io/matrix-bot-sdk/tutorial-encryption.html">here</a> (note that for appservices you'll need to turn on EDUs and MSC3202 in Synapse). If you run into problems, please <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/new/choose">report bugs</a> or pop by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-bot-sdk:t2bot.io">#matrix-bot-sdk:t2bot.io</a> on Matrix for help.</p>
<p>Alongside support for encryption, v0.6.0 brings a whole lot of other functionality for appservices, Synapse Admin API users, and bots wanting to make use of real DMs. Check out the full changelog <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk/releases/tag/v0.6.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Spec Core Team did some shuffling of our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/31">backlog board</a> this week in order to ensure that all in-flight and in-focus items are reflected on it.</p>
<p>Outside of that was the usual rounds of MSC review by team members.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2199">MSC2199: Canonical DMs</a>!</p>
<p>While the name may not make much sense to the layperson, the idea of a &quot;canonical&quot; Direct Messaging room (DM) is one that would always be referenced whenever a DM between two people is requested. That is, instead of potentially having a few different DM rooms with someone, both you and the other person would always know which room to use when DM'ing each other.</p>
<p>We don't really have this today. DM rooms are just group rooms with only you and someone else in them. If you attempt to DM another user, your client will try to guess the best room to use for this through some clever heuristics. What's lacking is a defined way to always arrive at the same room for this action.</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to define one, and would allow other functionality to be built on top of it, such as definitively knowing which room to send user-to-user data into, and to read from.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can now edit aliases in Nheko! This means you can publish your own aliases in the room directory as well as in the room. If an alias can't be used by people (because it isn't listed in the room directory), that alias is highlighted in red with an easy option to fix it (if you have permissions to do so). You can also easily switch the primary (canonical) alias of the room.</p>
<p>With this the feature set I wanted to have for the next release is complete. I wanted to focus on improving moderation and room management capabilities in Nheko and it does now have a very basic sets of capabilities to do so. I do already have plans to expand on them though!</p>
<p>So instead of working on new features, I will be focusing on bug fixes. For a start if someone has the username <code>room</code>, Nheko will now omit the reply fallback to prevent pinging the whole room. The verification window now also should always be big enough to show its contents and we now properly explain to users, why emojis might look different on different devices fixing an issue reported via Twitter... There is also a new icon for the room directory (it is now a building, very punny, huh?).</p>

<p>Just released a small update for the web client: <a href="https://gitlab.com/cactus-comments/cactus-client/-/releases/v0.13.0">cactus-client v0.13.0</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix for missing end tokens in sync responses from Synapse &gt;= v1.61.0 (Thanks to Tom Price for <a href="https://gitlab.com/cactus-comments/cactus-client/-/merge_requests/20">!20</a>).</li>
<li>A prettier animation while loading comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>/ipns/latest.cactus.chat is updated to point to the latest release, so sites linking there should already be using the new version.</p>
<p>Also, while we're here: we're surprised and delighted to so many people using Cactus Comments!
We just crossed 300k guest users registered on cactus.chat (roughly equivalent to 300k unique anonymous users). üéâ</p>
<p>An unfortunate side-effect is that we're having to up our hosting game to keep up with you all - and it's getting a bit expensive on our student budgets.
We set up a <a href="https://opencollective.com/cactus-comments">donations page</a> on Open Collective, in case any of you would want to help out. ‚ú®ü´Ç</p>
<p>üåµ Thanks!</p>

<p>After a long hunt, we've eventually found a significant problem with napi-rs, the layer we use in between Rust and Node.js for the crypto-nodejs, in the way it manages the memory coming from async functions in rust.

<p>A custom html element, web component, to display the latest messages from a matrix room</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ugp:matrix.org">@ugp:matrix.org</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>matrix-room-element</code> -&gt; <code>npm@v0.0.58</code> (GPLv3)</p>
<p><code>&lt;matrix-room-element/&gt;</code> is a web component (vanilla JS/HTML/CSS &amp; distributed un-minified) that can be imported and inserted in any web page, to display the content of a (public, soon with authentication, and private room support) matrix room.</p>
<ul>
<li>preview: https://sctlib.gitlab.io/matrix-room-element/</li>
<li>gitlab: https://gitlab.com/sctlib/matrix-room-element</li>
<li>npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sctlib/matrix-room-element/</li>

<p>Development is continuing, some new web-components have now prototypes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;matrix-login/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;matrix-logout/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;matrix-auth/&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;matrix-create-room/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;matrix-edit-room/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;matrix-join-room/&gt;</code></li>

<li><code>&lt;matrix-event/&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It is still heavy in development, and still looking for the right patterns (web components, and matrix).</p>
<p>We're trying to make composable components that can be inserted in any web page, and maybe help users use Matrix as a CMS, embedable anywhere (web). Our first use case is on https://libli.org (that now comes with a <code>/login</code> endpoint - alpha) (this event in libli, loading a <code>matrix-room-element</code> with correct room-id/event-id, https://libli.org/thisweekinmatrix:matrix.org/$KsbQ0JsqAXN9g-57M-aXyVohZYM3SZkKKkuUb9dW928).</p>

<p>We covered many interesting topics, such as the importance of specifying the expected behaviour of clients and servers in a protocol to deliver the best experience to end users (wink, wink, reminds you of something?), why Thunderbird was more dormant and is now vibrant as ever, what they plan for the future.

<p>This MSC is a relatively simple it. Currently widgets are only allowed to specify their capabilities (what the widget is allowed to do, like reading the logged-in user's display name) when the widget is loaded. This MSC attempts to allow that model to be extended to let widgets ask for additional (or fewer) permissions over time.</p>
<p>I can't help but be reminded of the shift in permissions on iOS and Android here in how they shifted from &quot;ask all permissions up front&quot; to &quot;ask for permission for each thing when it's used in the app&quot; :)</p>

<li>Incoming device list updates over federation are now queued in JetStream for processing so that they will no longer block incoming federation transactions and should never end up dropped, which will hopefully help E2EE reliability</li>
<li>The <code>/context</code> endpoint now returns <code>&quot;start&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;end&quot;</code> parameters to allow pagination from a context call</li>
<li>The <code>/messages</code> endpoint will no longer return <code>&quot;end&quot;</code> when there are no more messages remaining</li>
<li>Deactivated user accounts will now leave all rooms automatically</li>
<li>New admin endpoint <code>/_dendrite/admin/evacuateUser/{userID}</code> has been added for forcing a local user to leave all joined rooms</li>
<li>Dendrite will now automatically attempt to raise the file descriptor limit at startup if it is too low</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>A rare crash when retrieving remote device lists has been fixed</li>
<li>Fixes a bug where events were not redacted properly over federation</li>
<li>The <code>/invite</code> endpoints will now return an error instead of silently proceeding if the user ID is obviously malformed</li>

<p>Have you ever noticed that some people are just plain @*%&amp;!¬ß%&quot;+? Well, to quickly deal with what they wrote, Nheko now has a <code>/redact @userid:server.name</code> command, so you can redact everything they wrote (as long as it is in the currently cached section of the timeline). Note that you will run into rate limits when using that and Nheko is not yet applying an appropriate backoff in that case.</p>
<p>Similarly, q234rty fixed a lot of cases where icons in Nheko were either blurry or the wrong size. We fixed a few crashes, the room list should now not sometimes store the wrong order of rooms, brausepulver made large avatars cropped locally (since servers don't guarantee any size over 96x96 when cropped and synapse doesn't properly save the full image size in that case) and added a menu entry to copy a roomlink. You can also now define new powerlevels for users instead of using the existing levels in the room and Jason fixed some compiler warnings when a private member struct doesn't have an explicit constructor on some compilers. Nheko also now downloads the full online key backup when you explicitly toggle the switch.</p>
<p>A more noticeable topic might be, that Nheko now requires servers which support the v1.1 API or later and will not allow you to login or register otherwise. At the same time we also enabled support for the shiny and new knock_restricted rule and all remaining groups code was removed (you know, the feature from before spaces were cool).</p>
<p>I also updated Nheko on my work laptop now and since I was quite surprised by how fast it starts now (while my room count is over 900 !), I attached a video of that below for your pleasure.</p>

<p>Because sometimes you just have to do something else and it might be interesting to some people:</p>
<ul>
<li>I fixed calls not working when trying to use Element Web with a Conduit server: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/8931</li>
<li>I fixed Element Android still using the unstable endpoint (i.e. the one from the MSC, that proposed it) to list aliases: https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/6288</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes fixing something that annoys you isn't even that hard, and since it annoys you, you have some motivation to fix it. I call this Anger Driven Development (ADD). If you have some things that annoy you, I encourage to try fixing them for a bit. It might help out some other people too. If that makes you want to contribute to Nheko, don't hesitate to join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> and ask me to help you out with whatever fix you are trying to contribute.</p>
<p>This time I just decided to clean out some issues, that came up in the Conduit development channel and that weren't fixed yet. Turns out it was just a few lines to change and it hopefully makes the Matrix experience better for everyone in  the long run. The changes were also quickly reviewed and are merged now. Do you have any such little fixes that no one hears about, but you are proud of them? Please post about them, I'd love to see them!</p>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last few weeks, a significant push on rust-crypto-support for Nodejs has taken place, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/803">this PR</a>. Major parts are available, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/763">infrastructure to create releases ready</a>, however, a pretty rare huge memory allocation that causes a crash in Nodejs on the CI has blocked progress of the team recently. Debugging this <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/804">costs a lot of time and it is yet unclear</a>, how much of a problem this really is (as the cause stays mysterious), however it has also been seen in the wild on Windows now-- a concerning development.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean, there isn't any development going on. Thanks to the active community around the project, we now have a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/560">fix to prevent us from processing the same transaction twice</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/785">a method to create permalinks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/771">you can now verify sessions through FFI</a> as well as use the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/739">Client Builder via FFI</a>.

<p>Dart Matrix SDK: Version 0.10.2</p>
<p>This week, the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.10.2">version 0.10.2</a>. In this version, we added experimental support for native group call signaling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401">MSC3401</a>. We have been playing with it in our internal clients, and we have to say that we are pretty happy with the result! There are still some bugs, as sometimes a new call is creating instead of joining the existing one. But it's looking great!</p>
<p>We also took the opportunity to fix some bugs in call handling. Now the ringtone is properly properly when rejecting a call. Also, when opening the client, we don't trigger a call event anymore if the call end event is in the sync response.</p>
<p>We also did some refactoring for the sync handler, reducing the usage of JSON objects and adding some try catch to handle issues when handling event room updates. We switched to custom CachedStreamController so even if the stream has already been listened to, you can still access the last sent value.</p>
<p>Finally, when sending messages when under unreliable connection, messages could be sent out of order. This is now fixed thanks to the implementation of a message sending queue.</p>

<p>Most of the Spec Core Team has been away this week, thus there has not been much moving forwards. But we do have two new MSCs from <a href="https://github.com/duxovni">@duxovni</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Johennes">@Johennes</a>, which you can view above.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3077">MSC3077: Support for multi-stream VoIP</a> by <a href="https://github.com/SimonBrandner">@SimonBrandner</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC allows for differentiating between different incoming streams of media coming from a single user by adding a <code>sdp_stream_metadata</code> dictionary to Voice over IP (VoIP)-related events. This is a relatively simply addition with useful functionality, such as allowing a single user to share both their camera feed and screen share at the same time!</p>
<p>Check it out if that kind of stuff interests you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week the team released Synapse 1.61, which main new feature is media retention. That's right, you can now control how long Synapse keeps media files around, which should help server admins manage Synapse's disk space usage more efficiently. On a different note, this release of Synapse removes support for groups/communities (which was deprecated back in Synapse 1.56), as it has now been replaced by Spaces. Farewell groups, you have served your users well.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I skipped the last update, this one is a bit longer :3</p>
<p>First of all there have been lots and lots of updates to the translations! Finnish is now at 100% thanks to the tireless work of Aminda and Lurkki.</p>
<p>Nheko now also shows a nice badge on Unity compatible desktops (like KDE) for unread messages (although that doesn't work properly for multiple profiles being open at the same time due to limitations in that desktop protocol. Thank you d42 for contributing this, may you role a natural 42 every dice throw!</p>
<p>Syldra fixed up the paste behaviour (which didn't properly tie into undo in some edge cases), cleaned up how we find some of our dependencies and made cusor movement more consistent across systems.</p>
<p>Finally we fixed our glare resolution when verifying other sessions, which will be especially noticeable when verifying Cinny, since that responds to verification requests in a different way than I tested before! This should get rid of a whole range of verification issues people might have experienced. As part of our stabilization for the next release, we also fixed a crash on logout because I fatfingered and deleted a return statement, we now send an Element Android compatible height attribute on emotes, properly compile when the C++ version is set to 20, we once again support the current version of the hidden read receipts MSC (so that others can't tell what you read), edits now properly update in replies again, you can close the image overlay again by clicking outside, cancelled uploads properly get removed again, logging out and back in now doesn't mess up your configuration anymore and pinned messages now properly refresh once the events are loaded.</p>
<p>Phew, that was a mouthful. And we are not even done yet!</p>
<p>I spent some time on making Nheko compilation a bit faster again as well as improve startup speed. This might order your room list a bit weirdly for a few days after updating, but should normalize when receiving a few messages in some rooms. With this we now don't need to load the last message in all rooms on startup. This makes Nheko startup now only take 7 seconds on my old laptop (when not doing something CPU heavy at the same time). The remaining startup time is 40% building up the font database and 40% loading the powerlevels for each room. So we do have the chance to speedup startup by probably another 60%. It is unlikely that is necessary though.</p>
<p>When I discovered Matrix, Element was still called Riot. At the time some of the big design changes started happening to make it the Element you know today. One of the sideeffects was that the roomlist was consistently taking up 20% of my CPU on my Laptop, which I used at the time (and am forced to use now again, since I broke my newer laptop). It also used a lot more RAM than it does today. So for that reason I started shopping around for what other clients there are and I found Nheko. Clearly because it isn't a webclient, it had to be faster and use less RAM. Well, it did maybe a bit, but frankly the difference wasn't that much. Especially since at the time it loaded and rendered ALL your messages on startup (kinda). It never removed messages from memory, so it would just continuously render more and more parts of your timeline, which clearly increased RAM usage. It did however never resort the full roomlist, which made it not use a lot of CPU.</p>
<p>Since I didn't know any web development at the time, but I knew some C++, I started contributing to Nheko. At some point I made the roomlist constantly resort, which used quite some amount of CPU, but I quickly fixed that. At the time the most noticeable difference was that my fans didn't spin when using Nheko, but Element did (because of the roomlist sorting, iirc). RAM usage was pretty bad though. So that was one of the next projects, removing all events from RAM and only pulling them from the database as needed. While this means some additional load when switching rooms, it did decrease RAM requirements by quite a bit. Some new features made us still require loading data for every room from the database on startup, which causes quite some noticeable startup delay. The latest changes however got rid of most of that. We now don't need to load the messages from the database anymore. The only thing we still load is a small info object with roomname, notification and member count as well as the power levels of the room.</p>
<p>Since I recently broke my new and fast laptop, I decided to checkout how things changed on my old and slow laptop. Nowadays I am not in 15 rooms anymore, but I am in 900 rooms, but Matrix, servers as well as clients, has also gotten a lot more performant. So in the end I decided to do a little benchmark of where things stand. <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This is completely unscientific and unfair, so please take those numbers with a grain of salt. Almost no one runs such a slow laptop as I do, so likely your measurements will completely different. Even more, I was video recording the benchmark, which makes both clients a lot slower. Nonetheless it does somewhat mirror my personal experience.</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion that with 900 rooms, Nheko takes about 10-20 seconds to load and be ready for use on my system, while Element takes about 3 to 4 minutes. So basically Element handles 60 times as many rooms about 2x slower than it did back in the day, while Nheko got a bit faster or about the same speed on the same hardware (but still 60x as many rooms). I've attached a sped up video to this post, so that you can compare it for yourself. But since a lot of people ask, I guess the reason is that I wanted to see how fast you can make a Matrix client. I think I somewhat achieved that in the startup time department, but switching rooms still has a loooooong way to go. Also it is just fun to implement whatever you want in a client, since you are the maintainer and none can tell you how bad of an idea it is. That's probably the reason a lot of people start their own clients? (Although I didn't start Nheko, I just wrote too much code and people didn't want to review it anymore.)</p>
<p>That's it, I hope your eyes didn't glaze over with me babbling on about things. See you next time! :3

<p>The server implements the Matrix API specifications (with many advanced features still missing, like client-side end-to-end encryption), but did little modification on federation side so that it doesn't rely on the centralized domain name system to setup and authenticate other nodes. On the other hand, this means it cannot federate with existing home servers yet, because of the different trust model (domain name/HTTPS vs self-owned cryptographic keys).</p>

<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2000">MSC2000: Server-side password policies</a>!</p>
<p>This is a proposal that adds a mechanism for homeserver administrators to define a password policy for users. This policy can decide rules such as a minimum password length, whether a digit is required, etc. This policy can be enforced by the homeserver when a user registers an account or changes their account password and is communicated to the client so that it can also be enforced locally.</p>
<p>Astute readers will possibly note that authentication in Matrix will eventually be replaced by OAuth2 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2964">MSC2964</a>). This will move operations like password policy enforcement from the homeserver to a separate authentication service, essentially removing the need to reinvent-the-wheel in a homeserver.</p>
<p>Registration, login and managing passwords and connected third-party IDs is often a complex part of a Matrix homeserver. Moving these out to a separate authentication service will both unlock new features (log in with Matrix!) as well as reduce the resources required to implement a Matrix homeserver.</p>

<p>FluffyChat 1.5.0 goes Material You</p>
<p>FluffyChat 1.5.0 has been released and will soon be in all stores. This release comes with a bunch of bugfixes and introduces the first iteration of a Material You based design. We also try to support Android 12 accent colors (while this does not seem to work yet). On other platforms, our own purple shape will stay the default.</p>
<p>I like the new Material You design while we needed to tweak it at some points. Also the dropdown menu misses some elevation but this is a known issue in the Flutter repo which will be fixed soon.</p>
<p>This is also the first build with Flutter 3 which should improve the performance a little bit. Unfortunately it brings some regressions. We are forced to ship a little bug with it: Sharing on iPads seems to be broken. I'm very unhappy with this situation but otherwise we would have ended up in different releases for different platforms. As there afaik are not that many iPad users out there, we decided to live with this compromise and ship a bugfix release asap.</p>
<p>Yeah... Flutter has a lot of pros but also a lot of cons. Every new release of this framework leads to the fear of new regressions. Shipping a new major release where basic stuff like &quot;Sharing&quot; is just broken, is totally stupid... but that's the decision of Google. :-P</p>
<p>We didn't want to wait to ship the new design and also we needed a new release to come back to F-Droid where FluffyChat wasn't available in the last weeks because of a ProGuard problem, which should be fixed now.</p>

<p>Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fheese:element.io">Florian Heese</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Element Call Beta 2</strong></p>
<p>This week we landed Element Call beta 2 (https://call.element.io) including a bunch of nice updates. First of all, everything is now end-to-end encrypted by default: not only the WebRTC streams but also the matrix signaling (It was consciously disabled in beta 1 for debugging purposes). Moreover, we have experimental support for spatial audio rendering. Give it a try ‚Äî you can find it in the settings section. It's a lot of fun to play with and really supports immersion during a video call. This release also introduces a whole new experimental way of communicating: Walkie-talkie mode. In that mode, videos are disabled, and everyone is muted by default. To speak, press the ‚Äòpush-to-talk‚Äô (PTT) button ‚Äî takes me back to my childhood üôÇ</p>

<p>This week, the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.9.12">version 0.9.12</a>. In this version, we updated our Matrix API Lite package, in which we fixed the issue with the room hierarchy endpoint with some improper parsing and wrong type coming from the generation of the spec Open API documentation.</p>
<p>We also did some housekeeping and renamed some methods and getter to make them explicit. For example, the <code>futureSender</code> getter is now an asynchronous method called <code>fetchEventSender()</code> to make it clear that calling this function may trigger an API call.</p>
<p>Possibility to override the  supported Matrix spec version but we don't really recommend using it for production.</p>

<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we've been working on getting Matrix 1.3 out the door and generally working towards a better process for handling releases alongside critical proposals for the protocol. The goal is to be able to ship these major features while reducing the risk of a release falling behind. Watch this space for more details as this should result in MSCs getting through the process a little bit quicker.</p>
<p>For Matrix 1.3, we're targeting <strong>Thursday, June 16th, 2022</strong> as our release date, though this comes with a small asterisk: we're looking to land quite a lot of stuff so might have to adjust the date once more as needed. We do feel reasonably confident in the date though - watch for blog posts titled Matrix 1.3 in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've had breakthroughs this week on implementing a native Matrix SFU (selective forwarding unit) which speaks <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401">MSC3401</a>, thanks to <a href="https://siobud.com/">Sean DuBois</a> - all round WebRTC superstar, project lead for the <a href="https://github.com/pion/webrtc">Pion</a> WebRTC implementation for Go, and author of <a href="https://webrtcforthecurious.com/">WebRTC for the curious</a>.</p>
<p>Sean generously contributed an initial proof of concept to show how you'd build an MSC3401 SFU using Pion at https://github.com/matrix-org/sfu-to-sfu - which (I think?) is the first time that the first implementation of a major core MSC has been contributed from outside the core team.  Huge thanks to Sean to setting the ball going on this - the current PoC demonstrates not just SFU capability but also the decentralised cascading architecture which makes MSC3401 unique. The initial PoC speaks a 'test jig' version of MSC3401 hooked up to a simple web client for experimentation, but Matthew's now experimenting with adding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sfu-to-sfu/pull/10">genuine Matrix support</a> to it via mautrix-go, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/2423">hooking up Element Call</a> to speak to it.</p>
<p>Adding SFU support to Element Call will mean that we can support more than ~7 simultaneous calls - and with MSC3401-style decentralised cascading, we should be able to support hundreds or even thousands. There's lots of work remaining here, but the ball is now rolling.  For more info about SFUs and MSC3401, check out Matthew's <a href="https://2021.commcon.xyz/talks/extending-matrix-s-e2ee-calls-to-multiparty">CommCon 2021 talk</a> (which was what prompted Sean's implementation work here!)</p>
<p>Separately, we've been running Element Call on staging with E2EE enabled for the last few weeks, and should be releasing the first major Element Call update next week.  And once SFUs land, then Element Call can exit beta - watch out Zoom!</p>

<p>Dart Matrix SDK : Version 0.9.9</p>
<p>This week, the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.9.9">version 0.9.9</a>. In this new version, we added a search function to allow searching for an event in database and on server through several requests to the <code>/messages</code> endpoint.</p>
<p>There was also some work on updating the image size when generating thumbnail, which allow saving a bit of calculation when sending events. If using a custom resizer make sure to update the resize response as <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/company/frontend/famedlysdk/-/snippets/2342277">here</a>.</p>
<p>We also did some refactor with the event sender getter. The getter result is now a future to allow requesting the member event to the server if we cannot find it in memory, to help fix the issue when the user was not found in memory.</p>
<p>Finally, a quick helper function (<code>client.waitForSync</code>) was added. It allows you to wait for a room to appear in (left, join, invited) section of the sync response.</p>

<p>Pipes move messages from one room to an other. Useful if you are in important rooms but only want to monitor a single room. 
The Ansible role can now manage more aspects of MCM. Mainly in the post setup phase. The major one being if you run into encryption errors for any reason you can run the playbook with the fix tag and it will generate you a new device ID and encryption store.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pipes move all messages from one room to an other.</li>
<li>Adding a filter now uses the room the command was sent from by default if the roomid is not specified.</li>
<li>Ansible role now has tags for start, stop, configs, fix and all.</li>
<li>Ansible role backs up the configuration.toml file to prevent the possibility of data loss.</li>

<p>A bite-size MSC which aims to clean up the definition of a widget state event... by moving the &quot;title&quot; field to the root of the state event, alongside the existing &quot;name&quot; field.</p>
<p>This MSC needs someone to write an implementation in at least one homeserver and client to move forwards. Perhaps that someone could be you?</p>

<p>We added a way to edit permissions in Nheko now. It is an unconventional drag and drop dialog, where you drag users and permissions between different roles. We are hoping that this will make powerlevels easier to understand. Be careful when trying it, the wrong powerlevels might make your room unusable. Now... the bad part about that is, that powerlevels add around 50-100 new strings to translate... Help is appreciated! &lt;3</p>
<p>Nheko now also supports fallback keys, which should make E2EE more reliable after long periods of being offline and you can send images by pressing enter again. The privacy screen is also now fixed for separate room windows and our flatpak supports more image formats.

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/trixnity/trixnity/-/releases/v2.1.0">Trixnity 2.1.0</a> has been released. It includes support for Server-Server-API endpoints (client and server) and fetching missing <code>TimelineEvents</code> in client. The latter is used for fragmented timelines: If you want to show a timeline starting from any <code>EventId</code> and <code>RoomId</code> (e. g. from unread marker), Trixnity will try to fetch missing <code>TimelineEvent</code>s from server. If you reach <code>TimelineEvent</code>s, that are already saved in the local database, the timeline fragments are merged magically üßô</p>

<p>A set of Rust library crates for working with the Matrix protocol. Ruma‚Äôs approach to Matrix emphasizes correctness, security, stability and performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net">K√©vin Commaille</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since our last update from about a month ago, we had two bugfix releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruma 0.6.2 added methods to get the current room powerlevels from a <code>StrippedPowerLevelsEvent</code> and to get a user's membership whether the state event is redacted or not, and added a missing export to track member changes.</li>
<li>Ruma 0.6.3 fixed the serialization and deserialization of events with a dynamic <code>event_type</code> and added convenience constructors for logging in with a <code>UserIdentifier</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also landed a bunch of internal work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvement in our macros, notably to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1109">support unstable prefixes for event types</a>.</li>
<li>Some cleanup like removing some dead code, removing unnecessary <code>PartialEq</code> implementations, and fixing missing feature flags.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1109/commits/1cae9d253bb43c9ad8699cd3b59b89da23bd0e73">minimum supported rust version is now 1.59</a> and we use the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1137">Rust 2021 Edition</a>.</li>
<li>We started to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1132">refactor our tests</a> to have more helpful failure messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are of course new fixes and features for our next release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1114">push rules don't apply to the user's own events</a></li>
<li>Add support for <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1112">MSC3700: Ignore <code>content.sender_key</code></a></li>
<li>Implement <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1131">MSC3381: Polls</a></li>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Some new MSCs popping up this week around widgets, room types, fixing notifications with threads and room version 11! Though note that the last one currently serves as a means for the Spec Core Team to publicly track what should be included in room version 11, and is by no means is its content considered final.</p>
<p>The Spec Core Team are currently focused on room version 10 and getting Matrix v1.3 out the door soon. There's also been some discussion on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676: Message editing</a> this week, with the intention of finally landing that in the spec. Thanks to richvdh for driving the charge there.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1902">MSC1902: Split the media repo into s2s and c2s parts</a>!</p>
<p>Homeservers currently make use of Client Server Media APIs to pull media from other homeservers over federation. This has worked for a long time, but is a bit of a confusing blur of the lines between client&lt;-&gt;server and server&lt;-&gt;server traffic. It also makes it difficult to require different authentication rules for clients versus servers.</p>
<p>This MSC aims to help clean that up. Take a look if you're interested!

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week's <code>testing</code> updates are now in <code>master</code>!</p>
<p>Also included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better error handling:</strong> if the backend hits an error that causes your connection to KT chats to be dropped, the bridge should notify you about it (not that it should ever happen in the first place, but you never know!)</li>
<li><strong>Better logging:</strong> the Node module can be configured to print the arguments of RPC commands received from / sent to the Python module.  The example Node config includes a default set that should be helpful for general debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Room metadata bridging:</strong> setting an Open Chat title &amp; topic from Matrix should work now!
<ul>
<li>Setting the title of a Direct Chat should work too, but topics remain unbridged (since KT Direct Chats don't have topics/descriptions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Defensive error handling:</strong> Attempts to add a non-friend user to a DM will be refused by the bridge, since KT only allows Direct Chats between friends
<ul>
<li>KT does allow &quot;1:1 Open Chats&quot; between non-friends, but those aren't bridged yet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, <code>testing</code> adds support for joining KakaoTalk rooms from Matrix, either by joining an existing portal or providing an Open Chat URL to the bot with a <code>join</code> command. ...However, I've been unable to test this, since KT is stingy about whom it allows to join Open Chats!  So please give this a try if you can.</p>
<p>In other news, this bridge is now listed on <a href="https://matrix.org/bridges/#kakaotalk">Matrix.org</a>! ü•≥  Thanks Thib !</p>
<p>Also, for the time being, I will be taking a hiatus from this bridge &amp; the LINE bridge, as I'll be quite occupied for the foreseeable future on account of having joined Element ü§©!!

<li>Fixed compose docker Synapse configuration for registration</li>
<li>Improved Python 3.10 compatibliy (@BtbN)</li>
<li>Hidden room to hide joins using restricted rooms join rule (@BtbN)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some cool stuff this time around! Aside from many bug fixes this release has two great new features: IRC message colors and hiding invites from channels.</p>
<p>IRC colors are enabled by default and are rendered how your Matrix client sees fit. They can be disabled per network if needed.</p>
<p>Hiding joins works with room v9 restricted join rules feture to allow IRC ghosts to join rooms without an invite from the bridge bot first. This clears some clutter and may even make joining a bit faster in the long run - we will see. This feature is disabled by default and needs to be enabled by the bridge administrator as it is consiered a &quot;labs&quot; feature for now.</p>

<p>Post release (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0">we have release 0.5.0 last week</a>) the main focus was on minor fixes and bigger features we had pending but didn't want to merge before.

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The Spec Core Team has decided to not include <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> (threading via <code>m.thread</code> relations) specifically in the upcoming Matrix v1.3 release. We previously stated that it would be in v1.3, but there's a few unproven MSCs (namely <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773">MSC3773</a> (notifications for threads)) which make it feel improper to put threads into the spec at this stage. We're aiming for a future (very near) spec release to contain threads, assuming we can get enough of the feature landed. This is a very similar approach to what we did with Spaces: while the core feature existed as FCP-concluded for a while, we wanted to give some other MSCs a chance to land before writing it up formally.</p>
<p>As a follow-on from this, any implementations that are currently assuming &quot;v1.3&quot; spec support translates to threading support should note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients which are pre-emptively checking for v1.3 in <code>/versions</code> should stop doing that. Look for <code>org.matrix.msc3440.stable</code> as an &quot;unstable&quot; feature flag instead.</li>
<li>Servers which offer MSC3440's behaviour should expose it on stable endpoints and expose <code>org.matrix.msc3440.stable</code> for clients to detect.</li>
<li>Optionally, clients and servers can drop support for the <code>org.matrix.msc3440</code> (truly unstable) flag, given clients &amp; servers should have already upgraded.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the spec level, we'll still be writing up MSC3440's dependencies (aggregations and friends), but will notably be missing MSC3440 specifically in v1.3. If folks can update their clients urgently, it would be massively appreciated!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2596">MSC2596: Proposal to always allow rescinding invites</a>!</p>
<p>A simple change to the auth rules to help prevent an edge case where one is able to invite a user, but not disinvite them as the latter requires a separate permission. The MSC attempts to solve this by always allowing the cancellation of invitations you've sent.</p>
<p>A small MSC, but one with some open threads still. Perhaps a good opportunity to go in and clean it up!</p>

<p>This week we've actually made two releases ‚Äî <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.4">Dendrite 0.8.4</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.5">Dendrite 0.8.5</a> ‚Äî which are both primarily targeting performance and bug fixes.</p>
<p>We've also released our new living documentation, which is available at https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/, which features new installation instructions and documents that will be helpful to Dendrite server administrators. We will be writing more documentation and expanding this over time.</p>
<p>Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.8.2</li>
<li>Monolith deployments will no longer panic at startup if given a config file that does not include the <code>internal_api</code> and <code>external_api</code> options</li>
<li>State resolution v2 now correctly identifies other events related to power events, which should fix some event auth issues</li>
<li>The latest events updater will no longer implicitly trust the new forward extremities when calculating the current room state, which may help to avoid some state resets</li>
<li>The one-time key count is now correctly returned in <code>/sync</code> even if the request otherwise timed out, which should reduce the chance that unnecessary one-time keys will be uploaded by clients</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool should now work properly when the database is configured using the global connection pool</li>
<li>Fixes a regression introduced in the previous version where appservices, push and phone-home statistics would not work over plain HTTP</li>
<li>Adds missing indexes to the sync API output events table, which should significantly improve <code>/sync</code> performance and reduce database CPU usage</li>
<li>Building Dendrite with the <code>bimg</code> thumbnailer should now work again (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/database64128">database64128</a>)</li>

<li>Member completion now completes from all members in a room (rather than only those whose messages have been seen).</li>
<li>Power-level events are displayed.</li>
<li>Grouped membership events have tooltips showing each member's individual event.</li>
<li>When usernames are colorized, message bodies may optionally be colorized in a less intense shade of the same color, so they are easily distinguished yet easy on the eyes (and, of course, the shading is customizeable).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Changes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>When displaying usernames in the margin, names that are wider than the margin are abbreviated, with the full name in the tooltip.</li>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rust Matrix team is very excited to announce the next major release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0"><strong>Matrix SDK 0.5 &quot;stores and native crypto&quot;</strong></a>, now available for everyone by adding <code>matrix-sdk  = &quot;0.5.0&quot;</code> to their dependencies in their <code>Cargo.toml</code>. This first major release in about 8 months brings significant changes many have been waiting for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better, safer, native-er crypto</strong>: matrix-sdk 0.5 ditches libolm in favor of Vodozemac, the completely fresh rust-native re-implementation of the crypto crate. It has also been audited, the report of which is scheduled to be released soon.</li>
<li><strong>Store revamp</strong>: the entire cache storage infrastructure for crypto and state has been restructured to allow for full plug-ability, with even the two default supported backends, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-sled">sled</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-indexeddb">indexeddb</a> both being separate crates now. And as a matter of fact, a community-driven <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-sql">sql implementation has already been published as beta</a> (with postgres and sqlite support) by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lotte:chir.rs">charlotte ü¶ù</a>.</li>
<li><strong>WebAssembly</strong>; both of these changes also allow us to finally make WASM a Tier 1 supported target for the SDK. Not only does it build and even use the browser native indexeddb for permanent storage, we also have CI tests ensuring nothing will break this support going forward.</li>
<li><strong>Features, Features and Process</strong>: there's plenty more features and bug fixes in this release, e.g. native thumbnail generation support, as well as changes on our processes going forward.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For more details, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0">check out the Release Notes</a></strong>.</p>
<p><em>Sidenote</em>: If you want to contribute, or just learn Rust by actually doing it, we recommend taking <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">a look team at the <code>help wanted</code> issues</a> in our repo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you use Matrix with the Signal bridge (or any bridge) with relay mode
enabled, your guests have probably experienced the confusion where they don't know who else (on Matrix) is in the chat as only Matrix can double-puppet.</p>
<p>When this bot is added to a Matrix room, it will announce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who the room members are when a new Signal user joins;</li>
<li>When a Matrix user joins or leaves, who that Matrix user was.</li>
</ul>
<p>I built it just this afternoon using the excellent <code>matrix-bot-sdk</code>, but it's in Typescript and has plentyful unit tests!</p>
<p>I don't currently have a public bot, but if anyone is interested please join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#whos-in-this-room-bot-discussion:jakecopp.chat">#whos-in-this-room-bot-discussion:jakecopp.chat</a> and say hello!</p>
