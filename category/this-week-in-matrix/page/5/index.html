<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for <del>this week</del> the last little bit, we've been working on getting MSCs merged into the formal spec itself in preparation for v1.2 this quarter. We expect the release to happen quite soon and to contain <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3610">Spaces</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3387">room versions 8 and 9</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">refresh tokens</a> (no spec PR yet) in addition to all the other wonderful stuff which has landed.</p>
<p>The merged MSCs can be seen over at <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/">https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/</a> where they're queued up for the next release. Look out for <code>Added in v1.2</code> labels throughout the spec, denoting what is new and exciting.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>The random MSC this week is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2192">MSC2192: Inline widgets</a> (I promise it was random, after a few re-rolls). Inline widgets are a concept that allows for rich functionality in the timeline without needing to necessarily specify an explicit event type. For example, video embeds, minigames, etc could all be represented by inline widgets instead of dedicated event types.</p>
<p>The MSC needs updating to handle <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767: Extensible Events</a> (and friends), but once there it could be a very powerful bit of functionality, with free fallback thanks to Extensible Events. </p>

<p>Sliding sync (aka sync v3) is described in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3575">MSC3575</a> - it's still very early days for the proposal which means a lot can change: and YOU can be a part of that. Please take a look at the MSC and provide any and all feedback, be it on the names of keys, format of JSON objects, or the kinds of operations that can be performed. I'm particularly interested in feedback from client developers who have complex room list sort orders or room list filtering requirements and bot/bridge developers who typically don't have a visible room list UI. Any and all feedback at this stage is welcome, visit <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sliding-sync:matrix.org">#sliding-sync:matrix.org</a> to join the discussion.</p>

New year, new release candidate: we published <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.50.0rc1">Synapse 1.50.0rc1</a> today, marking the end of life for our Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6 support. We've also extracted some shared utilities into their own package, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/matrix-common/">matrix-common</a>, which is used by Synapse, Sygnal, and Sydent.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about what's in 1.50 next week when it formally releases.</p>
<p>The Synapse team is expecting to spend most of January on behind-the-scenes work as we gear up to virtually host FOSDEM again! Members of the team will be presenting two talks this year: Shay on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/matrix_events_uninitiatied/">Events for the Uninitiated</a>, and Brendan on <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/matrix_extend_synapse/">Beyond the Matrix: Extend the capabilities of your Synapse homeserver</a>.

<p>Howdy folks, it is the time of the year where everyone scarpers! Anyway, perfect time to announce that <strong>matrix-hookshot has gotten it's first major release!</strong>. 1.0.0 is here!</p>
<p>For those not in the know, the hookshot bridge is used to bridge GitHub, GitLab, JIRA and Generic Webhooks into Matrix rooms. It doesn't just bridge into existing rooms, but can also spawn dynamic rooms based on aliases, send you your notifications in a DM and do lots of other wonderful things!</p>
<p>The notable changes from the 0.1.0 release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridge has now been renamed from matrix-github to matrix-hookshot.</li>
<li>Now supports JIRA and Generic Webhooks in addition to GitHub and GitLab.</li>
<li>Includes new commands and metrics reporting.</li>
<li>Includes <a href="https://half-shot.github.io/matrix-hookshot">complete documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get involved and start playing with it by checking out the release <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.0.0">here</a></p>
<p>And that will be my last TWIM entry of the year. Have a good one and stay safe all 🐶</p>

<li>Added support for Figma webhooks. this also means the archival of my old project <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-figma">matrix-figma</a></li>
<li>Support GitLab wiki page change events.</li>
<li>Added a new script <code>validate-config</code> which allows you to check your config file for simple errors. Handy for people writing ansible roles!</li>
<li>Add support for a html key on generic webhooks to set the HTML content of a Matrix message.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project can be found over at https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot/, with pretty pretty docs at https://half-shot.github.io/matrix-hookshot. We're also in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#hookshot:half-shot.uk">#hookshot:half-shot.uk</a> if you prefer using Matrix to learn about these things!</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>

<p>Heisenbridge roundup!</p>
<p>Release <del>v1.8.0</del> <del>v1.8.1</del> <del>v1.8.2</del> v1.9.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>Spaces support 🌃</li>
<li>Sort NAMES reply nicks 🔤</li>
<li><code>UNPLUMB</code> network command to force unplumbing without being in the room</li>
<li>Proper SASL external with CertFP with mechanism override option (see notes)</li>
<li>Disconnect and cleanup from networks that have no rooms open ♻️</li>
<li>Reply (and reject) DM requests to ghosts with <code>QUERY</code> command ↪️</li>
<li>Try to keep IRC users in the room at all costs if they are on the IRC channel</li>
<li>Fix assumption of all IRC replies to have arguments</li>
<li>Prevent accidental namespace changes to cause mayhem</li>
<li>Finally convert from homegrown Matrix API stuff to Mautrix</li>
<li>Bump Mautrix requirement to 0.12=&gt;0.14</li>
<li>Conduit support was broken in 1.8.x but fixed again in 1.9.0, sorry</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally there's network level spaces support with a new <code>SPACE</code> command. This creates a new bridge controlled space for the network and automatically manages rooms in and out. There's an issue/feature with Element that all rooms that have been converted to DMs with <code>/converttodm</code> will appear in all bridge spaces. The workaround is to convert them back to regular rooms.</p>
<p>CertFP SASL has been updated to do SASL external flow by default. If you are upgrading and have used CertFP with OFTC you need to run <code>SASL --mechanism=none</code> for it to connect again.</p>
<p>Abandoned networks where the user has left all rooms including the network room will now automatically disconnect and cleanup. This is more in line what people would expect and prevents idle connections from hanging around.</p>
<p>Get your third vaccination from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We just released 0.9.1!</p>
<p>This is a small bug fix release. If you reported an issue, there is a 15% chance it is fixed now! This release also supports pinned messages, although those will only show up after someone changed the pinned messages in a room currently (we didn't want to force a full resync just for such a small feature). The spaces list is also now nested, Nheko offers you quick access to your recently used reactions and Nheko will show you your direct chats in the sidebar. Apart from that there are quite a few bugfixes and smaller improvements, you can find the full changelog and downloads here: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases/tag/v0.9.1</p>
<p>Thank you everyone, who helped shape this release!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now is a lot more efficient. We now use one Threadpool instead of 3, got rid of more than 60% of the allocations when scrolling through messages, layout half as much content when scrolling, blurhashes decode in 10% of the time and jdenticons allocate ~10% as much temporary buffers. We also deleted around 1000 lines of unused code. Tooltips also shouldn't steal the mouse focus when scrolling anymore, which could lead to sudden stalls when scrolling.</p>
<p>Additionally edits now replace existing notifications, tastytea added a manpage and fixed blurry or incorrectly sized custom emoji, you can now send custom emotes via the inline completer using ~ and completers now show a scrollable list with more Elements than before. Advanced users can also now opt into an insecure client side secrets storage via a hidden setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're baaaaack! Anyway, last week Drake just translated all of Nheko into Spanish, you can now zoom in and pan in the image viewer, emojis shouldn't split up into their segments anymore and Nheko should always be sending the qualified version of it (according the to the unicode test files, not by just appending FE0F). Blurhashes should be even faster still and we now have support for running the call event loop on macOS and Windows (although call support is still disabled there for now). </p>
<p>We are also now working to restructure our README. It has a lot of outdated stuff in it and you really want to see screenshots pretty early in the README! You can sneak a peak here: https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/nheko/-/tree/README_updates</p>

But mainly, this release brings a bunch of CSS improvements: introducing automatic dark mode, and making it easier to change colors with CSS variables.</p>
<p>Here's the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relicense from GPLv3 to LGPLv3.</li>
<li>Rewrite large parts of the stylesheet to use flexbox.</li>
<li>Introduce CSS variables to the stylesheet.</li>
<li><code>.dark</code> and <code>.light</code> CSS classes with default values for dark/light mode.</li>
<li>Bugfix: &quot;View More&quot; button no longer blinks when auto-refreshing short comment sections.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> has had a v0.6.0-beta.3 release with beta support for crypto! It even includes documentation!</p>
<p>The crypto is considered beta quality at the moment: good enough to use for somewhat unimportant bots, but not fully recommended for production just yet. With that being said, I'm interested in bugs you run into - please use the issue tracker if you run into crypto not working.</p>
<p>Tutorials for the crypto setup are at https://turt2live.github.io/matrix-bot-sdk/tutorial-encryption.html</p>
<p>Note for appservice support to work then you'll need a Synapse with these PRs enabled (may require manual merge too):</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11538</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11617</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11215</li>
</ul>
<p>For non-linux platforms, the rust-sdk will try to build itself which means you might need a working Rust stack. The Rust SDK repo itself has more information: </p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/travis/node-bindings/crates/matrix-sdk-crypto-nodejs/README.md</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/travis/node-bindings/README.md</li>

<p>Bots and appservices don't automatically support encryption, but adding encryption <em>should</em> be easy. The Rust SDK dependency is required in either case, sorry.</p>

<p>I don't think we've previously had any <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix/NixOS/nixpkgs</a> related entries in TWIM, so I'll start ^^</p>
<p>The current unstable channel has extended its Matrix ecosystem support to also include <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge">Heisenbridge</a> and <a href="https://conduit.rs/">Conduit</a> packages and modules. This makes it super easy to deploy any of those services: For example, my configuration for Heisenbridge is 21 lines long, and Conduit is only 11 lines. You can browse the available configuration options online: <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&amp;query=services.matrix-conduit"><code>services.matrix-conduit</code></a>, <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&amp;query=services.heisenbridge"><code>services.heisenbridge</code></a> (note that some of them are freeform and simply forward to the upstream configuration).</p>
<p>For those that are not into NixOS, a module is the code that turns the declarative configuration files into your running system setup. As an example, if you enable <code>services.heisenbridge</code> the following things are done for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new <code>heisenbridge</code> user and group for the service</li>
<li>Create and manage the registration file for the homeserver (i.e. automatically regenerate it after the configuration changed)</li>
<li>Create a systemd service that runs the <code>heisenbridge</code> command with the requested bridge configuration. The unit also sets a few systemd security hardening options.</li>
</ul>

<p>A supercharged episode this week with five super exciting demos!</p>
<h2 id="dept-of-spec-scroll">Dept of Spec 📜</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey all, it's me again, not-anoa, with your spec update. I don't have a graph for you this week, but I do have curated content which hopefully holds you over until next week 🙂 </p>
<p>This week we've seen a few new MSCs get opened up:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3567">MSC3567 - Allow requesting events from the start/end of the room history</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3570">MSC3570 - Room history visibility changes for relations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3571">MSC3571 - Relation aggregation pagination</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3572">MSC3572 - Relation aggregation cleanup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As demonstrated, a few of them are follow-on work from aggregations. A lot of the work is an effort to get <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675 - Serverside aggregations of message relationships</a> through FCP - it's changed quite a bit in the last week, so if you reviewed it before then please give it a quick read! </p>
<p>We're also gearing up for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767 - Extensible event types &amp; fallback in Matrix</a> receiving attention early next year. This is currently being evaluated by features like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3245">MSC3245 - Voice messages</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381 - Polls</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3488">MSC3488 - Static location sharing</a>. If all goes according to plan, the first pieces of Extensible Events will land soon.</p>
<p>Thib has caught me quite close to the deadline on TWIM, so while I don't have a random MSC for you this week I do recommend some light reading around aggregations and extensible events - these are both major features for Matrix and help shape the future for other, even more exciting, features.</p>

<h2 id="random-msc">Random MSC</h2>
<p>Since the script didn't run, I manually generated random numbers until I actually got one, that matches an MSC and is not a draft!</p>
<p>So the random MSC is: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2461">MSC2461: Proposal for Authenticated Content Repository API</a></p>
<p>The goal of this MSC is to restrict who can access files in your content repository, which is used to share files, images, voice messages and more on Matrix. Currently this is secured by using random identifiers, but this MSC wants to add a few more restrictions: A signed-in user can still access everything, but if you don't provide an access token, when downloading media, you either can access no media, only media that was sent from that server, only media which the server already downloaded or everything. The level of access can be set by the server admin.</p>
<p>I think this would be really nice to have, but it has various challenges when implementing it in clients and when it needs to work across federation. It could limit how much random users can fill up your disk though, which is especially important for small server admins!</p>

<p>Happy holidays! This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/14/synapse-1-49-0-released">released Synapse 1.49.0</a>, our last planned release of the year. This is the last release that supports Python 3.6 or PostgreSQL 9.6; if you've not upgraded, now is the time!</p>
<p>Most notably, this release includes stable support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a>. This is a more secure alternative to long-lived access tokens, and we'd encourage clients to implement support for refresh tokens as described in the MSC.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/releases/">Sygnal 0.11</a>, which includes <em>loads</em> of bugfixes. For the Element-managed Sygnal instances, this release has reduced our daily Sentry error rate by over 99%, dramatically improving the signal-to-noise ratio of our monitoring.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are planning to have a small release next week, that fixes a few issues with the 0.9.0 release. It would be lovely if some of you could test one of our <a href="https://matrix-static.neko.dev/room/!TshDrgpBNBDmfDeEGN:neko.dev/">nightlies</a> or could check if the translations for a language you speak are up to date in <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/#translations">our weblate</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the fixes this week include another crash fix for handling matrix links from your browser, notification bubbles that can show values over 9000(!), better preview images for sticker and emote packs created in Nheko, allowing you to click links in replies, a few layout and click area fixes. Nheko now also keeps track of your latest reactions and gives you easy access to them in the hover menu.</p>
<p>Nheko now also finally supports pinned messages! Most of you probably don't know, but that feature has pretty much always been in the matrix spec, but very few clients expose it. Today Nheko joins that rank! It's part of our goal to provide better support for building communities. Topics can be quite limiting, because they can only contain plain text. Pinned messages allow for much more creative freedom! They can also be encrypted, while state events currently never are, but the key for that isn't reshared, so currently experience in encrypted rooms is a tradeoff. Maybe we'll go for an encrypted description event in the future, but for now this seems to be a good solution to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Let's hope the current master branch is good and we'll have a release with ALL THE FIXES next week! And thank you everyone, who already translated and reported issues! It took less than 10 hours to have 5 languages updated to 100%! Last year we didn't even have that many languages at 100%! You guys are AMAZING! &lt;3</p>

I wrote a <a href="https://danilafe.com/blog/introducing_highlight/">brief introduction on my blog</a>, as well as made a little bit of a simple <a href="https://youtu.be/Q3h5A0DsE1s">demo video</a>. Here's a copy-pasted list of planned and existing features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Create and send website annotations over Matrix.</li>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Store data in a decentralized and federated manner.</li>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Share highlights with other users, including those on other servers.</li>
<li><strong>Current</strong>: Group annotations together and create multiple annotation groups</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong>: Use Matrix's End-to-End encryption to ensure the secure transmission and storage of highlight data.</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong>: Leverage the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/gsouquet/threading-via-relations/proposals/3440-threading-via-relations.md">m.thread MSC</a> to allow users to comment on and discuss
highlights.</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong>: Use something like <a href="https://archivebox.io/">ArchiveBox</a> to cache the current version of a website and prevent annotations from breaking.</li>
<li><strong>Planned</strong> Highlight PDFs in addition to web pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Come join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-highlight:matrix.danilafe">#matrix-highlight:matrix.danilafe</a>.com to receive updates about the project!</p>
<p>I haven't published the code just yet, but I'm going to as soon as the tool is in better shape.

<p>A Social Annotation Tool Powered by Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gleachkr:matrix.org">gleachkr</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been teaching a class this semester using a tool built on the matrix-js-sdk and tentatively entitled <a href="https://github.com/opentower/populus-viewer">populus-viewer</a>. Populus-viewer uses Matrix as a backend for the social annotation of PDFs, with the goal of helping matrix become a platform for teaching and scholarly collaboration. If you're interested in learning more, or adopting populus-viewer in your teaching, come visit <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opentower:matrix.org">#opentower:matrix.org</a>! </p>
<p>Populus-Viewer currently supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotation of PDFs with highlights and pin-drops</li>
<li>Matrix conversations based on annotations</li>
<li>Audio and video messages</li>
<li>Replies, reactions, and redactions</li>
<li>Markdown for rich text</li>
<li>LaTeX for mathematical notation</li>
<li>Typing notifications</li>
<li>Synchronized reading position across devices</li>
<li>SSO, with single-click links for embedding in an LMS like Canvas or Blackboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the project develops, I'm hoping to continue to polish the reading experience, and to add support for other mime types (audio and video especially).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension">Dimension</a>, an integration manager alternative for Element, has received a bunch of updates over the last couple weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added (early) support for <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot</a>'s GitHub, Jira, and Webhooks bridging. </li>
<li>Most of a redesign complete to make it feel more like an Element UI rather than something special and third party.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in helping out in getting the redesign finished, please check out https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension/issues/458 which has reference mockups and linked issues. The major parts are the &quot;complex bots&quot; (Travis CI, RSS, etc) and the sticker integration. Unfortunately, I don't have enough free time to work on it myself in the near term, but will get back to it eventually 🙂 </p>

<p>I made this project a while ago to hack in a relay mode to the <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/facebook">mautrix Facebook bridge</a>. But as of this week, that bridge supports relaying natively! 🎉 Thus, my main motivation for maintaining imposter-bot is obsolete, and the project will be on indefinite hiatus.</p>
<p>With that said, it can (mostly) still be used to add relay support to any bridges that don't yet support a relay mode themselves--but native relay support is always better!</p>

<p>A project has started to re-implement the venerable mIRCstats for Matrix!

However, we're moving quickly, and I hope to have some initial easy-to-use viz in place over the Christmas break.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo K.</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Board games are great. And Matrix and its widget api turned out to be an excellent environment to create collaborative board games. With some really impressive conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't have to maintain a server with a database.</li>
<li>I don't have to create a custom account systems user need to register. They play with their matrix account, which also makes accessibility great. Someone invites you in a room with the game and you can play!</li>
<li>I just need to host one static file and ppl will be able to play as long as that static site exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project tries to be two things. A tech demo and inspiration to what is possible with widgets (Especially, with the changes on how widgets can be displayed in element (Check the &quot;matrix live&quot; Demos! 😊) )
Second it should serve as source and resource. For ideas and solutions on how no trust games can be executed without server (third party) side logic. And, for the ones interested, also as a resource on how widgets are implemented.</p>
<p>Last but not least the game Saint Petersburg is really fun. It takes a couple of minutes to grasp the rules but it is one of those games where there are so many things that can be considered with simple rules that it becomes more and more exciting with each round. So I really invite you to check out the <a href="https://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/rules4/Saint%20Petersburg%20-%20rules.pdf">rules</a> and give it a try. Its best to start in the <a href="https://github.com/toger5/st-petersburg-widget">Git Repo</a> or join the this room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#st-petersburg-auth:matrix.org">#st-petersburg-auth:matrix.org</a></p>
<p>To put it simple, the widget works like this: The game state is stored in the room state and is updated through the widget directly.
This of course raises <strong>questions</strong>: How is it still possible to prohibit users from cheating and manually changing parameters like, how much money they own. Everyone (who has the permission) is always able to send whatever state events they want?
How is it possible to draw random cards if there is no third party involved. Could I not just send a state event with the cards that I hope are going to be drawn and are beneficial for me. Can we make card drawing deterministic? Not really since then everyone know what is going to happen. Which kind of breaks the game...</p>
<p>I would be super happy, if someone is interested and wants to find answer to the questions above by checking out the <a href="https://github.com/toger5/st-petersburg-widget/blob/main/README.md">README</a>.

<p>Last week the Matrix Scientists had turned this room into a portal to TWIM bot's ship tank so we could all fuel it with news about our work. The spec and hookshot news were reported late when the tank was already full, sending TWIM bot's ship into hyperspeed mode 🚀</p>
<p>We lost contact with the bot for a few days but managed to restore a connection with it. It appeared to have crashed on the green planet of Fuj'ehr. Its ship shattered in pieces at impact! 💥</p>
<p>The bot managed to find most of them, but some critical pieces of the engine were missing. We needed to find those pieces quickly before the mushy ground of Fuj'ehr swallows them forever! 😱</p>
<p>The Editor has asked the Matrix Scientists to reconfigure the room and bridge it to TWIM bot's navigation tools. Each news report highlighted the position of a piece of engine on its map. 🗺️</p>

<p>Extensible events are coming! With lots of potential usecases to be built on top of the concept (such as threading, polls, and any type of data one would like to through on top of existing room events), extensible events are finally getting some love. New MSCs are available above, which detail some of these usecases. Exciting times!</p>
<p>A small correction from last week's issue: the next aggregations MSC to be focused on (after <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (serverside aggregations) is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2677">MSC2677</a> (annotations and reactions), as it's a more pressing blocker for usecases such as threading and polls.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Spec Core Team is continuing to wind down in preparation for the holidays ☃️</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3015">MSC3015: Room state personal overrides</a>.</p>
<p>Quite a novel concept, and one that would enable many usecases, such as the ones described in the MSC itself.
Check it out if that's something that interests you!

<blockquote>
<p>This week we cut Synapse release candidate <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.49.0rc1">1.49.0rc1</a> It includes a bunch of work to supporta plethora of MSCs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675/">MSC 2675</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/main/proposals/2918-refreshtokens.md#msc2918-refresh-tokens">MSC2918</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946</a>), a crop of bugfixes and improvements to our documentation which incorporate Synapse's old wiki. And as ever, there's a bunch of internal type hinting to keep the Synapse team's blood pressure at healthy levels.</p>
<p>The formal release of Synapse 1.49.0 is scheduled for the coming Tuesday. This will be the last Synapse release of 2021 as the Synapse team prepare for a break over the Christmas period. Releases will continue at the usual pace in the new year, with 1.50.0rc1 slated for 2022/01/04 and 1.50.0 for 2022/01/11.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Synapse 1.49 will be the last version to support Python 3.6, PostrgreSQL 9.6, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic): by our next release, these will have reached their upstream end-of-life. If you're reliant on any of these platforms, please ensure you have plans to upgrade.</p>
<p>In other news, we're <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#sygnal-0110-2021-12-09">preparing</a> to release a new version of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a> with a series of fixes for common errors.

This also means that new versions will arrive monthly from now on. New features and fixes in this version include - but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spell checking while writing a message</li>
<li>Improved markdown to html conversion when sending a message</li>
<li>Built-in theme switching</li>

<h2 id="the-adventures-of-twim-bot-continued">The Adventures of TWIM bot continued</h2>
<p>The members of the Federation have been very active and helped TWIM bot to find all the pieces of its ship! TWIM bot assembled everything together and put the engine back in its place... but at the last moment, as it was ready to take off, another bright spot appeared on the map following madlittlemods late report!</p>
<p>How could this happen? All the pieces of the engine were already there! Unsure of what to do, the bot asked Earth for directions. Earth confirmed: it was worth going to that new bright spot on the map.</p>
<p>The bot welded back the plate of the engine casing, made sure nothing could get into the ship in its absence, and started heading to the mysterious spot. The signal of our communication tools with TWIM bot weakens as it enters in the thick forest of Fuj'ehr…</p>

<p>One thing you might not know is that TWIM bot is a space traveler, sent by the Matrix scientists to explore that zone called &quot;The Possibilities&quot;. The <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> room is a portal to its energy tank, and we had received a distress signal!</p>
<p>To help the TWIM explorer fulfil its mission, we asked the Matrix community to fuel it with news before it crashed into space debris made of aggregated ignorance!</p>
<p>This week again, the community has been very active and explored many possibilities of the Matrix universe!</p>

<p>The end of the year is drawing to a close. Thus many of the Spec Core Team members are focusing on implementation in order to meet deadlines. Review is still occurring though! As above, we have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a> (allow guests to send more event types). This was born out of next-generation VoIP work, but it should have a positive impact on improving the guest experience in Matrix on the whole.</p>
<p>Otherwise work is still ongoing by Bruno and others on untangling the aggregations MSCs, specifically <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2676">MSC2676</a>.</p>
<p>And finally, Alexandre Franke has <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3542">PR'd some work</a> to allow for matrix.org's OpenAPI spec to be widely available, meaning anyone with a <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> (or other <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> viewer) client can easily pull it and start sending requests against a Matrix homeserver.

<p>Goooood evening TWIM readers!</p>
<p>I want to start by drawing attention to a blog post which we published today: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/03/type-coverage-for-sydent-motivation">Type coverage for Sydent: motivation</a>. This the first in a series of three articles discussing what we've learned from making Sydent pass the <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/">mypy</a> type checker in strict mode. Improving type coverage across Synapse, Sygnal, and Sydent has been a major focus of the backend team at Element for the past few months, and we think we've learned a few useful things in the process.</p>
<p>This week we also <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/30/synapse-1-48-0-released">released Synapse 1.48</a> with loads of internal improvements, new Admin APIs, better alignment with the Matrix 1.1 spec, and more. We're planning one more release for the year, 1.49 on December 14th, and then we're taking a break until Synapse 1.50 on January 11th.</p>
<p>Importantly: Synapse 1.49 will be the last release to support Python 3.6, PostrgreSQL 9.6, and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) — if you're reliant on any of these platforms, please ensure you have plans to upgrade.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think of the article (and the Synapse release!), and we'll see you next week!</p>

<h3 id="gitter">Gitter</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org">madlittlemods (Eric Eastwood)</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the vein of <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Gitter feature parity</a> on Matrix, we've made the first steps towards a better public static archive. We merged an experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> into <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> which lets you use the unstable <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> client API endpoint go from a given timestamp to the closest event ID. This will allow us to implement a calendar jump to date interface to be able to navigate to any day in the rooms history. Our first target to add the jump to date UI in is <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen</a> since we plan to server-side render Hydrogen for the actual public static archive as well.</p>
<p>To enable the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a> unstable API endpoints in Synapse, add <code>experimental_features</code> -&gt; <code>msc3030_enabled: true</code> to your <code>homeserver.yaml</code>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/client/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/rooms/&lt;roomID&gt;/timestamp_to_event?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;
</span><span>{
</span><span>    &quot;event_id&quot;: ...
</span><span>    &quot;origin_server_ts&quot;: ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Also as part of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>, when you use the client API endpoint, if your homeserver sees that the closest event it has locally in the database is next to a gap in the history, it will go out and ask other federated homeservers what they have as the closest event instead.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>GET /_matrix/federation/unstable/org.matrix.msc3030/timestamp_to_event/&lt;roomID&gt;?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;
</span><span>{
</span><span>    &quot;event_id&quot;: ...
</span><span>    &quot;origin_server_ts&quot;: ...
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> to import batches of historical messages is still marching along getting some polishing passes and strengthening the assertions in the Complement tests to make sure things are going absolutely correctly. It's also good to see <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> utilizing it and catching a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11241">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11219">bugs</a> along the way 💪.</p>

<p>Stop the press. This is a last minute TWIM. We've been beavering away on <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot</a>. It's gained many features in the last week, but the big thing is that hookshot has gained the ability to provision connections over a provisioning API, which means it should hook nicely into Dimension (and other integration managers, in the future)!</p>
<p>Other notable features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple webhooks per room</li>
<li>Support for the username/text fields on an incoming webhook (slack style)</li>
<li>Named webhooks, so each hook now has a sensible displayname</li>
<li>The ability to spawn GitHub actions from rooms using the <code>!gh workflow run</code> command</li>
<li>Lots of new supported events from GitLab, such as reviews and tag pushes</li>
<li>Hosted documentation (so all of the above is easy to setup), it's a bit in progress atm.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're aiming for a release very very soon, hopefully in the next week or so!

<p>We finally figured out what caused the issues with the flatpak on GNOME, especially on Arm. It should now work properly, if you use Flathub. On the Pinephone (and other systems, that don't set a locale/use the C locale), timestamps should now not be needlessly long anymore. Redactions got a face-lift to distinguish them better from normal messages. We added a workaround for Synapse not allowing you to leave a banned room. We now delete the room from the room list permanently if Synapse returns &quot;unknown room&quot; when trying to leave it. Spaces can now show the entire hierarchy in the sidebar (if you pull it out) and you can navigate to subspaces by clicking on them in the roomlist, even if you collapsed the space hierarchy in the sidebar.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">Krille Fear</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we have released FluffyChat 1.0.0 with a whole new design, a lot of bug fixes and huge performance improvements.</p>
<h3 id="new-design">New design</h3>
<p>The new design has bigger message bubbles with fancy shadows and bigger fonts. The contrast has been improved and some elements, like the time on every single message bubble, are now hidden by default. But they are not gone! Detailed message information are now accessible in the new message info page, where we not also can see the message type and the timestamp, but also the whole JSON source code of each timeline event.</p>
<h3 id="spaces">Spaces</h3>
<p>Spaces have got a lot improvements and bug fixes. They have moved to the bottom bar of the chat list (while this bottom bar is still hidden if you have not joined any space yet). The multi account switcher have instead been moved to a top left drop-down menu. So we finally got rid of the drawer, which seems to be a deprecated material design feature anyway. This new UX makes spaces much easier to use. You can long press on them to go to the space settings and long press on any chat in the chat list, to add or remove a chat to (or from) a space.
We still have no support for the spaces summary API though so we don't have yet the ability to discover new rooms inside of a space but this feature might land soon in the Matrix Dart SDK.</p>
<h3 id="multi-account">Multi Account</h3>
<p>FluffyChats multi account is still in beta but got a lot of bug fixes as well. You are now able to sort your accounts in &quot;bundles&quot; which can be very handy. The new account switcher button gives you a much better overview over your connected Matrix accounts now.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>We did a lot refactoring under the hood in our Matrix Dart SDK and have improved our in-app database a lot. On the web it now uses IndexedDB natively while it tunes all database transactions on all platforms. This leads to the fastest FluffyChat experience we ever had and makes the app finally kinda usable with bigger accounts on all platforms. The room list is now lazy loaded which speeds up the app start (especially with multi account enabled) a lot.
Choose your own primary color
This was a long requested feature. You can now choose your favorite color to style your FluffyChat for your needs:</p>
<p>What will you choose? Let me know in the comments. I mostly like blue on my Ubuntu desktop.</p>
<h3 id="new-major-version">New major version?</h3>
<p>Ahhh by the way... What does it mean that we now have FluffyChat 1.0.0? It does NOT mean that the previous versions were not yet stable or ready for daily use. It just means that we make so many changes at once that we thought, bumping the first digit of our pseudo-semver version string might make sense. We totally messed up our versioning and are now going to do it better. Promised!!
What's next?
We are often asked: What is the roadmap of FluffyChat?
Well... we still don't have a clear roadmap and might never have. FluffyChat is completely driven by volunteers. But what I can say that we would like to do in the next months is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better QA -&gt; We would like to write some integration tests, push release candidates before new releases and involve everyone in testing them to offer the best stability possible.</li>
<li>Native video calls -&gt; Yes! There will soon land support for native video calls in the Matrix Dart SDK and we are going to implement this in FluffyChat.</li>
<li>Stories -&gt; Like you might know from SnapChat, WhatsApp or Instagram, stories are little messages you can send to all of your contacts and which will disappear after 24 hours. I would really like to implement this in FluffyChat!</li>
<li>Better notifications for iOS</li>
<li>Deeper support for spaces</li>
<li>Knocking feature</li>
<li>Drag&amp;Drop for web</li>
</ul>
<p>But as I said this is what we would like to do. We can't give any warranties on anything. We can only do our best. But you can help us if you like (You don't have to).</p>

<ul>
<li>On Web, work continues on notifications and integration with homeserver APIs to improve user experience.</li>
<li>On Mobile, link sharing has been added and work is about to start on notifications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Polls</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Polls are nearly ready!  If you enable this feature in labs, you can create a poll with several options, and people can vote on it.</li>
<li>We’re working on the finishing touches, and the first version of polls will be available in a release (on Element Desktop, Web, Android and iOS) within a few weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community testing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We closed 34 encryption bugs which had been resolved by improvements to the workflows and user interfaces.</li>
<li>Due to the overwhelming success with bug squash sessions in the last few weeks, we are making these a regular feature. Our next session will be on Thursday 9 December at 17:00 UTC.</li>

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a>, a multiplatform Matrix SDK written in Kotlin, has grown up since the last release 6 month ago! It has it first release candidate for v1.0.0!</p>
<p>If you don't heard about Trixnity: Trixnity aims to be strongly typed, customizable and easy to use. You can register custom events and Trixnity will take care, that you can send and receive that type.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing is the new trixnity-client module. It provides a high level client implementation and allows you to easily implement clients for Desktop, Mobile and Web. You just need to render data from and passing user interactions to Trixnity. The key features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
exchangeable database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
fast cache on top of the database</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
E2E (olm, megolm)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
verification</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
room list</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
timelines</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
user and room display name calculation</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
asynchronous message sending without caring about E2E stuff or online status</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
media support (thumbnail generation, offline &quot;upload&quot;, etc.)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
redactions</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, Trixnity only supports JVM in all modules, but JS and Native will follow soon (to be exact: when Kotlin 1.6.10 and ktor 2.0.0 is released). I also implemented the module trixnity-olm, which implements the wrappers of libolm for Kotlin JVM/JS/Native.</p>
<p>Cross signing is one of the next big features, I want to implement.</p>

<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (serverside aggregations) is getting lots of updates from Bruno in order to align the proposal with what is currently implemented in the wild (as it's easier to iterate on incremental improvements from a starting point grounded in reality). This MSC is a bit of a special case though, as it was implemented with stable prefixes before the MSC landed (in the before times...).</p>
<p>Regardless, thank you very much to Bruno for going through and finally untangling and help land aggregations in the spec! This MSC is one of four which describe how aggregations should work in Matrix, and it's great to see them finally being properly spec'd, especially as further features start to be built on top of them (such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440/">threading</a>!).</p>
<p>And finally, a further thank you to community members <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3509">an OpenAPI schema fix</a>!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a>!</p>
<p>This proposal aims to allow appservices to get ever greater visibility into what is happening on the homeserver, while still maintaining full process separation.</p>
<p>A lot of the time solutions to complex problems require knowing when a user has registered or logged in, with what name/3pids etc, when users change their emails, etc. Hooking into these non-room-based actions can help with developing useful features. Maybe you want an appservice that plays a sound effect whenever a user signs up to your homeserver!</p>
<p>These days, that is often achieved by homeserver implementation-specific solutions, such as <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/">modules</a> in Synapse. Being able to notify of these events using a standard API shape would be hugely beneficial to generalisation of projects.</p>
<p>So give the proposal a look over and review if that interests you!

<blockquote>
<p>As predicted last week, we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/23/synapse-1-47-1-released">released Synapse 1.47.1</a> on Tuesday. This is a security release which fixes an issue with Synapse's built-in media repository. Admins are strongly encouraged to upgrade.</p>
<p>Otherwise, relatively slow week: a handful of of the team have been away (Happy Thanksgiving, Americans!), but we <em>did</em> release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.48.0rc1">Synapse 1.48.0rc1</a>. Most importantly, this release candidate includes changes to improve the efficiency of large background updates from past releases, which should significantly reduce database load when upgrading. It also adds support for the <code>/v3</code> APIs defined in version 1.1 of the Matrix specification.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about 1.48 when it's formally released next week, but as always, we appreciate folks trying out the release candidates and letting us know how they behave.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver">Matrix Webhook Receiver</a></p>
<p>Do you like to receive notifications in matrix?
Matrix Webhook Receiver (MWR) is an add-on for the <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-webhooks">matrix-appservice-webhooks</a> bridge. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">Webhooks</a> are essentially web interfaces for applications to &quot;push&quot; data to.
The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.</p>
<p>This is where MWR comes in:
It can receive any (JSON) content, optionally reformat it nicely (customizable!), and forward it to the webhooks bridge which will post it to a room for you. If you are running any software service, there is a good chance it can notify you via webhooks!</p>
<p>Right now, several example configurations exist, ready for you to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>GitLab (including Community Edition/self hosted)</li>
<li>Ansible Tower/AWX</li>
<li>Grafana Alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here is the GitHub webhook as seen in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org">#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org</a>:
<img src="/blog/img/webhook_receiver.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>More examples of apps currently in development: Prometheus Alertmanager, Jellyfin</p>
<p>It is also easy to use to send messages from the commandline with standard tools (<code>curl</code>), e.g. for your cron jobs! See the README for an example.</p>
<p>Some other webhook matrix things exist, but often require</p>
<ul>
<li>➖ admin access to server (appservices)</li>
<li>➖ installing and running and maintaining a specific bot per service</li>
<li>➖ create and set up accounts and passwords for each bot to use</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, MWR requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>➖ matrix-appservice-webhooks set up on your server by your admin</li>
<li>➖ some knowledge of how to send POST requests for one time setup. I want to improve that, suggestions are welcome!</li>
<li>➕ MWR can be installed and run by anyone who can access the bridge</li>
<li>➕ one single MWR supports any amount of notifying apps!</li>
<li>➕ you don't need admin access to the server to add more apps</li>
<li>➕ no need to develop a bot/plugin to support new apps, just write a quick jinja template</li>
<li>➕ multiple people can use a single MWR instance by sharing HTTP basic auth credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>Other features:</p>
<ul>
<li>can post into encrypted rooms (see readme)</li>
<li>automatically generated API docs</li>

<p>What a massive update! At this rate I won't need to leave my Matrix client for anything!</p>
<h3 id="matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot">↗</a></h3>
<p>A multi purpose multi platform bridge, formerly known as matrix-github</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks! Some exciting new news on the bridge front: I've renamed <code>matrix-github</code> to <code>matrix-hookshot</code> to better reflect it's not-just-GitHub-ness. That's not all though, as there are new features too:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bridge now supports <strong>Rust</strong> as a companion language (we're aiming to rewrite critical sections in rust). Some parts of the formatting code have already been rewritten.</li>
<li>The bridge now supports JIRA (full puppeting!)</li>
<li>The bridge now supports generic webhooks too, with the ability to write <strong>custom handling code</strong> inside the state event to process these hooks into pretty messages.</li>
<li>Basic support for GitHub discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the works:</p>
<ul>
<li>A provisioning API to hook into integration managers</li>
<li>More GitLab support</li>
<li>Better GitHub discussions support</li>
</ul>
<p>We're not quite ready for a 0.2.0 release, but please check us out at https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the 0.9.0 release last week, we have of course been busy fixing all the bugs different people reported. Messing around with the sticker pack editor and then leaving room should not make Nheko crash anymore. The problems where the flatpak has issues starting on Gnome systems are still under investigation. We thought we had a solution, but that seems to have broken other stuff! 💥</p>
<p>Apart from that we have been doing some after release party cleanup. Apart from some refactorings, you can now filter your rooms on whether they are a direct chat or not in the sidebar. This is in addition to the filters we already had for favourites, spaces and your other personal tags. User colors should also now be much less biased towards blue and jdenticons should have more variance. Expect the next release to be a much more colorful experience!</p>
<p>Speaking of colors, Twily made this awesome ZX Spectrum inspired logo after we changed our Gitlab bot to be more colorful! Check it out:

<p>maubot <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> was released last weekend. Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling encryption should be much easier: the device ID can be entered in the web UI or you can just do <code>mbc auth --update-client</code> to automatically log in and store the access token and device ID in maubot.</li>
<li><code>mbc auth</code> can now log in with SSO.</li>
<li>The standalone mode for running a single plugin with a static config is now mostly functional and <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/maubot/usage/standalone.html">somewhat documented</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I finally took a day to figure out Sphinx/autodoc and made some decent-looking autogenerated <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/python/latest/">docs for mautrix-python</a>. I'll probably extend that to generate maubot-specific API references too eventually.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev">MTRNord</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today is a good day for those calling me a spy, someone not wanting to care about privacy and for those who did publicly harass me for server_stats.</p>
<p>People using the API likely already noticed it wasn't reachable for a while. Effective immediately I am currently leaving all rooms  the bot is part of. This will take days or even months considering this are 6397 rooms at the time of writing. I am not going into the motives of why I am shutting it down. It comes down to personal reasons.</p>
<p>There won't be any dump of the data. The source will be kept public. Note though if anyone ever tries to run it that you need about 600GB of space for synapse, a lot of CPU, a lot of RAM and plenty of workers as this can easily crash synapse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Server_Stats was an incredibly useful project. It pains me a lot to see it go, but it pains me even further that its author got harassed. This is not an acceptable behaviour, and we are better than that as a community. Thanks for this incredible project MTRNord, it's been both exciting and useful.</p>

<p>This week we finally, finally had one of the aggregation-related MSCs, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> (event relationships) enter final comment period! This MSC, along with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issue-406544216">several others</a>, document the stuff that powers message edit, reactions, the upcoming threading and polls MSCs, and much more! So it's really great to see the MSCs start to actually land.</p>
<p>Speaking of threading <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> has had a good amount of review from the Spec Core Team last week. Threading in Matrix has been a long awaited feature for chat applications - as well as helping extend the flexibility of Matrix as a data structure even further. The MSC relies on both <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> (or a modified version of it), so the latter will be an area of focus for review for next week.</p>
<h3 id="spec-prs">Spec PRs</h3>
<p>It seems that the recent <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">Matrix v1.1</a> has drummed up some more community support for spec PRs. Thank you to everyone who's sent in clarifications, changes and even typo fixes. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/ankur12-1610">@ankur12-1610</a> for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aankur12-1610">fixes to the OpenAPI fields, and for typo corrections in the spec copy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Dominaezzz">@Dominaezzz</a> for helping review them. Thank you both! </p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2867">MSC2867: Marking rooms as unread</a>!</p>
<p>This is definitely a feature that I would love to have for chat. Note that this MSC proposes marking <em>a room</em> as unread, rather than a specific point in the room's timeline. This is intentional as noted in the document, as the latter is more complicated, as it intersects with sending out read receipts to other users.

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">↗</a></h3>
<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> we plan to release a <strong>security release, Synapse 1.47.1</strong> on the coming <strong>Tuesday, 23rd of November</strong>; see the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/18/pre-disclosure-upcoming-security-release-of-synapse-1-47-1">predisclosure</a>.</p>
<p>We released Synapse 1.47.0 after squashing a couple of problems related to database migrations remaining in 1.47.0rc2.  Briefly, this release includes</p>
<ul>
<li>new features for users of the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin</a> and <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">module</a> APIs;</li>
<li>a number of long-standing bug fixes, including a thorny bug which prevented joining certain old rooms; and</li>
<li>continuing efforts to prototype new MSCs and improve type coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/17/synapse-1-47-0-released">blog post</a> has a better summary, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0">GitHub</a> has the full gory details.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.1">Sydent 2.5.1</a>, a minor release which improves the way we handle and log various error cases.</p>
<p>Thank you as ever to our community contributors, and everyone out there who's using Synapse to communicate!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> also reminds us</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we release the fix, the changes will be publicly known and bad actors will have the ability to deduce the vulnerability. Most servers don't run release candidates, so releasing the fix in an RC will mean there's a larger window for an attacker to exploit the problem. Internally, there will be an RC deployed to test homeservers and eventually matrix.org. This means we'll be able to confidently recommend the upgrade to server administrators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dkasak:termina.org.uk">dkasak</a> adds</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that's the very reason we have dedicated security releases, instead of just rolling the security fixes into a feature release. The security release doesn't contain anything new apart from the security fix so it minimizes the chance of things going wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep your servers up to date, and your users safe, administrators!</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.7.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement &quot;best effort&quot; basic IRC moderation in plumbed rooms if bot has ops on IRC</li>
<li>Allow configuring topic sync for plumbs (IRC&lt;-&gt;Matrix or one way)</li>
<li>Allow using forward slash (/) as MXID separator for IRC ghosts</li>
<li>Bump max mautrix version to &lt;0.12</li>
<li>Small fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Plumb moderation! If the bridge bot has ops on IRC it will do its best to map kicks and bans (regarding IRC users) from Matrix. This definitely isn't perfect and is meant as a convenience.</p>
<p>Topic synchronization is now configurable for plumbs as well to make it possible to share the same topic between an IRC channel and a plumbed Matrix room. Default is still off and it requires the bridge bot to have enough PL to work.</p>
<p>The separator for IRC ghosts can now be changed to forward slash (/) from the default underscore (_). This happens by modifying the regex in the registration file. Only do this for new installations and it will cause <em>all</em> IRC users to duplicate in rooms who you can't remove and probably other bad side effects as well. The default may be changed in the future.</p>
<p>There were lots of refactoring issues so I hope I fixed all of them 🙈.</p>
<p>Best effort your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>An important note on the interesting projects using Matrix for the login: those are community projects, and there are MSCs in the works to &quot;do it right&quot; at the Spec level!</p>
<p>As Matthew Hodgson <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29242445">reported in a comment on Hacker News</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The direction we're headed in the Matrix spec core team is instead towards replacing Matrix's current auth mechanisms with normal Open ID Connect (rather than wrapping our own OIDC-like thing, as we do today) - as per https://github.com/sandhose/matrix-doc/blob/msc/sandhose/oauth2-profile/proposals/2964-oauth2-profile.md The common login flow would then be for users to be authed by their server using a trusted OIDC identity provider, rather than ever trusting arbitrary clients with their credentials.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have compiled <a href="https://austinhuang.me/matrix-homeservers.html">a list of public homeservers</a> available for registration, since previous such efforts to make these homeservers more discoverable fell through. This list serves as a sanitized version of the asra.gr list, with only homeservers intended for public consumption included. It is a static list and does not include pings, but rather than focusing on the technical aspect, my list has an emphasis on the written rules of a homeserver, which I believe to play a larger role in the Matrix experience. Hope this can spark other efforts in maintaining a better list!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's one very useful list of hand curated servers! The transparency about the inclusion criteria is very much appreciated. Good job!</p>

<p>Hi everyone! Did you ever feel lost in the Matrix world? The room directory is big, but it's still hard to find something you like. Or are you a room moderator, but there is not much activity in your room because it doesn't have enough users?</p>
<p>This is why I want to share rooms (or spaces) I find interesting.</p>

<p><a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1">Matrix v1.1</a> was released! Read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">blog post here</a> if you missed it; it summarises everything that's new in v1.1, as well as plans for the future. Now that the new spec build pipeline and release infrastructure is in place, we're aiming for roughly quarterly releases going forward. Thank you all for being so patient in the meantime!</p>
<h3 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h3>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767: Extensible event types &amp; fallback in Matrix (v2)</a> (yes it really chose that).</p>
<p>Extensible events is something that has been a long time coming in Matrix. It unlocks so much potential, and is even currently being built on (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> (polls)). Definitely one of the next big ticket items to tackle in the medium term.

<blockquote>
<p>Dan (aka callahad) is away this week, so let me report on his behalf.</p>
<p>We cut a release candidate for Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0rc2">1.47.0rc2</a>, but see the changelog for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0rc1">rc1</a>). It exposes new functionality for <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">pluggable modules</a> and new endpoints to the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">Admin API</a>. We've fixed a bunch of long-standing bugs and continued to drive forward efforts to improve documentation and code quality. Thank you to all of our contributors!</p>
<p>With future releaes in mind, we've been continuing work to support threading and E2EE application services. We've also been prototyping a new Admin API to remove users from all rooms belonging to a certain space.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we've been doubling down on our effort to improve reliability and maintainability of our services as a whole. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent">Sydent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">Sygnal</a> have a number of PRs in flight for both, aimed at improving type coverage and driving down error noise in the logs. We've drafted a blog post to summarise the process of type annotating mypy (keep your eyes out for that one). We also worked to make the matrix.org database more resilient, and made changes to improve the experience of rolling out upgrades to Synapse en masse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you love bugs as much as I do? ♥🐛♥</p>
<p>I guess not. For that reason bug fixing in Nheko for the next release continues. We fixed a super annoying issue, where loading keys from the online backup could make Nheko stuck in a flickering mode with no way to interact with it anymore. You can now also click anywhere on a read receipt to open someones profile instead of just their avaitar, edited messages now also show as redacted, if only the original message got redacted and don't lose the reply in encrypted rooms, if the edit was sent by a client, that is not Nheko. You also used to get logged out after registration, which should finally be resolved. There were also a bazillion translation updates! Thank you, everyone who contributed to those.</p>
<p>We also finally merged the prettier video player, which also fixes a video playback issue on macOS. Try it out and give us feedback on it!</p>
<p>We are still hunting down some last bugs, but expect the release soon now. In the meantime, I did start summarizing the changes, if you want to see what will be in the next release: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#090----unreleased</p>

<li>We recently started a project to improve the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-meta/issues/56">info architecture</a>/layout of our apps, starting on the web first. We’re merging our first tweaks and experiments soon, so expect exciting things to be landing on develop!</li>
<li>We’re continuing to implement more Space creation &amp; management support on iOS. We’ve added in Space creation screens (implemented in SwiftUI!) and we’re polishing inviting people to Spaces.</li>
<li>We’ve also been conducting user research to see what parts of the app are tripping users up, and working on fixes to various issues. Expect tweaks to land soon!</li>
<li>Otherwise, we’re also merging &amp; testing release candidates for upcoming releases, merging several branches.</li>

<h2 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h2>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3217">MSC3217: Soft kicks</a>!</p>
<p>Other than this sounding like something out of a workout routine, soft kicks are proposed as a hint to clients that the user has been kicked from the room, but that it was not out of moderation, but for a technical reason (the example given disconnection from an IRC network). The client can then present a different UX as opposed to a normal, &quot;hard&quot; kick.</p>
<p>Give it a read and provide feedback if the topic interests you!

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.46.0">Synapse 1.46</a>! This release includes a fix for the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> from 1.44 which could cause smaller hosts to lock up when clients reconnected after some time offline.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.46 also includes experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440: Threading via <code>m.thread</code> relation</a>, a big step toward threaded messaging in Matrix. It's otherwise mainly a bugfix release, as we've spent much of our time reviewing infrastructure and making plans to improve our resilience should we experience hardware failures similar to what took out matrix.org two weeks ago.</p>
<p>We continue working toward a prototype implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775: Lazy loading over federation</a>, starting with setting up automated infrastructure to repeatedly measure the join speeds of assorted large, public rooms. Our goal is to have a rough proof of concept for lazy room joins by the end of the year.</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.0">Sydent 2.5.0</a>! In addition to fixing bugs, this release passes <code>mypy --strict</code>, uses Jinja2 for templates, and supports the <code>room_type</code> field from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3288">MSC3288</a> to better differentiate between invitations to rooms and invitations to Spaces.</p>

<p>mautrix-whatsapp <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/whatsapp/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> was released. The main change is switching to the new WhatsApp multidevice API, which means the phone doesn't need to be connected 24/7 anymore. The release also includes a new backfilling system using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a>, and making the relaybot mode less special-cased and more like what mautrix-signal does.</p>

<h3 id="heisenbridge">Heisenbridge <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/">↗</a></h3>
<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.5.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow opening multiple simultaneous connections to the same network</li>
<li>New STOP/STAHP ROOM command to end a long paste flood</li>
<li>Clear channel send queue if the user gets kicked to prevent continuing flood on rejoin</li>
<li>New KB ROOM command to do a proper kick &amp; ban (contributed by GitHub user @blastrock, thanks!)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most useful feature this week is having the ability to open multiple connections to the same network. This can be used to plumb channels with a secondary connection while using the bridge as yourself with the main one. You can also STAHP long pastes from being actually sent out completely to a channel if you weren't careful enough on Matrix side.</p>
<p>Upgrading from previous version to v1.5.0 will cause a small migration for every channel/pm that is open so it might take a little longer for the first startup to complete. If no multiple network connections are opened it is safe to downgrade but if someone uses the feature it will cause shenanigans for the duplicate networks in the older version.</p>
<p>Inject your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are preparing for a release! That means, if you are translator, we could use your help to get our translations <a href="https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/">updated</a> and if you want to have a bug fixed before release, now is the time to report it or complain about it! Please come and see us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> for complaints and questions!</p>
<p>We saw a lot of translation updates by Linerly, Priit and Thulinma already. The click ghosting issue in the room list should be fixed as well as the crash when accepting an invite from your browser. You can now register on matrix.org again, after fighting with some... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3471">reality deforming wording in the spec</a>. Notifications on macOS now use the &quot;modern&quot; API for notifications, including grouping notifications by room. (Expect more fancy improvements there in the future!) The warning about mentioning the whole room now vanishes properly, hiding space children from the roomlist now doesn't hide them from the space itself anymore, the loading spinner shouldn't show in a fully loaded room again, the room directory search bar is now focused by default and a few smaller fixes.</p>
<p>We also completed the bootstrapping UI now. This means you get prompted for unverified devices, when your device isn't verified or when cross-signing isn't configured for your account yet and you are given ways to remedy that.</p>
<p>We have a few more bug fixes we want to land before the release, so don't expect it tomorrow, but we have the featureset down now. And if you thought the changes listed in this snippet are long, wait for the full release changelog. It will probably take a few days for me to tidy that up and I think this will be our biggest release yet! Happy testing, everyone!</p>

<li>Release 1.3.6 is finally live on the PlayStore! Release 1.3.7 is expected for the beginning of next week.</li>
<li>We have started to implement threading of messages.</li>
<li>Draft for voice message has been delayed, we want to ensure that it’s working well before releasing it.</li>
<li>We are doing lots of internal migrations: Dagger to Hild, MvRx to Mavericks2, Rx to coroutines Flow.</li>
<li>And as always, we are trying to keep the app as stable as possible, and as reliable as possible</li>
<li>It’s also worth noting that the SDK 1.3.6 has some improvements in the login API, not needed for Element Android, but requested by other users of the SDK.</li>

<p>Godot-Matrix is a C++ module for connecting to Matrix from the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Game Engine</a>.
I refurbished it and the changes made it upstream now ^_^, thx vurpo! :<br />
https://www.matrix.org/docs/projects/sdk/godot-matrix/</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed compilation for 3.x Godot branch</li>
<li>Support plain http too for local tests with Conduit</li>
<li>Respect port numbers (as per Matrix spec)</li>
<li>Substantial rewrite of the example so it works</li>
</ul>
<p>Refurbishment made with love for the participants of <a href="https://itch.io/jam/fedijam-4">FediJam 4</a>, a weeklong gamedev competition with the focus on fediverse and federated multiplayer (via Matrix or any other means ^_^).

<p>New release of the Commander of <a href="https://etke.cc">etke.cc</a> backoffice is <del>coming</del> here!
New version brings new neat features and extends arsenal of the antispam tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://buymeacoffee.com">buymeacoffee</a> listings integration - pretty basic, but that's just a first step! So now you can list subscribers, supporters and extras purchases directly in matrix room (spolier: next releases will bring notifications about new subscribers, supporters and purchases)</li>
<li>rate limiter for http forms - no one can bother you if you don't want that! So now you can configure specific rate limits per form</li>
<li>enhanced email validation (mostly used in the forms module) - you had spam hosts and emails list before, but now you have MX records checks, regular expressions check and some other useful tricks to <del>hold the door</del> stop spammers</li>
<li>... and some small changes, like doc updates and auto-shrink of long messages to fit into matrix payload limits</li>

<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: Europe is close to officially regulating big corporations and forcing them to open their silos via the Digital Markets Act. Element joined forces with other companies to make sure that the members of the European Commission about to vote on the regulation knew how important it is.</p>
<p>Matrix was created to break the silos, as an interoperable layer for all communications. We wanted to ensure people had the ability to choose where their data is stored, and had the choice of interface to access them. This was also a good way to enable better competition and innovation in the communication space, forcing the players to compete on value add. But whilst Matrix is already a 39M users open network in itself, it could be even better if the bigger silos decided to open up and participate into it.</p>
<p>In December last year, as part of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Commission proposed to update the competition law for digital markets with rules mandating ‘gatekeeping’ platforms to open up, in order to enable innovation and data sovereignty. </p>
<p>This move is so aligned with Matrix and Element’s mission, that Element joined over twenty other organisations to launch the Coalition for Competitive Digital Markets on Tuesday the 26th. The coalition supports stronger rules for large online platforms in the DMA, calling for amendments to it to make sure that major services offer a public API to interact with their core services and to ban the pre-installation and default setting of core platform apps.</p>
<p>Matrix is a perfect example of how technology can thrive through openness and collaboration. We will bring our experiences of using federated and decentralised technologies to MEPs and Council members, in the hope for a regulatory framework which supports European innovation, competition and interoperability. </p>

<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the weekend, one of the servers backing matrix.org suffered a hardware failure, leading to around half an hour of downtime as we failed over to another system. Remediating and monitoring that has been the focus of much of the Synapse team over the past week.</p>
<p>We also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.46.0rc1">shipped a release candidate</a> for Synapse 1.46, due for formal release next week. Notably, we believe this solves a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> which was introduced in Synapse 1.44. If you've been experiencing long hangs or other periods of unresponsiveness, please try upgrading to <code>1.46.0rc1</code> and let us know if it resolves your issues.</p>
<p>The Synapse team has also decided to aim for building a rough prototype of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775: Lazy loading over federation</a> by the end of the year, in hopes that this will pave the way to extremely fast joins of large rooms.</p>
<p>We're also continuing to work on static type checking in our projects: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/448">As of today</a>, Sydent passes <code>mypy --strict</code>! We hope to write about what we've learned in the near future.</p>

<p>Here's an addendum about Sydent. We can see the results of our efforts visually, thanks to mypy's reporting options. Two different metrics show increasing coverage since our typing efforts began in the summer. The grey strip shows the last fortnight's sprint in particular.

Sunday Nkwuda and Olatunji Ajayi, with help from Pirate Praveen, are planning on writing support for MAM in XMPP.js (the XMPP library that Bifrost uses), and then adding MAM support to Bifröst.

<p>I work on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs">Collabs</a>, a library for making decentralized collaborative apps, and we have some demos that run on Matrix!  E.g., in a widget-capable client like Element, send the message:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>/addwidget https://compoventuals-tests.herokuapp.com/host.html?network=matrix&amp;container=demos/rich-text/dist/rich_text.html
</span></code></pre>
<p>to add a collaborative text editor widget.  (Fair warning: loading and saving is flaky, so don't type anything you can't afford to lose.)</p>
<p>All collaboration happens using messages sent to the Matrix room.  So, you're not dependent on any external service provider, and the document is end-to-end encrypted if your room is.</p>
<p>We have more demos <a href="https://compoventuals-tests.herokuapp.com/">here</a>, with instructions on how to use them in a widget.  You can follow those same instructions to run your own Collabs apps (<a href="https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/blob/master/collabs/docs/getting_started_guide.md">Getting Started Guide</a>), without needing to host any servers yourself!</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Collabs and see an app running on Matrix, check out my Strange Loop talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exr0iY_D-vw&amp;t=3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exr0iY_D-vw&amp;t=3s</a>.  The library is in an alpha state and not yet ready for production use, but we'll be improving it steadily over the next year.

<h2 id="dept-of-status-of-matrix-face-with-th">Dept of <em>Status of Matrix</em> 🌡️</h2>
<h3 id="sync-v3">Sync v3</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> shared very exciting news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a brand new <code>/sync</code> mechanism, dubbed sync v3, for the past few months. This is a complete overhaul of how clients live-stream sync data from homeservers, and fixes numerous pain points with <code>/sync</code> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syncs taking minutes to complete.</li>
<li>Syncs sending back vast quantities of data (e.g read receipts for every room you're in).</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, this new API is designed around the idea of having dynamic sliding windows around a sorted room list for a user's account. The room list can be sorted in different ways and <em>only rooms in the window are returned to the client</em>. The room list can also be filtered down based on various criteria (e.g only rooms in these spaces, with events newer than this timestamp, etc) and a subset of current room state can be requested with each returned room.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>
</span><span>         All joined rooms on user&#39;s account
</span><span>Q W E R T Y U I O P L K J H G F D S A Z X C V B N M
</span><span>
</span><span>\                                                 /
</span><span> \                                               /
</span><span>
</span><span>  \      Subset of rooms matched by filters     /
</span><span>   Q W E R T Y U I O P L K J H G F D S A Z X C V
</span><span>
</span><span>                       |
</span><span>   A C D E F G H I J K L O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z     Rooms sorted by_name (or by_recency, etc)
</span><span>
</span><span>   |_______|
</span><span>       |
</span><span>
</span><span>   A C D E F                                         first 5 rooms requested
</span></code></pre>
<p>This list is kept sorted on the server and deltas are communicated to the client as a series of delta operations (e.g INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE). Multiple non-overlapping windows can be requested and the windows can also change their size dynamically.</p>
<p>This work is still currently in the pre-MSC stage as it's a huge undertaking, but an early, runnable, implementation lives at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sync-v3">sync-v3</a> repo. This works by setting up a proxy sync server which will make <code>/sync</code> requests to a target homeserver, and storing the data in a useful form for sync v3 queries. It then exposes the sync v3 API which can then actually show you real data from your account.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span> +---------+                     +--------------+                                 +----------------+
</span><span>
</span><span> | sync v3 | &lt;-- sync v3 API --&gt; |   sync v3    | &lt;--- normal /sync requests ---&gt; | Any Homeserver |
</span><span> | client  |                     | proxy server |                                 |      Impl      |
</span><span>
</span><span> +---------+                     +--------------+                                 +----------------+
</span></code></pre>
<p>The proxy server also hosts a barebones web client which talks sync v3 at http://localhost:8008/client/ - to get started just point the proxy server to any HS and then paste in your access token to the web client. The web client is <strong>just a test jig</strong> so only has a <em>read-only</em> view of your account and lacks any scrollback, only showing live data. IMPORTANT: generate a new access token before using this client. Do NOT use the token from an existing client (e.g Element web) or else you risk being unable to decrypt E2EE messages.</p>
<p>Intrepid people are encouraged to run a server and see how fast sync on their own account could possibly be in the future. Note that the <em>first</em> sync will be slow as it has to fetch all the user's data via v2 <code>/sync</code>.</p>

It's been a long time coming. Thanks to Bruno and everyone else who's reviewed it so far.</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3214">MSC3214: Allow overriding <code>m.room.power_levels</code> using <code>initial_state</code></a>.</p>
<p>MSC3214 looks like an MSC that's been somewhat abandoned by everyone involved... But since there are already implementations out in the wild, it may be a simple one to get through!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we have spent some time optimising the Pinecone overlay routing protocol. We have added cryptographic signatures to the bootstrap and path setup process for stronger verification and have also reduced the amount of protocol maintenance traffic.</p>
<p>We are also finally starting to document how Pinecone works — you can find these living documents on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone/wiki">Pinecone repository wiki</a> and many new comments have been added throughout the source code too.</p>
<p>We have also released build 88 of the P2P demo today for <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/Tgh2MEk6">iOS</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uK_BcHGiAYHkN6OAA7P73obAquwShRg5">Android</a>. These demos are forks of the Element app with an embedded Dendrite homeserver and Pinecone-based federation. Users can communicate with each other locally on the same Wi-Fi network, direct between devices in close proximity using Bluetooth Low Energy and globally by using internet peers!</p>

<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/20/synapse-1-45-1-released">released Synapse 1.45</a> this week!</p>
<p>This is the first release to support oEmbed autodiscovery, leading to richer link previews for many sites. See the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/20/synapse-1-45-1-released">release announcement</a> for an example.</p>
<p>We also believe that we've <em>finally</em> fixed stuck messages! A <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9424">race condition</a> would occasionally prevent your sent events from syncing back  down to all of your clients. This caused messages to look like they were stuck at the bottom of the room, waiting to finish sending, even though other users would receive and see them normally.</p>
<p>Please shout loudly in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9424">this GitHub issue</a> if you see a stuck message on a server running 1.45 or later. 😉</p>
<p>We've merged a further 9 pull requests to Sydent, making even more modules pass mypy --strict. We're not quite <em>all</em> the way there, but we're close! Most of the &quot;leaf&quot; modules are done, with the bulk of the remaining work to be done is on <code>sydent.http</code>. This is trickier because it's more exposed to the machinery of Twisted, but we'll get there.</p>
<p>We're already much more confident working in Sydent, and hope to apply these lessons to Synapse soon.</p>
<p>(Well, one lesson that won't apply is that type hints are <em>especially</em> valuable in codebases you don't touch as often... but we have no intention of slowing down on Synapse any time soon!)</p>

<p>Heisenbridge roundup!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/">Heisenbridge</a> is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p>Release v1.3.0 🥳</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SOCKS proxy support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CertFP authentication support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WHOIS command and reply formatting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic CTCP support (optional, default off)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compatibility/workaround for Dendrite and Conduit registration configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>README has been improved</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Big ticket items this time around for privacy concerned users are connectivity improvements when using Tor/VPN with built-in SOCKS proxy support and CertFP authentication. Some WHOIS and CTCP has also been thrown in the mix for good measure!</p>
<p>Lately there has been quite a lot of people who are testing Dendrite or Conduit which has led to recurring support issues around some limitations they currently have with appservices. Heisenbridge now supports using and generating a &quot;compatible&quot; registration file (<code>--generate-compat</code>) for them that shouldn't be needed in the long run. I hope to drop this feature as soon as possible! 🍻</p>
<p>While Heisenbridge somewhat intentionally has very little documentation due to not having a refined UX yet the README has been updated with some frequently asked questions about installing and configuring it to the point you can talk with the appservice bot. A self-contained docker-compose setup has also been added to the repository to help testing it without installing anything on your system.</p>
<p>Go grab your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@carl:kde.org">Carl Schwan</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last Saturday we had an improvised NeoChat mini development sprint in a small hotel room in Berlin in the occasion of the 25th anniversary of KDE. In a good KDE tradition, Carl spent this time on improving NeoChat settings. He ported both the NeoChat general settings and the specific room settings to the new Kirigami.CategorizedSetting component. Tobias fixed a lot of papercuts and now the power level should be fetched correctly, we show the number of joined users instead of joined+invited users in the room information pane, the user search is now case insensitive. Nicolas focused on fixing our Android build by making the spellchecking feature compile on Android.</p>
<p>Aside from the mini-sprint, we also made a few more improvements during the week. Tobias fixed the flicking of the timeline on mobile and Carl made it possible for the user to resize the room information drawer.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thulinma added device management to Nheko. You can now also view your devices, that don't support encryption, delete devices, rename them and see their ip address. Additionally there were a few refactorings and code improvements. Most notably blurhashes should now decode twice as fast. Additionally there were a few small fixes to displaying hidden space rooms (we were checking the wrong power level, so in some cases fewer rooms got shown in a space, if they only had a parent set). That's all, was a busy week with lots of lasers!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Element One is here! We’re giving TWIM a sneak preview of the new Matrix hosting service from Element in advance of the official launch next week. Element One* is a consumer-focused hosting option which gives you an individual Matrix account on our shiny new one.ems.host homeserver (with a matching Element Web at one.element.io). However, in addition to being a fast, snappy Matrix account, it also comes with unlimited personal bridging to Whatsapp, Signal and Telegram thanks to mautrix-whatsapp/signal/telegram!</p>
<p>Hopefully this is good news for those of you who have chats with friends and family on these other platforms, as you can now chat with them in one place from Element without having to mess around having to run your own bridge - and accounts cost just $5 per month.</p>
<p>Right now this is a (relatively) private / limited beta intended for the TWIM and EMS inner circle, and we'll be announcing more generally in the next few days / weeks. So, if you are interested, please check it out and sign up at https://ems.element.io/element-one :)</p>
