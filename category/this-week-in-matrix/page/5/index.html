<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>This week the Spec Core Team focused on improvements to the spec source itself. richvdh <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1211">opened a PR</a> for edit events, and yours truly did <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1210">a small PR</a> to clarify the required state of the response to <code>/_matrix/client/v3/login/</code>.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aspec-bug">a lot more open issues</a> available for people to tackle however, so feel free to get involved and help out if you have some spare time!</p>
<p>Finally other than the usual rounds of review by the team, I've been working on a spec process document that aims to explain the practical portions of the text found at https://spec.matrix.org/proposals/, but in a easily scannable manner. Look out for a PR with that in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2871">MSC2871: Give widgets an indication of which capabilities they were approved for</a>! What a mouthful!</p>
<p>Historically, widgets have laid outside of the spec and have only been implemented in a small subset of clients - mainly Element. As of recent weeks though, there's now a team at Element backing the feature. So exciting times ahead!</p>
<p>Regardless, let's highlight this MSC! It solves a crucial problem with a simple solution. Widgets can ask the client they're embedded in to do certain things (if granted certain capabilities), and the client, potentially after asking the user for permission, can allow or deny those actions. This MSC adds the machinery for a further step: the client will tell the widget what capabilities they requested were allowed, and which were denied.</p>
<p>I believe this spec is non-contentious, but is blocked on widgets entering the spec as a whole. Regardless, if this particular piece of the puzzle interests you, or you'd like to read all about widgets in general, the see either the MSC above or this widget spec tracking PR: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/pull/825.

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.4">Dendrite 0.9.4</a>, containing primarily bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bug in the roomserver around handling rejected outliers has been fixed</li>
<li>Backfilled events will now use the correct history visibility where possible</li>
<li>The device list updater backoff has been fixed, which should reduce the number of outbound HTTP requests and <code>Failed to query device keys for some users</code> log entries for dead servers</li>
<li>The <code>/sync</code> endpoint will no longer incorrectly return room entries for retired invites which could cause some rooms to show up in the client &quot;Historical&quot; section</li>
<li>The <code>/createRoom</code> endpoint will now correctly populate <code>is_direct</code> in invite membership events, which may help clients to classify direct messages correctly</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool will now log an error if the shared secret is not set in the Dendrite config</li>
<li>A couple of minor bugs have been fixed in the membership lazy-loading</li>
<li>Queued EDUs in the federation API are now cached properly</li>
</ul>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now has some very dirty hack to render spoilers on desktop platforms. This does not show the reason and not work in mobile mode, doesn't hide it from notifications or from the sidebar. But it is at least something. Similarly we tightened what tags we allow when validating the incoming html again. Also, as a small fix, DMs should now also properly start with encryption enabled when started from a profile and there were a few crash fixes when searching for direct chat partners and closing the window too quickly or when a user uploads a device with invalid keys.</p>

The new reactive <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/940">Timeline API</a> has been progressed, it, too, has some FFI definitions now, allowing mobile client to start playing with it. Crypto-JS, too, has progressed, adding support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/958">de/encrypting attachments in an memory efficient fashion</a>. On the crypto-side, the longer on-going refactor and improvements have yielded another few PRs, too, that have successfully merged, while others are still pending reviews. Other than that, we've seen quite a few smaller fixes and improvements, around logging, docs and the examples.</p>

<p>Matrix SDK written in pure Dart.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in the dart SDK we mostly fixed bugs. Many of those are related to call negotiations where streams were closed in the wrong order, not closed at all or in group calls the call never learned about new members or the call_ids would not match. There were also a few fixes to the background thumbnailing support added in 0.11.1, helper methods were added to easily send the right message corresponding to the mimetype of some media and fetching a timeline for some event id should work properly again.</p>
<p>We have some support to mark a room as either a dm or a group using slashcommands now, you have more flexibility when implementing the SSSS Bootstrap now (using the extra Bootstrap parameter in onUpdate() and to round it all off, we now have nice coverage numbers as well as coverage display on merge request diffs.</p>

<h2 id="six-days-until-matrix-community-summit-berlin-2022">Six days until Matrix Community Summit Berlin 2022</h2>
<p>In less than a week the Matrix Community Summit Berlin is taking place at c-base.
Join us early on Thursday (25th August) for a Barcamp where we will brainstorm, draft and prototype new ideas.
The main conference days are Friday and Saturday (26th and 27th August). We have a schedule all about Matrix hosting, clients and development.
With three simultaneous tracks there sure is something for you to listen to. It's also the perfect place to get to know other community members.
Look forward to talks, workshops, a signing party, a Matrix P2P live test, dinner and barbecue!</p>
<p>We're not planing to stream or record the event. Our focus lies on providing a great in-person activities.
If attendees want to blog or toot/tweet about it, please use the hashtag #MatrixCommunitySummit.
Also, German-speaking folks can look forward to more coverage from the event on my podcast.
https://chrpaul.de/podcast/</p>
<p>Because we've heard about some confusion:
The event is NOT organised by the Matrix Foundation. To minimize the misconception, we've renamed it to the Matrix Community Summit Berlin.
This is an event initiated by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@yan:datanauten.de">Yan</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaller94:matrix.org">jaller94</a> and other Matrix enthusiasts. We also organise the Matrix Meetup Berlin.</p>

<p>Have you ever felt lost in the Matrix world? Too many rooms and spaces to manage? Well, back by popular demand  (with Timo's blessing), I present, The Room of the Week! Every week we strive to highlight a room or a space that we believe deserves attention for discussing interesting going on across the Matrix Network.</p>
<p>Last week, we were serving coffee, this week, it's tea! Specifically, tea at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#tea:matrix.org">#tea:matrix.org</a></p>
<p>Do you prefer sheng or shu puerh? Maybe bit more into lapsang, liuan or perhaps cliff oolongs? Greens or whites? Sencha? Having mood to discuss impact of varios clays and pot shapes? Is it better warm up water in bofura, tetsubin or electric kettle? Simply everything about the tea.</p>
<p>Come join us while the kettle is whistling.</p>
<p>If you have a room you wish to see highlighted, join us at:
https://matrix.to/#/!bIyiUUnriVoHtYzuPS:fachschaften.org?via=chat.shawnsorbom.net&amp;via=matrix.org&amp;via=fachschaften.org
To get your favorite room of the week highlighted.</p>

<p>The Spec Core Team had another retro this week, and part of what we talked about was how most of the spec PR writing falls to just a few people. Starting this week, we're going to try and diversify that work across the Spec Core Team, both for reducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> and increasing bandwidth of spec PRs. Hopefully the results of that will be noticeable!</p>
<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3783">MSC3783: Fixed base64 for SAS verification</a>!</p>
<p>For those that don't know, &quot;SAS verification&quot; refers to the act of two devices verifying each other through the use of Short Authentication Strings (SAS). This is the backbone of emoji verification when you verify with another user or one of your own devices.</p>
<p>It turns out that libolm, the olm and megolm encryption library, originally incorrectly encoded the base64 output of the message authentication code (MAC) calculation, which is a values that's passed between devices. Due to trying to maintain backwards-compatibility with older clients, this has not been fixed in newer clients yet.</p>
<p>This MSC proposes bumping the MAC algorithm identifier (which is agreed upon between devices when verifying) to a something new, which allows newer clients to know when to use the new or old (and incorrect) method of calculating the base64 encoding of MAC values.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this has no security implications. It's just unfortunate to have incorrect base64 encoding when interfacing with other, non-libolm, implementations of olm and megolm.

<p>The Synapse team is hard at work making Synapse faster and leaner. Work continues
apace on faster room joins over federation, and it seems that the work might land
sooner rather than later, although there are no solid dates yet.
In other news, profiling work is being done to determine ways to hopefully increase
the speed of local room joins and DM creation. Stay tuned for more information in the future on that.
Finally, it was an RC release week. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.65.0rc2">Synapse 1.65.0rc2</a> was released, and it contains some fun features and bugfixes. Check it out!</p>

<p>Dendrite is a second-generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.2">Dendrite 0.9.2</a> which contains the following updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite now supports history visibility on the <code>/sync</code>, <code>/messages</code> and <code>/context</code> endpoints
<ul>
<li>It should now be possible to view the history of a room in more cases (as opposed to limiting scrollback to the join event or defaulting to the restrictive <code>&quot;join&quot;</code> visibility rule as before)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The default room version for newly created rooms is now room version 9</li>
<li>New admin endpoint <code>/_dendrite/admin/resetPassword/{userID}</code> has been added, which replaces the <code>-reset-password</code> flag in <code>create-account</code></li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> binary now uses shared secret registration over HTTP to create new accounts, which fixes a number of problems with account data and push rules not being configured correctly for new accounts</li>
<li>The internal HTTP APIs for polylith deployments have been refactored for correctness and consistency</li>
<li>The federation API will now automatically clean up some EDUs that have failed to send within a certain period of time</li>
<li>The <code>/hierarchy</code> endpoint will now return potentially joinable rooms (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/texuf">texuf</a>)</li>
<li>The user directory will now show or hide users correctly</li>
<li>Send-to-device messages should no longer be incorrectly duplicated in <code>/sync</code></li>
<li>The federation sender will no longer create unnecessary destination queues as a result of a logic error</li>
<li>A bug where database migrations may not execute properly when upgrading from older versions has been fixed</li>
<li>A crash when failing to update user account data has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition when generating notification counts has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition when setting up NATS has been fixed (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/brianathere">brianathere</a>)</li>
<li>Stale cache data for membership lazy-loading is now correctly invalidated when doing a complete sync</li>
<li>Data races within user-interactive authentication have been fixed (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/tak-hntlabs">tak-hntlabs</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This brings our current test compliance figures to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 90%</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 95%</li>

<p>Announcing <code>matrix-appservice-discord</code> 3.0.0!</p>
<p>What? Another week, another major release?
Yes, we want to make breaking changes obvious, and the bridge now requires Node.js 16+.</p>
<p>The release fixes the outdated <code>yarn.lock</code> file. Thanks to the package maintainers of NixOS to point this out! üëã
Furthermore, mentioning Matrix users in Discord got fixed.</p>
<p>And, for the fans of containers, we've re-added the release of Docker images. üê≥
The URL changed and we don't plan to update <code>halfshot/matrix-appservice-discord</code> on Docker Hub.
The image can be pulled from <code>ghcr.io/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-discord:v3.0.0</code>.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now shows you a pretty preview for rooms you are trying to join. This uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3266">MSC3266</a>, which you might need to enable in your synapse config, if you want to see more than the roomid of the room you are trying to join. It tries to fall back to the /hierarchy endpoint, but that won't work over federation.</p>
<p>Similarly you can now somewhat edit what rooms are in a space. I grew up with Windows 98, so this is a very nested right click menu. We are still discussing some of the wording choices for the options there, so if you have any opinions about it, feel free to give feedback about it! This is part of the bigger goal to be able to manage your communities from within Nheko, so stay tuned for more features coming in that area.</p>
<p>red_sky (nheko.im) also improved our notifications code on macOS. You can now disable the notification sound in the system settings, which for some reason requires badge permissions to show that option... macOS will always remain a mystery to us! Similarly we fixed the source text for notifications on Windows, which should now not show a stray %1 anymore as well as a few other cleanups.

<li>That‚Äôs not the only exciting update in EleWeb/Desktop this week, including the newly extended voice messages! Instead of voice messages capped at 2 minutes, users are now able to send a voice note of up to 15 minutes long. Go forth and record üé§</li>
<li>In upcoming releases we‚Äôre also looking at how to improve a user‚Äôs first few days in Element. We know that it can be daunting to stare at an empty screen and wonder how to get going, which is why we‚Äôve designed and built a checklist for new users.

<p>Have you ever felt lost in the Matrix world? Too many rooms and spaces to manage? Well, back by popular demand  (with Timo's blessing), I present, The Room of the Week! Every week we strive to highlight a room or a space that we believe deserves attention for discussing interesting going on across the Matrix Network.</p>
<p>This week, we are highlighting:
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#coffee-discuss:matrix.org">#coffee-discuss:matrix.org</a></p>
<p>A place to discuss buying, brewing, and drinking everyone's favorite morning beverage of choice! I had no idea there was so much Nuance to this topic until I joined this room . For example, did you know there was a correct way to distribute coffee grounds when you first pour to ensure maximum flavor? Neither did I! Whether you are new to the world of coffee drinking, or a seasoned connoisseur of morning Joe, this room has something for everyone who loves coffee.</p>
<p>If you have a room you wish to see highlighted, join us at:

<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.0">Dendrite 0.9.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.1">Dendrite 0.9.1</a>. There are quite a few big changes, including an all-new caching model and several optimisations. This release also moves our baseline supported Go version up to Go 1.18.</p>
<p>The following changes are included across both releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite now uses Ristretto for managing in-memory caches
<ul>
<li>Should improve cache utilisation considerably over time by more intelligently selecting and managing cache entries compared to the previous LRU-based cache</li>
<li>Defaults to a 1GB cache size if not configured otherwise</li>
<li>The estimated cache size in memory and maximum age can now be configured with new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/e94ef84aaba30e12baf7f524c4e7a36d2fdeb189/dendrite-sample.monolith.yaml#L44-L61">configuration options</a> to prevent unbounded cache growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for serving the <code>/.well-known/matrix/client</code> hint directly from Dendrite
<ul>
<li>Configurable with the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/e94ef84aaba30e12baf7f524c4e7a36d2fdeb189/dendrite-sample.monolith.yaml#L67-L69">configuration option</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refactored membership updater, which should eliminate some bugs caused by the membership table getting out of sync with the room state</li>
<li>The User API is now responsible for sending account data updates to other components, which may fix some races and duplicate account data events</li>
<li>Optimised database query for checking whether a remote server is allowed to request an event over federation without using anywhere near as much CPU time (PostgreSQL only)</li>
<li>Database migrations have been refactored to eliminate some problems that were present with <code>goose</code> and upgrading from older Dendrite versions</li>
<li>Media fetching will now use the <code>/v3</code> endpoints for downloading media from remote homeservers</li>
<li>HTTP 404 and HTTP 405 errors from the client-facing APIs should now be returned with CORS headers so that web-based clients do not produce incorrect access control warnings for unknown endpoints</li>
<li>Some preparation work for full history visibility support</li>
<li>Upgrades a dependency which caused issues building Dendrite with Go 1.19</li>
<li>The roomserver will no longer give up prematurely after failing to call <code>/state_ids</code></li>
<li>Removes the faulty room info cache, which caused of a number of race conditions and occasional bugs (including when creating and joining rooms)</li>
<li>The media endpoint now sets the <code>Cache-Control</code> header correctly to prevent web-based clients from hitting media endpoints excessively</li>
<li>The sync API will now advance the PDU stream position correctly in all cases (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/sergekh2">sergekh2</a>)</li>
<li>The sync API will now delete the correct range of send-to-device messages when advancing the stream position</li>
<li>The device list <code>changed</code> key in the <code>/sync</code> response should now return the correct users</li>
<li>A data race when looking up missing state has been fixed</li>
<li>The <code>/send_join</code> API is now applying stronger validation to the received membership event</li>
<li>Fixes a crash that could occur during event redaction</li>
<li>The <code>/members</code> endpoint will no longer incorrectly return HTTP 500 as a result of some invite events</li>
<li>Send-to-device messages should now be ordered more reliably and the last position in the stream updated correctly</li>
<li>Parsing of appservice configuration files is now less strict (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/Kab1r">Kab1r</a>)</li>
<li>The sync API should now identify shared users correctly when waking up for E2EE key changes</li>
<li>The federation <code>/state</code> endpoint will now return a HTTP 403 when the state before an event isn't known instead of a HTTP 500</li>
<li>Presence timestamps should now be calculated with the correct precision</li>
<li>A race condition in the roomserver's room info has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition in the sync API has been fixed</li>
</ul>

<p>After a short vacation, I've done some new work on populus-viewer. Most of this has been UX and bugfixes, but I've added one new feature that I wanted to share. <a href="https://github.com/opentower/matrix-doc/blob/audio-markup/proposals/3775-markup-locations-for-audiovisual-media.md">MSC3775: Markup Locations for Audiovisual Media</a> gives a spec for annotating audio and video on matrix, but it also allows you to annotate images. So, for completeness sake, I've added support for annotating image files in Populus! This might be useful for discussing publication layouts, product designs, or for teaching art history.

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api/">matrix-widget-api</a> v1.0.0 was released yesterday, reflecting the fact that we're not expecting any big changes to the library's architecture for the foreseeable future, and that it's more or less ready for wider use.</p>
<p>It also comes with a couple of new features ‚ú® for widget authors: Sending and receiving to-device messages with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3819">MSC3819</a>, and getting TURN servers from the client with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3846/">MSC3846</a>. Together, these features enable some new complex use-cases, such as doing VoIP from inside a widget. See Matrix Live for a preview of what that looks like with Element Call! üìπÔ∏è</p>
<p>This is as good a time as any to mention that matrix-widget-api doesn't have to just be for web-based apps. If you're building mobile apps with Matrix and want to make use of widgets, running matrix-widget-api inside a web view to liaison with the actual widget can make it a lot simpler to start supporting widget API features. If you're curious, watch Element iOS+Android for upcoming examples of this.</p>

Further more, we've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/903">refactored the examples</a> (now to be found in <code>/examples</code> rather than some sub-sub-directory no one finds) and created two more: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/dfec17e6afbf6c1ea35e9ee968c7668eb4a46a04/examples/getting_started/src/main.rs"><code>getting-started</code></a> combines the autojoin and command-example with a lot more additional inline comment to explain what is going on and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/dfec17e6afbf6c1ea35e9ee968c7668eb4a46a04/examples/custom_events/src/main.rs"><code>custom-events</code></a> showcases how to use the sdk and ruma types to send any custom events (in that case a ping-ack example) over matrix!</p>
<p>This was also a week of fighting the ci. After the integration tests landed, coverage reporting broke and an investigation was kicked off to check whether llvm-cov is in a usable state for us by now (it is not), but a fix was found. We've also started regretting adding <code>npm</code>-based workflows in our repo, as we've found ourselves at the end of an upgrade bug and the saw CI failing without us changing anything :shakes_fist_at_sky: . A fix was found quickly by pinning a sub-dependency. On a similar note, we've postponed merging the kotlin bindings until the android team is back on it and available to answer some questions we have, and the wasm-js bindings showed build failures on CI, which the original author will have to take a look at after coming back from vacation - thus delaying <code>crypto-js</code> a bit further.</p>

<ul>
<li>several more tests have been added</li>
<li>there have been some some front-end improvements</li>
<li>I've also improved the documentation, done some refactoring, and added some helper/utility modules to make things clearer.  My goal is to make it easier for people who don't know Elixir to be able to read and write tests without running away screaming.</li>
<li>compatibility with some Matrix clients has been improved</li>

<p>This week I'm showing off an early look at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive">Matrix public archive</a>. As the name suggests, it acts as an archive of history for your world-readable Matrix rooms. This allows you to view historical content day-by-day and jump back years ago to see what your Matrix room was up to.</p>
<p>More importantly, it also allows Google to do the same thing so you‚Äôll probably start finding Matrix content from your favorite search engine and be able to harness the massive knowledge base stored in Matrix. Imagine seeing Matrix logs instead of Stack Overflow answers when googling questions! The new portal into the Matrix ecosystem üåå</p>
<p>You can also see this demoed in <a href="https://youtu.be/6KHQSeJTXm0?t=583">this week's Matrix Live video</a> (at the top of the page).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/zFISGvYfCIhdqunsrPZMhOF.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Under the hood, we use the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3030">MSC3030 <code>/timestamp_to_event</code></a> endpoint to fetch the messages for a given day and then we sever-side render the events with the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen SDK</a>. Re-using Hydrogen gets us pretty and native(to Element) looking UI and keeps the maintenance burden of supporting new event types in Hydrogen.</p>
<p>If you want to follow what‚Äôs going on and see how it's coming along, you can checkout the project on GitHub, https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive</p>

<p>I was able to to host a matrix-synapse server on termux app on an android device. I documented the process on <a href="https://github.com/medanisjbara/synapse-termux/">termux-synapse</a> github repo And started working on a script that automates the process (final commit is being currently tested before pushing).
It was a &quot;for fun&quot; type of thing. But I can see it being useful for people who do not have access to a raspberry pi (such as myself at the moment) to use as a small homeserver. It can hold up in 1 to 1 Direct Messages and in small rooms.

<p>We've also been at IETF 114 to talk about <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mahy-mimi-problem-outline/">MIMI</a> - an initiative to define a standard for messaging interoperability inspired by the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/30/technical-faq-on-the-digital-markets-act">DMA</a>. Matrix appears to fit perfectly into this use-case, so we've been talking with various folks involved to ensure Matrix is on the radar, including preparing our own Internet-Draft to demonstrate how it could work. MIMI is not currently a working group within the IETF, but the expectation is that it will be soon - we look forward to this happening, and are eager to contribute to the process here - or proposing Matrix itself to IETF as an initiative in its own right.</p>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3554">MSC3554: Extensible Events - Translatable Text</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC covers an Extensible Events (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) schema definition for translatable text! This would allow a client to send a message in multiple languages, with the receiver able to choose which language they're prefer to see the message in (ideally falling back to a default or machine translation if their preferred language was not available).</p>
<p>Like other MSCs that rely on Extensible Events, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a> will need to land before this MSC can. But until then, it's great to see all of the wonderful things this feature will allow Matrix to do!

<p>It's been a week of quite, constant progress on many fronts, most not that visible to the outside observer. For once, the progress on integration sliding sync into element-x for iOS has taken up speed, with many smaller bug fixes and additional features exposed through the FFI being added and performance optimisations. After the internal jack-in testing tool, this is the first actual trial of sliding sync for rust (and after the js-implementation, only the second client to actually use sliding sync overall)‚Äîand it has been tremendous. Latest tests put the loading time to first view on the first 20-ish rooms at a 150ms range üéâ.</p>
<p>More visible to the keen observers of the repository has been that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/874">we've updated the <code>event_handler</code> API</a> to allow removing existing handlers, an important step towards implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/868">completion guaranteeing API calls</a>, and that we've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/882">support for custom encrypted events</a> now.</p>

<p>In addition to that, <a href="https://matrix.org/open-tech-will-save-us/">Open Tech Will Save Us will be back on Wednesday 27 at 16:00 UTC</a>! The topic will be &quot;what makes a platform&quot;, or more specifically: &quot;are Linux or the web platforms&quot;. There are many fascinating topics to discuss, such as &quot;is it possible to create an app for Linux&quot; (it's not as simple as it sounds), &quot;why are some people against theming?&quot;, or &quot;why do developers want to use platforms&quot;.</p>
<p>And to answer that, who other than the Linux desktop most advanced projects GNOME and KDE, and people working on Matrix, the protocol that wants to become as unmissable as the web itself, and more specifically on a deeper integration of widgets with Matrix clients?</p>
<p>You can join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#otwsu:matrix.org">#otwsu:matrix.org</a> to ask your questions on July 27 during the live show, and bookmark either https://stream.matrix.org or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGE2KEasjbc">YouTube stream</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of MSCs moving through the pipeline in the last couple weeks! As always, be sure to take a look at those in Final Comment Period above - only a few days left to comment on them before they merge/close!</p>
<p>Otherwise the Spec Core Team is looking to try and get a handle on the current MSC backlog - this means taking a look at all of the open MSCs, triaging them and organising them into a loose priority queue. This is likely to take quite a while to do and may not ever be complete - but should give us and everyone else an idea of what's expected to land in upcoming Matrix spec versions.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3217">MSC3217: Soft kicks</a>!</p>
<p>The idea this MSC proposes is to add a possible <code>m.softkick</code> field to room membership events of type &quot;leave&quot;, which if present will inform clients that the user has only been kicked temporarily, and they are welcome to rejoin.</p>
<p>This helps with the IRC bridging use case laid out in the MSC.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct server has been refurbished to support the Ubuntu 22.04+ platform. I am happy to
report that Construct performs faster and more reliably than ever before. It's been
a long time since the last update due to COVID-related health problems, but development
has picked up again. I'd like to thank @manu_kamath:matrix.org and @uis246 for their
contributions, and of course Yan Minari for keeping things together over the past year.
Additional work implementing the latest MSC's will continue in the coming weeks so I
encourage everyone to show support in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> and contribute if possible.</p>
<p>Several enhancements have taken place this release, so I'd just like to highlight one
here: The media database has been eliminated and has been integrated into the main
events database. Construct did always store media in rooms by splitting files
into blocks, but it offloaded the content block to separate storage leaving just a
hash of the content in the matrix event. Construct now stores blocks directly in event
content via hardware-accelerated base64 encoding. The result performs better because 
there's only one database query instead of two, and the room can be shared between
servers in a Construct Cluster.</p>
<p>Construct is a performant and robust Matrix Server and Natural Language Processor.
Please be mindful of any laws in your country which require registering your instance
for commercial use.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan Abolivier</a> announces</p>

<p>This week we've released Synapse 1.63! This release includes a few features such as better rate limiting for invites, as well as experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">MSC3827</a> which allows filtering public room search results by room type. The latter will, once stabilised, allow for better discoverability of public spaces since it will allow clients to specifically look for them. Read all about this new release on the matrix.org blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/07/20/synapse-1-63-released</p>
<p>We've also spent some time clarifying documentation and prompts about the usage statistics Synapse automatically reports if configured with <code>report_stats</code> set to <code>true</code>. The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.63/usage/administration/monitoring/reporting_homeserver_usage_statistics.html">new documentation page</a> lists exactly what is reported and how this reporting works. This clarification work included removing the use of &quot;anonymised&quot; when referring to this feature to make it clearer that, even though Synapse does not report identifiable information about users and rooms, it does report the homeserver's name (i.e. the value of the <code>server_name</code> configuration setting).</p>

<p>Say hello to a new bridge in Matrix universe (or rather fediverse): <strong>Threematrix</strong>. As you might've guessed from the name: It's a bridge between the Threema messenger and Matrix. Threema is a very popular messenger in europe, especially in German speaking countries (it's a swiss company). We've just released our very first alpha version ‚Äì it's a very simple bot bridge for now, but we have quite a lot of improvements on our todo list. Currently, it only works with the (paid) Threema Gateway API product, but we're trying to talk to Threema to come up with a more affordable hobbyist pricing model for bridge use.

<p>If you are reading this a bit early, the release builds might still be cooking, but they should be available in the next few hours. There about 40 more features and at least 30 bugfixes waiting for you, so checkout the release here: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases/tag/v0.10.0 . I'd like to thank as always everyone who contributed to this release, it has been a pleasure to work with you folks and I hope I will see a few of you in the next release as well.</p>
<p>As you might be able to tell, moderation features were a big topic this release. But they are clearly not done yet and I expect more of those to land in the future now that Nheko is fairly mature. There are also a few other cool features planned, so while this release is exciting, there will always be more! Same bad client, same bad... wait, this is not my outro!</p>
<p>Please give this release a whirl and tell us how you like it in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a>!</p>

<li>We have started to work on using the new Realm Kotlin SDK (we are using the legacy Java SDK at the moment): it should improve the stability of the app (and so the crash free session) and improve devX. Nearly all the possible blocking points have been handled. This will force us to use suspend methods, which will be useful for ElementX.</li>
<li>Latest tweaks on FTUE have been merged on develop. We will iterate on a few things, but we are close to releasing the feature! New wordings for FTUE are waiting for translations on Weblate. Thanks to all the contributors!</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bmiller59:matrix.org">Brendan A. Miller</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New project! <code>open-super-dapp-android</code> is a fully open source, open standard, decentralized &quot;super app&quot; including a secure, encrypted Matrix compatible messenger based off of the Element Messenger, and an Ethereum crypto wallet and web3 browser based off of Alpha Wallet. Our mission is to foster, and provide access to, a decentralized and secure digital commons for all. Github repo: https://github.com/2gatherproject/open-super-dapp-android</p>
<p>OSD is a downstream project of Element, aiming to provide the functionalities of a &quot;super app&quot; like WeChat, just as an open, distributed and not-for-profit app instead of a proprietary, closed and for-profit one.</p>
<p>This software is pre-alpha, actively seeking contributors, donors and maintainers/leaders. Get in on the ground floor and help build something amazing!</p>
<p>Currently, Open Super dApp builds and runs with full functionality of the Element messenger and Alpha Wallet in the same Android app, with all existing tests passing. Efforts to further integrate their functionalities are just beginning.</p>
<p>Next steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate easy to use person to person Ethereum payment functionality between Matrix users.</li>
<li>Provide a powerful and easy to use messaging and payment javascript API for use by web3 applications accessed through the Open Super dApp. Produce sample web dApps using this API.</li>
<li>Centralize cryptographic secrets between the wallet and the messenger.</li>
<li>Build a parallel iOS version for iPhones using Element iOS and Alpha Wallet iOS.</li>

<p>This week has seen an merges of many minor, partially longer-pending PRs into the mainline code base: among them a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/851">fix for a longer pending CI problem with Apply builds</a>, an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/854">update to latest ruma</a> and many minor fixes and style improvements. We've also gotten the Crypto-bindings for the JS in web using WASM a lot further, the only thing remaining for a release are some last minute PRs and fixes in the release infrastructure. But the most changes to the code base this week have been coming from the appservice department, who've submitted, reviewed and merged a whopping seven PRs this week, fixing various problems and adding a bunch of appservice specific features.</p>
<p>Beyond purely code changes this week has seen a lot of project starts, too: For ones, with the help of the rust team, the iOS Team has started integrating the Sliding-Sync/Sync V3 into the upcoming Element-X-Series;  the team has put up the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/855">first PR to add integration tests against an actual synapse server</a> (some issues pending); a workshop set out the first ideas for the new upcoming timeline API; and a very <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/868">interesting draft PR</a> was brought in from community member <a href="https://github.com/docweirdo">docweirdo</a> proposing a new API on top of the existing SDK to have futures wait for actual completion - no more sending a message and observing sync for the appropriate response yourself.</p>

<p>Because I don't like having to change my display name to tell coworkers when I'm away, I've written a maubot plugin for an auto-responder bot.</p>
<p>It allows me to signal when I'm away, at which point anyone who sends a message in an existing DM will be sent an automated reply so they know that I'm away, when I'll be back, and how to reach out to me in case of emergencies (it does this once per DM until I come back). When I'm back, I just need to tell the bot and it will automatically turn off the auto-responder and give me a summary of the DMs in which I've missed messages while I was away.</p>

<p>This week Matthew gives us a general update on everything Matrix and Element. What is going on with Sliding Sync, OpenID Connect or P2P Matrix? Let's find out!</p>
<p>We're also pleased to announce the next episode of Open Tech Will Save Us has been scheduled. We will be talking live and interacting with you on July 27, 16:00 UTC (18:00 CEST) on the subject of platforms with people from GNOME, KDE and Element.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3847">MSC3847: Ignoring invites with policy rooms</a></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3786">MSC3786: Add a default push rule to ignore <code>m.room.server_acl</code> events</a> (merge)</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The Spec Core Team took a concentrated effort to work through our priority backlog of MSCs, resulting in the decent amount of MSCs hitting FCP this week!</p>
<p>Thankfully the community has nearly matched this number by adding quite a few more MSCs into the fray. But we're still up by 1!</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most exciting MSCs to move forwards is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676: Message editing</a>, which allows users to edit events (including messages) that they've previously sent. Part of the aggregations work, this functionality has been used extensively throughout the ecosystem. But only now is it making its way into the spec proper. I'm also personally excited about <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2285">MSC2285: Private read receipts</a>, which allows users to read a room's contents without advertising it.</p>
<p>Of course the above MSCs are still in Final Comment Period; a 5 day period where anyone can raise their concerns about an MSC before it is accepted. So if you have any last-minute comments, be sure to get them in now!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2666">MSC2666: Get rooms in common with another user</a>!</p>
<p>Another MSC I'm personally excited about! This MSC provides an endpoint on the homeserver to request the rooms (or spaces) you have in common with another user. I would find this useful for incoming DMs from users I may or may not know. Note that the client may not already have this information if it is making use of <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#lazy-loading-room-members">lazy loading room members</a>, so it needs a way to ask the server for this information.</p>
<p>Looks like the MSC is currently sitting in the Spec Core Team's review backlog. We'll get to it soon!</p>

<p>The Synapse team has been hard at work! This week we published <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.63.0rc1">Synapse 1.63.0rc1</a>. Among the notable features are support for MSC3827: filtering <code>/publicRooms</code> by room type, allowing for better discovery of Spaces. You can read more about that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">here</a>. In addition, the release contains a number of bugfixes, updates to the documentation, and internal changes focused on reducing memory usage and increasing performance, as well as supporting the long-standing goal of faster room joins. More on these next week in the official release announcement!</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can now edit aliases in Nheko! This means you can publish your own aliases in the room directory as well as in the room. If an alias can't be used by people (because it isn't listed in the room directory), that alias is highlighted in red with an easy option to fix it (if you have permissions to do so). You can also easily switch the primary (canonical) alias of the room.</p>
<p>With this the feature set I wanted to have for the next release is complete. I wanted to focus on improving moderation and room management capabilities in Nheko and it does now have a very basic sets of capabilities to do so. I do already have plans to expand on them though!</p>
<p>So instead of working on new features, I will be focusing on bug fixes. For a start if someone has the username <code>room</code>, Nheko will now omit the reply fallback to prevent pinging the whole room. The verification window now also should always be big enough to show its contents and we now properly explain to users, why emojis might look different on different devices fixing an issue reported via Twitter... There is also a new icon for the room directory (it is now a building, very punny, huh?).</p>

<li>Nvrwhere has improved NeoChat's Timeline layout: On a wide window, the bubbles will now be centered in the window, in order to better use the space while not stretching the timeline out too far</li>
<li>He's also fixed several papercut issues around the UI, for example editing and replying using the keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>The browser will now properly open when clicking on a link when using wayland</li>
<li>The first part of Snehit's GSoC project is almost ready to land: The room list is gaining a list of spaces, which can be used to filter for the rooms included in that space</li>
<li>We're also moving forward on the E2EE support, with NeoChat now allowing a user to send an encrypted message into a matrix room - provided libQuotient supports it üôÇ</li>
<li>Tobias is also working on improved Reaction &amp; Emoji pickers, which will allow users to select different variants like skin tones and which will behave better on mobile devices</li>

<p>We encourage everyone with matrix-related projects, products and ideas to come around and give a talk: From the past to the future, from the moment of the idea, the story of the creation or the vision of the future. We‚Äôd like to understand the principles as well as the technology. The conference is from people for people, so if you‚Äôd like to talk about yourself, your community, your organization, please do. Showcase yourself and your relation to the Matrix world. Let's get to know each other!
We aim to compile a versatile program. We are open to contributions of any length, from 5 minutes (lightning talks) to presentations and talks to workshops and hacksessions up to 5 hours. We‚Äôll come together to discover, celebrate and enjoy the world of matrix. Also, if you have any arty, cultural or playful contribution in mind, please offer it.</p>

<p>The Spec Core Team did some shuffling of our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/31">backlog board</a> this week in order to ensure that all in-flight and in-focus items are reflected on it.</p>
<p>Outside of that was the usual rounds of MSC review by team members.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2199">MSC2199: Canonical DMs</a>!</p>
<p>While the name may not make much sense to the layperson, the idea of a &quot;canonical&quot; Direct Messaging room (DM) is one that would always be referenced whenever a DM between two people is requested. That is, instead of potentially having a few different DM rooms with someone, both you and the other person would always know which room to use when DM'ing each other.</p>
<p>We don't really have this today. DM rooms are just group rooms with only you and someone else in them. If you attempt to DM another user, your client will try to guess the best room to use for this through some clever heuristics. What's lacking is a defined way to always arrive at the same room for this action.</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to define one, and would allow other functionality to be built on top of it, such as definitively knowing which room to send user-to-user data into, and to read from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week the Synapse team released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.62.0">Synapse 1.62</a>! It features a lot of changes, including a fairly big update of spam checker callbacks, performance improvements around syncing and device management, improved customisation of <code>.well-known</code> client files, and much more. Read all about it on the Matrix.org blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/07/06/synapse-1-62-released</p>
<p>Apart from this, we've been working on refining and fine-tuning our processes as a team over the past few weeks, which, among other things, resulted in the creation of <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/development/reviews.html">this documentation</a> that gives contributors some insight on how we review pull requests on Synapse. Olivier has also landed his work on running <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/">Complement</a> (our next-gen integration test suite) against instances of Synapse using workers, which is a massive improvement for our CI.</p>

<li>Brand new icons from Remix Icons (https://github.com/Remix-Design/RemixIcon)</li>
<li>Messages can be redacted (for now only by the message owner)</li>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can now edit aliases in Nheko! This means you can publish your own aliases in the room directory as well as in the room. If an alias can't be used by people (because it isn't listed in the room directory), that alias is highlighted in red with an easy option to fix it (if you have permissions to do so). You can also easily switch the primary (canonical) alias of the room.</p>
<p>With this the feature set I wanted to have for the next release is complete. I wanted to focus on improving moderation and room management capabilities in Nheko and it does now have a very basic sets of capabilities to do so. I do already have plans to expand on them though!</p>
<p>So instead of working on new features, I will be focusing on bug fixes. For a start if someone has the username <code>room</code>, Nheko will now omit the reply fallback to prevent pinging the whole room. The verification window now also should always be big enough to show its contents and we now properly explain to users, why emojis might look different on different devices fixing an issue reported via Twitter... There is also a new icon for the room directory (it is now a building, very punny, huh?).</p>

<p>A custom html element, web component, to display the latest messages from a matrix room</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>matrix-room-element</code> -&gt; <code>npm@v0.0.58</code> (GPLv3)</p>
<p><code>&lt;matrix-room-element/&gt;</code> is a web component (vanilla JS/HTML/CSS &amp; distributed un-minified) that can be imported and inserted in any web page, to display the content of a (public, soon with authentication, and private room support) matrix room.</p>

</ul>
<p>It is still heavy in development, and still looking for the right patterns (web components, and matrix).</p>
<p>We're trying to make composable components that can be inserted in any web page, and maybe help users use Matrix as a CMS, embedable anywhere (web).

<p>Your favourite bot for social chats with Signal &amp; Matrix friends just got better!</p>
<p>The bot will now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not show full Matrix usernames to Signal users (they can't use them). It will send their display name if it exists, otherwise their username prefix.</li>
<li>Send message on invite rather than join, as Signal users may not understand Matrix join vs invite semantics</li>
<li>Send read receipts so you know it's working</li>
</ul>

<p>I had the chance to have Ryan with me for a special edition of Open Tech Will Save Us on Thunderbird to celebrate their 102 release, which includes Matrix support for the first time in a stable release.</p>
<p>We covered many interesting topics, such as the importance of specifying the expected behaviour of clients and servers in a protocol to deliver the best experience to end users (wink, wink, reminds you of something?), why Thunderbird was more dormant and is now vibrant as ever, what they plan for the future. I had good fun and I hope attendees did too! Next episode is going to be at the end of July, but you can already join the

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2974">MSC2974: Widgets: Capabilities re-exchange</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC is a relatively simple it. Currently widgets are only allowed to specify their capabilities (what the widget is allowed to do, like reading the logged-in user's display name) when the widget is loaded. This MSC attempts to allow that model to be extended to let widgets ask for additional (or fewer) permissions over time.</p>
<p>I can't help but be reminded of the shift in permissions on iOS and Android here in how they shifted from &quot;ask all permissions up front&quot; to &quot;ask for permission for each thing when it's used in the app&quot; :)</p>
<p>Check it out if widgets are your thing!</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Incoming device list updates over federation are now queued in JetStream for processing so that they will no longer block incoming federation transactions and should never end up dropped, which will hopefully help E2EE reliability</li>
<li>The <code>/context</code> endpoint now returns <code>&quot;start&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;end&quot;</code> parameters to allow pagination from a context call</li>
<li>The <code>/messages</code> endpoint will no longer return <code>&quot;end&quot;</code> when there are no more messages remaining</li>
<li>Deactivated user accounts will now leave all rooms automatically</li>
<li>New admin endpoint <code>/_dendrite/admin/evacuateUser/{userID}</code> has been added for forcing a local user to leave all joined rooms</li>
<li>Dendrite will now automatically attempt to raise the file descriptor limit at startup if it is too low</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>A rare crash when retrieving remote device lists has been fixed</li>
<li>Fixes a bug where events were not redacted properly over federation</li>
<li>The <code>/invite</code> endpoints will now return an error instead of silently proceeding if the user ID is obviously malformed</li>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever noticed that some people are just plain @*%&amp;!¬ß%&quot;+? Well, to quickly deal with what they wrote, Nheko now has a <code>/redact @userid:server.name</code> command, so you can redact everything they wrote (as long as it is in the currently cached section of the timeline). Note that you will run into rate limits when using that and Nheko is not yet applying an appropriate backoff in that case.</p>
<p>Similarly, q234rty fixed a lot of cases where icons in Nheko were either blurry or the wrong size. We fixed a few crashes, the room list should now not sometimes store the wrong order of rooms, brausepulver made large avatars cropped locally (since servers don't guarantee any size over 96x96 when cropped and synapse doesn't properly save the full image size in that case) and added a menu entry to copy a roomlink. You can also now define new powerlevels for users instead of using the existing levels in the room and Jason fixed some compiler warnings when a private member struct doesn't have an explicit constructor on some compilers. Nheko also now downloads the full online key backup when you explicitly toggle the switch.</p>
<p>A more noticeable topic might be, that Nheko now requires servers which support the v1.1 API or later and will not allow you to login or register otherwise. At the same time we also enabled support for the shiny and new knock_restricted rule and all remaining groups code was removed (you know, the feature from before spaces were cool).</p>
<p>I also updated Nheko on my work laptop now and since I was quite surprised by how fast it starts now (while my room count is over 900 !), I attached a video of that below for your pleasure.</p>

<p>Because sometimes you just have to do something else and it might be interesting to some people:</p>
<ul>
<li>I fixed calls not working when trying to use Element Web with a Conduit server: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/8931</li>
<li>I fixed Element Android still using the unstable endpoint (i.e. the one from the MSC, that proposed it) to list aliases: https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/6288</li>

<p>Sometimes fixing something that annoys you isn't even that hard, and since it annoys you, you have some motivation to fix it. I call this Anger Driven Development (ADD).

If that makes you want to contribute to Nheko, don't hesitate to join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> and ask me to help you out with whatever fix you are trying to contribute.</p>
<p>This time I just decided to clean out some issues, that came up in the Conduit development channel and that weren't fixed yet. Turns out it was just a few lines to change and it hopefully makes the Matrix experience better for everyone in  the long run. The changes were also quickly reviewed and are merged now. Do you have any such little fixes that no one hears about, but you are proud of them? Please post about them, I'd love to see them!</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks, a significant push on rust-crypto-support for Nodejs has taken place, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/803">this PR</a>. Major parts are available, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/763">infrastructure to create releases ready</a>, however, a pretty rare huge memory allocation that causes a crash in Nodejs on the CI has blocked progress of the team recently. Debugging this <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/804">costs a lot of time and it is yet unclear</a>, how much of a problem this really is (as the cause stays mysterious), however it has also been seen in the wild on Windows now-- a concerning development.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean, there isn't any development going on. Thanks to the active community around the project, we now have a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/560">fix to prevent us from processing the same transaction twice</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/785">a method to create permalinks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/771">you can now verify sessions through FFI</a> as well as use the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/739">Client Builder via FFI</a>.

<p>Dart Matrix SDK: Version 0.10.2</p>
<p>This week, the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.10.2">version 0.10.2</a>. In this version, we added experimental support for native group call signaling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401">MSC3401</a>. We have been playing with it in our internal clients, and we have to say that we are pretty happy with the result! There are still some bugs, as sometimes a new call is creating instead of joining the existing one. But it's looking great!</p>
<p>We also took the opportunity to fix some bugs in call handling. Now the ringtone is properly properly when rejecting a call. Also, when opening the client, we don't trigger a call event anymore if the call end event is in the sync response.</p>
<p>We also did some refactoring for the sync handler, reducing the usage of JSON objects and adding some try catch to handle issues when handling event room updates. We switched to custom CachedStreamController so even if the stream has already been listened to, you can still access the last sent value.</p>
<p>Finally, when sending messages when under unreliable connection, messages could be sent out of order. This is now fixed thanks to the implementation of a message sending queue.</p>

<li>The room state API is now supported, try <code>synadm room state</code></li>
<li>And with the help of that API we created a command to easily generate a list of rooms and corresponding admins and mods: <code>synadm room power-levels</code></li>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The big news from the spec <del>this</del> last week is the release of Matrix v1.3 üéâ (read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release">blog post</a> if you haven't already)! Roughly three months since the release of Matrix v1.2, this release brings improvements such as knocking on rooms, room version 10, reduced metadata in encrypted messages and the first pieces of aggregations finally landing in the spec proper. And more! See the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release">blog post</a> for the full changelog.</p>
<p>Most of the Spec Core Team has been away this week, thus there has not been much moving forwards. But we do have two new MSCs from <a href="https://github.com/duxovni">@duxovni</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Johennes">@Johennes</a>, which you can view above.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3077">MSC3077: Support for multi-stream VoIP</a> by <a href="https://github.com/SimonBrandner">@SimonBrandner</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC allows for differentiating between different incoming streams of media coming from a single user by adding a <code>sdp_stream_metadata</code> dictionary to Voice over IP (VoIP)-related events. This is a relatively simply addition with useful functionality, such as allowing a single user to share both their camera feed and screen share at the same time!</p>
<p>Check it out if that kind of stuff interests you!</p>

<p>Hi there! I'm Marco Melorio and I'm participating in this year's Google Summer of Code, under the GNOME Foundation. I'm working on Fractal, the GNOME matrix client, with the help of my mentor Julian Sparber. More specifically I'm working on implementing a media history viewer to the app.</p>
<p>To follow my progress on the project you can check out my blog <a href="https://melix99.wordpress.com/">here</a>. I've already published a small <a href="https://melix99.wordpress.com/2022/06/07/introduction/">introduction post</a> about me and a first <a href="https://melix99.wordpress.com/2022/06/17/gsoc-update-1-planning/">update post</a> which includes a mockup and milestones about the project.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week the team released Synapse 1.61, which main new feature is media retention. That's right, you can now control how long Synapse keeps media files around, which should help server admins manage Synapse's disk space usage more efficiently. On a different note, this release of Synapse removes support for groups/communities (which was deprecated back in Synapse 1.56), as it has now been replaced by Spaces. Farewell groups, you have served your users well.</p>
<p>See the full Synapse 1.61 release announcement on the matrix.org blog here: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/17/synapse-1-61-released</p>
<p>Aside from this, the team is as always hard at work on making Synapse better and more efficient.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I skipped the last update, this one is a bit longer :3</p>
<p>First of all there have been lots and lots of updates to the translations! Finnish is now at 100% thanks to the tireless work of Aminda and Lurkki.</p>
<p>Nheko now also shows a nice badge on Unity compatible desktops (like KDE) for unread messages (although that doesn't work properly for multiple profiles being open at the same time due to limitations in that desktop protocol. Thank you d42 for contributing this, may you role a natural 42 every dice throw!</p>
<p>Syldra fixed up the paste behaviour (which didn't properly tie into undo in some edge cases), cleaned up how we find some of our dependencies and made cusor movement more consistent across systems.</p>
<p>Finally we fixed our glare resolution when verifying other sessions, which will be especially noticeable when verifying Cinny, since that responds to verification requests in a different way than I tested before! This should get rid of a whole range of verification issues people might have experienced. As part of our stabilization for the next release, we also fixed a crash on logout because I fatfingered and deleted a return statement, we now send an Element Android compatible height attribute on emotes, properly compile when the C++ version is set to 20, we once again support the current version of the hidden read receipts MSC (so that others can't tell what you read), edits now properly update in replies again, you can close the image overlay again by clicking outside, cancelled uploads properly get removed again, logging out and back in now doesn't mess up your configuration anymore and pinned messages now properly refresh once the events are loaded.</p>
<p>Phew, that was a mouthful. And we are not even done yet!</p>
<p>I spent some time on making Nheko compilation a bit faster again as well as improve startup speed. This might order your room list a bit weirdly for a few days after updating, but should normalize when receiving a few messages in some rooms. With this we now don't need to load the last message in all rooms on startup. This makes Nheko startup now only take 7 seconds on my old laptop (when not doing something CPU heavy at the same time). The remaining startup time is 40% building up the font database and 40% loading the powerlevels for each room. So we do have the chance to speedup startup by probably another 60%. It is unlikely that is necessary though.</p>
<p>When I discovered Matrix, Element was still called Riot. At the time some of the big design changes started happening to make it the Element you know today. One of the sideeffects was that the roomlist was consistently taking up 20% of my CPU on my Laptop, which I used at the time (and am forced to use now again, since I broke my newer laptop). It also used a lot more RAM than it does today. So for that reason I started shopping around for what other clients there are and I found Nheko. Clearly because it isn't a webclient, it had to be faster and use less RAM. Well, it did maybe a bit, but frankly the difference wasn't that much. Especially since at the time it loaded and rendered ALL your messages on startup (kinda). It never removed messages from memory, so it would just continuously render more and more parts of your timeline, which clearly increased RAM usage. It did however never resort the full roomlist, which made it not use a lot of CPU.</p>
<p>Since I didn't know any web development at the time, but I knew some C++, I started contributing to Nheko. At some point I made the roomlist constantly resort, which used quite some amount of CPU, but I quickly fixed that. At the time the most noticeable difference was that my fans didn't spin when using Nheko, but Element did (because of the roomlist sorting, iirc). RAM usage was pretty bad though. So that was one of the next projects, removing all events from RAM and only pulling them from the database as needed. While this means some additional load when switching rooms, it did decrease RAM requirements by quite a bit. Some new features made us still require loading data for every room from the database on startup, which causes quite some noticeable startup delay. The latest changes however got rid of most of that. We now don't need to load the messages from the database anymore. The only thing we still load is a small info object with roomname, notification and member count as well as the power levels of the room.</p>
<p>Since I recently broke my new and fast laptop, I decided to checkout how things changed on my old and slow laptop. Nowadays I am not in 15 rooms anymore, but I am in 900 rooms, but Matrix, servers as well as clients, has also gotten a lot more performant. So in the end I decided to do a little benchmark of where things stand. <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This is completely unscientific and unfair, so please take those numbers with a grain of salt. Almost no one runs such a slow laptop as I do, so likely your measurements will completely different. Even more, I was video recording the benchmark, which makes both clients a lot slower. Nonetheless it does somewhat mirror my personal experience.</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion that with 900 rooms, Nheko takes about 10-20 seconds to load and be ready for use on my system, while Element takes about 3 to 4 minutes. So basically Element handles 60 times as many rooms about 2x slower than it did back in the day, while Nheko got a bit faster or about the same speed on the same hardware (but still 60x as many rooms). I've attached a sped up video to this post, so that you can compare it for yourself. But since a lot of people ask, I guess the reason is that I wanted to see how fast you can make a Matrix client. I think I somewhat achieved that in the startup time department, but switching rooms still has a loooooong way to go. Also it is just fun to implement whatever you want in a client, since you are the maintainer and none can tell you how bad of an idea it is. That's probably the reason a lot of people start their own clients? (Although I didn't start Nheko, I just wrote too much code and people didn't want to review it anymore.)</p>
<p>That's it, I hope your eyes didn't glaze over with me babbling on about things. See you next time! :3

<p>A P2P Matrix home server created using libp2p.</p>
<p>An early-stage home server prototype that communicates in a fully decentralized manner: every user runs their own server locally!</p>
<p>This is achieved with the libp2p library which provides decentralized node discovery, NAT traversal and gossip-based communication capabilities.</p>
<p>The server implements the Matrix API specifications (with many advanced features still missing, like client-side end-to-end encryption), but did little modification on federation side so that it doesn't rely on the centralized domain name system to setup and authenticate other nodes. On the other hand, this means it cannot federate with existing home servers yet, because of the different trust model (domain name/HTTPS vs self-owned cryptographic keys).</p>
<p>Try out the latest Webview client on windows, or on other OSs with Docker&amp;Browser!</p>
