<h2 id="spec">Spec</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> continues to plow through work in documenting, clarifying and confirming the spec. You can check out his project on Github: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/1">August 2018 r0</a>, which should give an idea of both the scale of the project and the amount of work which has been done. Rather than list out individual items as I have been, please take a look at that project, and come chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> if you'd like to contribute.</p>

<h3 id="seaglass-builds-being-generated">Seaglass builds being generated</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass">Seaglass</a>, the MacOS-native client, now has <a href="https://bintray.com/neilalexander/Seaglass/Seaglass#files">automatically generated builds available on bintray</a>.</p>
<p>Seaglass is now a very usable and stable client on macOS. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">neilalexander</a> has been very active this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seaglass has had various updates, including the groundwork for joining and leaving channels, LOADS of crashes fixed, some more work done on avatars and E2E encryption has been fairly well road-tested now
Still need to complete UI for device verification and setting E2E but it works fine in existing channels</p>

<h3 id="quaternion">Quaternion</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has been working on <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quaternion has gained a new way to highlight mentions - with tinted background instead of colored text. Also, the majority of work on rooms grouping is done, and the current master branch features the roomlist grouped by tag (but rooms under each tag are pretty much out of order so it's not really ready for daily use yet).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quaternion is looking for a macOS packager - if someone has the chance to help out in this area, speak to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!PCzUtxtOjUySxSelof:matrix.org">#QMatrixClient</a>.</p>
<h3 id="palaver">Palaver</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@arne:matrix.localtoast.de">Arne</a> came at us with the v0.2.1 release of <a href="https://gitlab.com/MrCustomizer/palaver">Palaver</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few days back Palaver has been moved to Gitlab. And I have since released v0.2.0 and v0.2.1. A runnable jar-file of the latest release can be downloaded at <a href="https://gitlab.com/MrCustomizer/palaver/tags/v0.2.1">https://gitlab.com/MrCustomizer/palaver/tags/v0.2.1</a>. The biggest changes in v0.2.x are the replacement of all the web views with native JavaFX components (as I don't feel comfortable embedding a whole browser stack in a desktop application) and support for read markers. There is a short YouTube video demonstrating the read marker implementation:</p>

<h3 id="neo-client">neo client</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:lain.haus">f0x</a> has begun rewriting <a href="https://github.com/f0x52/neo">Neo</a> using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">matrix-js-sdk</a>.</p>
<h3 id="matrique">Matrique</h3>
<p><a href="http://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> has been working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/matrique-go">Matrique</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrique now has a (basic) room management panel, a working emoji picker, an unread marker and supports playing &quot;m.audio&quot;. It should be available at Flathub any time.</p>

<h3 id="jeon-jmsdk-gene-matrix-jabber-bridge-ma1uta-world">Jeon, Jmsdk, Gene, Matrix-Jabber-Bridge: ma1uta-world</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> is continuing to make progress on his Java-focused collection of APIs and SDKs, he's eagerly awaiting the r0 release of the spec (aren't we all!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeon (https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon) (client2server and application api) has released on the Maven Central Repository with version 0.4.1. The next goal: the stable release of all apis 1.0.0 after the Matrix spec will be released (I hope it will be soon :))
Jmsdk (https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk) the client and bot SDK have released on the Maven Central Repository.
Gene (https://github.com/ma1uta/gene) the lightweight api for android has released on Maven Central Repository with 0.2.1 version.
So, everyone can use this libraries without additional settings and additional repositories.
Matrix-Jabber-Bridge (https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-jabber-java-bridge) the double-pupped bridge between the Matrix and Jabber. I am still working on it and I think it will be released in a few weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ruby-sdk-v0-0-3">Ruby SDK v0.0.3</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ananace/">Ananace</a> has tagged and released the next development version of the <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby Matrix SDK</a> - 0.0.3. He has plans to &quot;finish up documentation and unit testing&quot;, with the aim of making a v1.0.0 release.</p>
<h3 id="mautrix-appservice-go">mautrix-appservice-go</h3>
<p><a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has a new, yet-to-be-revealed project, and in support of this he's been working again on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-appservice-go">mautrix-appservice-go</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-appservice-go">mautrix-appservice-go</a> is a bit more active again: it now has an initial intent API similar to the one in <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-appservice-python">mautrix-appservice-python</a> (which in turn is based on the intent API from matrix-appservice-bridge).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>No release this week, but Synapse has been progressing:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Python 3 port continues at pace, we expect to have a beta to test in monolith mode rsn (Hawkowl leads this)</li>
 	<li>Erik has been working on some federation API refactoring to make matrix.org snappier and hopes to have the new state resolution algo ready to go if not deployed late next week</li>
 	<li>Richvdh has been looking at performance, as well as spec PRs/ Next week will be r0 work</li>
</ul>
Many Synapse maintainers are also doing huge lifts on development of the spec.
<h2 id="matrix-support-now-in-ntfy">Matrix support now in ntfy</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> took a rare 30-minute window away from bridge maintenance to add Matrix support to <a href="https://github.com/dschep/ntfy">ntfy</a>. ntfy describes itself as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A utility for sending notifications, on demand and when commands finish</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but in fact, you also send notifications whenever you like by calling <code>ntfy send</code> from anywhere you'd normally execute shell commands. This will make it really easy to integrate Matrix notifications into any other application!</p>
<h2 id="matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> brought updates to matrix-docker-ansible-deploy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> got a lot of improvements lately:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>email-sending support, so that Matrix Synapse can send email notifications (enabled by default)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd">mxisd</a> Identity Server support (enabled by default)</li>
 	<li>more detailed <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/README.md">docs</a> split into various sections (used to be a single README, but with more and more features it was turning into a wall of text)</li>
 	<li>started keeping a <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a>, especially for backward-incompatible things</li>

Non-Matrix-related aside: as a lazy Brit, I was vaguely aware of the cultural weight language carries in the history of Scandinavia, but didn't realise that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language#Bokm%C3%A5l_and_Nynorsk">Norway still has some fundamental differences</a> ongoing.</p>
<h2 id="giveth">Giveth</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://giveth.io/">Giveth</a> project have produced a bot built on matrix: <a href="https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-bot">giveth-bot</a></p>
<p>For some more context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Giveth is re-engineering charitable giving, by creating an entirely free, open-source platform, built on the Ethereum Blockchain.</p>

<p>The current <a href="https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-bot">giveth-bot</a>:</p>

<h2 id="mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> now has an official 0.3.0 release. Says <a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No major changes since the release candidates last week, except a Telethon update that might have fixed history backfill.</p>

<h2 id="the-end-of-gsoc">&quot;The End of GSOC&quot;</h2>
<p>Well, it may well be the end of the Julian's <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a> experience with the <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a> project, but I think Google will continue to run the programme.

<h3 id="quaternion-new-redacted-message-handling-options">Quaternion: new redacted message handling options</h3>
<p>Many of you will have seen the incredible volumes of spam plaguing Freenode over the last few weeks. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">Kitsune</a> has added new features to <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> to help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In response to the recent spam deluge from Freenode Quaternion has got an option to tidy up your timeline after all the spam-cleaning: you can hide all redacted messages or just those that came from recently joined users (along with the join message). So as long as the spammer gets moderated, it can become inexistent for you.
The experimental code doing that will eventually be moved to <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> for the benefit of <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/matrique-go">Matrique</a>, <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a> and other clients based on the library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is especially cool: moving functionality to the lib for the benefit of other projects makes me very happy. :D</p>

<p>Big updates are on the horizon for both iOS and Android, with 0.7.0 of iOS headed to TestFlight today with a release due once it's through beta &amp; AppStore review.  More details once the releases are out!</p>
<p>Meanwhile on Riot/Web, Lazy Loading members is pretty much complete - just writing end-to-end tests to ensure that encryption still works well when lazy loading is enabled.  Next up is actually progressing the redesign at last!</p>

<h2 id="informo-project-releases-saltstack-states">Informo project releases SaltStack states</h2>
<p>vabd, from the <a href="https://github.com/Informo/">Informo</a> project, arrived to say they have produced &quot;a set of SaltStack states that includes deploying fully working Synapse homeservers: <a href="https://github.com/Informo/salt-states">https://github.com/Informo/salt-states</a>&quot;</p>
<p>They introduce the Informo project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Informo's a project (still a work in progress, currently) that aims at bypassing censorship of information on the Internet, by basically having news items go through a decentralised and federated network made of Matrix homeservers. Since we need to host nodes to this network (at least for testing purposes), we've worked on a working and automated infrastructure using <a href="https://saltstack.com/salt-open-source/">SaltStack</a>, which involved hand-writing a few SaltStack states, including states handling the installation and configuration of working Synapse homeservers. In the spirit of giving back to the community, we're publishing all of those hand-written states (available at the GH link above) under the GPLv3 license. If you want to discuss with us about what we're doing, or this topic specifically, please join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discuss:weu.informo.network">#discuss:weu.informo.network</a> ?
The project is still pretty much a WIP and the technical specifics (even the ones we already implemented in our projects) are still under discussion and subject to changes (as mentioned in the GH repo's readme). All I can add for sure to what we already say is that we'll be working in partnership with NGOs to promote the project in countries where the press is heavily censored, and we're planning on implementing a cryptographic verification chain of some sort to reduce the risk of intentional disinformation.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2018/08/09/synapse-0-33-2-is-here/">Synapse 0.33.2 is out now</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The release focuses on performance, notable highlights include reducing CPU consumption through speeding up state delta calculations and reducing I/O through lazily loading state on the master process
Separately work continues on our python 3 port and we hope to have something concrete to trial very soon – we're really excited about this and expect step change improvements in CPU and memory use.</p>

<h2 id="room-tagging">Room Tagging</h2>
<p>This is not from this week at all, other than that it was new information to me. Actually it's ancient, matrix-wise, but I think it's interesting for those who don't know! Although Riot doesn't have an interface for adding custom room tags (&quot;Favourites&quot; and &quot;Low Priority&quot; come by default), Matrix supports arbitrary strings as room tags, and will display them if you add them via another CS API call. To facilitate this <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> created <a href="https://gist.github.com/turt2live/697d5b3781fb7ab7e11d704ea90e3dbe">a small script, tag_room.sh</a>, which makes it very simple to set your own room tags.</p>

 	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1466">MSC1466</a></strong> Erik proposes a <code>soft_logout</code> field to be added to the body of 401 responses, to better help handling of encryption keys. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/soft_logout/proposals/1466-soft-logout.md">Check the proposal notes</a></li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1452">MSC1452</a></strong> agreement has been reached on Homeserver Warning Messages</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We're going with pinned messages (option 2) and room tags (option 5) as that seems to be where the consensus is: it re-uses existing bits of the spec and room tags also help clients that don't know about this specific room tag to handle the room the right way</p>

<h2 id="updates-on-irc-bridges-from-half-shot">Updates on IRC bridges from Half-Shot</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has been working tirelessly on the IRC bridge lately, so I wanted to update on his recent successes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've recently been working on mitigating the effects of a netsplit on the IRC bridge, and optimising it to start and run faster. This week I trimmed down the heap usage (where the memory usually goes) to just under a gigabyte on my 10,000 matrix user test bridge. Previously it could spike to as much as 3.5GB. This optimisation is still in a testing phase but results are looking positive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For reference here is the memory usage of the Freenode process during startup:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-current.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3445" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-current.png" alt="" width="853" height="268" /></a></p>
<p>And here are the results of my local test bridge before and after the change:</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-before.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3446" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/freenode-before.png" alt="" width="860" height="385" /></a></p>

<p>We also made some internal changes to the appservice-bridge to cache the joined state of all the bridge users and therefore avoiding joining rooms which saves us some time on startup.</p>

<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/2018/08/02/security-update-synapse-0-33-1/">Synapse 0.33.1</a> is out now as a security update release. Please update if you haven't already - it fixes two issues concerning event visibility where if you knew the event ID of an event you could read it even if you didn't have access to it; we don't believe these have been exploited in the wild, but you will definitely want to upgrade now.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Python 3 port is progressing well (all sytests now pass in Python 3, i think!), and intrepid folks are starting to experiment with running it in production.</p>
<h2 id="decentralised-web-summit-matrix-live">Decentralised Web Summit &amp; Matrix Live</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Matthew &amp; Amandine have been in San Francisco for the 2018 <a href="https://decentralizedweb.net">Decentralised Web Summit</a> - so this week's Matrix Live is live from SFO and gives a quick overview of the sort of things we got up to!  Some of the sessions are already online thanks to the (somewhat unreliable) live stream (e.g. here's Muneeb (Blockstack), Amandine, Danielle (Dat), and Zooko (Zcash) talking about their respective governance models &amp; growing pains over the last 2 years: <a href="https://youtu.be/tsz3ffrJDpw?t=12133">https://youtu.be/tsz3ffrJDpw?t=12133</a>).  The summit was a massive success, with lots of discussions about decentralised reputation, UI/UX for decentralised apps, metadata-resistance, the balance of P2P versus decentralised-servers, etc.  Hopefully some of the conversations we had will result in some major improvements to Matrix in the future!</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-01-DWeb-1.pdf">Here are the slides</a> for our &quot;<a href="https://decentralizedwebsummit2018.sched.com/event/Fhlb/workshop-diving-into-decentralized-communication">Diving into Decentralised Communication</a>&quot; workshop, for those interested in a comparison between Matrix/SSB/Mastodon/Status/Vuvuzela/Briar.  They're pretty minimal, as they just formed a framework for discussion, but might still be of interest.</p>

<p>It can also be used to enable bridging of ephemeral events, which synapse doesn't send to appservices (read receipts, typing notifications, presence).</p>
<p>Also, the bridge has a new HTML parser which should be much better than the old one. It might have caused some new bugs though (like m.emote bridging breaking)</p>

<h2 id="coffee-and-the-faqbot">Coffee and the FAQBot</h2>
<p>I've been slowly working on matrix.org the last couple of months, updating the FAQ, updating content and UI/appearance of <a href="/blog/try-matrix-now">try-matrix-now</a>. As you may know, the <a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee/FAQBot">FAQBot</a>, created and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee">Coffee</a>, uses try-matrix-now for it's data, so Coffee updated the bot to start to use some of the new fields.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The final puzzle piece needed for FAQBot has been put into place: https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/extract-web-to-org<br />This is the bit that grabs &quot;Try Matrix Now!&quot; and turns it into questions that FAQBot can use.<br />While I was working on that bit of code anyway, I also added support for the new 'home', 'repo', 'room' and 'language' fields. FAQBot will now give more and better information accordingly. For example, it is now possible to ask, &quot;where is the Riot Android source code?&quot; although it is generally better to just ask &quot;where can I find Riot Android?&quot; which combines several fields into a single answer.<br />4 of 7 items are now completed: https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/FAQBot/issues/2<br />and the remaining 3 items before FAQBot's release are just the final review and integration tests.</p>

<h2 id="new-discord-bridge-maintainer">New Discord Bridge Maintainer</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> has been working stridently on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">Discord Bridge</a> lately, and the project has now attracted a second maintainer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've got a new member of the maintainer crew in discord bridge land (bringing the total count to 2.) I'd like to welcome Sorunome :). They are going to be helping review the influx of PRs, chew some issues and be a point of contact in the community. They've already filled my PR queue up and it's going to help us move even faster!</p>

<p>In other Bridge news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> 1.5.0 is out now, uses the latest matrix-js-sdk and matrix-appservice-node, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/master/CHANGES.md">contains a lot of changes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bruno-unit-tests">Bruno unit tests</h2>
<p>Bruno, the latest and greatest addition to the [riot-web] team, has been working on configuring end to end unit tests. His scripts now install synapse from the metal, install riot and then run a test suite. Take a look at the animation below to get the idea!</p>

<p><a href="@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre Franke</a> tells us about new features in Fractal 3.29.5, and how the project has benefited from <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a> contributors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fractal got a big new release 3.29.5, which includes Eisha's multi-line input (with markdown syntax highlighting) and Julian's room details redesign, as well as his refactor on avatar code which leads to a perf boost.</p>

<h2 id="quaternion-libqmatrixclient-support-local-echo">Quaternion / libQMatrixClient support local echo</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> had a surprising week while working on his QMatrix projects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/me accidentally found a year-old feature branch in his Git and thought of rebasing it in order to <em>eventually</em> continue working on it. As a result, libQMatrixClient and Quaternion master branches support local echo from today. Too bad the same trick doesn't work for E2EE.</p>

                <h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates!</h2>
<p>First of all: we've just released the first draft of the proposal for our next generation State Resolution algorithm as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">MSC1442</a> (State Resolution: Reloaded).  This is the result of a massive amount of work from Erik - if you are at all interested in the problems that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1953">state resets</a> have plagued us with, then you will want to <strong>read the proposal and please comment on it</strong>!</p>
<p>The next step on State Resolution: Reloaded (once approved) is to be able to actually roll it out - and to this end, richvdh has proposed <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1425">MSC1425 (Room Versioning proposal)</a>. This was published at the beginning of the week but we haven't had any feedback yet - again, please read &amp; give feedback as the intention is to start working on this as soon as possible!  Matthew's also been updating the Lazy Loading proposal (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1227">MSC1227</a>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Matrix Spec is now awash with activity, lots of work from <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> and others to accelerate progress. Take a look at the <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">proposals list</a> to stay up to date, or straight to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc">matrix-doc</a> repo and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> room to get the raw activity.</p>
<p>Finally, discussions relating to the spec proposal process itself have attracted attention: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1426">MSC1426</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1421">MSC1421</a>, and we're already trialling the new process (using Github PRs rather than Google Docs) in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">MSC1442</a> (State Resolution: Reloaded) already.</p>
<h2 id="nheko-0-5-x">nheko 0.5.x</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> 0.5.1 is out, and it's great! Get a version for your platform from <a href="https://bintray.com/mujx/matrix/nheko/">bintray.com</a>. I've been using it for the last week or so (on macOS) and found it very stable and usable. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mujx:matrix.org">mujx</a> commented that &quot;highlights were encryption support &amp; desktop notifications on all platforms&quot;, but you can get much more thorough notes from the <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko/releases">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="plasma">Plasma</h2>
<p>It's been several weeks since we mentioned <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/">Plasma</a>, but work on the C2S parts of the spec implementation have been happening quietly behind the scenes. Project lead <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/">Nico</a> said recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've updated the CI test server with the latest snapshot version of plasma. <code>createRoom</code> and <code>invite</code> C2S endpoints are fully implemented and should work as expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find the full list of implemented endpoints <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/blob/master/README.md">in the readme</a>, and also read the <a href="https://gitlab.com/beerfactory.org/plasma/blob/master/docs/architecture.md">architecture overview</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> continues working on <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad">GTAD</a>, and this week has started automatically including docs in <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GTAD is now aware of description and summary fields in API descriptions so you can use them with Javadoc/Doxygen. As a result, libQMatrixClient master branch now enjoys doc-comments throughout its CS API layer - the rest of the library builds in envy.</p>

<h3 id="arrival-of-the-discord-dms">Arrival of the Discord DMs</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>After lots of begging, frustration and eventually an offer of a free lunch (thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">Anoa</a>): I give you Discord DMs.<br />This first cut bridges over existing regular and group DMs to Matrix. In the future we will also allow you to create DMs from Matrix so that you can contact users without even logging into Discord. With thanks to the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discord:half-shot.uk">#discord:half-shot.uk</a> community for helping shape this feature!</p>
<p>Currently this is in PR form but is very likely to make it into the 0.3 release of <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</a>.</p>

<h3 id="half-shot-fixes-the-foonetic-irc-bridge">Half-Shot fixes the Foonetic IRC bridge</h3>
<p>For those who (want to) use Foonetic IRC channels, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> is here for you! Previously this bridge had been down due to invalid certificates, but this is now resolved.</p>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Synapse 0.33 landed on Thursday, boasting 2x speed-ups for /sync and (briefly) meaning that the matrix.org homeserver felt impressively snappy and fast!  Ironically traffic levels promptly grew again such that the synapse master process is now the bottleneck once more, but between incremental state res, python 3 and upcoming room-sharding work we should see the performance fixes continuing to come!  Meanwhile, lots of PRs in the queue for Synapse 0.34 - including Lazy Loading support as per (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1227">MSC1227</a>), and a whole new set of stats functionality for tracking per-room and per-user stats.</p>
<h2 id="riot">Riot</h2>
<p>Lots of activity in the build up to Riot/Web 0.16 - merging the new Slate rich text editor to /develop (try it now!), upgrading Jitsi and turning it on by default (at last!! - again, try it on /develop, although you'll have to enable it in Labs).  We'd be particularly interested in how Jitsi is behaving, as so far for us it's been unrecognisably improved over the previous deployment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, lots of work on Lazy Loading members on Riot/Web and Riot/iOS, and lots of stability perf work in general across mobile.</p>
<h2 id="state-resolution-special-matrix-live">State Resolution Special... Matrix Live!</h2>
<p>And finally, all you could ever want to hear about the new State Resolution algorithm on a special edition of Matrix Live, starring Erik &amp; Matthew!</p>

<p>Matrique now has support for sending/receiving messages (plaintext, markdown, HTML, rainbow), emotes and notices. It also supports receiving images, videos, files and states. I am still working on file receiving functions.</p>

<h2 id="fluffychat-for-ubuntu-touch">fluffychat for Ubuntu Touch</h2>
<p>New to me, <a href="https://github.com/ChristianPauly/fluffychat">fluffychat</a> is a &quot;Simple Matrix Messenger for <a href="https://ubports.com">Ubuntu Touch</a>&quot;. The design philosophy for this app is focused on simplicity, and the hope is for it to complement <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a>, another Ubuntu Touch client.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are you not just contributing to uMatriks?
uMatriks is great and it's superb, that someone has created a Matrix Client for Ubuntu Touch. But sometimes you have a so detailed vision of a user interface, which you want to implement, that you can not just contribute to an existing project. However, I would like to work with the uMatriks developers together. We could use the same push gateway for example.</p>

<p>Dendrite updates for TWIM (before GSoC 2nd eval):
This month we've got most of the federation APIs working on Dendrite. These are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>State APIs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/486">#486</a></li>
 	<li>Get missing events API <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/516">#516</a></li>
 	<li>Query user devices <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/498">#498</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We still need to figure out pagination for backfill API.</p>
<p>On applications services, we've got a lot of APIs working, thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>. Authentication now acknowledges App services, though lot of other stuff is under review. I am eagerly waiting for it to land.</p>

<p>On the same topic, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've had a PR from fadeAce/dirichlet_zby for the server-side implementation of end-to-end encryption support in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>. Will be looking forward to seeing that land as well.</p>

<p>Encryption in matrix-python-sdk should now work fairly well.<br />The biggest parts to write were device tracking and key persistence.

<p>Welcome to This Week in Matrix, let's see what updates the community has to offer this week!</p>
<h2 id="koma">koma</h2>
<p>Announcing his update nearly a week ago, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@radicus:matrix.org">radicus</a> released <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/releases/tag/0.7.3">v0.7.3</a> of <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">koma</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There have been quite some changes since updates of the project were last posted, but the major ones are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Upgrade to JavaFx 9</li>
 	<li>Experimental support for infinite scroll on message list</li>
 	<li>Rewrite ListView to improve performance and reduce jar file size</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="dialogflow-connector">dialogflow connector</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@vurpo:vurpo.fi">vurpo</a> has released <a href="https://gitlab.com/vurpo/matrix-dialogflow">matrix-dialogflow</a>, which allow the use of DialogFlow agents as chatbots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've written a little bot for connecting a DialogFlow agent to Matrix as a chatbot. I did this for my own personal purposes but I know someone else might find this handy as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</h2>
<p><a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New stuff in mautrix-telegram:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>A basic telematrix database import script</li>
 	<li>Improved config for relaybot message formatting, including the option to use Matrix displaynames (instead of just mxid localparts)
I've also been planning an improved Matrix-&gt;Telegram formatting converter and a provisioning API for integration managers like Dimension.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="jmsdk">jmsdk</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> has been working on a matrix client this week. To that end, he has implemented <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk">jmsdk</a>, a &quot;very early version of the matrix sdk and common classes (client, bot, …)&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently implemented the matrix client on the java with full support of the C2S API. It still under development and contains bugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has also been working on a &quot;bot sdk with core classes to write custom bots and appservices.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> has been working on VoIP bridging between Matrix and regular phones using Freeswitch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have successful VoIP bridging between Matrix and regular phones using Freeswitch, for 1:1, both directions! a v0.1 is scheduled in a few days once configuration is possible and a getting started doc is written.</p>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>more voice backends (think Jitsi, etc.)</li>
 	<li>SMS support with Twilio and/or OVH initially</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd">mxisd</a> integration to automatically invite bridge users if needed and suggest bridge users</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxgwd</a> integration to auto-join HS regular users if a VoIP bridge user invites them, so &gt; calls are directly seen</li>
 	<li>And much more in later releases</li>

<h2 id="transform">transform</h2>
<p>A wild <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bettiah:matrix.org">bettiah</a> appeared, announced a completely new homeserver implementation in TypeScript:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been working on a homeserver implementation over at <a href="https://github.com/bettiah/transform">https://github.com/bettiah/transform</a> . It is fairly basic at the moment, but the development experience is straight-forward and even fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm interested to see a TypeScript backend running, and of course it's great to have more homeserver implementations! Some highlights from the <a href="https://github.com/bettiah/transform">readme</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Transform is a matrix homeserver built using Typescript and Redis. It is not fully functional yet.
<strong>Status:</strong> Register, Login, CreateRoom, Invite &amp; Join seem to be functional with riot web client. But quite a lot of functionality is missing and the software is definitely not ready for deployment in a public facing role.
<strong>Design:</strong> A lot of the code is auto-generated from the excellent swagger specs for the client-server api.
<strong>Contributing</strong>: It is early days yet. However, Typescript has enabled safe &amp; rapid progress. Redis streams too seem to have a very well thought out api and the whole thing has been a fun experience so far. Contributions are very welcome.</p>

<p>kitsune writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> 0.3.0.2 has been released - no new features, just small fixes including one for an unlucky typo preventing 0.3.0.1 from generating .cpp files with GTAD.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> 0.0.9.2 is out, another step towards 0.1. Aside from bugfixes and using the latest libQMatrixClient, it features an entirely new timeline layout similar to that of Riot (the old one is still around too). Also, you can now change some settings through the menu rather than by editing a configuration file or registry - including switching timeline layouts on the fly!</p>

So, today I have one project for the api (<a class="linkified" href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon</a>), another for the sdk (<a class="linkified" href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk</a>) but last is very early and non-usable.<br />Also I covered the code with the swagger-annotation and now I can generate the swagger schema from the code. There is an example: <a class="linkified" href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon/blob/master/client-api/generated/swagger-ui/swagger.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/ma1uta/jeon/blob/master/client-api/generated/swagger-ui/swagger.json</a><br />And there is an example of the spec was generated from swagger: <a class="linkified" href="https://ma1uta.github.io/matrix-api.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ma1uta.github.io/matrix-api.html</a> (plain and without sorting or grouping, I'll maybe fix it).<br />Everyone can ask me in the <a class="" title="#jeon:matrix.org" href="https://riot.im/develop/#/room/#jeon:matrix.org" data-reactroot="">#jeon:matrix.org</a> (matrix api) or <a class="" title="#mxtoot:matrix.org" href="https://riot.im/develop/#/room/#mxtoot:matrix.org" data-reactroot="">#mxtoot:matrix.org</a> (matrix-mastodon bridge).<br />Then I want to cover the remaining api (appservice, push, identity but not federation because it isn't completed yet), write sdk (client, bot). And publish api and sdk on the maven central repository.</p>

<p>I am currently writing a high-level API on top of gomatrix. As gomatrix is suitable for bots but not for clients, I decided to write a layer above it.
(The motivation is to provide a backend for Matrique)
It will have similar API as libqmatrixclient, but in Golang.
It is currently under heavy development, and API breaking changes are frequent.
Sources are available in Gitlab: <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/gomatrixclient">https://gitlab.com/b0/gomatrixclient</a>P.s. It is a library for writing clients in Golang. But it also provides useful APIs for basic functions, e.g. getting avatars.</p>

<p>TravisR writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a Terraform provider for matrix. It is still a work in progress, however I plan to have the basics completed in the coming days. The provider gives you the opportunity to create users, rooms, and other objects on your homeserver, making your homeserver part of your infrastructure. This could be useful for people who want to set up a monitoring room, or for setting up default rooms on a homeserver instance. In particular, this provider will be used by the monitor bot (see last week's post) to set up the test homeservers for seeing how the bot scales with increased server counts.

<p>ma1uta says:</p>
<p>I've fixed a few bugs and added some new commands (show status by id and show n-last statuses), and now
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/mxtoot">mxtoot 0.4.3</a> (Matrix-Mastodon bridge) can send public, private, unlisted and direct messages.
There are 4 features left to go:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>show, add and remove follows;</li>
 	<li>show threads;</li>
 	<li>show notification, public and federated lines (and optionally merge them with the home timeline);</li>
 	<li>show account info by id.</li>
</ul>
Also I think to implement a bridge Matrix-ActivityPub as S2S. For example, a room - is a ActivityPub's actor. Room participants is a bot corresponds to actors you follow to. Room timeline is a Inbox+Outbox. Reactions is a likes/favorites. Pinning message is a boost. Replies will be very useful.

<h3 id="and-finally">And finally...</h3>
<p>On the core team it's been an irregular week; as mentioned in last TWIM we spent most of it in workshops working through spec issues as part of the mission to finally get to an 'r0' stable release of the spec across all APIs - not just the Client/Server API.  The majority of this was spent making up for lost time on the S2S API, analysing its various holes and designing solutions to them.  Things are looking promising - we're keeping the work under wraps though given the potential for abuse, although we should see more gaps being fixed in the coming days.  Meanwhile we're aiming to get the r0 stable release out by the end of August.  We also unblocked a few longstanding MSCs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/433">.well-known</a> URIs and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1232">media limits</a>), although in the end the S2S stuff took priority.  On the client side we did a lot of design sessions on Riot/Mobile (working out how the new app design should work on Mobile - watch this space for details!) and also how to speed up app launch (the concept of Hybrid Sync; somewhere between an initial sync and an incremental sync - basically an initial sync which can be interrupted in order to let the user use the app whilst the initial sync is still ongoing) - we'll write up the notes and publish these asap.</p>
<p>We also announced the <a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">Open Governance</a> work which we've been doing in order to extend control of the Matrix spec to properly include the wider Matrix community - the plan is to get the Matrix.org Foundation legal entity set up roughly around the same time as the r0 release of the spec in August, and formally decouple control of the Matrix spec from New Vector (the company we set up last year to hire the core team).</p>
<p>We'd also like to welcome mujx (developer of nheko) and kitsune (developer of Quaternion and libQMatrixClient) to the new core team as we start trialling the new governance structure (which mainly amounts at this point to getting review approvals on spec proposals and changes from the relevant domain experts on the new team).  This brings us to a full complement for the team: Erik (servers), richvdh (servers, crypto &amp; clients), Dave (clients &amp; push/identity) and uhoreg (crypto, general) from the current core team; and Anoa (servers, AS API), TravisR (integrations, AS API; acting with Dimension hat on), mujx &amp; kitsune from the community.</p>
<p>Otherwise, spec work has taken priority over writing software, with the exception of: APwhitehat doing as much federation work in Dendrite as part of GSoC as the current unstable state of the API allows; Michael (t3chguy) has been blitzing through P1 Riot/Web issues.  Next week should be back on the normal (if not better!) trajectory however.  No Matrix Live this week however, as we're all exhausted.</p>

 	<li>added request authentication function which recognises an application service user (partially landed.)</li>
 	<li>username auto generation, which let's you register without username (will be used for guest access later.)</li>
 	<li>We also added a tokens library based on macaroons, however we might not be using it anytime soon. Since it's been known to be very problematic (on synapse).</li>
 	<li>Other small bug fixes not big enough to mention.</li>

We've covered <a href="https://github.com/KitsuneRal/gtad">GTAD</a> before, but I think it's worth including this note from the readme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GTAD (Generate Things from an API Description) is a generator of code from a Swagger/OpenAPI specification. Initially made to generate marshalling/unmarshalling C++ code for Matrix CS API, it can be extended to support other API descriptions and other programming languages with static type checking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> regarding the GTAD 0.6 release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version of API code generator, GTAD, 0.6, has been released today, adding support of variant types, proper dealing with definitions referencing other files ($ref) and more options to override schema names - even defined inline. Most importantly, GTAD has got extensive README.md that describes (most of) the things needed to start writing your own templates! As usual, kitsune will be happy to help those who would like to try it (both with C/C++ projects and other languages).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>libQMatrixClient has been benefiting from GTAD over the last 4 months or so - but this is the first release where GTAD is stable and feature-complete enough to be shared with other projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://matrix.to/#/#gtad:matrix.org">#gtad:matrix.org</a> is the new room for GTAD chat and support.</p>
<p>and <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> 0.3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new version of libQMatrixClient, 0.3, comes out this weekend. This is the first libQMatrixClient release to include (almost) all CS API requests and supplementary (non-event) definitions, thanks to GTAD 0.6. Notably, it now includes jobs to register users, manage devices and keys on the server (no local key management yet - E2E work has just begun). This version also gains centralised request error handling so that clients could deal with problems in a unified way, and support &quot;Consent not given&quot; errors of GDPR fame, so that client authors could automatically open consent pages. You can also trigger logging out of all devices through libQMatrixClient thanks to a very recent addition to CS API spec from <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon</a> - another java implementation of the matrix api (client-server, server-server, application server, push server, identity server) using jax-ws. It corresponds the specification on <a href="/docs/spec">https://matrix.org/docs/spec</a>. On the next step I want dive deep into synapse to parse it's api and fill the gaps of the spec with sending pull request. May be I will write something like a TCK (test compatibility kit).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And an SDK for which there is a sample bot for mastodon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also this project has a very early sdk (client, bot). I will fix it after finishing works with the spec.
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/mxtoot">https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/mxtoot</a> - matrix-mastodon bridge.

<p>I've been building slightly specialized Synapse docker images since 0.25.1 - and running them on my Kubernetes cluster at home. Moved them to being based on the official images now instead of building them on CentOS as I used to.</p>

<p>And here it is. As you may have noticed, I'm leaning much more toward quoting wherever possible, rather than trying to paraphrase. The aim is to keep the content authentic and community-driven, rather than a narrative from one fairly naive observer. The risk is it makes the post awkward to read as it switches voice too frequently. Come to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> and let me know if you have opinions on this.</p>
