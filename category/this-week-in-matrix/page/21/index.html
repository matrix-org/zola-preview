<p>This week we continue Matrix Live Season 3 by talking to community member <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@axx:jaccu.se">axx</a>, Axel Simon from <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/">La Quadrature du Net</a>, a French advocacy group that promotes digital rights and freedoms of citizens. We talk about the work La Quadrature du Net do, with a focus on the importance of decentralisation and how Matrix helps support this.</p>

<p>An implementation for Push-to-Talk for Jitsi calls in Riot has now been completed and is in the review phase. This was a result of multiple weeks of work, with code changes across many different repositories. Will hopefully make a difference with background noise or many participants. Look forward to seeing it land in /develop sometime shortly! Works with both Scalar and Dimension setups.</p>

<p>Welcome to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a>, who has started working on Dendrite as his new day job at New Vector:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's been some progress on Dendrite (?), with a couple of bug getting fixed along with some progress in the implementation of Matrix endpoints, such as the <code>/backfill</code> federation one (documented <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/unstable.html#get-matrix-federation-v1-backfill-roomid">here</a>), which has already been merged, and the <code>/messages</code> one from the client-server API (documented <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#get-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-messages">here</a>) for which a pull request <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/591">has been opened</a> and is currently under review.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a>:</p>
<p>I have pushed my asyncio wrapper of the Python matrix client api class to pypi, so I can use it in a few different projects while the PR to the Python SDK is in an unmerged state. It exposes all the methods on the MatrixHttpApi class as awaitables. <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/matrix_api_async">https://github.com/Cadair/matrix_api_async</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/matrix-api-async/">https://pypi.org/project/matrix-api-async/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>TWIM (but actually over the last few weeks), thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://github.com/d3m3vilurr">a new contributor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack">matrix-puppet-slack</a> v1.7.0 and v1.8.0 have been released, fixing a number of old and new issues and adding support for new types of Slack events, including bidirectional @-mentions, Slack-to-Matrix typing notifications, fixing Slack-to-Matrix image/file uploads with comments, and more!
The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-bridge/">matrix-puppet-bridge</a> projects have gotten relatively quiet over the past year or so, but there's still plenty of bridges with plenty of features to implement and plenty of bugs to fix (and, even more importantly, bugs to <em>report</em>!) for any would-be-contributors who'd like to use a trusted Matrix homeserver as their double-puppetting Slack/iMessage/Facebook/GroupMe/iChat/Skype/Hangouts/Signal/Tox client from which to brag to their friends on the other platforms about how great Matrix is.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been making big progress on his <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a> management UI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maubot management UI has progressed well, but isn't quite ready yet. I think it should be usable by Next Week in Matrix.
It can be used to set up and configure a maubot instance and plugins. Once it's ready, it should be possible to do everything except installing maubot itself through the UI: installing and updating plugins, adding matrix clients, configuring plugin instances, viewing logs, etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee">Coffee</a> continues his streak of TWIM mentions by bringing a new bot to combat abuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/HKBot">HK Bot</a> is an anti-abuse bot for public <a href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a> chatrooms.
This is a bot that really shouldn't exist, but since some people just like to make others' lives more difficult, here we are.
The purpose of this bot is twofold. It can automatically oversee rooms and respond to abuse, based on programmable pattern rules, providing a stop-gap measure in case no human moderators are nearby. It can also automate some tedious tasks via its command interface, the primary one being the complete redaction of all of an abuser's messages.
HK Bot is still under construction and contains dangerous features. Use with caution.</p>

<h2 id="x-sampa-to-ipa-bot">X-SAMPA to IPA bot</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dandellion:dodsorf.as">Dandellion</a> &quot;made an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA">X-SAMPA</a> to IPA bot based on matrix-bot-sdk and discord's conniebot&quot;. This bot essentially lets you use ASCII characters to get an output in IPA. The advantage of this is that you can much more easily type and transmit pronunciation (because you don't need to find the characters).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll just have to make it a bit more configurable, but then I'll throw the source up
When making constructed languages and talking about linguistics, it's nice to get an easily readable IPA representation of a word, but it's really hard to write IPA, which is why x-sampa exists as a way to input IPA with a normal keyboard!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> introduces a new client built on JavaFX: no code yet, but it's built on the previous <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta">Java Matrix</a> work he's been doing. &quot;It will be cross-platform (linux,windows,osx I hope) client with supports of the multi accounts.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> also continued work on bridging via libpurple: &quot;I've nearly got group chats working, with invites (and hopefully people joining and leaving them showing up properly) as well as user's having profiles.&quot;</p>
<p>Work continues on <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">Koma</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the last TWIM update, koma is updated to kotlin 1.3, experimental coroutines are replaced with stable ones. The changes are being tested and should be merged soon. A new contributor has joined, so expect development to speed up a bit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in preparation for the upcoming Matrix 1.0 release, we've been moving ahead with the rest of the open governance plan – and we're happy to announce that as of a few hours ago, the <strong>initial incarnation of The Matrix.org Foundation exists!</strong><br />Watch this space over the coming weeks as we announce the Guardians and finish bootstrapping the Foundation into its final long-term form!

<h2 id="hello-matrix">Hello Matrix</h2>
<p>Alex has managed the invaluable <a href="https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php">https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php</a> for some years, but in two weeks time will be making some changes to the page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just wanted to let everyone know that changes are coming to the server list: I've put up a notice on the site that starting Nov 16th I will only show a curated list of servers I would recommend to join.<br />This reduces the workload for me quite a bit and avoids me becoming some kind of arbiter on what encompasses the Matrix universe… I think it is also more useful for users who are looking for a server to join.<br />And there is always <a href="https://matrixstats.org">matrixstats.org</a> for those who are looking for a more complete-ish list of known homeservers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, if you have ideas on how to continue the project, or would like to step up and get involved in maintaining a list using data and tools from Hello Matrix, please <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">contact me</a>. Alex told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you find someone willing to take up the project of a more automated, self-service and complete list at a later date, I am more than willing to hand over all the stuff I currently have and might also lend a helping hand myself (if I have time then).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a> management API I mentioned last week is now mostly ready. It should be possible to use it to set up a maubot instance and plugins without filling the database manually. There's no UI yet though, so it still means <code>curl</code>ing manually.<br />The management API also supports the fancy plugin reloading stuff which was the &gt; reason I rewrote maubot in python: You can <code>POST</code> an updated plugin to the API and it'll install it without having to restart.<br />I also made a bunch of plugins while working on the API that I used to test the API: a <a href="https://github.com/maubot/dice">dice rolling/calculator bot</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/maubot/media">bot that replies with the MXC URI of images you send it</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/maubot/echo">simple echo/ping bot</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/maubot/xkcd">xkcd bot</a></p>

<p>My lightweight bot/client framework, <a href="https://gitlab.com/Matrixcoffee/matrix-client-core">matrix-client-core</a>, received its first tag ever. Version 0.0.1 is relatively stable, and lies on the doorstep of some refactoring work (ongoing) which should keep the master branch backwards compatible for now, but could make things less stable as I add new commits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out this isn't strictly a new project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[it has] been there all along, quietly powering FAQBot and all of my bots. ? Maybe I have failed to explicitly indicate it as such up until now. (oops)</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> is often found working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a> (previously 'Matrique'.) This week, he has been building <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nsfw:encom.eu.org">@nsfw:encom.eu.org</a>, which is a bot designed to give scores for how likely an image should be classified as NSFW. It's a simple mechanism, you give it an image, it gives you a JSON object with the result. For example:</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nsfw-bot.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3734" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nsfw-bot.png" alt="" width="936" height="1004" /></a></p>
<p>My avatar returned less than 1% probability of being NSFW, which I was actually a little offended by.</p>

This week, Matthew and recent-Matrix-arrival Nad discuss UX for E2E encryption key handling. This is an unsurprisingly complex design question, both in terms of how it should behave and how it should look. Nad shared his <a href="/blog/2018/11/02/user-experience-preview-end-to-end-encryption-by-default/">latest thinking in a blog post earlier today</a>, and you can watch the video below.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</h2>
<p>We've covered the growth of this project several times in TWIM, but I wanted to give a little more attention to the work <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> has been doing with <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>. Synapse is a large Python project with many configurable options, and many optional components, so installing it has sometimes been a challenge. I have seen many reports that using Ansible and Docker, and in particular using these playbooks from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a>, is a more sane way to install Synapse. The tools get a lot of attention and updates. This week, Slavi reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> now has a <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/maintenance-checking-services.md">self-check command</a> that can help diagnose various configuration problems with the setup (DNS records being misconfigured, firewall ports not being open, etc).</p>

<p>Dimension is an integration manager for Matrix. It's written and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>, and allows you to an a pre-defined selection of widgets, bots and bridges to improve your self-hosted Matrix experience. Check out: <a href="https://dimension.t2bot.io/">https://dimension.t2bot.io/</a>. This week, TravisR reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dimension has received quite a lot of updates over the last week. Here's what's hot off the press:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>4 new bridges can be self-hosted and managed in Dimension: Telegram, Webhooks, Slack, and Gitter.</li>
 	<li>3 new widgets are available: Grafana, TradingView, and Spotify.</li>
 	<li>Add your own custom bots for people to add to their rooms.</li>
 	<li>A dark theme has been added and is automatically applied if you use the dark theme in Riot.</li>
 	<li>The overall UI has been updated to be slightly more modern and less bright orange.</li>
 	<li>Various bug fixes and improvements (is it even possible to have a changelog without this?)</li>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> now uses the non-ORM part of SQLAlchemy for database tables that are used often. That change made the CPU usage on the t2bot.io instance drop from ~100% to ~7%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have graphs to illustrate the improvements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Spectral now provides an AppImage along with Flatpak build. Also, thanks to the notification codes from nheko, Spectral can show icons in notifications, and now enters corresponding room when clicking on the notification.

<h2 id="new-communities">New communities</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@swedneck:swedneck.xyz">swedneck</a> has created a new gaming community on Matrix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we just bridged the linux-gaming community from discord to matrix, with a matrix community and individually bridged rooms/channels and all
main room is <a href="https://riot.im/develop/#/room/#general_linuxgaming:matrix.org">#general_linuxgaming:matrix.org</a>
community is <a href="https://matrix.to/#/+linux-gaming:matrix.org">+linux-gaming:matrix.org</a></p>
<p>i've set up an instance of matrix-appservice-discord, which is bridging some select rooms from the linux-gaming discord server to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/+linux-gaming:matrix.org">+linux-gaming:matrix.org</a></p>
<p>The Linux Gaming community has gotten a proper matrix community (+linux-gaming:matrix.org) with a fair few rooms in it, all of which are bridged to a discord channel via my matrix-appservice-discord instance.</p>

<p><strong>Informo</strong> is an ambitious project hoping to be a &quot;decentralised news network, making information accessible&quot;. The project lives at <a href="https://github.com/Informo">https://github.com/Informo</a>, but for now you can join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discuss:weu.informo.network">#discuss:weu.informo.network</a> to get their latest news.</p>
<p>This week, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@vabd:weu.informo.network">vabd</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We made a Matrix bot that shouts about updates to change submissions to Informo's specifications. It basically processes all changes made to the list of labels for each issue and PR of a GitHub repository's, and generates a notice message that it sends to the configured room(s). We made it because we wanted the people that are interested in Informo to know in real time about any change made to the state of proposals, along with the calls for public reviews. We just set it up in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#discuss:weu.informo.network">#discuss:weu.informo.network</a>, and published its source code along with a built binary here: <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs-bot">https://github.com/Informo/specs-bot</a><br />It might also be worth noticing that, although we designed it to shout about updates to Informo's specifications proposals, we also made it compatible with other projects, e.g. the Matrix specs</p>

<h2 id="greetings-from-mozfest">Greetings from Mozfest</h2>
<p><a href="https://mozillafestival.org">Mozfest</a> is a tech-focused event happening this weekend in London. Neil and I have been along tonight and we've been chatting to a lot of people about Matrix, decentralisation and all those things we love! Check out our very short and sweet video below!</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZqfTYwDz9HM" width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p>This is the start of Season Three of Matrix Live. Matrix Live seasons are variable in length, based on the data available so far. From this season, Matrix Live with change the format slightly, based on feedback. The videos will try to be a bit more interesting, varied, and deep. With this video being the start of a new season, it was meant to be more substantive with us talking to Mozfest-ites, but I lost track of time, so this shorter but still energetic video will hopefully convey the idea.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>, master of the bridge, has been working with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> to produce a new RC for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack">bridging Matrix and Slack</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've got a Slack RC out at long last! Rejoice! It's absolutely massive and full of features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Half-Shot even provided this explanation of how it works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Integrations manager &gt; sign into slack &gt; click your channel &gt; ??? &gt; channel bridged :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/0.2.0-rc1">release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the first release of the Slack bridge. 0.1.0 has been the version number for previous efforts but was never an official release.</p>

Next I'll implement plugin config storage and some way to manage maubot and plugins (maybe a plugin to manage plugins?)</p>

<h3 id="riot-web-0-17-riot-android-0-8-18-lazy-loading">Riot Web 0.17, Riot Android 0.8.18: Lazy Loading</h3>
<p>This week saw the launch of Riot Web 0.17, and two bug-release updates (0.17.1 and 0.17.2) to fix issues on the Windows desktop app. This version is substantially faster due to its use of Lazy Loading room members. <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/riot-im-web-0-17-and-ios-0-7-6-smaller-footprint-faster-launch-5ddd18a65abb">Read more here</a>.   Meanwhile, Travis continues his foray into 'first impressions' bugs - including an initial implementation of .well-known URI support!</p>
<p>Riot Android 0.8.18 is also available from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app">Play Store</a> and <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.vector.alpha/">F-Droid</a>, with Lazy Loading option available in the Labs menu (but still has a few bugs left).</p>
<p>Riot iOS meanwhile is busy implementing incremental server-side E2E key backups, and there's generally been a huge amount of work on E2E encryption UX across the board in preparation for all-new E2E on Web and iOS.  More details will be coming soon!</p>
<p>With this done, Riot is now getting a lot more attention on the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/a-sneak-peek-at-a-whole-new-riot-im-1114df653782">impending redesign</a>, with Bruno <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+redesign+author%3Abwindels">starting to merge</a> code to the experimental branch.</p>

<h3 id="coffee-on-matrix-console-for-android">Coffee on Matrix Console for Android</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Matrixcoffee">Coffee</a> rolled a natural twenty for bravery this week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have decided to take up maintainership of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-console">Matrix Console for Android</a> client. This is still the only multi-account capable Android client, but it is unmaintained and growing long in tooth. In particular, the API endpoints it uses may be removed from Synapse soon.
I will not be developing new features for it, but I will integrate reasonable patches if others want to take that on.
My own goals are to remove GCM and analytics, and get it added to F-Droid. And of course to switch to the latest API.
As part of this work, I have been fighting Gradle and its bugs to get <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">matrix-android-sdk</a> to build together with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-console">matrix-android-console</a> as a git submodule, so it's no longer necessary to inject the precompiled sdk into the source code. I did not win yet.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> has continued work on <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd">mxisd</a>, an Identity Server:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a> got a new beta release <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.2.0-beta.1">v1.2.0-beta.1</a>.<br />It adds the ability to send email notification about room invites to existing accounts in Identity store that might not have been provisioned in the homeserver yet as users never logged in, or for users' profile that are not auto-populated with 3PIDs. This is especially targeted for onboarding/enrolling times when adopoting Matrix in groups/corporations or for custom setups.<br />We would love to hear about your experience with it!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> has been working on <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-trello-bot">matrix-trello-bot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-trello-bot">matrix-trello-bot</a> has received quite the overhaul. It's gone from a small bot that had pre-determined notifications for board activity to a much more capable bot. The bot now supports managing boards (yes, you can create a board from within Matrix!), lists, and cards including creating, moving, archiving, assigning, and querying.</p>
<p>On top of all that, the bot respects that not every room will want to receive every possible notification and offers commands to pick and choose which events it should notify about on a per-board basis. Feel free to <a href="https://t2bot.io/trellobot/">give it a spin</a> and check out the massive help menu with <code>!trello help</code>. Please send bugs and suggestions to GitHub :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fixes only these two issues:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Firefox private mode being broken &gt; (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/2195)</li>
 	<li>Breakage when mixing /app and /develop use (issue #7432)</li>

<p>My gomatrix fork is now <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-go">mautrix-go</a> and the basic client API stuff in <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python/tree/matrix-restructure">mautrix-python</a> is starting to be usable enough for me to start the rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a> in Python.<br />For a bit of background, maubot is a dynamic plugin-based bot system. It's currently written in Go, but due to many limitations in the Go plugin system, I decided to rewrite it in Python. matrix-python-sdk doesn't have asyncio or a maintainer, so I decided to make a new framework that combines my existing mautrix-appservice-python framework with a more generic client API layer.

<p>If you've spent any time using Matrix public rooms, you've probably seen the bot <code>DSN Traveller</code>. This is a post-grad project from Florian Jacob, an informatics student at the <a href="https://kit.edu/">Karlsruhe Institute for Technology</a>. This week, Florian handed in his thesis on Matrix!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, I could show that Matrix has few large but many small servers. Large servers reduce the overall network load, but a significant fraction of the load is concentrated in them. Introducing more small servers would further increase the load concentration. The Matrix event graph as a Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type showed to be well-suited for reliable messaging and history synchronization, and is applicable beyond Matrix.<br />I'm now working on a scientific paper on the results, which will boil down the more than 80 pages of the thesis to something much more digestible. ? You'll hear it in TWIM when that is finished!</p>
<p>Room for discussions: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dsn-traveller:matrix.org">#dsn-traveller:matrix.org</a><br />Website with more information on the DSN Traveller: <a href="https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/">https://dsn-traveller.dsn.scc.kit.edu/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really is exciting stuff! The thesis will be made available online in the future (we'll post it here.) Florian is also hoping to continue his work into Matrix research:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm currently in the process of trying to secure funding for a doctorate with Matrix as the topic, as that's where I can proof experience.</p>

<p>As you may know, although he's now back studying for the final year of his Computer Science degree, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> will continue to dedicate some time to bridge maintenance. He's been working on <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/irc-conntrack/">IRC Connection Tracker</a>, the next gen bridge for Matrix-IRC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The IRC connection tracker has had yet more code and love applied to it. The headline changes are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>We now have a fully working IRC client that can connect to an IRCd, join channels and chat. These client's persist over &gt; the lifetime of the service.</li>
 	<li>There is a tool included with the service <code>ircctl</code> which allows you to spawn and use connections en masse. It also lets &gt; you list the state of the currently connected clients.</li>
 	<li>Work has just begun on a client library for connecting this up to the bridge, but should be swiftly completed thanks to…</li>
 	<li>A brand new spec website in the works for describing the protocol (thanks Brendan for pointing me in the right direction)</li>

<p>I spent last night setting up hypertrix.ovh, a matrix server only listening on <a href="https://docs.meshwith.me/">Hyperboria</a>, a cjdns based end-to-end encrypted IPv6 overlay mesh network. I'd be glad if someone could be found to peer and federate with me there! Registration is open, but your client needs to be connected to Hyperboria to be able to talk to the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are currently using Hyperboria, go join hypertrix.ovh, or start your matrix server listening on it, and go chat to JC!</p>
<h2 id="seaglass">Seaglass</h2>
<p>Lots of discussion about this project, specifically the question of how to efficiently render Rich Text. macOS does not make this easy, so a solution being considered is to use a WebKit for room rendering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebKit has the advantage of being super super fast on macOS, and also very low overheads<br />The current approach uses Cocoa NSTableViews and it's horrible because Apple clearly couldn't decide how they wanted them to work and therefore it's not very optimised<br />Moving to WebKit only adds about 16mb to the RAM usage and redraws far faster than the NSTableViews can when resizing etc, and we'll save a lot on the text formatting too which currently is a bit of a mess</p>

<h2 id="spec">Spec</h2>
<p>September was mainly spent cleaning up loose ends on the Spec after <a href="/blog/2018/09/03/matrix-spec-update-august-2018/">all the releases at the end of August</a>, and catching up on the never-ending maintenance burden of improving Synapse.  However, in October the plan is to to go back again to working full out on the S2S r0 release. Wish us luck...</p>
<h2 id="riot">Riot</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Lazy loading members is now on by default on riot.im/develop - reducing Riot's RAM by 3-5x.  Please give it a go and test it before we ship it in Riot 0.17 (probably next week) so we can iron out any last bugs (which will probably look like user profiles going missing)</li>
 	<li>Lazy loading also ships by default in Riot/iOS in Testflight 0.7.4 - if you want in on Testflight let us know in #riot-ios:matrix.org and we'll share an invite link!</li>
 	<li>Lazy loading in Riot/Android coming real soon now; it's behind a labs flag on the develop branch if you want to experiment.</li>
 	<li>Travis has started attacking the Riot/Web '<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/projects/12">First Impressions</a>' project (starting with unbreaking onboarding in Riot/Web when GDPR consent is enabled)</li>
 	<li>Lots and lots of UX work from Nad on E2E, Communities, Onboarding and the overall redesign, complete with a <a href="https://twitter.com/RiotChat/status/1044609832609861632">redesign workshop</a> with Jouni.</li>
 	<li>Aiming for end of Oct for first cut of redesign to be live as an experimental branch on riot.im.</li>
 	<li>Lots and lots of E2E implementation work in general; backups, cross-signing, and verification.</li>
</ul>

<p>Massive update from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> about his <a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">Jeon</a> project! This update brings Jeon into line with the most recent updates to the Client-Server, Application Service, Push and Identity APIs.</p>
<p>In ma1uta's words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeon is a set of the java interfaces and classes which describes the Matrix API.</p>
<ul>
 	<li>client-api: r0.4.0-1 corresponds to the r0.4.0 C2S API.</li>
 	<li>application-api: r0.1.0-1 corresponse to the r0.1.0 AS API,</li>
 	<li>push-api: r0.1.0-1 corresponds to the r0.1.0 PUSH API,</li>
 	<li>identity-api: r0.1.0-1 corresponds to the r0.1.0 IS API.</li>
 	<li>All artefacts available from the Maven Central Repository.</li>
</ul>
Major changes:
<ul>
 	<li>Full support for the corresponding Matrix api.</li>
 	<li>Changed version for displaying the Matrix api version.</li>
 	<li>Added support to the asynchronous responses.</li>
</ul>
Also updated the swagger schemas generated from the code:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/c2s.json">https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/c2s.json</a> - C2S API</li>
 	<li><a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/as.json">https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/as.json</a> - AS API</li>
 	<li><a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/push.json">https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/push.json</a> - PUSH API</li>
 	<li><a href="https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/id.json">https://ma1uta.github.io/swagger/id.json</a> - IS API</li>
</ul>
And the first hotfix: application-api r0.1.0-2 with fixed url (/transactions has been changes to the _matrix/app/v1/transactions). And this release will break all AS because synapse sends transactions to the old url.

<p>Exciting times for <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a>!! Thanks <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>, developer of libQMatrixClient and <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After some pretty long time of being in a PR/fork, VoIP signalling support has landed in libQMatrixClient! Many thanks to mariogrip (the founder of UBports) for the initial code and to delijati (a developer behind <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a>) for getting it to work with the most recent library.<br />The actual VoIP stack does not come included, client developers have to take whatever WebRTC implementation is available for their platform and glue the pieces together. However, as the example of uMatriks shows, this now becomes relatively easy if your platform is on good terms with WebRTC (like UBports). I look forward to further work with UBports community on keeping this platform a first-class Matrix citizen.</p>

Hawkowl's Py3 has merged for monoliths and is working pretty well, looking like 2-3x RAM improvement. Please help us test!</p>
<p>Erik's state compressor tool is pretty much finished, we've been starting to run it on things and it reduces disk usage for the state group table by at least 10x.</p>

<p>Lots of final bug hunting for lazy loading - this is taking longer than you might expect because we're doing end-to-end CI everywhere.</p>
<p>Lots of work on E2E, Dave has been working on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UI for e2e key backup that's waiting for some lower level bits<br />and hopefully our e2e core code is moving from asm.js to webassembly making it, by current estimations, significantly faster.</p>

<h3 id="seaglass">Seaglass</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil</a> has been keeping up the pace with <a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass">Seaglass</a> development:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seaglass has had a substantial rewrite to the room cache to help improve reliability and reduce crashes, better thumbnail behaviour on inline images, various tiny visual tweaks, in-window blending, support for encryption key sharing requests for E2E rooms.</p>
<p>Rendering performance has been massively increased (if you ignore the occasional bug). Resizing the window shouldn't be so slow anymore and a lot of avatar image operations are no longer repeated unnecessarily</p>
<p>Other than that this week has mostly featured lots and lots of bug fixes, hopefully lots of crashes fixed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Screenshot below shows the new E2E UI:</p>

<h3 id="quaternion">Quaternion</h3>
<p>When not escaping typhoons, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has found some time to continue work on Quaternion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a>'s master branch is alive again - it's been prone to crashes in the last two weeks, now it shouldn't. Feel free to try the new room list organised by tag!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@MTRNord:matrix.ffslfl.net">MTRNord</a> has been working on SimpleMatrix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/Nordgedanken/SimpleMatrix">SimpleMatrix</a> now supports Basic messages sending (with Commonmark) and basic receiving of messages.</p>

<h3 id="minivector">miniVector</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bubuiic:matrix.org">Marcus</a> has re-packaged miniVector for F-Droid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's now a second matrix client available in F-Droid: <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.lavadip.miniVector/">https://f-droid.org/packages/com.lavadip.miniVector/</a></p>
<p>This is a fork of Riot Android done by hrjet, f-droid release done by me. It's removing mostly jitsi group call functionality and some other smaller stuff. In doing so it manages to require far less permissions and is also only 12 MB in size instead of riots 20 MB.</p>

<p>This is thanks to leaning on libqmatrixclient's native multiple account support!</p>

<h3 id="riot-web-0-16-4-released">Riot Web 0.16.4 released</h3>
<p>This is pretty much a maintenance release - fixing the DM avatar regression that crept in with 0.16.3, adding better support for warning users when their client hasn't yet synced with the server, and the final bits of work needed before we can turn on membership Lazy Loading in the upcoming Riot 0.17.</p>
<p>Full changelogs as always are split over the three projects which make up Riot/Web:</p>
<ul>

<h3 id="libqmatrixclient-ecosystem">libQMatrixClient ecosystem</h3>
<p>As you may know, <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/matrique-go">Matrique</a>, led by <a href="http://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a>, led by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>, are both projects build using <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a>, a Qt5 library from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> designed for writing Matrix clients. While <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has been working on the library for some time, <a href="http://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> has also now
started making contributions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>libQMatrixClient now has a pkg-config file to further ease clients building on Linux systems, as well as more convenient API to track read markers if all users, not just of the local one.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="matrix-js-sdk-v0-11-0-released"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">matrix-js-sdk</a> v0.11.0 released</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/releases">This release contains</a> support for lazy loading room members, and also some breaking changes relating to <code>startClient()</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>Support for lazy loading members. This should improve performance for users who joined big rooms a lot. Pass to <code>lazyLoadMembers = true</code> option when calling <code>startClient</code>.</li>
 	<li><code>MatrixClient::startClient</code> now returns a Promise. No method should be called on the client before that promise resolves. Before this method didn't return anything.</li>
 	<li>A new <code>CATCHUP</code> sync state, emitted by <code>MatrixClient#"sync"</code> and returned by <code>MatrixClient::getSyncState()</code>, when doing initial sync after the <code>ERROR</code> state. See <code>MatrixClient</code> documentation for details.</li>
 	<li><code>RoomState::maySendEvent('m.room.message', userId)</code> & <code>RoomState::maySendMessage(userId)</code> do not check the membership of the user anymore, only the power level. To check if the syncing user is allowed to write in a room, use <code>Room::maySendMessage()</code> as <code>RoomState</code> is not always aware of the syncing user's membership anymore, in case lazy loading of members is enabled.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Synapse 0.33.4 <a href="/blog/2018/09/11/synapse-0-33-4-released/">was released</a>, with a whole host of bug fixes, some enhancements to resource usage management and a bunch of internal changes in readiness for room member state lazy loading and our ongoing port to Python 3.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Python 3 support for monolithic (non-worker) Synapses has finally landed on the develop branch, thanks to massive work from hawkowl and notafile - if you want to help us test and flush out any remaining byte/utf8 style errors, please create a virtualenv for python 3.6 or 3.5 (twisted doesn't support 3.7 yet) and point the develop branch of Synapse at it, tail the logs for ERRORs and report them via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues">Github</a> if/when you see them.  In practice it seems pretty stable though, and noticeably reduces RAM and speeds things up thanks to improved GC and general performance work in Python.</p>
<p>We've also discovered that <a href="http://jemalloc.net/">jemalloc</a> works <em>very</em> well at improving RAM usage on Python 2 under Linux (we haven't tried it on Python 3 yet) by providing a more fragmentation-resistant malloc implementation; if you are having problems with your Synapse RAM spiking up we recommend giving it a go.  All of the Matrix.org server is using it now.</p>
<p>Also, lots of ops work this week; Erik has prototyped a <a href="https://github.com/erikjohnston/rust-synapse-compress-state">new storage strategy for state groups</a> which shrinks storage requirements by 10x, we'll be applying this shortly to Matrix.org otherwise we're going to run out of disk space.  There was also a regression on Synapse develop on federation, where outbound requests would get stuck and never retry - this impacted the matrix.org server badly over the course of the week, but as of Friday night we have a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/3875/files">workaround</a> in place.  We're not aware of it affecting anyone other than the matrix.org deployment (and we haven't got to the root cause yet).</p>
<h2 id="construct-homeserver-progress">Construct homeserver progress</h2>
<p>This week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Added notification counts which show up in Riot now, and expanded support for g++-7 and 8 instead of just g++-6. Construct repository is found at: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="irc-connection-tracker">IRC Connection Tracker</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> is continuing to work on the project to split out IRC connection management from the IRC bridge, letting the bridge be restarted without interrupting IRC connections!</p>
<p>The project is going quite well, and is going to be used on matrix.org once production ready which will really speed up upgrades and give us near zero downtime indifferent to the size of the bridge.</p>
<p>At the moment the project has the ability to spin up and maintain connections, however the connections are not supporting IRC fully yet as there are bits to do on the parsing and maintaining state side. There is also work on a top-like tool to visualise and control the service outside of the bridge so we can quickly handle any oddities if they come up. Finally, it allows you to hot reload the configuration without dropping existing connections!</p>
<p>On the work done to support this on matrix-appservice-bridge, there is basic support for stating connections on the bridge but it's in early stages at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="spec">Spec</h2>
<p>Travis has been tidying up loose bits on the Matrix spec this week:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>experimenting with splitting out the "Room" specific bits of the spec into a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1669">dedicated section</a> rather than being split between the CS and SS APIs;</li>
 	<li>trying to pin down a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1607">formal grammar for room aliases</a></li>
 	<li>...and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1598">identifiers in general</a>.</li>
</ul>
In practice, finalising the S2S API is now blocked on proving the implementation on Synapse; work on this will resume next week and then we'll document the end result and ship the r0 at last.  Timings are going to be completely determined by available manpower and what level of ops distractions we face (c.f. the Synapse section above...).  Whilst we're waiting for the final S2S details to get hashed out, Travis is going to be helping on Riot dev, to try to stop <a href="https://twitter.com/amarendra/status/1040782285807603714">stuff like this</a>, as there's no point in having the platonic ideal of a perfect spec if actual users are unable to benefit from it.
<h2 id="matrix-dev">#matrix-dev</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev:matrix.org</a> was reborn as a new room a couple of weeks ago to flush out old corrupted events, but maybe not everyone knows. Come join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev:matrix.org</a>, it's a starting point for all developers looking to build on the platform.  We're also rebuilding #test:matrix.org and #riot:matrix.org, although once we ship the new state resolution</p>
<h2 id="a-sneak-peek-at-modular">A sneak peek at Modular...</h2>
<p><a href="https://modular.im"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3567 size-medium" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-15-at-11.11.00-1-300x49.png" alt="" width="300" height="49" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, there's been a massive amount of work on the <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a> side of things to soft-launch <a href="https://modular.im">Modular</a> - a paid hosting platform for Matrix servers (and, in future, paid integrations).  At this point we're looking for early adopters who want a dedicated Riot+Synapse for communities or companies of 50 or more users - but don't want to have to run it themselves.  Modular takes the homeserver hosting we've already been providing for <a href="https://chat.status.im">Status</a>, <a href="https://tadhack.riot.im">TADHack</a> and others, and turns it into a mass-market product.  The pricing for early adopters is over 5x cheaper than Slack, so if you've been dying to have a reliable, fast and expertly maintained homeserver without any of the headaches of admining one yourself, please head over to <a href="https://modular.im">https://modular.im</a> and give it a whirl and let us know how it goes!  This is also a great way to support Matrix development in general, as money from Modular will directly keep the core Matrix team funded to work on Matrix.  Once we're happy with the soft-launch and have incorporated any feedback we'll start yelling about it as loud as we can :)</p>
<h2 id="matrix-live">Matrix Live</h2>
<p>We've had a bit of an accidental hiatus on Matrix Live thanks to getting submerged all the different project endgames happening atm (spec releases, lazy loading, Modular, Riot redesign etc), and for the last few Fridays we've got to midnight and beyond with too much still on the todo list to justify recording a video.  But to avoid completely falling behind, here's a slightly exhausted Saturday morning update instead (warning: Matthew is not a morning person).</p>
