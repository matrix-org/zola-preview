<p>I chatted with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">Kitsune</a>, maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a>, <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> and Spec Core Team member. We talked about the history and future of these projects, platform preferences, the importance of decentralisation and more.</p>

<h2 id="synapse-and-the-road-to-1-0">Synapse and the road to 1.0</h2>
<p>Neil, Synapse-dev wrangler #1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Huge thanks to everyone who has helped increase the number of ‘1.0 ready' synapse installs. If you don't know what this means, <a href="/blog/2019/03/15/matrix-1-0-https-arewereadyyet-com/">see our blog</a>. <a href="https://arewereadyyet.com">https://arewereadyyet.com</a> reports &gt; 60% adoption on a per server basis, and high 90s on a per user basis. We are now really close to being able to ship a 1.0 release candidate and start the 2 week countdown before releasing 1.0 proper.</p>
<p>This week we have focussed on performance, richvdh has been working on batching of outgoing read receipts and hawkowl shipped a much more performant implementation of user search. Erik has been putting the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/rust-synapse-compress-state">state compressor</a> through its paces, he saw one room compress down to 1% of its original size. Andrew has been focusing on ensuring spec compliance on various Synapse endpoints and is currently looking at some bugs in the federation tester.</p>

<h2 id="pattle-lots-of-progress-and-dart-sdk-planned">Pattle, lots of progress and Dart SDK planned</h2>
<p>Lots of news from <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/android">Pattle</a>, the project aiming to create clients for multiple mobile platforms. All quotes below from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pattle for Android now has an F-droid repository: <a class="linkified" href="https://fdroid.pattle.im/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=E91F63CA6AE04F8E7EA53E52242EAF8779559209B8A342F152F9E7265E3EA729" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://fdroid.pattle.im/</a></p>
<p>It's the most up to date version straight from the pipeline, so not necessarily stable.</p>

<p>As part of the project, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a> also announced the intention to create a Dart SDK:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm currently working on a <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/library/matrix-dart-sdk">Matrix SDK for Dart</a>, which will be used for the <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/app">Pattle rewrite in Flutter</a>.
The reason for this is outlined <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/android#future">here</a>. To summarize: My goal for Pattle is to release for not only Android but also iOS and web, with a single code base. Other reasons include that Android native development is just bad, and the fact that I'm not too happy with the official Matrix Android SDK design and documentation.
I will maintain and also add some features to the current version of Pattle, to try things out. The Flutter version will replace the native one once the features are in sync.</p>

<h2 id="dimension-sticker-packs">Dimension sticker packs</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> has introduced sticker packs for <a href="https://dimension.t2bot.io/">Dimension</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dimension now has beta support for custom sticker packs. To create a sticker pack:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
 	<li>Start a conversation with @stickers:t2bot.io</li>
 	<li>Say <code>!stickers newpack</code> and follow the prompts.</li>
 	<li>Share the URL with your friends.</li>
</ol>
To add the sticker pack to your sticker picker:
<ol>
 	<li>Make sure you're using Dimension as your integration manager.
<ul>
 	<li>Not sure if you are? Click the 4 squares in the top right of the room in Riot - if the dialog is titled "Dimension", you're all set :)</li>
 	<li>If you aren't, check out <a href="https://dimension.t2bot.io">https://dimension.t2bot.io</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Click on the smiley face to the right of where you type messages then the Edit button in the top right.</li>
 	<li>Paste the URL of the sticker pack into the box and click "Add Stickerpack".</li>
 	<li>Start using your new stickers.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>These instructions are also available at <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension/blob/master/docs/custom_stickerpacks.md">https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension/blob/master/docs/custom_stickerpacks.md</a> as is the admin/operator guide for running your own sticker bot (you're not stuck with using t2bot.io unless you want to be).<br />Custom sticker packs are still beta while the proposals to share this with the wider Matrix ecosystem are still works in progress. This serves as a proof of concept to see how crazy of an idea it is to have stickerpacks-as-rooms (yes, they're just plain Matrix rooms under the hood) and what needs ironing out before moving ahead with the MSC.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-notification-profile-manager">matrix-notification-profile-manager</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a> has created a notification profile manager:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past few weeks, I grew a bit fed up of always having to turn on and off every notification rule each time I'm having a slight change in what I'm working on or depending on what mood I was in (e.g. want to focus only on work-related stuff and nothing else, don't want to hear about work at all, somewhere in the middle, etc.), so I built a <a href="https://github.com/babolivier/matrix-notification-profile-manager">notification profile manager for Matrix</a>. It's available both as a command line interface or a Go package in case people want to build on top of it.</p>
<p>It allows one to take a snapshot of their current notifications settings and save that as a profile, so that this profile can be applied later. It also allows one to delete a profile or list the existing profiles (more features to be added as time goes by). In order to make the whole thing interoperable with other projects building on top of the Go package, it also uses the user's account data on the user's Matrix homeserver to store profiles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="neo-v4-iris">neo v4: iris</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:lain.haus">F0x</a> has recommenced development on the Matrix client Neo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After discussion following <a href="https://cyberia.social/@foks/101785513826000032">https://cyberia.social/@foks/101785513826000032</a> I've resumed development on Neo. Suggestions are very much welcomed on the pad and mastodon thread<br />I'm implementing components one by one now, with just mocked events. Actual Matrix integration will come when the gui components are ready.</p>
<p>Neo is now partly integrated with <code>matrix-js-sdk</code> because I grew tired of having to write my own mock events. There's a basic authentication flow, with 0 error handling, and parsing of <code>m.text</code> and <code>m.image</code> events</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/iris-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4131" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/iris-1-1024x576.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>

<p>f0x also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it would be much appreciated to get some feedback on how I implemented matrix-js-sdk, had to do some weird stuff to make React update</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll take a look but would love anyone with more experience of the SDK to get in touch with the f-man.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> is up again with his Telegram bridge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> 0.5.0 was released after I finally fixed the bug that was causing the bridge database to lock up. It turned out to be a single line of ORM usage that I had missed while converting everything to use SQLAlchemy Core.
The full release notes are at <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram/releases/tag/v0.5.0.">https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram/releases/tag/v0.5.0.</a>
I also released <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram/releases/tag/v0.5.1">v0.5.1</a> to fix a bug that made the DBMS migration script not work and Python 3.5 compatibility. I wouldn't recommend using Python 3.5 though, I'm going to drop support for it some time after Debian 10 is released</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This React Native client is not announced so <a href="https://github.com/limvot/bubbles">don't look at it</a></p>
<p>My pal Doug shared his frustration with the broader state of the chat ecosystem after <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/hottest-chat-app-teens-google-docs/584857/">reading that teens now use Google Docs for their chat needs</a> (and not the chat feature, the document itself!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love that you've got Amazon with their Alexa messaging, Apple in their own bubble with iMessage, Facebook doing chat 3-ways and Google trying 50 ways to do chat. And that's before you even get into things like Slack, Discord, Telegram, Riot, Line, WeChat etc etc. And then the current hot way to chat is in a document...
I mean, <strong>how much money is being invested in trying to create the perfect chat solution?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the record, we were chatting over Matrix…</p>
<h2 id="that-s-all-i-know">That's all I know</h2>
<p>That's the news, if you have something to say, or something to add, then you should go to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> and share it.

<p>It's all about 1.0 for the Synapse gang this week. This means performance improvements across the board in the form of read receipt batching, user directory (room directory coming soon!) and rate limiting on log in and registration APIs.</p>
<p>Brendan shipped the low bandwidth CoAP proxy we demo'd at FOSDEM</p>
<p>As well as a bunch of spec implementation projects to ensure that Synapse (and Sydent) are ready for Synapse 1.0.</p>

<p>Lots of progress this week. I'd like to give a special thanks to Yan Minari for another great week of testing, bugfixes and feature requests.</p>
<ul>
 	<li>We implemented features related to room directory lists, reporting content, ignoring users, VoIP turnServer, prev_content in state events.</li>
 	<li>Improving SSL: allowing configurable lists of ciphers, and sending/receiving SNI.</li>
 	<li>At the lower level: adding support for Linux AIO features that are present in newer kernels, giving a nice performance boost.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@wilko:matrix.org">Wilko</a> announced <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/android">Pattle</a>, a Matrix client for Android:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey all, I've been working on my Matrix Android app, Pattle! The goal of Pattle is to be an easy to use app for Matrix, with it's design inspired by popular apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram. <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/android">Development happens here</a>, and contributions are encouraged! The app is not currently suited for daily use, but some functionality is there, such as registering, logging in and viewing chats.
Currently it's an Android only app using the official Matrix Android SDK, but the plan is to support iOS and web too, in the future.
There's also a sort of <a href="https://docs.pattle.im/design/philosophy/">design document</a> available, stating how Pattle differs from standard Matrix apps and what it's goals are. The intent of the design document is to make development easier later on for other platforms</p>

<p>From Neil of the Synapse-team</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Folks, in the run up to Synapse 1.0, if you are running your own homeserver now would be an excellent time to check that your TLS certificates are up to date. Point your server name at <a href="/federationtester/">https://matrix.org/federationtester/</a> and if there are errors check our handy FAQ on how to fix it. If you do not have valid TLS certificates Synapse 1.0 will refuse to federate with you.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benpa:matrix.org">benpa</a> has put together a federation checker to quantify how many homeservers are 1.0 ready - <a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com">https://www.arewereadyyet.com/</a> - It currently stands at 50.5% let's try and get that to 60% over the weekend.</p>
<p>Aside from all that, the team have been working on preparing for Synapse 1.0, you can <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/8">track our progress here</a>. We promise not to just land 1.0 out of the blue - we'll give everyone a 2 week warning to give stragglers a chance to get their certificates in order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To everyone who wonders how to connect his application to Matrix (at least for notifications of some kind) - use <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">OpenSAPS</a>! It just reached v0.1.0. <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">OpenSAPS</a> stands for Open Slack API Server and able to retransmit messages from applications (like Gitlab or everything that can send data to Slack) to somewhere else. Right now these &quot;somewhere else&quot; is a Telegram (with HTTP proxy support) and Matrix! Written in Golang to ensure minimal memory footprint. Take a look at <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps">https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps</a> Tested with Gitlab and Gitea but should work with almost any service. Join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opensaps:pztrn.name">#opensaps:pztrn.name</a> to talk with developers or get help. BTW, there is OpenSAPS instance in our room that transmits everything from gitlab.com into room! (almost) immediately after 0.1.0 comes <a href="https://gitlab.com/pztrn/opensaps/tags/v0.1.1">0.1.1</a>, with fixed URLs parsing and fixed inability to login into servers which use .well-known for delegation. It should work [with other webhooks]. If something strange happens there is also a possibility to write own parser to make everything work :)‚ Tested with Gitlab and Gitea ATM. Share application names that work, I'll start to make a list of them. :D</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bifrost is now starting to comfortably support gatewaying. For those that don't know, gateways allow a remote user to participate in the matrix network without prior bridging, it's very fancy. The latest changes are that XMPP clients can now ask for the public room list by querying the bridge component. There is a video on this using the Yaxim XMPP client on Android (Credit to Ge0rG). Come chat with us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#bifrost:half-shot.uk">#bifrost:half-shot.uk</a></p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aaron:raim.ist" rel="nofollow">Aaron Raimist</a> has made some updates to Riotic, which was a good chance for me to revisit it. It works nicely and is a great alternative to the Electron version of Riot. I also like being able to use <a href="https://riot.im/develop" rel="nofollow">https://riot.im/develop</a> as an app.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've slightly tweaked Joakim Ahlen's Riot wrapper for macOS, riotic, which uses the native WKWebView instead of Electron. I updated the app to be sandboxed so it has very limited access to your system. I also updated the interface to follow macOS conventions and updated it to use the latest version of Swift.</p>
<p>riotic does have some limitations though. Riot doesn't support VoIP on Safari so riotic can't support VoIP either and WKWebView doesn't support notifications as far as I can tell. Right now it uses a really old Riot icon, maybe I'll ask about using one of these community made icons <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/4474">https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/4474</a>.</p>
<p>It does have some advantages over the official Riot Electron app though. The app is only ~12 MB compared to Riot which is ~180 MB, it also uses significantly less RAM. riotic also allows you to pick what Riot URL to use so you can run /develop as a desktop app.</p>
<p>You can download riotic from <a href="https://github.com/aaronraimist/riotic/releases/tag/v1.1">https://github.com/aaronraimist/riotic/releases/tag/v1.1</a>.</p>

The updated Tchap can be found at <a class="linkified" href="https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android</a>, the virus scanner API implementation at <a class="linkified" href="https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-media-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-media-scanner</a>.</p>

<p>The remainder of 0.6.x is expected to be bug fixes. This includes bug fixes in mtxclient as well as nheko.<br />0.7.0 will be the next feature release. The end goal here is to add some of the capabilities that people have been requesting, and other things that people haven't been requesting.<br />AFTER 0.7.0 releases, I will then focus on updating the encryption to include more than just text messages.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>Clean up c++ code</li>
 	<li>Make the c++ code less heavy, we should focus on speed</li>
 	<li>Offload js code to direct qml binding, with this i mean instead of having ablock if-else code that modifies qml object that runs on component load, we do this directly in qml: see 0a800fc and https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriksblob/0a800fcdc0af4fa2e08526dbff88e06bcb591779/uMatriks/componentsChatItem.qml as an example for a cleaner code</li>
 	<li>Make all ui depended calls async, we should NEVER block ui</li>
 	<li>Offload heavy js logic to c++</li>
 	<li>Cleaner UI, with less crust</li>
 	<li>Async everything</li>
 	<li>Merge our WIP call support</li>
 	<li>Finish impl of call support (maybe move to a standalone webrtc module)</li>
 	<li>Slowly start moving to QQC2</li>
 	<li>Implement reply</li>

<h2 id="matrix-archive-keyring">matrix-archive-keyring</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been working on new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've paused porting Synapse to OpenBSD this week, while I attempt to both fix and <em>revert</em> some security issues caused by <code>sudo apt-key add</code> for Matrix.org and Riot.im packages for Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution users.<br /><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4609">matrix-org/synapse PR #4609</a> was my first attempt to fix the problem, however I fell short this time in ease-of-use and my implementation had other issues. (Read: The <code>repo-key.asc</code> downloaded from Matrix.org Debian repository should go to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>, and must not be added by <code>apt-key add</code> or added to <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d</code> directly. I attempted the latter with my first PR; but that would've allowed the Matrix.org signing key to also be used to verify packages from Debian's main repositories. Yikes!)<br />As my second attempt, I'm now creating a new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>. There's multiple things this package intends to do:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>A post-install script to remove any previously added Matrix.org package signing keys from <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg</code>. (This is the file <code>apt-key add</code> most commonly uses, and the most commonly found bad advice on the Internet.)</li>
 	<li>Convert <code>repo-key.asc</code> to a de-armorized <code>.gpg</code> format, understood better by apt(8). (Essentially, <code>gpg --dearmor</code>.)</li>
 	<li>Install the converted <code>.gpg</code> key to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>.</li>
 	<li>Make sure <code>apt(8)</code> uses the newly added key for Matrix.org repository only?</li>
 	<li>Deliver any updates to <code>repo-key.asc</code> directly to you via <code>apt upgrade</code>. Your operating system might then also do it automatically for you if <code>unattended-upgrades(8)</code> is installed on your system. ?</li>
 	<li>Make sure everything goes away when this keyring package is uninstalled. No more <code>sudo sh -c 'apt-key del C35EB17E1EAE708E6603A9B3AD0592FE47F0DF61; rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> to get rid of the repository.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I have one more interesting enhancement to disclose.<br />We can ask you with <code>debconf</code> if you want to install <code>deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian $(lsb_release -cs) main</code> to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> while you're installing the new keyring with <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code>.<br />You'll most likely notice the difference in install instructions, as a result of this package. Before and after:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># Before
sudo apt install -y lsb-release curl apt-transport-https
echo "deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian `lsb_release -cs` main" |
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list
curl "https://matrix.org/packages/debian/repo-key.asc" |
    sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
<pre><code># After
sudo apt install matrix-archive-keyring
sudo sh -c 'apt update && apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are a Debian or Ubuntu user and Synapse homeserver operator using Matrix.org repositories, I'll be towncrying when this package becomes available as much as I can. All you should need to do then is <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code> and it should patch the security holes in your operating system if you've formerly installed packages from Matrix.org or Riot.im! (The command may change a bit, because next Debian operating system release &quot;Buster&quot; has entered soft-freeze just today (2019-02-12) and not accepting new packages into that release.)<br />PS: I'm at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#debian-matrix:matrix.org">#debian-matrix:matrix.org</a>, please come talk to us if Debian packaging interests you!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the eager early testers not afraid of building from source, <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code> version <code>2015.12.09+debian0.10</code> is available for early testing (attached).</p>
<pre><code># Something like this!
sudo apt install devscripts

<p>With the release of <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.0.html">Server to Server Spec r0.1</a>, Synapse 0.99.0 is shipping now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synapse 1.0.0 will be compliant with r0.1 and the goal of Synapse 0.99.0 is to act as a stepping stone to Synapse 1.0. Synapse 0.99.0 supports the r0.1 release of the server to server specification, but is compatible with both the legacy Matrix federation behaviour (pre-r0.1) as well as post-r0.1 behaviour, in order to allow for a smooth upgrade across the federation.<br />It is critical that all admins upgrade to 0.99.0 and configure a valid TLS certificate. Admins will have 1 month to do so, after which 1.0.0 will be released and those servers without a valid certificate will no longer be able to federate with &gt;= 1.0.0 servers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After seeing a demo at FOSDEM of <a href="https://github.com/dinsic-pim/tchap-android">Tchap</a>, the app the French government uses to access their Matrix network, I decided to try to get it to work as a general-purpose Matrix client. The app uses email and password to log in, and infers the homeserver address from the homeserver name. So to get it to work, I had to patch the app and write a little proxy so it gets the proper homeserver (and optionally identity server) from an email address.<br />A patched version of Tchap can be found at <a href="https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android">https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android</a>, code for the proxy at <a href="https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-proxy">https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-proxy</a>. At the moment it's very crude, and images/files don't work since the virus scan API is unimplemented, but at least it can be used outside the French government. ?</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been making progress on a project to get Synapse running on OpenBSD, and to that end has been preparing and improving the dependencies that we take for granted on Linux. To summarise the current status:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I've been porting Synapse's dependencies to OpenBSD <code>-current</code> distribution. There is no port yet for Synapse in OpenBSD.
Ports missing from OpenBSD <code>6.4</code> for Synapse's dependencies were:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li><code>py-frozendict</code>: ok'd, waiting…</li>
 	<li><code>py-unpaddedbase64</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-canonicaljson</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-signedjson</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-treq</code>: WIP (this will take a while, lots of dependencies)</li>
 	<li><code>py-daemonize</code>: ok'd, waiting…</li>
 	<li><code>py-pymacaroons</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-phonenumbers</code>: <code>8.10.4</code> done, waiting to be imported…</li>
 	<li><code>py-prometheus_client</code> done, needs to be tested/imported…</li>
 	<li><code>coturn</code>: TBD, maybe?</li>
</ul>
waiting = usually waiting for an OpenBSD developer to "ok" and import
<blockquote>
<p>Of those, <code>py-phonenumbers</code> was added to OpenBSD<br /><code>-snapshots</code> (<code>-current</code>) distribution. <code>py-phonenumbers</code> (?) and <code>py-service_identity</code> received updates to ports. <code>py-prometheus_client</code>, <code>py-daemonize</code> and <code>py-frozendict</code> are ported ready and waiting to be given &quot;ok&quot; at OpenBSD's <code>ports@</code> mailing list.<br />There is <a href="https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip/tree/master/net/synapse">an unofficial up-to-date Synapse port exists at GitHub</a> maintained by someone else, which I've not yet tested. (At glance, I can take a guess the <code>devel/tz</code> port may not be required.)<br />(<code>coturn</code> doesn't have a port yet, may have to look at it later.)</p>

<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Neil and the team have been working frantically on getting a new Synapse release out this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has been all about gearing up for v0.99.0 and if you would like to help us test it, our latest release candidate lives <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.0rc4">here</a><br />We've taken the decision to bump up to v0.99.0 because it is very much a precursor to v1.0. When v1.0 lands it will contain a breaking change that means all homeservers will need a valid certificate for their server to server endpoint, self signing will no longer be possible.<br />v0.99.0 contains support to help you do this, but once it lands all admins will need to upgrade, failure to do so will mean losing the ability to federate with &gt; v1.0 servers.<br />We'll have detailed docs ready to go alongside the full v0.99.0 release, and we plan to leave at least 1 month between v0.99.0 and v1.0, but for now please be aware that the change is coming.<br />Huge thanks to Rich, Erik, Hawkowl and Anoa for all their work in getting us to rc stage.</p>

<p>I've posted another blog on <a href="https://github.com/lukebarnard1/journal">journal</a> about the next steps for the project, including my thoughts on verifying blog content.</p>

<p>I'm planning to start work on the component that will scrape blog content from a matrix room. This will most likely involve a dedicated bot that syncs new journal blog events, verifies the blog signature and then writes the blog content to a file on the blog server.</p>
<p>I'll probably ramble about the details of that at some point.</p>

<h3 id="matrix-jabber-java-bridge"><a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-jabber-java-bridge/">matrix-jabber-java-bridge</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The bridge is being re-written. I excluded the jabber server (still need to setup SRV records) and implementing the xmpp s2s api in the bridge.
Done:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>rfc6120 in s2s part;</li>
 	<li>almost server dialback (XEP-0220);</li>
</ul>
Remaining:
<ul>
 	<li>MUC (XEP-0045);</li>
 	<li>stabilize.</li>
</ul>
New version will allow:
<ul>
 	<li>1:1 conversations between matrix and jabber users;</li>
 	<li>group chats by double-puppet mapping rooms to conferences;</li>
 	<li>additionally xmpp users can join directly to rooms via double-puppet bots.</li>
</ul>
Also I started breaking the bridge to modules. And the next module will be ActivityPub S2S module which allows communicate matrix servers with other fedivers.

 	<li>Since <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1711">MSC1711</a> is a breaking change, we will initially ship our next release (v0.35.0) with ACME support to make it easy to provision and renew certificates. The give everyone a month to upgrade and install a cert before we ship Synapse v1.0 which will require that servers have certificates in order to federate. Don't worry, there will be plenty of details on the steps necessary for admins when v0.35.0 lands - watch this space.</li>
 	<li>Finally a raft of db performance improvements, room version upgrade bug fixes, as well taking a look at room directory and user directory efficiency.</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack">matrix-puppet-slack</a> version 1.10.1 has been released, thanks again to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack/commits?author=twouters">@twouters</a></p>
<ul>
 	<li>The bridge could not create new Matrix rooms on versions of Synapse after a certain change, because it did not reserve the room alias prefix it used. That's been fixed, but anyone currently running matrix-puppet-slack will need to edit their slack_registration.yaml and restart Synapse. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack/releases/tag/1.10.1">the Release</a> for instructions on doing so.</li>
 	<li>The bridge will no longer send "Edit: " events when Slack sends it a "message_changed" message, if the message text has not actually changed (Slack sends these events for URL previews, for example, but this just causes duplicate bridged messages). This fix has been a long time coming.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>From the notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reconciliation is now much faster, due to the way we retrieve account data from the Matrix server (no longer doing <code>/sync</code>).<br />From now on, the minimum requirement for running matrix-corporal is Synapse v0.34.1, as it's the first Synapse release which contains the new API we require (<code>GET /user/{'{'}user_id{'}'}/account_data/{'{'}account_dataType{'}'}</code>).</p>

<pre><code class="lisp language-lisp">(define-matrix-endpoint room-send-event (:put)
  ("rooms" room-id "send" event-type txn-id))

<p>made some minor changes to <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/continuum-desktop">continuum</a> to make the GUI more intuitive. Now when there are no joined rooms, buttons for joining or creating rooms are shown instead of an empty list. And when there are issues with syncing or syncing takes longer than usual, a status bar with options is shown.</p>

<p>Still not quite sure if it's a good idea, but at least the input area component is very nice. It should also make it easier to add more fancy stuff like html tables and selecting messages (for replying/redacting)</p>

<p>We are still working on the key backup screens. The last bit on the SDK side, the passphrase support, has been implemented this week.</p>
<p>Reskin is almost done. It just needs some small adjustments. We will release a beta soon so that we can gather users feedback.</p>
<p>This week, we have also fixed small but boring UX issues in Riot and we will continue to do so up to the end of the month and FOSDEM!</p>

<p>Reskin is almost done too and available on develop builds.</p>
<p>Benoit has started to implement the key backup passphrase management in the SDK. Valere is still improving push notifications at the code level but also at the display level.</p>
<p>We are working hard to polish the app for FOSDEM.</p>

<p>Rick reports:</p>

<p>We now have a <b> HipChat migration tool - </b><a href="https://www.modular.im/tools/hipchat-migration">https://www.modular.im/tools/hipchat-migration</a><b>. </b>This tool helps migrate a HipChat workspace to your very own Modular Hosted Homeserver. Migration is performed by uploading an exported copy of an existing HipChat workspace so that the tool can automatically re-create all of the users and rooms (including messages and attachments) on your new Matrix homeserver. Once the migration is complete all of the migrated users will be emailed with login instructions, so that they can seamlessly continue chatting where they left off in HipChat. If your organisation (or if you know of an organisation that) has not yet decided what to do when Stride &amp; HipChat is discontinued next month, come and try Modular!</p>

<p>People have been generally happy about the flood of new issues following the completion of the internal audit last week, and a few folks have been opening PRs addressing some of the “good-first-issues” labeled ones, which has been amazing to see, including fixing room joins and a couple of default variables. Thanks a lot to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cnly:matrix.org">Cnly</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@manasseh:matrix.org">Behouba</a> for these!</p>
<p>On my end, this week mainly consisted in reviewing most of these PRs (and merging them when that was possible), while <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> worked on making Dendrite's CI more complete and reliable, especially by configuring it to run <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">sytest</a> against Dendrite which will allow us to better track its compliance to the Matrix specification.</p>
<p>If you're interested in contributing on Dendrite, there's still some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">“good first issues”</a> open, and we'll be happy to chat and help in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite-dev:matrix.org">#dendrite-dev:matrix.org</a> ?</p>
