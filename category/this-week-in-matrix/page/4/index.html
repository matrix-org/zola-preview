<p>Our guest for Matrix Live is Rich, to talk about how the Synapse team is hard at work to hunt those pesky spinners. Faster room joins now? Yes! But only for the brave!</p>

                <p>Happy TWIMday everyone! Thib is away this week again, so I'm covering for him as your host in this edition of This Week In Matrix.</p>
<h2 id="matrix-live">Matrix Live 🎙</h2>

<p>Following up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsw1bbBjAM">last week's tutorial</a> about using Docker Compose to install Synapse, this week Thib explains how to use Ansible to deploy your own Matrix homeserver.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the year, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/04/this-week-in-matrix-2022-03-04#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F">t2bot.io passed 1 Million known rooms</a> and now it's passed 10 Million bridged users (10,039,915 users to be exact, at time of writing). Most of these users will be people who have participated in a channel/chat on Discord or Telegram that was bridged to Matrix through t2bot.io's free service, with about 500 thousand being active each month.</p>
<p>Approximately 8 Million of the users are from Telegram, covering about 11% of all Telegram users (previously 15% based on information available at the time). The remaining 2 Million are Discord users, roughly 0.5% of Discord's user base. For perspective, t2bot.io has just over 683 Million events in the database and is bridging between 30 and 40 thousand people a day.</p>
<p>Like last time, this is just a milestone update, though it's also a good reminder to host your own server if you can. Element's own <a href="https://element.io/matrix-services">hosting platform</a> is a great option if you'd like to have a server without running it yourself, and <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> offers a richer bridging experience than t2bot.io can feasibly provide. If you'd like to go down the self-hosting route, check out Thib's video guide on hosting synapse or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsw1bbBjAM">last week's Matrix Live</a> for a better understanding of what hosting Synapse actually means.</p>
<p>As for an interesting statistic: despite not having much functionality that deals with Spaces, t2bot.io can see 2687 Spaces from the wider world. The plan in the coming months is to support a way to bridge a whole Discord server to a Matrix Space, making this statistic hopefully more interesting as time goes on.</p>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2162">MSC2162: Signaling Errors at Bridges</a>!</p>
<p>Bridges sometimes are unable to relay messages to the remote service for one reason or another.  This MSC proposes a way to allow bridges to indicate that a message failed to be delivered, and allow users to tell the bridge to retry.

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.5">Dendrite 0.9.5</a> which includes a number of fixes, particularly for federation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The roomserver will now correctly unreject previously rejected events if necessary when reprocessing</li>
<li>The handling of event soft-failure has been improved on the roomserver input by no longer applying rejection rules and still calculating state before the event if possible</li>
<li>The federation <code>/state</code> and <code>/state_ids</code> endpoints should now return the correct error code when the state isn't known instead of returning a HTTP 500</li>
<li>The federation <code>/event</code> should now return outlier events correctly instead of returning a HTTP 500</li>
<li>A bug in the federation backoff allowing zero intervals has been corrected</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> utility will no longer error if the homeserver URL ends in a trailing slash</li>
<li>A regression in <code>/sync</code> introduced in 0.9.4 should be fixed</li>

<p>simplematrixbotlib is an easy to use bot library for the Matrix ecosystem written in Python and based on matrix-nio.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de">HarHarLinks</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib">simplematrixbotlib</a> has reached version <a href="https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib/releases/tag/v2.7.0">2.7.0</a>, adding support for end-to-end encryption! 🎉
Come chat over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#simplematrixbotlib:matrix.org">#simplematrixbotlib:matrix.org</a>!</p>
<p>Here is a summary of things that have happened since we last announced v2.6.3 on this channel:</p>
<ul>
<li>🌐 The repo canonically moved to https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib, but the PyPI package remains available in the usual place.</li>
<li>🔒️ E2EE support! To enable it, simply install the optional e2ee dependencies. Find out how in <a href="https://simple-matrix-bot-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#e2e-encryption">the manual</a>.</li>
<li>😄 Emoji verification support! Enable the option and you'll be able to interactively verify between the bot and your devices. (But mind that for now, <a href="https://simple-matrix-bot-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#interactive-sas-verification-using-emoji">in-room verification is not supported, but only to-device</a>).</li>
<li>☝️ Fingerprint verification support! As an additional method, the bot will print it's encryption fingerprint so you can &quot;manually verify&quot;.</li>
<li>🗄️ Extensible config file! It is now easier than ever to add your own configuration options to the built-in TOML config file.</li>
<li>🧹 The usual housekeeping, bumping matrix-nio to 0.19.0.</li>
<li>🗨️ I (<a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks">HarHarLinks</a>) will be presenting the library this weekend at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-summit-berlin-2022:c-base.org">#matrix-summit-berlin-2022:c-base.org</a>! If you are in the Berlin 🇩🇪 area, come visit c-base!</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest to use bot library for Matrix. Get started in just 10 lines of code:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>import simplematrixbotlib as botlib
</span><span>
</span><span>config = botlib.Config()
</span><span>config.emoji_verify = True
</span><span>creds = botlib.Creds(&quot;https://home.server&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;)
</span><span>bot = botlib.Bot(creds, config)
</span><span>
</span><span>@bot.listener.on_message_event
</span><span>async def echo(room, message):
</span><span>    if botlib.MessageMatch(room, message, bot, PREFIX).is_not_from_this_bot():
</span><span>        await bot.api.send_text_message(room.room_id, message.body)
</span><span>
</span><span>bot.run()

<h3 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h3>
<p>This week the Spec Core Team focused on improvements to the spec source itself. richvdh <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1211">opened a PR</a> for edit events, and yours truly did <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1210">a small PR</a> to clarify the required state of the response to <code>/_matrix/client/v3/login/</code>.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aspec-bug">a lot more open issues</a> available for people to tackle however, so feel free to get involved and help out if you have some spare time!</p>
<p>Finally other than the usual rounds of review by the team, I've been working on a spec process document that aims to explain the practical portions of the text found at https://spec.matrix.org/proposals/, but in a easily scannable manner. Look out for a PR with that in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2871">MSC2871: Give widgets an indication of which capabilities they were approved for</a>! What a mouthful!</p>
<p>Historically, widgets have laid outside of the spec and have only been implemented in a small subset of clients - mainly Element. As of recent weeks though, there's now a team at Element backing the feature. So exciting times ahead!</p>
<p>Regardless, let's highlight this MSC! It solves a crucial problem with a simple solution. Widgets can ask the client they're embedded in to do certain things (if granted certain capabilities), and the client, potentially after asking the user for permission, can allow or deny those actions. This MSC adds the machinery for a further step: the client will tell the widget what capabilities they requested were allowed, and which were denied.</p>
<p>I believe this spec is non-contentious, but is blocked on widgets entering the spec as a whole. Regardless, if this particular piece of the puzzle interests you, or you'd like to read all about widgets in general, the see either the MSC above or this widget spec tracking PR: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/pull/825.

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.4">Dendrite 0.9.4</a>, containing primarily bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bug in the roomserver around handling rejected outliers has been fixed</li>
<li>Backfilled events will now use the correct history visibility where possible</li>
<li>The device list updater backoff has been fixed, which should reduce the number of outbound HTTP requests and <code>Failed to query device keys for some users</code> log entries for dead servers</li>
<li>The <code>/sync</code> endpoint will no longer incorrectly return room entries for retired invites which could cause some rooms to show up in the client &quot;Historical&quot; section</li>
<li>The <code>/createRoom</code> endpoint will now correctly populate <code>is_direct</code> in invite membership events, which may help clients to classify direct messages correctly</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool will now log an error if the shared secret is not set in the Dendrite config</li>
<li>A couple of minor bugs have been fixed in the membership lazy-loading</li>
<li>Queued EDUs in the federation API are now cached properly</li>

<p>Nheko now has some very dirty hack to render spoilers on desktop platforms. This does not show the reason and not work in mobile mode, doesn't hide it from notifications or from the sidebar. But it is at least something. Similarly we tightened what tags we allow when validating the incoming html again. Also, as a small fix, DMs should now also properly start with encryption enabled when started from a profile and there were a few crash fixes when searching for direct chat partners and closing the window too quickly or when a user uploads a device with invalid keys.</p>

<p>This week in the dart SDK we mostly fixed bugs. Many of those are related to call negotiations where streams were closed in the wrong order, not closed at all or in group calls the call never learned about new members or the call_ids would not match. There were also a few fixes to the background thumbnailing support added in 0.11.1, helper methods were added to easily send the right message corresponding to the mimetype of some media and fetching a timeline for some event id should work properly again.</p>
<p>We have some support to mark a room as either a dm or a group using slashcommands now, you have more flexibility when implementing the SSSS Bootstrap now (using the extra Bootstrap parameter in onUpdate() and to round it all off, we now have nice coverage numbers as well as coverage display on merge request diffs.</p>

The main conference days are Friday and Saturday (26th and 27th August). We have a schedule all about Matrix hosting, clients and development.
With three simultaneous tracks there sure is something for you to listen to. It's also the perfect place to get to know other community members.
Look forward to talks, workshops, a signing party, a Matrix P2P live test, dinner and barbecue!</p>
<p>We're not planing to stream or record the event. Our focus lies on providing a great in-person activities.
If attendees want to blog or toot/tweet about it, please use the hashtag #MatrixCommunitySummit.
Also, German-speaking folks can look forward to more coverage from the event on my podcast.

<p>Because we've heard about some confusion:
The event is NOT organised by the Matrix Foundation. To minimize the misconception, we've renamed it to the Matrix Community Summit Berlin.
This is an event initiated by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@yan:datanauten.de">Yan</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaller94:matrix.org">jaller94</a> and other Matrix enthusiasts. We also organise the Matrix Meetup Berlin.</p>

<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3783">MSC3783: Fixed base64 for SAS verification</a>!</p>
<p>For those that don't know, &quot;SAS verification&quot; refers to the act of two devices verifying each other through the use of Short Authentication Strings (SAS). This is the backbone of emoji verification when you verify with another user or one of your own devices.</p>
<p>It turns out that libolm, the olm and megolm encryption library, originally incorrectly encoded the base64 output of the message authentication code (MAC) calculation, which is a values that's passed between devices. Due to trying to maintain backwards-compatibility with older clients, this has not been fixed in newer clients yet.</p>
<p>This MSC proposes bumping the MAC algorithm identifier (which is agreed upon between devices when verifying) to a something new, which allows newer clients to know when to use the new or old (and incorrect) method of calculating the base64 encoding of MAC values.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this has no security implications. It's just unfortunate to have incorrect base64 encoding when interfacing with other, non-libolm, implementations of olm and megolm.

<p>Announcing <code>matrix-appservice-discord</code> 3.0.0!</p>
<p>What? Another week, another major release?
Yes, we want to make breaking changes obvious, and the bridge now requires Node.js 16+.</p>
<p>The release fixes the outdated <code>yarn.lock</code> file. Thanks to the package maintainers of NixOS to point this out! 👋
Furthermore, mentioning Matrix users in Discord got fixed.</p>
<p>And, for the fans of containers, we've re-added the release of Docker images. 🐳
The URL changed and we don't plan to update <code>halfshot/matrix-appservice-discord</code> on Docker Hub.
The image can be pulled from <code>ghcr.io/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-discord:v3.0.0</code>.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now shows you a pretty preview for rooms you are trying to join. This uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3266">MSC3266</a>, which you might need to enable in your synapse config, if you want to see more than the roomid of the room you are trying to join. It tries to fall back to the /hierarchy endpoint, but that won't work over federation.</p>
<p>Similarly you can now somewhat edit what rooms are in a space. I grew up with Windows 98, so this is a very nested right click menu. We are still discussing some of the wording choices for the options there, so if you have any opinions about it, feel free to give feedback about it! This is part of the bigger goal to be able to manage your communities from within Nheko, so stay tuned for more features coming in that area.</p>
<p>red_sky (nheko.im) also improved our notifications code on macOS. You can now disable the notification sound in the system settings, which for some reason requires badge permissions to show that option... macOS will always remain a mystery to us! Similarly we fixed the source text for notifications on Windows, which should now not show a stray %1 anymore as well as a few other cleanups.

<li>Ever started a DM with someone, only to get distracted and leave them staring into an empty timeline wondering who you are and what you want. Well, it is no more! In this update new DMs will only notify the person you’re messaging once you’ve sent your first message.</li>
<li>That’s not the only exciting update in EleWeb/Desktop this week, including the newly extended voice messages! Instead of voice messages capped at 2 minutes, users are now able to send a voice note of up to 15 minutes long. Go forth and record 🎤</li>
<li>In upcoming releases we’re also looking at how to improve a user’s first few days in Element. We know that it can be daunting to stare at an empty screen and wonder how to get going, which is why we’ve designed and built a checklist for new users. This checklist will help them to get off the ground and messaging friends in no time.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.0">Dendrite 0.9.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.1">Dendrite 0.9.1</a>. There are quite a few big changes, including an all-new caching model and several optimisations. This release also moves our baseline supported Go version up to Go 1.18.</p>
<p>The following changes are included across both releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite now uses Ristretto for managing in-memory caches
<ul>
<li>Should improve cache utilisation considerably over time by more intelligently selecting and managing cache entries compared to the previous LRU-based cache</li>
<li>Defaults to a 1GB cache size if not configured otherwise</li>
<li>The estimated cache size in memory and maximum age can now be configured with new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/e94ef84aaba30e12baf7f524c4e7a36d2fdeb189/dendrite-sample.monolith.yaml#L44-L61">configuration options</a> to prevent unbounded cache growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for serving the <code>/.well-known/matrix/client</code> hint directly from Dendrite
<ul>
<li>Configurable with the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/e94ef84aaba30e12baf7f524c4e7a36d2fdeb189/dendrite-sample.monolith.yaml#L67-L69">configuration option</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refactored membership updater, which should eliminate some bugs caused by the membership table getting out of sync with the room state</li>
<li>The User API is now responsible for sending account data updates to other components, which may fix some races and duplicate account data events</li>
<li>Optimised database query for checking whether a remote server is allowed to request an event over federation without using anywhere near as much CPU time (PostgreSQL only)</li>
<li>Database migrations have been refactored to eliminate some problems that were present with <code>goose</code> and upgrading from older Dendrite versions</li>
<li>Media fetching will now use the <code>/v3</code> endpoints for downloading media from remote homeservers</li>
<li>HTTP 404 and HTTP 405 errors from the client-facing APIs should now be returned with CORS headers so that web-based clients do not produce incorrect access control warnings for unknown endpoints</li>
<li>Some preparation work for full history visibility support</li>
<li>Upgrades a dependency which caused issues building Dendrite with Go 1.19</li>
<li>The roomserver will no longer give up prematurely after failing to call <code>/state_ids</code></li>
<li>Removes the faulty room info cache, which caused of a number of race conditions and occasional bugs (including when creating and joining rooms)</li>
<li>The media endpoint now sets the <code>Cache-Control</code> header correctly to prevent web-based clients from hitting media endpoints excessively</li>
<li>The sync API will now advance the PDU stream position correctly in all cases (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/sergekh2">sergekh2</a>)</li>
<li>The sync API will now delete the correct range of send-to-device messages when advancing the stream position</li>
<li>The device list <code>changed</code> key in the <code>/sync</code> response should now return the correct users</li>
<li>A data race when looking up missing state has been fixed</li>
<li>The <code>/send_join</code> API is now applying stronger validation to the received membership event</li>
<li>Fixes a crash that could occur during event redaction</li>
<li>The <code>/members</code> endpoint will no longer incorrectly return HTTP 500 as a result of some invite events</li>
<li>Send-to-device messages should now be ordered more reliably and the last position in the stream updated correctly</li>
<li>Parsing of appservice configuration files is now less strict (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/Kab1r">Kab1r</a>)</li>
<li>The sync API should now identify shared users correctly when waking up for E2EE key changes</li>
<li>The federation <code>/state</code> endpoint will now return a HTTP 403 when the state before an event isn't known instead of a HTTP 500</li>
<li>Presence timestamps should now be calculated with the correct precision</li>
<li>A race condition in the roomserver's room info has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition in the sync API has been fixed</li>
</ul>

<p>This bridge connects users on Matrix and Discord – or other platforms, if combined with other bridges.
Earlier this year the community bridge has been adopted by the Matrix.org bridge team to give it some attention.
Its most recent update dated back to December 2020 and some fixes waited for a new release.</p>
<p>Well, here it is! v2.0.0
Its breaking changes are the requirement of NodeJS 14 or newer and the usage of <code>yarn</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>.
Furthermore, the update introduces a changelog and rolls out the guidelines we use for developing other matrix.org bridges.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gleachkr:matrix.org">gleachkr</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a short vacation, I've done some new work on populus-viewer. Most of this has been UX and bugfixes, but I've added one new feature that I wanted to share. <a href="https://github.com/opentower/matrix-doc/blob/audio-markup/proposals/3775-markup-locations-for-audiovisual-media.md">MSC3775: Markup Locations for Audiovisual Media</a> gives a spec for annotating audio and video on matrix, but it also allows you to annotate images. So, for completeness sake, I've added support for annotating image files in Populus! This might be useful for discussing publication layouts, product designs, or for teaching art history. So populus can now annotate: video, audio, images and pdfs.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@robin:robin.town">Robin</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api/">matrix-widget-api</a> v1.0.0 was released yesterday, reflecting the fact that we're not expecting any big changes to the library's architecture for the foreseeable future, and that it's more or less ready for wider use.</p>
<p>It also comes with a couple of new features ✨ for widget authors: Sending and receiving to-device messages with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3819">MSC3819</a>, and getting TURN servers from the client with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3846/">MSC3846</a>. Together, these features enable some new complex use-cases, such as doing VoIP from inside a widget. See Matrix Live for a preview of what that looks like with Element Call! 📹️</p>
<p>This is as good a time as any to mention that matrix-widget-api doesn't have to just be for web-based apps. If you're building mobile apps with Matrix and want to make use of widgets, running matrix-widget-api inside a web view to liaison with the actual widget can make it a lot simpler to start supporting widget API features. If you're curious, watch Element iOS+Android for upcoming examples of this.</p>

<li>This week we've been building on the initial work on the pion call server (SFU) from Sean, and have made our very first call through it with Element Call! It's still very early and there's still lots of work to do, but this will allow Element Call to scale up to much higher numbers of people.</li>
<li>The VoIP team are also looking after widgets now, and in our quest to embed Element Call into the Element apps, we've hit the milestone of releasing matrix-widget-api 1.0.0. We're also making great progress towards embedding into Element Web.

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week saw a few major improvements on the dev-ex of the Rust SDK (among others): <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/892">support for refresh tokens</a> landed; we have a setup for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/855">integration tests against an actual synapse instance now</a> (and started writing tests); our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/897">docs for <code>main</code> now contain the js bindings, too</a>; <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/889">event handlers can now be unregistered</a> and we've added an API for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/899">room specific event handlers</a>. Further more, we've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/903">refactored the examples</a> (now to be found in <code>/examples</code> rather than some sub-sub-directory no one finds) and created two more: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/dfec17e6afbf6c1ea35e9ee968c7668eb4a46a04/examples/getting_started/src/main.rs"><code>getting-started</code></a> combines the autojoin and command-example with a lot more additional inline comment to explain what is going on and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/dfec17e6afbf6c1ea35e9ee968c7668eb4a46a04/examples/custom_events/src/main.rs"><code>custom-events</code></a> showcases how to use the sdk and ruma types to send any custom events (in that case a ping-ack example) over matrix!</p>
<p>This was also a week of fighting the ci. After the integration tests landed, coverage reporting broke and an investigation was kicked off to check whether llvm-cov is in a usable state for us by now (it is not), but a fix was found. We've also started regretting adding <code>npm</code>-based workflows in our repo, as we've found ourselves at the end of an upgrade bug and the saw CI failing without us changing anything :shakes_fist_at_sky: . A fix was found quickly by pinning a sub-dependency. On a similar note, we've postponed merging the kotlin bindings until the android team is back on it and available to answer some questions we have, and the wasm-js bindings showed build failures on CI, which the original author will have to take a look at after coming back from vacation - thus delaying <code>crypto-js</code> a bit further.</p>

<p>This week I'm showing off an early look at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive">Matrix public archive</a>. As the name suggests, it acts as an archive of history for your world-readable Matrix rooms. This allows you to view historical content day-by-day and jump back years ago to see what your Matrix room was up to.</p>
<p>More importantly, it also allows Google to do the same thing so you’ll probably start finding Matrix content from your favorite search engine and be able to harness the massive knowledge base stored in Matrix. Imagine seeing Matrix logs instead of Stack Overflow answers when googling questions! The new portal into the Matrix ecosystem 🌌</p>
<p>You can also see this demoed in <a href="https://youtu.be/6KHQSeJTXm0?t=583">this week's Matrix Live video</a> (at the top of the page).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/zFISGvYfCIhdqunsrPZMhOF.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Under the hood, we use the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3030">MSC3030 <code>/timestamp_to_event</code></a> endpoint to fetch the messages for a given day and then we sever-side render the events with the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen SDK</a>. Re-using Hydrogen gets us pretty and native(to Element) looking UI and keeps the maintenance burden of supporting new event types in Hydrogen.</p>

It was a &quot;for fun&quot; type of thing. But I can see it being useful for people who do not have access to a raspberry pi (such as myself at the moment) to use as a small homeserver. It can hold up in 1 to 1 Direct Messages and in small rooms.
