                <p>Happy TWIMday everyone! Thib is away this week again, so I'm covering for him as your host in this edition of This Week In Matrix.</p>

<p>Following up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsw1bbBjAM">last week's tutorial</a> about using Docker Compose to install Synapse, this week Thib explains how to use Ansible to deploy your own Matrix homeserver.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the year, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/04/this-week-in-matrix-2022-03-04#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F">t2bot.io passed 1 Million known rooms</a> and now it's passed 10 Million bridged users (10,039,915 users to be exact, at time of writing). Most of these users will be people who have participated in a channel/chat on Discord or Telegram that was bridged to Matrix through t2bot.io's free service, with about 500 thousand being active each month.</p>
<p>Approximately 8 Million of the users are from Telegram, covering about 11% of all Telegram users (previously 15% based on information available at the time). The remaining 2 Million are Discord users, roughly 0.5% of Discord's user base. For perspective, t2bot.io has just over 683 Million events in the database and is bridging between 30 and 40 thousand people a day.</p>
<p>Like last time, this is just a milestone update, though it's also a good reminder to host your own server if you can. Element's own <a href="https://element.io/matrix-services">hosting platform</a> is a great option if you'd like to have a server without running it yourself, and <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> offers a richer bridging experience than t2bot.io can feasibly provide. If you'd like to go down the self-hosting route, check out Thib's video guide on hosting synapse or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsw1bbBjAM">last week's Matrix Live</a> for a better understanding of what hosting Synapse actually means.</p>
<p>As for an interesting statistic: despite not having much functionality that deals with Spaces, t2bot.io can see 2687 Spaces from the wider world. The plan in the coming months is to support a way to bridge a whole Discord server to a Matrix Space, making this statistic hopefully more interesting as time goes on.</p>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2162">MSC2162: Signaling Errors at Bridges</a>!</p>
<p>Bridges sometimes are unable to relay messages to the remote service for one reason or another.  This MSC proposes a way to allow bridges to indicate that a message failed to be delivered, and allow users to tell the bridge to retry.

<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.5">Dendrite 0.9.5</a> which includes a number of fixes, particularly for federation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The roomserver will now correctly unreject previously rejected events if necessary when reprocessing</li>
<li>The handling of event soft-failure has been improved on the roomserver input by no longer applying rejection rules and still calculating state before the event if possible</li>
<li>The federation <code>/state</code> and <code>/state_ids</code> endpoints should now return the correct error code when the state isn't known instead of returning a HTTP 500</li>
<li>The federation <code>/event</code> should now return outlier events correctly instead of returning a HTTP 500</li>

<li>üòÑ Emoji verification support! Enable the option and you'll be able to interactively verify between the bot and your devices. (But mind that for now, <a href="https://simple-matrix-bot-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#interactive-sas-verification-using-emoji">in-room verification is not supported, but only to-device</a>).</li>
<li>‚òùÔ∏è Fingerprint verification support! As an additional method, the bot will print it's encryption fingerprint so you can &quot;manually verify&quot;.</li>
<li>üóÑÔ∏è Extensible config file! It is now easier than ever to add your own configuration options to the built-in TOML config file.</li>
<li>üßπ The usual housekeeping, bumping matrix-nio to 0.19.0.</li>
<li>üó®Ô∏è I (<a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks">HarHarLinks</a>) will be presenting the library this weekend at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-summit-berlin-2022:c-base.org">#matrix-summit-berlin-2022:c-base.org</a>! If you are in the Berlin üá©üá™ area, come visit c-base!</li>

<p>There's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aspec-bug">a lot more open issues</a> available for people to tackle however, so feel free to get involved and help out if you have some spare time!</p>
<p>Finally other than the usual rounds of review by the team, I've been working on a spec process document that aims to explain the practical portions of the text found at https://spec.matrix.org/proposals/, but in a easily scannable manner. Look out for a PR with that in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2871">MSC2871: Give widgets an indication of which capabilities they were approved for</a>! What a mouthful!</p>
<p>Historically, widgets have laid outside of the spec and have only been implemented in a small subset of clients - mainly Element. As of recent weeks though, there's now a team at Element backing the feature. So exciting times ahead!</p>
<p>Regardless, let's highlight this MSC! It solves a crucial problem with a simple solution. Widgets can ask the client they're embedded in to do certain things (if granted certain capabilities), and the client, potentially after asking the user for permission, can allow or deny those actions. This MSC adds the machinery for a further step: the client will tell the widget what capabilities they requested were allowed, and which were denied.</p>
<p>I believe this spec is non-contentious, but is blocked on widgets entering the spec as a whole. Regardless, if this particular piece of the puzzle interests you, or you'd like to read all about widgets in general, the see either the MSC above or this widget spec tracking PR: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/pull/825.

<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.4">Dendrite 0.9.4</a>, containing primarily bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bug in the roomserver around handling rejected outliers has been fixed</li>
<li>Backfilled events will now use the correct history visibility where possible</li>
<li>The device list updater backoff has been fixed, which should reduce the number of outbound HTTP requests and <code>Failed to query device keys for some users</code> log entries for dead servers</li>
<li>The <code>/sync</code> endpoint will no longer incorrectly return room entries for retired invites which could cause some rooms to show up in the client &quot;Historical&quot; section</li>
<li>The <code>/createRoom</code> endpoint will now correctly populate <code>is_direct</code> in invite membership events, which may help clients to classify direct messages correctly</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool will now log an error if the shared secret is not set in the Dendrite config</li>
<li>A couple of minor bugs have been fixed in the membership lazy-loading</li>
<li>Queued EDUs in the federation API are now cached properly</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, please feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for more Dendrite-related discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now has some very dirty hack to render spoilers on desktop platforms. This does not show the reason and not work in mobile mode, doesn't hide it from notifications or from the sidebar. But it is at least something. Similarly we tightened what tags we allow when validating the incoming html again. Also, as a small fix, DMs should now also properly start with encryption enabled when started from a profile and there were a few crash fixes when searching for direct chat partners and closing the window too quickly or when a user uploads a device with invalid keys.</p>

<p>This week in the dart SDK we mostly fixed bugs. Many of those are related to call negotiations where streams were closed in the wrong order, not closed at all or in group calls the call never learned about new members or the call_ids would not match. There were also a few fixes to the background thumbnailing support added in 0.11.1, helper methods were added to easily send the right message corresponding to the mimetype of some media and fetching a timeline for some event id should work properly again.</p>
<p>We have some support to mark a room as either a dm or a group using slashcommands now, you have more flexibility when implementing the SSSS Bootstrap now (using the extra Bootstrap parameter in onUpdate() and to round it all off, we now have nice coverage numbers as well as coverage display on merge request diffs.</p>

<p>In less than a week the Matrix Community Summit Berlin is taking place at c-base.
Join us early on Thursday (25th August) for a Barcamp where we will brainstorm, draft and prototype new ideas.
The main conference days are Friday and Saturday (26th and 27th August). We have a schedule all about Matrix hosting, clients and development.
With three simultaneous tracks there sure is something for you to listen to. It's also the perfect place to get to know other community members.
Look forward to talks, workshops, a signing party, a Matrix P2P live test, dinner and barbecue!</p>
<p>We're not planing to stream or record the event. Our focus lies on providing a great in-person activities.
If attendees want to blog or toot/tweet about it, please use the hashtag #MatrixCommunitySummit.
Also, German-speaking folks can look forward to more coverage from the event on my podcast.

<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3783">MSC3783: Fixed base64 for SAS verification</a>!</p>
<p>For those that don't know, &quot;SAS verification&quot; refers to the act of two devices verifying each other through the use of Short Authentication Strings (SAS). This is the backbone of emoji verification when you verify with another user or one of your own devices.</p>
<p>It turns out that libolm, the olm and megolm encryption library, originally incorrectly encoded the base64 output of the message authentication code (MAC) calculation, which is a values that's passed between devices. Due to trying to maintain backwards-compatibility with older clients, this has not been fixed in newer clients yet.</p>
<p>This MSC proposes bumping the MAC algorithm identifier (which is agreed upon between devices when verifying) to a something new, which allows newer clients to know when to use the new or old (and incorrect) method of calculating the base64 encoding of MAC values.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this has no security implications. It's just unfortunate to have incorrect base64 encoding when interfacing with other, non-libolm, implementations of olm and megolm.

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.2">Dendrite 0.9.2</a> which contains the following updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite now supports history visibility on the <code>/sync</code>, <code>/messages</code> and <code>/context</code> endpoints
<ul>
<li>It should now be possible to view the history of a room in more cases (as opposed to limiting scrollback to the join event or defaulting to the restrictive <code>&quot;join&quot;</code> visibility rule as before)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The default room version for newly created rooms is now room version 9</li>
<li>New admin endpoint <code>/_dendrite/admin/resetPassword/{userID}</code> has been added, which replaces the <code>-reset-password</code> flag in <code>create-account</code></li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> binary now uses shared secret registration over HTTP to create new accounts, which fixes a number of problems with account data and push rules not being configured correctly for new accounts</li>
<li>The internal HTTP APIs for polylith deployments have been refactored for correctness and consistency</li>
<li>The federation API will now automatically clean up some EDUs that have failed to send within a certain period of time</li>
<li>The <code>/hierarchy</code> endpoint will now return potentially joinable rooms (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/texuf">texuf</a>)</li>
<li>The user directory will now show or hide users correctly</li>
<li>Send-to-device messages should no longer be incorrectly duplicated in <code>/sync</code></li>
<li>The federation sender will no longer create unnecessary destination queues as a result of a logic error</li>
<li>A bug where database migrations may not execute properly when upgrading from older versions has been fixed</li>
<li>A crash when failing to update user account data has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition when generating notification counts has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition when setting up NATS has been fixed (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/brianathere">brianathere</a>)</li>

<p>What? Another week, another major release?
Yes, we want to make breaking changes obvious, and the bridge now requires Node.js 16+.</p>
<p>The release fixes the outdated <code>yarn.lock</code> file. Thanks to the package maintainers of NixOS to point this out! üëã
Furthermore, mentioning Matrix users in Discord got fixed.</p>
<p>And, for the fans of containers, we've re-added the release of Docker images. üê≥

<p>Nheko now shows you a pretty preview for rooms you are trying to join. This uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3266">MSC3266</a>, which you might need to enable in your synapse config, if you want to see more than the roomid of the room you are trying to join. It tries to fall back to the /hierarchy endpoint, but that won't work over federation.</p>
<p>Similarly you can now somewhat edit what rooms are in a space. I grew up with Windows 98, so this is a very nested right click menu. We are still discussing some of the wording choices for the options there, so if you have any opinions about it, feel free to give feedback about it! This is part of the bigger goal to be able to manage your communities from within Nheko, so stay tuned for more features coming in that area.</p>
<p>red_sky (nheko.im) also improved our notifications code on macOS. You can now disable the notification sound in the system settings, which for some reason requires badge permissions to show that option... macOS will always remain a mystery to us! Similarly we fixed the source text for notifications on Windows, which should now not show a stray %1 anymore as well as a few other cleanups.

<li>Ever started a DM with someone, only to get distracted and leave them staring into an empty timeline wondering who you are and what you want. Well, it is no more! In this update new DMs will only notify the person you‚Äôre messaging once you‚Äôve sent your first message.</li>
<li>That‚Äôs not the only exciting update in EleWeb/Desktop this week, including the newly extended voice messages! Instead of voice messages capped at 2 minutes, users are now able to send a voice note of up to 15 minutes long. Go forth and record üé§</li>
<li>In upcoming releases we‚Äôre also looking at how to improve a user‚Äôs first few days in Element. We know that it can be daunting to stare at an empty screen and wonder how to get going, which is why we‚Äôve designed and built a checklist for new users. This checklist will help them to get off the ground and messaging friends in no time.</li>

<li>Threads improvements are still very much underway. We have a proof of concept (PoC) for improving notifications that we‚Äôre testing to ensure scalability and performance.</li>

<li>Our release this week was rejected by Apple. Their feedback? Our info.plist comments do not provide enough context as to why we‚Äôre asking for access to things like the camera, photos, or contacts. Never fear! We‚Äôve updated our copy and we‚Äôre confident that it‚Äôs clearer than ever.</li>
<li>Also in the upcoming release:
<ul>
<li>Fixing the crashes that some users were running into when switching space.</li>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>On July 28 project marked its one-year milestone. During this time it has grown at an unexpected rate, both in terms of development as well as popularity. This is great news, so let's celebrate that with this birthday edition.</p>
<p>In this update, we have added <strong>Custom emoji and sticker support</strong> to Cinny. Custom emoji and stickers were not in our roadmap but that's the surprise. Aren't they cool?
Apart from the emoji and stickers, there are tons of other features such as Blurhash, Mark entire space as read, user pills, and bug fixes. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny/releases/tag/v2.1.0">release</a> <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny/releases/tag/v2.1.1">page</a> for a <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny/releases/tag/v2.1.2">detailed changelog</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of the roadmap, we are still on that, work on the &quot;Rich input editor&quot; is in progress and will come as the next release. Stay tuned for that!</p>
<p>The update is live on <a href="https://app.cinny.in/">https://app.cinny.in</a> and the desktop app can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny-desktop/releases/tag/v2.1.2">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.0">Dendrite 0.9.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.1">Dendrite 0.9.1</a>. There are quite a few big changes, including an all-new caching model and several optimisations. This release also moves our baseline supported Go version up to Go 1.18.</p>
<p>The following changes are included across both releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite now uses Ristretto for managing in-memory caches
<ul>
<li>Should improve cache utilisation considerably over time by more intelligently selecting and managing cache entries compared to the previous LRU-based cache</li>
<li>Defaults to a 1GB cache size if not configured otherwise</li>
<li>The estimated cache size in memory and maximum age can now be configured with new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/e94ef84aaba30e12baf7f524c4e7a36d2fdeb189/dendrite-sample.monolith.yaml#L44-L61">configuration options</a> to prevent unbounded cache growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for serving the <code>/.well-known/matrix/client</code> hint directly from Dendrite
<ul>
<li>Configurable with the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/e94ef84aaba30e12baf7f524c4e7a36d2fdeb189/dendrite-sample.monolith.yaml#L67-L69">configuration option</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refactored membership updater, which should eliminate some bugs caused by the membership table getting out of sync with the room state</li>
<li>The User API is now responsible for sending account data updates to other components, which may fix some races and duplicate account data events</li>
<li>Optimised database query for checking whether a remote server is allowed to request an event over federation without using anywhere near as much CPU time (PostgreSQL only)</li>
<li>Database migrations have been refactored to eliminate some problems that were present with <code>goose</code> and upgrading from older Dendrite versions</li>
<li>Media fetching will now use the <code>/v3</code> endpoints for downloading media from remote homeservers</li>
<li>HTTP 404 and HTTP 405 errors from the client-facing APIs should now be returned with CORS headers so that web-based clients do not produce incorrect access control warnings for unknown endpoints</li>
<li>Some preparation work for full history visibility support</li>
<li>Upgrades a dependency which caused issues building Dendrite with Go 1.19</li>
<li>The roomserver will no longer give up prematurely after failing to call <code>/state_ids</code></li>
<li>Removes the faulty room info cache, which caused of a number of race conditions and occasional bugs (including when creating and joining rooms)</li>
<li>The media endpoint now sets the <code>Cache-Control</code> header correctly to prevent web-based clients from hitting media endpoints excessively</li>
<li>The sync API will now advance the PDU stream position correctly in all cases (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/sergekh2">sergekh2</a>)</li>
<li>The sync API will now delete the correct range of send-to-device messages when advancing the stream position</li>
<li>The device list <code>changed</code> key in the <code>/sync</code> response should now return the correct users</li>
<li>A data race when looking up missing state has been fixed</li>
<li>The <code>/send_join</code> API is now applying stronger validation to the received membership event</li>
<li>Fixes a crash that could occur during event redaction</li>
<li>The <code>/members</code> endpoint will no longer incorrectly return HTTP 500 as a result of some invite events</li>
<li>Send-to-device messages should now be ordered more reliably and the last position in the stream updated correctly</li>
<li>Parsing of appservice configuration files is now less strict (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/Kab1r">Kab1r</a>)</li>
<li>The sync API should now identify shared users correctly when waking up for E2EE key changes</li>
<li>The federation <code>/state</code> endpoint will now return a HTTP 403 when the state before an event isn't known instead of a HTTP 500</li>
<li>Presence timestamps should now be calculated with the correct precision</li>
<li>A race condition in the roomserver's room info has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition in the sync API has been fixed</li>
</ul>

<p>This bridge connects users on Matrix and Discord ‚Äì or other platforms, if combined with other bridges.
Earlier this year the community bridge has been adopted by the Matrix.org bridge team to give it some attention.
Its most recent update dated back to December 2020 and some fixes waited for a new release.</p>
<p>Well, here it is! v2.0.0
Its breaking changes are the requirement of NodeJS 14 or newer and the usage of <code>yarn</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>.
Furthermore, the update introduces a changelog and rolls out the guidelines we use for developing other matrix.org bridges.</p>

<p>After a short vacation, I've done some new work on populus-viewer. Most of this has been UX and bugfixes, but I've added one new feature that I wanted to share. <a href="https://github.com/opentower/matrix-doc/blob/audio-markup/proposals/3775-markup-locations-for-audiovisual-media.md">MSC3775: Markup Locations for Audiovisual Media</a> gives a spec for annotating audio and video on matrix, but it also allows you to annotate images. So, for completeness sake, I've added support for annotating image files in Populus! This might be useful for discussing publication layouts, product designs, or for teaching art history. So populus can now annotate: video, audio, images and pdfs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api/">matrix-widget-api</a> v1.0.0 was released yesterday, reflecting the fact that we're not expecting any big changes to the library's architecture for the foreseeable future, and that it's more or less ready for wider use.</p>
<p>It also comes with a couple of new features ‚ú® for widget authors: Sending and receiving to-device messages with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3819">MSC3819</a>, and getting TURN servers from the client with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3846/">MSC3846</a>. Together, these features enable some new complex use-cases, such as doing VoIP from inside a widget. See Matrix Live for a preview of what that looks like with Element Call! üìπÔ∏è</p>
<p>This is as good a time as any to mention that matrix-widget-api doesn't have to just be for web-based apps. If you're building mobile apps with Matrix and want to make use of widgets, running matrix-widget-api inside a web view to liaison with the actual widget can make it a lot simpler to start supporting widget API features. If you're curious, watch Element iOS+Android for upcoming examples of this.</p>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week saw a few major improvements on the dev-ex of the Rust SDK (among others): <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/892">support for refresh tokens</a> landed; we have a setup for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/855">integration tests against an actual synapse instance now</a> (and started writing tests); our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/897">docs for <code>main</code> now contain the js bindings, too</a>; <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/889">event handlers can now be unregistered</a> and we've added an API for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/899">room specific event handlers</a>. Further more, we've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/903">refactored the examples</a> (now to be found in <code>/examples</code> rather than some sub-sub-directory no one finds) and created two more: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/dfec17e6afbf6c1ea35e9ee968c7668eb4a46a04/examples/getting_started/src/main.rs"><code>getting-started</code></a> combines the autojoin and command-example with a lot more additional inline comment to explain what is going on and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/dfec17e6afbf6c1ea35e9ee968c7668eb4a46a04/examples/custom_events/src/main.rs"><code>custom-events</code></a> showcases how to use the sdk and ruma types to send any custom events (in that case a ping-ack example) over matrix!</p>
<p>This was also a week of fighting the ci. After the integration tests landed, coverage reporting broke and an investigation was kicked off to check whether llvm-cov is in a usable state for us by now (it is not), but a fix was found. We've also started regretting adding <code>npm</code>-based workflows in our repo, as we've found ourselves at the end of an upgrade bug and the saw CI failing without us changing anything :shakes_fist_at_sky: . A fix was found quickly by pinning a sub-dependency. On a similar note, we've postponed merging the kotlin bindings until the android team is back on it and available to answer some questions we have, and the wasm-js bindings showed build failures on CI, which the original author will have to take a look at after coming back from vacation - thus delaying <code>crypto-js</code> a bit further.</p>

<p>This week I'm showing off an early look at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive">Matrix public archive</a>. As the name suggests, it acts as an archive of history for your world-readable Matrix rooms. This allows you to view historical content day-by-day and jump back years ago to see what your Matrix room was up to.</p>
<p>More importantly, it also allows Google to do the same thing so you‚Äôll probably start finding Matrix content from your favorite search engine and be able to harness the massive knowledge base stored in Matrix. Imagine seeing Matrix logs instead of Stack Overflow answers when googling questions! The new portal into the Matrix ecosystem üåå</p>
<p>You can also see this demoed in <a href="https://youtu.be/6KHQSeJTXm0?t=583">this week's Matrix Live video</a> (at the top of the page).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/zFISGvYfCIhdqunsrPZMhOF.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Under the hood, we use the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3030">MSC3030 <code>/timestamp_to_event</code></a> endpoint to fetch the messages for a given day and then we sever-side render the events with the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen SDK</a>. Re-using Hydrogen gets us pretty and native(to Element) looking UI and keeps the maintenance burden of supporting new event types in Hydrogen.</p>

<p>This MSC covers an Extensible Events (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) schema definition for translatable text!

<blockquote>
<p>Greetings! We have been hard at work on Synapse this week. Work on faster room joins continues. In addition, Synapse 1.64.0rc2 was released. Notable features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>support for room version 10</li>
<li>per-room rate limiting for room joins</li>
<li>support for Implicit TLS for sending emails
and much more, as well as a number of bugfixes, improvements to the documentation, and other changes to make Synapse leaner, faster, and generally more awesome.</li>

<h3 id="construct-server">Construct Server</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week The Construct server runs on Alpine Linux using freshly cut docker images building on the 0.7 release announced last week. A few images are available for preview while a more complete matrix is filled out. I am proud to announce to TWIM that Construct offers the most compact docker image for a Matrix server at just under 15 MiB; the only caveat is that media
thumbnailing won't be available.</p>
<p>There's still a lot of room for optimization and docker experts to critique! Feel free to join the discussion at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> and check out https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct today!</p>

<li>It‚Äôs an exciting week for both our mobile teams as we‚Äôre ready to release our new authentication flow! If you‚Äôve been reading TWIM for a while you‚Äôll know that we‚Äôve been working hard, across all Element teams, to improve our onboarding experience. Part of this work on iOS was a new Create Account flow.
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre rolling the changes out slowly, so don‚Äôt panic if you don‚Äôt see the new experience yet!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In even more exciting news, our test coverage has increased with a big bump. We‚Äôve gone from 12% to 51%!</li>
<li>We‚Äôve also continued to make updates and improvements to our location sharing feature.</li>
<li>On the ElementX front we have our first proof of concept for sliding sync (sync v3) working and we‚Äôve almost finished setting up snapshot and integration testing. We also have Rust logs, a new authentication service and performance tests incoming.</li>
<li>Finally, the account deactivation button has had a change of copy - this keeps us inline with Apple guidelines around deleting and deactivating accounts.</li>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been a week of quite, constant progress on many fronts, most not that visible to the outside observer. For once, the progress on integration sliding sync into element-x for iOS has taken up speed, with many smaller bug fixes and additional features exposed through the FFI being added and performance optimisations. After the internal jack-in testing tool, this is the first actual trial of sliding sync for rust (and after the js-implementation, only the second client to actually use sliding sync overall)‚Äîand it has been tremendous. Latest tests put the loading time to first view on the first 20-ish rooms at a 150ms range üéâ.</p>
<p>More visible to the keen observers of the repository has been that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/874">we've updated the <code>event_handler</code> API</a> to allow removing existing handlers, an important step towards implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/868">completion guaranteeing API calls</a>, and that we've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/882">support for custom encrypted events</a> now.</p>

<p>An episode with the maintainers of Threematrix, the 100% Rust bridge between Matrix and Threema!</p>
<p>In addition to that, <a href="https://matrix.org/open-tech-will-save-us/">Open Tech Will Save Us will be back on Wednesday 27 at 16:00 UTC</a>! The topic will be &quot;what makes a platform&quot;, or more specifically: &quot;are Linux or the web platforms&quot;. There are many fascinating topics to discuss, such as &quot;is it possible to create an app for Linux&quot; (it's not as simple as it sounds), &quot;why are some people against theming?&quot;, or &quot;why do developers want to use platforms&quot;.</p>
<p>And to answer that, who other than the Linux desktop most advanced projects GNOME and KDE, and people working on Matrix, the protocol that wants to become as unmissable as the web itself, and more specifically on a deeper integration of widgets with Matrix clients?</p>
<p>You can join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#otwsu:matrix.org">#otwsu:matrix.org</a> to ask your questions on July 27 during the live show, and bookmark either https://stream.matrix.org or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGE2KEasjbc">YouTube stream</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of MSCs moving through the pipeline in the last couple weeks! As always, be sure to take a look at those in Final Comment Period above - only a few days left to comment on them before they merge/close!</p>
<p>Otherwise the Spec Core Team is looking to try and get a handle on the current MSC backlog - this means taking a look at all of the open MSCs, triaging them and organising them into a loose priority queue. This is likely to take quite a while to do and may not ever be complete - but should give us and everyone else an idea of what's expected to land in upcoming Matrix spec versions.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3217">MSC3217: Soft kicks</a>!</p>
<p>The idea this MSC proposes is to add a possible <code>m.softkick</code> field to room membership events of type &quot;leave&quot;, which if present will inform clients that the user has only been kicked temporarily, and they are welcome to rejoin.</p>
<p>This helps with the IRC bridging use case laid out in the MSC.</p>

<h2 id="offline-matrix-spec-for-dash-and-zeal">Offline Matrix Spec for Dash and Zeal</h2>
<p>I use Zeal ‚Äì an offline documentation browser using the same docsets as Dash for MacOS.
It allows me to browse MDN, ExpressJS docs, NodeJS docs and other languages and formats while not relying on the Internet when traveling.
They have &quot;208 awesome docsets&quot;, and I guess you know which one I'm missing ‚Äì or used to miss, until I packaged it myself.</p>
<p>Introducing: The <a href="https://gitlab.com/jaller94/dash-matrix-spec">Matrix Spec for Dash and Zeal</a></p>
<p>If you use Dash or Zeal, give it a try. Let me know, if you find pages that are not working.
I hope that Matrix will be included in their list of user-contributed docsets.</p>
<p>Note, this is not an official release distribution of the Matrix Spec. Enjoy at your own risk of this breaking or not getting updated.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct server has been refurbished to support the Ubuntu 22.04+ platform. I am happy to
report that Construct performs faster and more reliably than ever before. It's been
a long time since the last update due to COVID-related health problems, but development
has picked up again. I'd like to thank @manu_kamath:matrix.org and @uis246 for their
contributions, and of course Yan Minari for keeping things together over the past year.
Additional work implementing the latest MSC's will continue in the coming weeks so I
encourage everyone to show support in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> and contribute if possible.</p>
<p>Several enhancements have taken place this release, so I'd just like to highlight one
here: The media database has been eliminated and has been integrated into the main
events database. Construct did always store media in rooms by splitting files
into blocks, but it offloaded the content block to separate storage leaving just a
hash of the content in the matrix event. Construct now stores blocks directly in event
content via hardware-accelerated base64 encoding. The result performs better because 
there's only one database query instead of two, and the room can be shared between
servers in a Construct Cluster.</p>
<p>Construct is a performant and robust Matrix Server and Natural Language Processor.
Please be mindful of any laws in your country which require registering your instance
for commercial use.</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan Abolivier</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we've released Synapse 1.63! This release includes a few features such as better rate limiting for invites, as well as experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">MSC3827</a> which allows filtering public room search results by room type. The latter will, once stabilised, allow for better discoverability of public spaces since it will allow clients to specifically look for them. Read all about this new release on the matrix.org blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/07/20/synapse-1-63-released</p>
<p>We've also spent some time clarifying documentation and prompts about the usage statistics Synapse automatically reports if configured with <code>report_stats</code> set to <code>true</code>. The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.63/usage/administration/monitoring/reporting_homeserver_usage_statistics.html">new documentation page</a> lists exactly what is reported and how this reporting works. This clarification work included removing the use of &quot;anonymised&quot; when referring to this feature to make it clearer that, even though Synapse does not report identifiable information about users and rooms, it does report the homeserver's name (i.e. the value of the <code>server_name</code> configuration setting).</p>

<p>Say hello to a new bridge in Matrix universe (or rather fediverse): <strong>Threematrix</strong>. As you might've guessed from the name: It's a bridge between the Threema messenger and Matrix. Threema is a very popular messenger in europe, especially in German speaking countries (it's a swiss company). We've just released our very first alpha version ‚Äì it's a very simple bot bridge for now, but we have quite a lot of improvements on our todo list. Currently, it only works with the (paid) Threema Gateway API product, but we're trying to talk to Threema to come up with a more affordable hobbyist pricing model for bridge use. Feel free to follow our releases in the <a href="https://github.com/bitbetterde/Threematrix">GitHub repo</a>, follow our <a href="https://mastodon.social/web/@threematrix">Mastodon account</a> and join our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#threema-bridge:matrix.org">Matrix room</a> to stay up to date or ask any questions.</p>

<p>Hello all -- since our last TWIM announcement, Hookshot has been updated from 1.7.2 to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.8.1">1.8.1</a>. Aside from usability fixes and documentation improvements, there have been some notable changes to generic webhook support:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>XML webhook payloads are now decoded</strong> instead of being treated as blobs of text.

<p>I got a fantastic release for you to day and it won't fit inside a normal sized update so without further ado, here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notification counts üíØ (LorenDB, d42)
<ul>
<li>You can now see notification counts in more spaces, like your task bar or in
the community sidebar.</li>
<li>For better work-life balance you can hide the notification counts on a per
space basis.</li>
<li>For notification counts in the task bar your desktop environment needs to
support the Unity protocol.</li>
<li>Notifications are also preserved across restarts now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moderation üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
<ul>
<li>You can now change the permissions and aliases of a room.</li>
<li>Permissions are shown in the Memberlist</li>
<li>A new <code>/redact</code> command to redact an event or all messages by a user.</li>
<li>You can now provide a reason when inviting, knocking, kicking and banning
users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Faster startup ‚ö°
<ul>
<li>On at least some systems startup should now be instant even with thousands
of rooms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Encryption improvements üõ°Ô∏è
<ul>
<li>Support for the most recent changes to Matrix E2EE including fallback keys,
no longer relying on the sender_key.</li>
<li>Compatibility and stability improvements when dealing with different base64
encodings and when verifying users and devices.</li>
<li>Fetch the whole online key backup at the click of a button.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integration with external apps üó∫Ô∏è (LorenDB)
<ul>
<li>Nheko now has a D-Bus API, which you can enable in the settings menu.</li>
<li>This allows applications like KRunner or Rofi to list and switch between
rooms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are reading this a bit early, the release builds might still be cooking, but they should be available in the next few hours. There about 40 more features and at least 30 bugfixes waiting for you, so checkout the release here: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases/tag/v0.10.0 . I'd like to thank as always everyone who contributed to this release, it has been a pleasure to work with you folks and I hope I will see a few of you in the next release as well.</p>
<p>As you might be able to tell, moderation features were a big topic this release. But they are clearly not done yet and I expect more of those to land in the future now that Nheko is fairly mature. There are also a few other cool features planned, so while this release is exciting, there will always be more! Same bad client, same bad... wait, this is not my outro!</p>

<li>We have started to work on using the new Realm Kotlin SDK (we are using the legacy Java SDK at the moment): it should improve the stability of the app (and so the crash free session) and improve devX. Nearly all the possible blocking points have been handled. This will force us to use suspend methods, which will be useful for ElementX.</li>

<p>New project! <code>open-super-dapp-android</code> is a fully open source, open standard, decentralized &quot;super app&quot; including a secure, encrypted Matrix compatible messenger based off of the Element Messenger, and an Ethereum crypto wallet and web3 browser based off of Alpha Wallet. Our mission is to foster, and provide access to, a decentralized and secure digital commons for all. Github repo: https://github.com/2gatherproject/open-super-dapp-android</p>
<p>OSD is a downstream project of Element, aiming to provide the functionalities of a &quot;super app&quot; like WeChat, just as an open, distributed and not-for-profit app instead of a proprietary, closed and for-profit one.</p>
<p>This software is pre-alpha, actively seeking contributors, donors and maintainers/leaders. Get in on the ground floor and help build something amazing!</p>
<p>Currently, Open Super dApp builds and runs with full functionality of the Element messenger and Alpha Wallet in the same Android app, with all existing tests passing. Efforts to further integrate their functionalities are just beginning.</p>
<p>Next steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate easy to use person to person Ethereum payment functionality between Matrix users.</li>
<li>Provide a powerful and easy to use messaging and payment javascript API for use by web3 applications accessed through the Open Super dApp. Produce sample web dApps using this API.</li>
<li>Centralize cryptographic secrets between the wallet and the messenger.</li>
<li>Build a parallel iOS version for iPhones using Element iOS and Alpha Wallet iOS.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan Abolivier</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because I don't like having to change my display name to tell coworkers when I'm away, I've written a maubot plugin for an auto-responder bot.</p>
<p>It allows me to signal when I'm away, at which point anyone who sends a message in an existing DM will be sent an automated reply so they know that I'm away, when I'll be back, and how to reach out to me in case of emergencies (it does this once per DM until I come back). When I'm back, I just need to tell the bot and it will automatically turn off the auto-responder and give me a summary of the DMs in which I've missed messages while I was away.</p>
<p>The source code and package for this plugin are available right here: https://github.com/babolivier/maubot-autoreply üôÇ</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just created a simple bot that generates a MSC url from the specified MSC id.
The source code for the project can be found at https://mau.dev/minecraftchest1/mscbot/. And example instance can be found at @maubottest1:synapse1.arsrobotics.org Demo and use the bot in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#msc-bot:synapse1.arsrobotics">#msc-bot:synapse1.arsrobotics</a>.org</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cat:feline.support">Cat</a> reminds us</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This feature is already in the MSC bot used in #matrix-spec or atleast in one of those bots.</p>

<p>A release tracker that posts updates into Matrix rooms</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio">Ananace</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/ananace/matrix-releasetracker">release tracking bot</a> received a bunch more work since the last update. It now supports tracking repos, groups, and user stars on GitHub, GitLab (both .com and self-hosted), as well as Gitea (though Gitea requires a token for reading stars). And also tracking &quot;releases&quot; - a.k.a. tags - on bare Git repos, at least as long as they don't require SSH key authorization. Things are getting ever closer to a 1.0 release, with only really some missing bang commands and error reporting being the remaining pieces.</p>
