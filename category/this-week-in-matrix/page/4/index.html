<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone. It's been a quieter week for the Synapse team---many of us are away this week.</p>
<p>We released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.55.0rc1">Synapse 1.55.0rc1</a> yesterday, a little later than usual. A full release is still planned for the coming Tuesday (22nd March). Please note that this release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11700">breaks compatibility with Mjolnir 1.3.1 and earlier</a>. Administrators using Mjolnir should ensure it is upgraded before upgrading Synapse to 1.55.0rc1.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the release candidate includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12028">New tools in the module API</a> enabling modules to prevent administrators from deleting rooms and deactivating users. Half-Shot <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12026">explains the movtivation here</a>.</li>
<li>Experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12135">using Twisted's asyncio reactor</a>. If this is feasible, it might allow us to leverage tools and libraries for Python's growing <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html?highlight=asyncio#module-asyncio">asyncio</a> ecosystem.</li>
<li>A performance fix for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12132">logging in on large accounts</a>.</li>
<li>A variety of other bugfixes and internal tweaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please feel free to try it out and let us know how you get on: either in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new/choose">on GitHub</a> if you encounter any unexplained problems. As ever, many thanks to all contributors involved.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes we've been working on a few longer-term projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continued support for threading (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>) and the mechanism which supports it, relations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2674">MSC2674</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11537">Managing Synapse's dependencies</a> using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12028">poetry</a> to formally lock requirements across all our debian and docker releases.</li>
<li>Performance investigations: we're looking at getting better profiling information; and seeing if we can reclaim CPU cycles by cancelling processing when a requester terminates their request early.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully we'll see these plans come to fruition over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week brings some bugfixes to DMs, and general improvements to the way channels are synced on startup.</p>
<p>I've also written some <a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-appservice-kakaotalk/src/branch/master/SETUP.md">setup instructions</a> to assist anyone wanting to try this bridge out for themselves!</p>
<p>As for bugs, I just stumbled upon a big one just now: if a KakaoTalk channel hasn't had activity for a few days, sending a message in its Matrix portal may crash. This happens because of the KakaoTalk API's apparent eagerness in forgetting about inactive channels (IIRC content that's a few weeks old is deleted from their servers, for privacy reasons), and the likely fix is for the bridge to use the right API calls to trigger those channels back into an active state before trying to interact with them.</p>
<p>Once that's fixed, the next thing I'll get out of the way (for the sake of completeness) is the web-based login interface, which all of the other mautrix-python bridges support (and is quite nice for privacy-conscious users that would rather send their KakaoTalk passwords directly to the bridge, instead of through a Matrix homeserver).</p>
<p>After that, I'll work on contact searching &amp; inviting contacts to group chats or DMs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After our release last week, of course all the bugreports came out of the woodworks. As such we fixed issues with device ids being set incorrectly after SSO, screensharing, overlapping in the reply popup and UIA flows without fallback support like https://github.com/devture/matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth showing up as UIA stages. Key backup is also now enabled by default (if it has the correct signatures and everything), various layouting fixes and more.</p>
<p>We'll probably make a bugfix release in the next few days.</p>

<p>I have been working on integrating MSC3575: Sliding Sync into Element-Web. This is a pretty large endeavour but there has been a lot of progress on it already!</p>
<p>There now exists a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/2242">JS-SDK PR</a> to add the core bits of Sliding Sync (along with E2EE/to-device extensions), and a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/tree/kegan/sliding-sync">React-SDK branch</a> which adds the Labs flag, <code>config.json</code> section for the proxy URL, and sets up room subscriptions when you select a room. The net result?</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/ZLWTIMcqEUqPHCTKNQVrHqsb.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is still early days: you cannot scroll the room list yet and there's still many outstanding issues to fix before it can land on mainline, but it's at the stage where it's <em>almost</em> ready for people to try out. Watch this space...</p>

<h2 id="v0-6-0-v0-6-1">v0.6.0 &amp; v0.6.1</h2>
<p>Want to purge a space recursively? Matrix Wrench now has a button for that. It will try to fetch a list of all sub spaces and rooms and offer you to delete them via the Synapse Admin API.</p>
<p>Also, you can now knock on rooms and the room lists allow to navigate to a room page by clicking on a room ID.</p>
<p>Next up will likely be searchable lists for rooms and users as well as other usability and layout improvements. The goal is to have a nice-looking, stable v1.0 release for its anniversary on 13th June. I'm looking for help with design and documentation.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Keeping in step with our quarterly spec releases, the release of Matrix v1.3 is expected to land sometime early Q2 2022. This release will include Threads (as defined by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>), as well as a number of other MSCs which land in the meantime.</p>
<p>Speaking of other MSCs, client developers should be aware of upcoming work to support live and static location sharing in the ecosystem. A <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!XXSJTvRPInupfUgQVb:matrix.org/$SM5oKCPu1OYu1uVhn73YMUcJ4kBaQZEp_Z9Xx4EZUgQ?via=pixie.town&amp;via=matrix.org&amp;via=element.io">notice</a> on the subject has been posted today in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-client-developers:matrix.org">Matrix Client Developers room</a>.</p>
<p>A reminder that the matrix-doc GitHub repository has been split into two new repositories: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec">matrix-spec</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals">matrix-spec-proposals</a>. Read more about this in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix#msc-status">the last edition of TWIM</a>.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2398">MSC2398: proposal to allow mxc:// in the &quot;a&quot; tag within messages</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC makes the case for allowing linking to MXC content by using of an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag in the HTML-formatted <code>formatted_body</code> field of a <code>m.room.message</code>. As MXC urls could contain HTML files, it could be rather useful to link directly to them, as you would any other webpage. Your client would then translate this to an http/s URL which can be used to view/navigate to the file.</p>

<p>We've released Synapse 1.54! It includes quite a lot of nice improvements, including around URL previewing, and new callbacks for third-party modules. Check out the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/08/synapse-1-54-released">release announcement</a> for more info on all this goodness.</p>
<p>We've also landed more of the ground work to improve the time it takes for new servers to join big rooms, which Rich was talking about last week. Aside from this, we're continuing the effort towards switching Synapse to use <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>, which will enable reproducible builds for Synapse. These are some very exciting projects which will be maturing in the coming weeks, so watch this space!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The basics of the bridge are now ready! Backfilling, message sending, and message receiving are now implemented...albeit quite buggy and untested.</p>
<p>For anyone curious to try it out, installation follows the same general steps as <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/setup/index.html">tulir's Python-based mautrix bridges</a>, plus a backend Node module that must be launched before the Python component of the bridge. I'll write a README with proper setup instructions soon!</p>
<p>Just note that for the time being, <em>updates to the bridge may invalidate its database!!</em>. I won't guarantee stable DB upgrades until the bridge's early growing pains have settled down.</p>
<p>Reminder that my KakaoTalk ID is <code>fair-mw</code> if anyone wants to help me test things out üôÇ</p>

<p>Cinny is a Matrix client focused on simplicity, elegance and security</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kfiven:matrix.org">Lozenge</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Namaste</em>  üôè,</p>
<p>We are happy to announce that Cinny now support <strong>all the features of Spaces</strong> ‚Äî <em>a way to group rooms in Matrix</em>. This means that you can now create new spaces from client, add rooms or subspaces inside them or manage the added rooms.
We have also made our unique feature of <strong>Pinning spaces</strong> to sidebar more easy and organized. With this option all the spaces and subspaces will be visible at one place and you can select the one you want to pin or remove.
One more unique feature we added with update is the <strong>Categorized subspaces</strong>, what this do is make all the subspaces inside a space appear as categories. This is helpful when there are deep nested spaces inside a space and breadcrumb is pain to navigate back and fourth. Keep in mind that this ignore the nesting of subspaces and all of them will appear under mainspace, but nice thing is that you can select which subspace you want to categorized and which not.
Another exciting update related to spaces is the <em>Drag-and-Drop</em>. Earlier there was no option to reorder pinned spaces but now with DnD you can reorder them as you like.</p>
<p>Apart from spaces this update also include option to drag and drop files, ||sending spoiler||, desktop notification and viewing event source. (Thanks to @ginnyTheCat for these amazing additions.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gatho.party/">Gatho.party</a> is a replacement for Facebook Events for small social gatherings. I've used it for a number of parties and received great feedback, and I'm seeing others are starting to use it too üéâ</p>
<p>To receive confirmations of attendance you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the included Matrix bot to automatically sync RSVP emoji reactions in a linked Matrix room (great
for your friends on Matrix or in a bridged Signal chat)</li>
<li>Send a unique one-click RSVP links to you friends without Matrix (eg. Instagram DMs, SMS)</li>
<li>And as of this week, guests can &quot;self serve&quot; and add their own RSVP via the unique event link, so you can just drop the event link in a Facebook Messenger chat or iMessage group
(without email or phone verification at the moment, so hosts will need to moderate if
their guests go rogue and add multiple fake names!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other recent improvements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to delete guests</li>
<li>Improved call to action and copy text for when a guest with a &quot;magic&quot; link is prompted to RSVP</li>
<li>Confetti animations when your guests RSVP via the Gatho website as &quot;Going&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm currently testing an experimental chat embed using Matrix Live so your guests not on Matrix can optionally see your linked Matrix room - I've found some of my friends join Matrix after seeing this so they can join the action!</p>
<p>I'm keen to eventually use Cactus Comments once I figure out a bit of Elm and have more spare time so that non-Matrix guests can post too.</p>
<p>The Gatho website and bot is <a href="https://github.com/gatho-party/gatho-website">open source (AGPL-3.0) on Github</a>, PRs and Github issues are very welcome! It's built using Next.js in Typescript.</p>

looking forward feedback comments or anything,
cheers &amp; viva la matrix!</p>
<p>for now it only uses default matrix messages, and it is read only, so users have to login/register/CRUD through element (or any other client)
the idea would be to give back users control on their data, allow them to &quot;collect&quot; (individually or as group), any type of content, gathered into matrix room</p>
<p>For now, the client is making HTTP requests to matrix API, to fetch the data of a (public) room, all message &amp; state events.
it also give a &quot;clean URL&quot; <code>libli.org/room:server.tld</code> so users can access their &quot;profile&quot; (chat room) easily (just like a twitter, instagram, medium) page</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://t2bot.io">t2bot.io</a> - a public integrations network for Matrix - has passed 1 Million known rooms and 8.3 Million bridged users. 10,000 of these rooms are attributed to Voyager (a bot which actively goes out to find rooms to map Matrix, with the map currently down for maintenance), leaving the remaining ones either bridged, previously bridged, or using a different integration offered by t2bot.io for free.</p>
<p>The 8.3 Million users are mainly Discord and Telegram users which have been brought over to Matrix through bridges. The stats say &quot;excluding Twitter-bridged&quot; because there's 424,832 old accounts from back in the day when t2bot.io had a free Twitter bridge available. To further break this down, about 6.8M are Telegram users (12% of Telegram) and 1.3M are Discord (&lt;1% of Discord). </p>
<p>For perspective, t2bot.io has about 569 Million events stored in its database and sees approximately 30 thousand people bridged daily from the wider world into Matrix through its bridges. </p>
<p>This post is just a milestone update, but it also serves as a reminder that running your own server/bridges is also possible. In fact, it's even recommended to have better control over your own data and avoid latency issues that large providers, like t2bot.io, can unintentionally introduce. Synapse is relatively easy to set up with minimal sysadmin knowledge (<a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/setup/installation.html">guide</a>), and there's always paid offerings like <a href="https://element.io/matrix-services">Element Matrix Services</a> (<a href="https://element.io/element-home">for home</a> and also <a href="https://element.io/element-one">for fun</a>) and <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> for a richer bridging experience than t2bot.io can feasibly provide.</p>

<p>MSC3575 Sliding Sync work is progressing, and a number of new features have been added to the MSC with implementations in the built-in web client in the proxy. A list of changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>spec/proxy: the ability to filter the room list by room name.</li>
<li>spec/proxy: An<code>initial</code> flag on the room to distinguish between updates and the initial sync for a given room. This can be used as a hint to clients to determine if they should update/replace their local data for that room.</li>
<li>proxy: more efficient algorithm for determining overlapping sets of ranges, resulting in fewer bytes over the wire when scrolling.</li>
<li>proxy: the client implementation now supports sending basic text messages as well as issuing<code>/join</code>,<code>/invite</code>,<code>/leave</code> commands.</li>
<li>proxy: the client implementation now has a developer HUD which tracks the Tx/Rx bytes as well as a visual representation of the sliding window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/blog/img/ZCFijelEVxqrDDOrzyvZcpBG.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The net result is a basic but incredibly low bandwidth syncing client: 60.79KB to download an entire initial sync on matrix.org. Further improvements will be done on the client to make sure it doesn't scale with the number of rooms on the user's account (it currently does because it naively adds a placeholder for each room in the list) to ensure it remains extremely snappy and a vision for what Sliding Sync can do in practice, right now. Please continue giving feedback on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575">MSC3575</a> or in <code>#sliding-sync:matrix.org</code> as the API is still in development and will change depending on what clients require.</p>

<p>Heads up! You may have noticed some changes to the matrix-org/matrix-doc github repository this week. The first major one being that it no longer exists!</p>
<p>We have separated it out into two repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec">matrix-org/matrix-spec</a> - the source text of the spec. Issues and pull requests filed here should relate to the source of the spec.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals">matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals</a> - all Matrix Spec Change proposals. New MSCs should be filed against this repository as pull requests. Issues should not be filed against this repository (and no, the issue tracker cannot be disabled, as it would cause transferred issue link redirects to 404).</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary motivation for this was to separate concerns of interacting with matrix-org/matrix-doc. Those interacting with the spec's source would have to wade through long-lived spec proposals, while those only interested in spec proposals would need to filter out spec source files and other issues and PRs related to them. This also helps writing tooling against the repo either as it no longer needs to filter MSCs via issue labels.</p>
<p>Existing links to matrix-doc should be automatically redirected by github to the right place. MSC authors and developers should update their git remote settings to point to the new repos.</p>
<p>What happened in detail to achieve this was:</p>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3383">MSC3383: Include destination in X-Matrix Auth Header</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC asks for the simple change of adding a &quot;destination&quot; field to the <code>Authorization</code> header of federation requests. This would have the benefit of allowing reverse proxies - potentially handling traffic for multiple homeservers - to know where requests should be sent. Or for forward proxies, which could validate outgoing requests from a homeserver before they're sent.</p>
<p>There is currently some discussion on the fundamental idea of the MSCs, which will need to be resolved first before it can move forwards.</p>

<p>Quite a varied bag this week! Firstly we cut a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.54.0rc1">release candidate</a> for Synapse 1.54.0, which we hope to release next week. As ever, testing and feedback is much appreciated.</p>
<p>Our switch to <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> for dependency management has come a few steps closer, by removing <a href="https://tox.wiki">tox</a> from our Continuous Integration, and converting some of our ad-hoc scripts to proper Python <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/">entry points</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we've been continuing to knock out blockers to improving room join speeds, including better exception handling and logging, and some exciting work to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3528">reduce wasted work</a> when a client disconnects while we're still processing a request.</p>
<p>We've also been taking a wider look at performance problems, such as slow <code>/sync</code> and <code>/login</code> times.</p>

<h3 id="dendrite-website">Dendrite (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">Kegan</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been asked by numerous people over months if there are any kind of graphs comparing Synapse and Dendrite. Up until now, my answer has been &quot;as far as I know, no&quot;. However, this got me thinking whether I can use <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a> to engineer some kind of performance testing infrastructure. After hacking on it for a day or two, I can now share some of the work I've done in this area. There now exists two new binaries in the Complement repo: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/tree/main/cmd/perftest">perftest</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/tree/main/cmd/perfgraph">perfgraph</a>. The former will run some tests and output a <code>.json</code> file. The latter will consume these files to generate <code>.svg</code> graphs. The tests performed include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a bunch of rooms with different users. (currently 10 users and 50 rooms)</li>
<li>Joining a bunch of rooms with different users.</li>
<li>Sending messages into rooms with different users. (currently 100 messages)</li>
<li>Doing an initial sync for all users.</li>
<li>Updating the display name of all users.</li>
<li>Doing an incremental sync for all users.</li>
</ul>
<p>The metrics are collected using <code>docker stats</code>. This means the <em>entire container</em> is measured, not just the homeserver binary (e.g any daemons or assistive processes are included in the metrics) and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU time consumed</li>
<li>Memory consumed</li>
<li>Bytes transmitted/received</li>
<li>Disk read/writes</li>
<li>Time taken</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some results:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/XqFhgSQyQMNuElZctQWoqdmx.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This was a surprising find and probably indicates that Dendrite has a memory leak somewhere when creating events. However, the fun doesn't stop there. We can also use this tool to compare different versions of the same homeserver:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/KcWIYkkVAcoHDSmWFmdEdvVF.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This allows us to quantify any performance improvements we've been working on, and you can clearly see how we're being more efficient with CPU in newer versions. But the fun doesn't stop there either. We can also compare different flavours of the same version of a homeserver:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/WwUSbKWYkIUPEOELmeJiPlYO.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>You can quantify the cost of running sqlite or postgres for your particular installation. </p>
<p>Care must be taken when interpreting results. Lower doesn't always mean better. For example, a low readout on &quot;create_users&quot; may be a cause for concern as it might indicate that the server is not hashing passwords correctly (e.g using bcrypt/scrypt which are designed to consume CPU/memory). Servers which don't implement all of the specification will also be abnormally low on CPU/memory (e.g not having to calculate unread counts or handle push notifications naturally means less work to do so less resources consumed). Furthermore, these tests do not yet test federation, so expensive remote joins are not measured (remote joins require the joining server to check signatures, hashes, etc of a lot of events which doesn't happen for local servers). That being said, I have hopefully illustrated how useful this tool can be for both server developers trying to improve their software and server admins who want to use the right server for their hardware. The graphs are still a work-in-progress and there's a lot more that can be done in this area beyond a few days work, but it's a start.</p>

<p>Today we've released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6.5">Dendrite 0.6.5</a> which contains early push notification support as well as a number of fixes and improvements. This release includes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early support for push notifications has been added, with support for push rules, pushers, HTTP push gateways and the <code>/notifications</code> endpoint (contributions by <a href="https://github.com/danpe">danpe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PiotrKozimor">PiotrKozimor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tommie">tommie</a>)</li>
<li>Spaces Summary (MSC2946) is now correctly supported (when <code>msc2946</code> is enabled in the config)</li>
<li>All media API endpoints are now available under the <code>/v3</code> namespace</li>
<li>Profile updates (display name and avatar) are now sent asynchronously so they shouldn't block the client for a very long time</li>
<li>State resolution v2 has been optimised further to considerably reduce the number of memory allocations</li>
<li>State resolution v2 will no longer duplicate events unnecessarily when calculating the auth difference</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool now has a <code>-reset-password</code> option for resetting the passwords of existing accounts</li>
<li>The <code>/sync</code> endpoint now calculates device list changes much more quickly with less RAM used</li>
<li>The <code>/messages</code> endpoint now lazy-loads members correctly</li>
<li>Read receipts now work correctly by correcting bugs in the stream positions and receipt coalescing</li>
<li>Topological sorting of state and join responses has been corrected, which should help to reduce the number of auth problems when joining new federated rooms</li>
<li>Media thumbnails should now work properly after having unnecessarily strict rate limiting removed</li>
<li>The roomserver no longer holds transactions for as long when processing input events</li>
<li>Uploading device keys and cross-signing keys will now correctly no-op if there were no changes</li>
<li>Parameters are now remembered correctly during registration</li>
<li>Devices can now only be deleted within the appropriate UIA flow</li>
<li>The <code>/context</code> endpoint now returns 404 instead of 500 if the event was not found</li>
<li>SQLite mode will no longer leak memory as a result of not closing prepared statements</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance, as measured by Sytest, currently sits at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 76%, up from 65% last time</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 95%, up from 94% last time</li>

<p>The highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support splitting users from different homeservers into different IPv6 blocks. We used this at FOSDEM to split attendeeds into a different ILINE.</li>
<li>Added a new metric <code>clientpool_by_homeserver</code> which lists the states of IRC clients, by the top 25 homeservers. Useful to know who is using your bridge.</li>
<li>Add support for subscribing to moderation policies. This allows a bridge admin to subscribe to Matrix &quot;ban lists&quot; and filter who can use their bridge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This release also now requires Node 14.x</strong> as Node 12.x will be out of support very soon.</p>

</li>
<li>Stable support for lots of previously-unstable functionality that got stabilized upstream as part of the Matrix specification releases v1.1 and v1.2 [<a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a>]</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/issues/842">Support for versioned endpoints</a> in the client-server API [<a href="https://github.com/ShadowJonathan">@ShadowJonathan</a>]</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/906">Rehaul of our module structure</a> to match the client-server API's new versioned endpoints (before: <code>r0::foo::get_bar</code>, after: <code>foo::get_bar::v3</code>) [<a href="https://github.com/ShadowJonathan">@ShadowJonathan</a>]</li>
<li>More fine-grained feature flags for MSC implementations (before: everything behind <code>unstable-pre-spec</code>, after: most things behind dedicated <code>unstable-mscXXXX</code> features) [<a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a>]</li>

<p>Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a> recently started implementing extensible events <em>and</em> doing some pretty heavy internal refactoring that will make our release process faster and hopefully make contributing to Ruma easier as well.</p>
<p>With all these changes we're very close to supporting all of Matrix v1.1 (and Matrix v1.2 too!), with the only major omission being Secure Secret Storage and Sharing (SSSS). Some work on that was done as far back as last year's GSoC but it was blocked on a medium-sized refactoring of how we handle account data.

<blockquote>
<p>I'm working on a little hobby project, The Matrix Scribe.</p>
<p><a href="https://lab.trax.im/julianfoad/matrix-scribe">The Matrix Scribe</a> helps us re-post or transcribe messages into <a href="https://matrix.org/">matrix</a> that we received from somewhere else, posing as different ghost users to represent the original authors.</p>
<p>Scribe will post this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Ann</code> I'm Ann.</p>
<p><code>Bob</code> Hello! I'm Bob.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when I write this to <code>@scribe-bot</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>@julian</code> /scribe as Ann</p>
<p><code>@julian</code> I'm Ann.</p>
<p><code>@julian</code> /scribe as Bob</p>
<p><code>@julian</code> Hello! I'm Bob.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is an illustration of the goal. The output part works already; the bot part isn't implemented yet.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to encourage people to experiment and play with extending Matrix in creative ways.</li>
<li>As a building block for myself towards building more usual matrix bridges. Scribe is the input half of the matrix half of a bridge, so literally one quarter of a typical matrix bridge.</li>
<li>I hope that I myself and maybe some other people will find Scribe fun or useful in itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find this interesting...</p>
<ul>
<li>Come and say hello in the matrix room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-scribe:foad.me">#matrix-scribe:foad.me</a>.uk</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Scribe is not intended to mislead users. It should be deployed in such a way that its use is clear, and require appropriate permissions.</em></p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3589">MSC3589: Room version 9 as the default room version</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3582">MSC3582: Remove m.room.message.feedback</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs are in FCP.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3744">MSC3744: Support for flexible authentication</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3743">MSC3743: Standardized error response for unknown endpoints</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3741">MSC3741: Revealing the useful login flows to clients after a soft logout</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3735">MSC3735: Add device information to m.room_key.withheld message</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> continues to be the focus on much review as the proposal inches towards entering final comment period.</p>
<p>Otherwise both <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3589">MSC3589</a> (room version 9 as the default room version) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3582">MSC3582</a> (remove m.room.message.feedback) merged this week. The former brings with it updated versions for rooms as they continue to be created across the federation, whereas the latter is simply a nice clean up to the existing spec :)</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3593">MSC3593: Safety Controls through a generic Administration API</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC aims to introduce a set of generic administrative APIs for Matrix homeservers, starting with those that could potentially be useful for user moderation.</p>
<p>There has long been talk of adding administration APIs akin to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">Synapse's Admin API</a> to the spec, in part to reduce the number of tools that are specifically created for it, and thus can only be used with Synapse.</p>
<p>Feedback welcome!</p>

<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">neilalexander</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6.4">Dendrite v0.6.4</a> which contains a significant number of improvements and fixes. It includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Client-Server API endpoints are now available under the <code>/v3</code> namespace</li>
<li>The <code>/whoami</code> response format now matches the latest Matrix spec version</li>
<li>Support added for the <code>/context</code> endpoint, which should help clients to render quote-replies correctly</li>
<li>Accounts now have an optional account type field, allowing admin accounts to be created</li>
<li>Server notices are now supported</li>
<li>Refactored the user API storage to deduplicate a significant amount of code, as well as merging both user API databases into a single database</li>
<li>Guest registration can now be separately disabled with the new <code>client_api.guests_disabled</code> configuration option</li>
<li>Outbound connections now obey proxy settings from the environment, deprecating the <code>federation_api.proxy_outbound</code> configuration options</li>
<li>The roomserver input API will now strictly consume only one database transaction per room, which should prevent situations where the roomserver can deadlock waiting for database connections to become available</li>
<li>Room joins will now fall back to federation if the local room state is insufficient to create a membership event</li>
<li>Create events are now correctly filtered from federation <code>/send</code> transactions</li>
<li>Excessive logging when federation is disabled should now be fixed</li>
<li>Dendrite will no longer panic if trying to retire an invite event that has not been seen yet</li>
<li>The device list updater will now wait for longer after a connection issue, rather than flooding the logs with errors</li>
<li>The device list updater will no longer produce unnecessary output events for federated key updates with no changes, which should help to reduce CPU usage</li>
<li>Local device name changes will now generate key change events correctly</li>
<li>The sync API will now try to share device list update notifications even if all state key NIDs cannot be fetched</li>
<li>An off-by-one error in the sync stream token handling which could result in a crash has been fixed</li>
<li>State events will no longer be re-sent unnecessary by the roomserver to other components if they have already been sent, which should help to reduce the NATS message sizes on the roomserver output topic in some cases</li>
<li>The roomserver input API now uses the process context and should handle graceful shutdowns better</li>
<li>Guest registration is now correctly disabled when the <code>client_api.registration_disabled</code> configuration option is set</li>
<li>One-time encryption keys are now cleaned up correctly when a device is logged out or removed</li>
<li>Invalid state snapshots in the state storage refactoring migration are now reset rather than causing a panic at startup</li>
</ul>
<p>Sytest compliance is up slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 67%, up from 65%</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 95%, same as before</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, please feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for Dendrite-related chat!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here are the first steps for a bridge to <a href="https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/service/service/KakaoTalk?lang=en">KakaoTalk</a>! The bridge is based on <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/python">mautrix-python</a> (having used <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> as a starting point--there's still plenty of Facebook-specific code in there), with the backend handled by <a href="https://github.com/storycraft/node-kakao">node-kakao</a> (connected via RPC, as there seems to be no Python API for KakaoTalk!).</p>
<p>The bridge doesn't do much yet; all it can do is log in &amp; sync your list of chats (if that). But it's under rapid development &amp; decent momentum, so hopefully it will be usable soon!</p>
<p>For anyone brave enough to try it out, its setup steps are very similar to that of any of the <a href="https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/setup/index.html">Python-based mautrix bridges</a> (though Docker is currently unsupported).</p>

<p>Apart from that Nheko now has support for hidden read receipts (thanks to symphorien, see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2285">MSC2285</a>). ZenWalker updated our usage of deprecated gstreamer APIs. Malte has been spending a lot of effort on improving the scrolling experience on the PinePhone as well as allowing to search on mobile. Forwarding should now work properly again as well as calling on mobile and we fixed a small memory leak when opening some dialogs.</p>

<p><strong>Coming to a Poll near you‚Ä¶</strong></p>

<li>From next week‚Äôs releases, you‚Äôll discover two new updates on polls! First off, you‚Äôll be able to edit a poll as long as no one has yet voted on it - which is great if you create a poll and realise you‚Äôve made a small mistake. Even better, there‚Äôs now a new type of poll: ‚Äòclosed polls‚Äô don‚Äôt show any results until the poll has ended, to keep the surprise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Location Sharing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Location Sharing is now available by default for users on all platforms, except desktop (where you can receive but not send locations). Check it out!</li>
<li>The next stage is live location sharing and ‚Äòpin dropping‚Äô, expect more soon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threaded Messaging</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to make catching up on rooms easier, and to keep the main timeline as clutter free as possible, Threads are nearly here.</li>
<li>You can try Threads out on all platforms - you‚Äôll find them in Labs. This feature is experimental; let us know your feedback, and report any bugs as we continue to improve.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community testing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will be looking at search result ordering on Web as part of the new search experience at 17:30 UTC / 18:30 CET on Tuesday, 1st of March</li>
<li>We‚Äôre also hoping to test Threads on mobile devices towards the end of the week, join the testing room to get involved!</li>

<p>Over at <a href="https://github.com/opentower/populus-viewer">Populus-Viewer</a>, we're continuing to refine the UX, for maximum focus, efficiency and enjoyment. Since last time we've:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reworked the mobile view controls into a sidebar design.</li>
<li>Improved the generation of highlight rectangles.</li>
<li>Made sure that LaTeX and code listings are always displayed nicely</li>
<li>Made it possible to modify text selections within a PDF using the keyboard</li>
<li>Added &quot;one-click&quot; links for onboarding new users into a particular server, SSO flow and PDF collection.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've also had some bug fixes related to federation, and had some of our first ever (maybe the first on matrix - first in the history of the universe?) federated social annotation sessions.</p>
<h2 id="populus-philarchive">Populus-Philarchive</h2>
<p><a href="https://opentower.github.io/populus-philarchive/">Populus-Philarchive</a>, our proof-of-concept discussion overlay for preprint archives, now incorporates an OAI-PMH harvester, so it can aggregate OAI bibliographic metadata, and use that data for room creation and discovery. The implementation is pretty general, so it should be easy to tweak for any archive that supports OAI-PMH.</p>
<h2 id="msc3574">MSC3574</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3574">MSC3574 - marking up resources</a> got some love this week, as we added a proposal for serializing annotations on matrix that ought to be compatible with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">w3c web annotation data model</a>. This paves the way for interoperability between the matrix annotation ecosystem and services like hypothes.is, and hopefully will make matrix a compelling option even for institutions where compliance with existing web standards is a must.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Circles beta on iOS continues inching toward a public release later this Spring.</p>
<ul>
<li>This week I added support for infinite scrolling on timelines.  (Previously, scrolling the timelines was very clunky -- the user had to manually tap a button to &quot;Load More&quot; every 10-15 posts.)</li>
<li>Also added a confirmation dialog when the user attempts to leave a group.</li>
</ul>
<p>On Android, the prototype is coming along nicely, thanks to the efforts of our new developer Taras:</p>
<ul>
<li>The login screen works</li>
<li>Currently working on implementing the timeline of social posts for groups</li>

<p>A widget for moderating with mjolnir. Highly WIP. Use at your own risk!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev">MTRNord (they/them)</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the last 2 weeks, I increasingly had to learn how to moderate rooms properly, which brought up a lack of nice Mj√∂lnir gui for me.
Due to that, I just started to write one.
It is at the time of writing still fairly young.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-features-are">The current features are:</h2>
<ul>
<li>An overview of the ban list data the user is in (Not for the specific Mj√∂lnir currently. Also requires a user to have joined the list room)</li>
<li>A quick form to ban a person</li>
<li>A form to redact someone or a message</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="planned-features-are">Planned features are:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support for showing MSC1929 information if available</li>
<li>Writing a patch for Mj√∂lnir, so the widget can know which banlist the bot watches, so only relevant lists show up.</li>
<li>Editing the banlist (aka unbanning)</li>
<li>Adding support for more advanced features like deactivation of users and removal of media on the matrix-media-repo.</li>
<li>Covering most of Mj√∂lnir's commands</li>
<li>Redact on ban and similar utilities you might want while banning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="small-getting-started-it-is-simple-d">Small getting started (it is simple :D)</h2>
<p>To use it, you simply can add it to your Mj√∂lnir Admin room by putting <code>/addwidget https://moderation_widget.nordgedanken.dev?room_id=$matrix_room_id</code> (the variable will get replaced automatically) in the message bar and pressing enter. The widget runs entirely client side, so this is not sending any events to my server. If you still are concerned due to the big amount of permissions asked, you can just build it yourself and host it.</p>

<p>You know what would be embarrassing? If changing the version number of something broke Nheko... Well, completely unrelated, mtxclient 0.6.2 is out now which fixes an issue where it would aggressively validate that version numbers started with an 'r'. Otherwise that release is API and ABI compatible, so if packagers could pick that up as a bugfix release into stable releases, that would be great!</p>

<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we've been looking at unblocking <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440: Threads</a> so it can make a smooth journey into acceptance. This involves quite a lot of work to ensure that the features we're concerned about are addressed, but so far the FCP progress on it is looking good.</p>
<p>We're also spending a bunch of time working out what room version 10 looks like to try and fix some usability issues with join rules and general maintenance of things like power levels. The hope is that in time for Matrix 1.3 we'll have v10 out (but not made default) for folks to experiment with.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>Your random MSC is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2974">MSC2974: Widgets: Capabilities re-exchange</a>. I swear it was actually random and only after running the script exactly once. The MSC is interesting because it allows widgets (a feature working its way into the general spec, slowly) to ask for more permissions when they need them. This ensures the widget doesn't need to ask for everything at startup (which is more likely to mean that it gets rejected), and that it can maintain a clean security state during normal operation.</p>
<p>One day it'll probably make it into the spec as part of the larger widget movement, but first we need to get widgets into the spec properly.</p>
<h2 id="the-graph">The Graph</h2>
<p>Numbers only mean so much, and graphs show progress. Here's the breakdown of MSCs over time:</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is using Nheko a bit of a pain on your PinePhone? Do you just want bubbles in your chat app, not raw lines of text? Does Nheko waste too much space on timestamps and other metadata for messages?</p>
<p>Well, I am assuming Malte was annoyed by that or similar reasons. But in the end, they did spend a lot of effort reorganizing the way Nheko layouts messages so that people can have bubbles. This should make Nheko feel much more at home on the PinePhone and it seems like they are doing even more to make Nheko a great experience on mobile devices! But just look at it yourself:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/clBmUlpDyQUmvIfIKSRCJsIb.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you are scared now and you think: &quot;This is not the Nheko I came to love!&quot;, don't worry, all of this is optional. You can play around with the different avatar sizes as well as the bubbles themselves. You can even make Nheko look like it always looked!</p>
<p>There will be some regressions though. If you want to contribute, it would help a lot if you test those changes and report issues that you find! &lt;3</p>
<p>Apart from that, there were also a lot of other bugfixes and cleanups by various contributors. You can also hide events by type now. If you don't want to see stickers or when someone joins a room, just disable that in the room settings! Tastytea implemented that. Long usernames should now also no longer overflow the profile pages and you can reset the state for a single room using the /reset-state /command. This is helpful when updating Nheko to use widgets, but Nheko just threw those events away (or pinned messages or other state events).</p>
<p>That's all, have a wonderful bubbly day!</p>

<p>I wrote a small web app thing that can download, decrypt and display Matrix media in a browser. The goal is to use it in the Android SMS bridge for sending attachments that are too big for MMS, but it might be useful for other things too.</p>
<p>Currently it consists of the web frontend, a maubot plugin to generate links, and a small server that stores file metadata (so the URLs just contain the decryption key and a short ID to find the metadata on the server). I'll probably continue working on the exact URL format to make it shorter and to encrypt the metadata, and maybe also add an alternative mode where all info is included in the URL to make the server component optional.</p>
<p>You can try it out by sending files in an encrypted room with @media:maunium.net. It'll reply with a link like <a href="https://media.mau.chat/AGIPyjtJQAU#KHBwuZFrv1ffCd4ZUylo8MV03P9N4sz2T75zLi1Urcw">https://media.mau.chat/AGIPyjtJQAU#KHBwuZFrv1ffCd4ZUylo8MV03P9N4sz2T75zLi1Urcw</a></p>

<li>Re-structure login form to more clearly separate matrix.to links from direct login.</li>
<li>Require user id (e.g. <code>@alice:example.com</code>) instead of username. Only show homeserver url field if .well-known lookup fails.</li>
<li>Add top-right &quot;X&quot; button to close login modal.</li>
<li>Login modal now closes when you press outside it.</li>
<li>Fix some CSS bugs related to positioning the login form in viewport center.</li>
<li>Make <code>LoginForm</code> a stateful component.</li>

<p>After a few years, <a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-room-directory-server">matrix-room-directory-server</a> has finally gotten an upgrade to modern times. Intended to eventually be a standalone directory server (making vanity aliases possible, but otherwise not functional as a homeserver), it currently only supports overriding the federation <code>/publicRooms</code> endpoint. </p>
<p>The changes made today are to replace the old, broken, appservice-backed approach with a space-backed approach. You can see this in action on t2bot.io: querying the room directory over federation will hit the room directory server, which is watching <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#directory:t2bot.io">#directory:t2bot.io</a> in the background to determine which rooms to serve.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> (threading) continues to move forward with a proposed final comment period this week. As a really useful feature in Matrix, it's great to see it getting closer to landing in the spec.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3613">MSC3613</a> (combinatorial join rules) had a proposed final comment period. The intention of this is to be a simple mechanism for resolving the &quot;it's not possible to have both a restricted and knock room&quot; situation - as both introduced mutually exclusive join rules. This MSC will likely serve as the basis of a new room version whenever it lands.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3144">MSC3144: Allow Widgets By Default in Private Rooms</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC makes the case for allowing widgets to be created in private rooms by default. The actual spec for it is blocked behind having widgets in the spec (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2764">this tracking PR</a> if you're interested).</p>
<p>As noted in the PR though, this MSC could build on the existing <code>im.vector.modular.widgets</code> unstable prefix for widgets in order to create an implementation for this feature. It does not appear to have happened yet though.</p>

We've also fixed / improved media previews for sites <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11767">like Reddit</a>. Plus lots more fixes / refactors / improvements under the hood.</p>
<p>This is a smaller release as it's coming off of our FOSDEM sprint, but we look forward to getting back to more regularly-sized and featureful Synapses this month.</p>
<p>Notably, we've been experimenting with <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> to better manage Python dependencies in our applications (Synapse, Sygnal, and Sydent). We just <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/488">switched Sydent over</a> this week and are working out the kinks in our CI and build pipelines. We're looking forward to bringing this consistency to Synapse next month!</p>
<p>See you next week!</p>

<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">neilalexander</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6.3">Dendrite 0.6.3</a> which is a primarily bug fix release. It contains the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial support for <code>m.login.token</code></li>
<li>A number of regressions from earlier v0.6.x versions should now be corrected</li>
<li>Missing state is now correctly retrieved in cases where a gap in the timeline was closed but some of those events were missing state snapshots, which should help to unstick slow or broken rooms</li>
<li>Fixed a transaction issue where inserting events into the database could deadlock, which should stop rooms from getting stuck</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where rejected events could result in rolled back database transactions</li>
<li>Avoided a potential race condition on fetching latest events by using the room updater instead</li>
<li>Processing events from <code>/get_missing_events</code> will no longer result in potential recursion</li>
<li>Federation events are now correctly generated for updated self-signing keys and signed devices</li>
<li>Rejected events can now be un-rejected if they are reprocessed and all of the correct conditions are met</li>
<li>Fetching missing auth events will no longer error as long as all needed events for auth were satisfied</li>
<li>Users can now correctly forget rooms if they were not a member of the room</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to everyone who tested the maximised widgets feature which was recently added to Element Web. It received a sudden burst of attention as part of the FOSDEM conference. üòÑ This week we've been fine tuning the feature to ensure it works for more workflows, and we've also cleaned up various associated widget bugs. In particular, in the develop version of Element Web, the pin and maximise actions are more consistent accessible, so you can toggle between pinned and maximised if e.g. you're in a conference room and temporarily want the stream widget to be larger while still having access to the chat timeline.</p>
<p>Next week we'll be focusing more on our Matrix-native collaborative document plans.</p>

<p>The new version contains two new features around the Synapse Admin API, making someone a room admin and listing all unencrypted media URLs.</p>
<p>I've had some good ideas on how to make Matrix Wrench cover more use cases while staying simple for both users and me as a developer. New components allow me to add new API endpoints in as little as 7 lines. So far this only applies to simple endpoints without parameters, like joining and leaving a room, but it can be expanded to more endpoints because of how similar all Matrix endpoints are. Props to the Spec! üôå</p>

<p>You can also create one-click RSVP links to send to your friends - no matter which chat/social app they use!</p>
<p>It's fully GDPR compliant and multi-region with an EU server and database, and uses NextAuth.js for passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>The Gatho website and bot is open source (AGPL-3.0) on <a href="https://github.com/gatho-party/gatho-website">Github</a>, PRs and Github issues are very welcome! It's built using Next.js in Typescript.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today we've released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6.1">Dendrite 0.6.1</a> which contains a number of fixes and improvements. This release includes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roomserver inputs now take place with full transactional isolation in PostgreSQL deployments</li>
<li>Pull consumers are now used instead of push consumers when retrieving messages from NATS to better guarantee ordering and to reduce redelivery of duplicate messages</li>
<li>Further logging tweaks, particularly when joining rooms</li>
<li>Improved calculation of servers in the room, when checking for missing auth/prev events or state</li>
<li>Dendrite will now skip dead servers more quickly when federating by reducing the TCP dial timeout</li>
<li>The key change consumers have now been converted to use native NATS code rather than a wrapper</li>
<li>Go 1.16 is now the minimum supported version for Dendrite</li>
<li>Local clients should now be notified correctly of invites</li>
<li>The roomserver input API now has more time to process events, particularly when fetching missing events or state, which should fix a number of errors from expired contexts</li>
<li>Fixed a panic that could happen due to a closed channel in the roomserver input API</li>
<li>Logging in with uppercase usernames from old installations is now supported again (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/hoernschen">hoernschen</a>)</li>
<li>Federated room joins now have more time to complete and should not fail due to expired contexts</li>
<li>Events that were sent to the roomserver along with a complete state snapshot are now persisted with the correct state, even if they were rejected or soft-failed</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance, as measured by Sytest, currently sits at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 65%</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 94%</li>

<p>It's FOSDEM! Don't forget to checkout my 5 min ramble about custom stickers and emotes in Matrx: https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/matrix_custom_stickers/</p>
<p>In preparation for FOSDEM, I've also been working on some goodies so that you can participate using Nheko in a limited manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previews for rooms are now fetched for spaces using the hierarchy API</li>
<li>Widgets for the talks should be shown below the topic as links</li>
</ul>
<p>While this isn't grand, it should be good enough for some to participate using Nheko. You will need the latest master (some commits aren't even pushed at the time of writing!), but if you are just watching, this should give you an easy way to fetch the talk link for each room. You will still have to watch the actual talk in your browser though.</p>
<p>LorenDB also added a big, fat, red offline indicator. If your server dies because of FOSDEM, now Nheko will tell you.</p>
<p>I hope you all will have a great time and I hope I see you around!</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="viewer-updates">Viewer Updates</h3>
<p>Here's a big populus viewer update! Since last time, I've been mostly working on improving the user experience and onboarding for non-experts, as well as making my teaching-assistant bot a little smarter - this work is ongoing. But I have had time for a few new features üòÅ</p>
<ul>
<li>Populus now implements <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3592">MSC3592 - Markup locations for PDF documents</a>, a proposal building on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3574">MSC3574 - Marking up resources</a>, so there's a documented format for interoperable PDF annotations (though this is not the final draft, see below!)</li>
<li>I've reworked the sidebar for the PDF view, improving the aesthetics and allowing for a &quot;fullscreen&quot; view of PDF content.</li>
<li>I've added user-directory search and improved the usability of the invite modal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason that MSC3574 is not a final draft is that I'm increasingly looking at the w3c's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">web annotation data model</a> as a compelling foundation for annotations on Matrix. Stay tuned for a upcoming MSC, or come over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opentower:matrix.org">#opentower:matrix.org</a> to talk about the future of annotation on Matrix!</p>
<h3 id="populus-philarchive">Populus-Philarchive</h3>
<p>I've also been working on a proof-of-concept for one Matrix use-case that I'm hoping Populus can help fill. Social annotation can be a good tool for getting feedback on works in progress, or for discussing new research with your team or lab. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just pop open a paper on a preprint archive and start commenting, or say &quot;hey friends, I'm reading this paper, what do you think?&quot; And wouldn't it be nicer if you could do that and host the discussion on your university or team's Matrix server?</p>
<p>Here's a first pass at that idea: https://opentower.github.io/populus-philarchive/</p>
<p>At the moment works by just pasting in paper codes from <a href="https://philarchive.org/">philarchive.org</a> - it'll preview bibliographic information and give you a list of discussions taking place around a given paper, with the option to create a  new one. Sessions are shared with populus-viewer, and pdfs continue to be hosted by the original archive. There are a number of clear upgrade paths, by integrating with a preprint archive that has an open search API, or even by adding an OAI-PMH metadata harvester to the backend, to combine the metadata from a bunch of open paper archives. I'm really excited to see where this work goes.</p>

<p>A KRunner plugin to list joined rooms and possibly other things from nheko.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lorendb:matrix.org">LorenDB</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been working on a little project over the last week: <a href="https://github.com/LorenDB/nheko-krunner">nheko-krunner</a>. nheko-krunner is a <a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner">KRunner</a> plugin that loads rooms from nheko, displays them to the user, and allows the user to activate said rooms. How does it do this? Well, I've also been creating a D-Bus API for nheko! This code has not been merged yet, but once it is, you will be able to create your own plugins that access nheko via D-Bus!</p>
<p>The current functionality of nheko-krunner is simply (1) search and switch to rooms that you are in (not unlike the Ctrl-K switcher), and (2) join rooms from their aliases.</p>
<p>If you want to try out nheko-krunner, you will need to build from the <code>dbus</code> branch in my personal fork of nheko and then install nheko-krunner from the above repo.</p>
<p>I hope that somebody finds this useful and I am excited to see what other D-Bus plugins may show up in the future!</p>

<p>Ideally, I want to focus as much on the Matrix Spec as possible, but for the v0.5.0 I might venture into the territory of the Synapse Admin API, e.g. for listing and deleting media in a room. Please contact me, if you have use cases around media moderation you'd like me to consider.</p>

<p>No new release this week. I've been working on the video sending functionality, and I am looking forward to seeing what that enables ya'll to do!
In the meantime, I've published a template / demo bot you can find here: https://github.com/WesR/Halcyon-stock-bot . In just <strong>37</strong> lines of (unminified) code, this little bot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sets a status message</li>
<li>Automatically joins rooms via invite</li>
<li>Searches messages for $stocks mentioned, then formats and replies the current price and daily percent change for all the tickers in the message
Screenshot below</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm always looking for more feedback, and love to see what people are working on. Come hangout in the Halcyon room: https://matrix.to/#/#halcyon:blackline.xyz

<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2291">MSC2291: Configuration to Control Crawling</a>!</p>
<p>A concept similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard">robots.txt for the web</a>, but for Matrix! Currently the way to inform room-crawling bots in Matrix today is by banning/kicking them from the room. However, this doesn't allow you to blanket prevent bots from joining - nor does it only inform bots that they should access <em>some</em> of the room's data. It's a binary switch.</p>
<p>Consider if you wanted your room to be crawled, but the room topic to not be indexed. This MSC could help with that! Give it a read/review if you're interested.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever pinged someone by accident, because you replied to a message with their name in it or maybe even a whole room mention? Or are you avoiding replies for that reason? Did the quote of a messages suddenly vanish when someone edited their message in a client? Or are you just in general unhappy with replies only showing what type of message was replied to, instead of showing the actual image being replied to (on mobile for example)? Were you annoyed, that you could only reply with a text message, but not an emote message, an image, a sticker or even a video?</p>
<p>I spent a bunch of time trying to remove the blocker for that in the Matrix specification, you can find the proposal here: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2781</p>
<p>As it turns out, it is not quite as simple, because notifications for replies to your messages rely on a bunch of implicit interactions, which is why I also wrote another MSC to fix that: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3664</p>
<p>I'm a bit unhappy with replies across the matrix ecosystem at the moment and I hope this is a small step towards improving things. It's certainly not as exciting as spaces, voip, threads or stickers, but it is something which affects me every day and I think those small papercuts need some attention too.</p>
<p>I hope some of you share my love for the less exciting stuff!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jboi:jboi.nl">Jonathan</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To add onto Nico's efforts, I think that mentions today are based on too many &quot;false-positives&quot; (ping on displayname or username mention), and i kinda wish for the &quot;just mention them&quot; UX of discord, telegram, whatsapp, and so many other messengers.</p>
<p>So I've also made a proposal that tries to bring some explicitness in that, a new push rule that'll fire on &quot;mention&quot;; https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3517</p>
<p>It'll look for any <code>@</code>-MXID mention in the plaintext, or look for an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>-mention &quot;pill&quot; in the HTML. It is a hack, but it is the most correct way of determining if you've been pinged in matrix, at the moment.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> announces</p>

<p>In terms of reply fallbacks - the Spec Core Team gave an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2781#issuecomment-1016853716">overwhelming thumbs up</a> to removing reply fallbacks via MSC2781... but given practically this causes a cascade of other work (defining and implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3664">push_rules for replies</a>, and defining and implementing push_rules for threads (MSC TBD)) and so as a temporary transitional measure we've instead made reply fallbacks best effort (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc3676/proposals/3676-transitioning-away-from-reply-fallbacks.md">MSC3676</a>).  This means that clients can now reply using non-textual events, and we can use replies as a fallback for threads for non-thread-capable-clients/ASes once <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> lands.  To be clear, the intention is still to incorporate all of Nico's excellent contributions on MSC2781 and MSC3664 however.</p>

<li>The roomserver now being responsible for fetching missing events and state instead of the federation API, which fixes some race conditions</li>
<li>Strict ordering and asynchronous input support in the roomserver input API, which smooths out incoming federation significantly</li>
<li>Consolidated federation API, including functionality from the now-deprecated federation sender and signing key server components</li>
<li>Database-backed device list synchronisation, which is now more reliable</li>
<li>Correct gap checking when fetching missing events and state</li>
<li>Better behaviour and lower resource usage by the <code>/event_auth</code> endpoint</li>
</ul>

<p>Hey folks, no releases this week but a general update on a little project of ours. I've been working through the problem of making bridges easier to use and supplimenting our command interfaces with pretty buttons and forms.

<blockquote>
<p>Next to spec work, progress on porting Nheko to 100% qml continues. This week I ported the login and registration pages. I also did some minor cleanups on them and prep work for future improvements (like buttons for each SSO provider or providing email address and registration token inline instead of in a separate popup, if the server requires it). Logging in or registering is often the first thing a user does on a client or maybe even the first thing they do on Matrix! As such I should really spend more effort optimizing that feature, that usually falls off the priority list because I don't use it often!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/qjaQfwuJRnkZxDdIpXYOqVhF.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Once Nheko is 100% Qml we should also see lower memory usage again, here is a screenshot from a Nheko instance with over 100 rooms, that's been running for a few days of active use on Windows:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/SWwRTvWLLmJeJrFDjvomjdXj.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where Nheko could crash the notification service, because it sent images not following the Freedesktop notification specification and tasty spent some time further improving the man page.</p>

<p>Hello folks, it's been a while since we last spoke! We have been focused on the code, but we're long overdue for an update. A lot has happened since November. Fractal-Next is getting closer to feature parity with current Fractal, and even supports new things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Timeline</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fractal-Next now allows you to open and save sent files</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>You can also get a better view of media send to the room thanks to the built-in media viewer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It (finally!) supports reactions (displaying them and sending new ones)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>User verification</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fractal-Next now supports verification of other users by scanning their QR code, or via emoji</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a user is verified, an icon is displayed next to their username in the list of room members</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room details</p>
<ul>
<li>The room details show now the members of the room including the power level</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>General UX</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fractal-Next is better integrated with GNOME's secret management service Seahorse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It supports room upgrades</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also supports inviting users to a room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users can change the category of rooms in the sidebar  via drag and drop or by using the context menu</p>

<p>Also, after the discussion in Matrix Live and with some minor tweaks, I was able to get the extension to play nice with conduit! So that's now a viable alternative if you want to use Matrix Highlight with your own, self-hosted server.</p>

<p><a href="https://kombuchaprivacy.com/circles">Circles</a> is a project to build a secure, end-to-end encrypted social network using Matrix technology.</p>

<li>
<p>This week the primary focus was on updating Circles to work with the latest Matrix iOS SDK.  I also successfully built and packaged the first beta release from an Apple M1 Mac.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next step is to develop and integrate a new, more secure password-based login based on the <a href="https://tobtu.com/blog/2021/10/srp-is-now-deprecated/">BS-SPEKE</a> protocol.  This will replace Circles' current approach, which is described in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3265">MSC3265</a>.  Hopefully the new login flow will also be of interest to the broader Matrix community.</p>

<p>Bubo is a friendly little owl (bot) that helps maintain your community. It's been over a year since cutting the last release, so the changelog contains a bunch of things, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added command to set power levels in rooms.</li>
<li>Added users command to list and create users in a configured Keycloak. Optionally send invites via <a href="https://github.com/elokapina/keycloak-signup">keycloak-signup</a>, a web app that allows self-registering with Keycloak via short lived tokens.</li>
<li>Add logging to a Matrix room.</li>
<li>Bubo admins and coordinators can now be set based on room memberships.</li>
<li>Add command to make Bubo unlink and part itself from a room.</li>
<li>Add command to list rooms Bubo maintains but is not admin in.</li>
<li>Add command to recreate a room. This follows the upgrade room functionality, but does it without needing admin permissions (basically almost everything except a tombstone event). Useful if for example you have accidentally lost admin in a hundred or so rooms in your community. Which may have happened üòÖ</li>
<li>The communities command is now deprecated (support for spaces coming in the next version).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally some other changes and fixes, see changelog for full details.</p>
<p>Plans for next up features include syncing with Discourse to replicate spaces from Discourse groups and populate space members from Discourse group memberships (when Discourse shares the same Keycloak SSO provider with the homeserver).</p>

<h2 id="reaching-another-feature-milestone-submitting-images-via-matrix-art">Reaching another feature Milestone ‚Äì Submitting images via Matrix Art.</h2>
<p>Matrix Art now supports logging in with any account (well-known not supported yet. You need to provide the full server address) and submitting images through the interface.
You can now either just log in (No benefit though at this time as comments and follows are missing) or create a Matrix Art Profile.</p>
<p>An Account can also be created later. An Account would create a Profile room at <code>#&lt;mxid&gt;</code> on your server if it doesn't exist.
This currently is only possible by doing a logout and login in again with the box checked. A better way will be added soon.
Editing the Profile is not yet implemented at this time.</p>
<p>These 2 changes should allow some people to experiment with this. Mobile design is not tested at this time.
Submits should work. If you were previously logged in, you will need to log out and back in for some variables to get set correctly.</p>
<p>Registration is still WIP as there is some more moderation prep needed before the server accepts the registrations.</p>
<p>I hope people cheer in and post their images :)
(Also, please use the nsfw flag if required. This will make them hidden on the front page but shown in your profile page. I will block people that don't use it from the instance otherwise. Please be sensible.)</p>
<h2 id="other-changes">Other Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Form readability increased</li>
<li>Search engine getting filled in the background (Self hosted https://meilisearch.com instance gets used) when submitting</li>

<li>Images without thumbnails or html caption don't break anymore</li>
<li>Directory Database was switched to SQLite</li>
<li>Roboto font was replaced with Inter font</li>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Work on preparing the release of Matrix v1.2 is currently underway. As of today, the Spec Core Team is aiming for a release of Matrix v1.2 on <strong>February 2nd</strong>.</p>
<p>If you know of any MSCs which you believe should be included in Matrix v1.2, but haven't started/finished Final Comment Period yet, please bring them up in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a>, and we'll take a look. Thanks!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3635">MSC3635: Early Media for VoIP</a>!</p>
<p>When I first came across this MSC, I didn't know what &quot;Early Media&quot; as a concept referred to. Even after skimming the MSC... I still didn't really know. But I'll demystify it here in case it peaks your interest and you would like to learn more.</p>
<p>Early media is essentially any media that is exchanged between the moment you start a call, to the moment the other side picks up (a connection is established). For instance, the ringing you hear while waiting for someone to pick up (called &quot;ringback tones&quot;), or the &quot;busy&quot; tone you hear when the line is busy. Those audio bits are known as &quot;early media&quot;. Video can also fall into this category (though that's less common).</p>
<p>This MSC would essentially allow Matrix to introduce these concepts in Matrix-only calls (though these days the client just plays sounds while connecting), but more crucially would allow Matrix to interoperate with other protocols (like SIP) that expect to handle these features.</p>
<p>So yay, more interoperability and bridge compatibility!</p>

<h3 id="synapse-website">Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a somewhat bumpy process, we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/01/18/synapse-1-50-released">released Synapse 1.50</a> on Tuesday! The big thing you need to be aware of is that we're turning off support for Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6, including Linux distributions which ship with those versions by default (like Ubuntu 18.04 LTS). Please make sure your infrastructure is up-to-date.</p>
<p>I'm personally very excited that we tracked down <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11729">a bug</a> which could cause device list updates to get lost when being sent over federation. When device lists fall out of sync, it can cause failures when attempting to decrypt messages, since the keys may not have been sent to all of the user's devices.</p>
<p>We've also made quite a lot of progress in allowing Application Services to support end-to-end encryption via the still-experimental <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3202">MSC3202</a>.</p>
<p>For MSCs which <em>have</em> been merged into the Matrix Spec, we now implement <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a>, allowing guests to send state events into rooms, and we now use stable identifiers for cross-signing and fallback keys per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1756">MSC1756</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2732">MSC2732</a>. </p>
<p>Looking to the future: We're aiming to release 1.51 next week so it has plenty of time to burn in before we host <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/">FOSDEM 2022</a>. This is a pretty quick turnaround from 1.50, but we'll return to our usual fortnightly release cadence for subsequent releases. To that end, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.51.0rc1">1.51.0rc1</a> is out today; give it a shot. üòâ</p>

<p>Hello again! In the last week we continued to optimize the rocksdb backend and Conduit in general, trying to get it as memory efficient as possible. Using valgrind we could see that memory was not getting released in some cases.</p>
<p>We found out that switching to the <code>jemalloc</code> allocator completely got rid of this problem and memory usage seems to be a lot more stable now!</p>
<p>All of this is currently available on the <code>next</code> branch. We are preparing to make a v0.3.0 release soon!</p>

<p>Honoroit is a helpdesk matrix bot with end-to-end encryption support, that utilizes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440/">MSC3440 (Threading)</a> to act as a proxy between a customer (any matrix user) and your backoffice (users added in special room), each customer's room = thread in a backoffice room, where multiple operators can send messages to the same customer at once.</p>

I published a long-planned, long-in-the-making, long-winded <a href="https://www.gibiris.org/eo-blog/posts/2022/01/21_containterise-synapse-postgres.html">report</a> of how I containerised my <em>matrix-synapse</em> homeserver and its <em>PostgreSQL</em> database in order to get ahead of the application dependency deprecations. This was something I couldn't find for myself, so I put this together to help anyone else who might need it. (And it <strong>does</strong> contain a TL;DR section!)</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Hot on the heels (relatively speaking) of v1.1 of the Spec being released in November, v1.2 is now on the horizon! As a reminder, we're working towards quarterly releases of the spec going forwards - no hard dates yet though.</p>
<p>While this is certainly an improvement in speed, when it comes to writing software and updating implementations: quarterly spec updates may actually seem <em>too fast</em>. This is OK; implementations of the spec are <strong>not</strong> expected to update as soon as a new spec release is published. Rather, it is more realistic to expect that the ecosystem updates gradually over the course of the next few months/year after the release.</p>
<p>Look forward to more concrete dates soon!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2702">MSC2702: Specifying semantics for Content-Disposition on media</a>!</p>
<p>This looks like a small, but useful improvement to the spec that never really received much love. Feel free to give it some!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy Friday everyone! Today the Synapse team has <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.50.0rc2">released Synapse 1.50.0rc2</a>. It fixes a particularly nasty federation-breaking regression that crept in during 1.50.0rc1. If you're currently running 1.50.0rc1, we implore you to update to 1.50.0rc2 as soon as possible!</p>
<p>In other news, a reminder that as of Synapse 1.50.0rc1, we have ended support for Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6 as per our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/deprecation_policy.html">dependency deprecation policy</a>, as upstream has marked them as end-of-life.</p>
<p>We'll let the community test 1.50.0rc2 over the weekend to ensure that no other regressions have emerged (please test if you can)! If not, expect Synapse 1.50 to land sometime early next week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has been a long time since my last TWIM post, so here's a summary of all exciting news:</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>We now support RocksDB as a backend. Migrating to RocksDB improved both my memory and IO usage a lot.</li>
<li>You can select the database backend at runtime. No need to recompile a special version anymore.</li>
<li>Lazy loading works. This means initial syncs are significantly faster (1-2 minutes instead of an hour!)</li>
<li>Voice calls are now supported (requires configuring a TURN server)</li>
<li>The report feature is now implemented and sends a report into the admin room</li>
</ul>
<p>Improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Much faster state resolution</li>
<li>Batch inserts for events</li>
<li>Better appservice docs</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is currently available on the <code>next</code> branch. We are preparing to make a v0.3.0 release soon!</p>
<p>Join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:fachschaften.org">#conduit:fachschaften.org</a> to help us test it.</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.10.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>RELAYMSG sending support üöÄ</li>
<li>Allow forwarding all IRC noise to network room ü§´</li>
<li>Support ZNC self-message caps ‚úÖ</li>
<li>Support CHGHOST caps (prevents leave+join on host change) ‚úÖ</li>
<li>Fix owner auto-registration (regression) üêõ</li>
<li>Upgrade to Mautrix 0.14 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è</li>
</ul>
<p>Sending RELAYMSGs have been requested for a while so now we do support that if the cap is added to request list. This makes plumbs on networks that support it work nicer. Receiving RELAYMSGs has not been implemented yet so they show up as external like before.</p>
<p>If you prefer keeping your IRC rooms clean without any IRC noise (mode changes etc.) you can now use a new FORWARD command in the network room to make all such events happen in the network room instead. This affects in-room commands as well.</p>
<p>ZNC users can now enjoy messages coming from your own clone in IRC rooms (including PMs!) if you wish so by keeping the znc.in/self-message cap enabled. This isn't extremely well tested yet but feedback welcome.</p>
<p>Not a breaking change but the caps support will cause connections to networks that ignore CAP requests take a few seconds longer unless you remove all the default caps for said network and it will never try requesting them again.</p>
<p>Mautrix 0.14 upgrade bumps the minimum version as well so packages beware.</p>
<p>Get some global warming from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're about to release 0.2.23 after somewhat of a release hiatus. We've been working on two fronts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the SDK out! Hydrogen was always meant to be easy to embedded, reuse in parts, and make customized versions of. But until now, actually doing that was quite challenging. Now that the SDK is out, you can use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hydrogen-view-sdk"><code>hydrogen-view-sdk</code></a> package in your projects and use parts of Hydrogen in your application. It's still early days, and we're still working out what symbols should be exported (finding a balance between APIs we want to support and utility), etc. Expect updates in the coming weeks. We're also not yet promising API stability for now, some APIs will very likely still change. Once we hit 1.0, we won't change things from underneath you anymore without increasing the major version. </li>
<li>Rich reply previews: as part of providing minimal support for threads (representing them as replies), we're switching from using the embedded reply fallback and actually looking up the replied-to message. One benefit is that reply previews will now updated when they are redacted (and edited, once we support that :).</li>
<li>Also fix some minor other things, like loading images when they are only partially visible, and a very basic location tile.</li>

<h3 id="trixnity-website">Trixnity (<a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a> version 1.0.0 is out! I decided to make it 1.0.0 not because it is out of beta, but because it has most features you need to build a usable client.
That means: cross signing has landed into Trixnity! The next big features will be room key backup and push notification.</p>
<p>Here is the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>fully support cross signing</li>
<li>load members of rooms in an async way (you don't need to catch errors anymore)</li>
<li>reactive displayname and avatar url of the logged-in user</li>
<li>reactive avatar url for rooms</li>
<li>reactive is-direct-room state for rooms</li>
<li>better Android support for thumbnails</li>
<li>make part of device keys API public</li>
<li>merge SecureStore into Store (encrypt your database if you want to keep secrets secure)</li>
<li>move trixnity-client-api model-classes into separate module to use them e.g. for a matrix server implementation (thanks to <a href="https://gitlab.com/NicolasJouanin">@NicolasJouanin</a>)</li>
<li>fixed long standing bug of wrong room name calculation</li>
<li>account data events are handled as if they have a key (like state events) to bypass inconsistency in the spec (maybe this will lead into a MSC)</li>
</ul>

<p>Ruby SDK for the Matrix communication protocol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just cut a new release of the <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby Matrix SDK</a>, with 2.5.0 there's some preliminary support for Matrix 1.1 and the <code>client/v3</code> API, the information for room knocking is exposed properly, some threading issues have had workarounds applied, and a bunch of fixes have been applied.</p>

<p>Use Matrix as a backend for local-first applications with the Matrix-CRDT Yjs provider.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@yousefed:matrix.org">yousefed</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just open sourced a library called Matrix-CRDT: https://github.com/yousefED/matrix-crdt - feedback very welcome! It allows you to use Matrix as a backend for decentralized, local-first collaborative apps. Above you see a <strong>collaborative rich text editor (like Google Docs)</strong> powered by Matrix!</p>
<p>You can try the Rich text editor here: https://bup9l.csb.app (see also the links in the repo, e.g. there is also a collaborative todo-list example)</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jryans:matrix.org">J. Ryan Stinnett</a> adds</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have a distributed data structure and an algorithm that ensures all participants end up with the same result when their actions are combined, then that's effectively a CRDT as well. For Matrix, there a few research papers like https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06488 which examine the CRDT-like properties.</p>

<p>The worst (according to its author!) but simplest webhook bot for GitHub and Matrix.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@me:jae.fi">Jae Lo Presti</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First stable release of the <a href="https://github.com/Jaedotmoe/gh-bot">gh-bot</a> which is a simple webhook to Matrix bot made in Python.
As of now, the bot supports webhooks from Github, Gitlab and Gitea (although support for this one is very light).
Some other projects might do that way better than this bot but this is a learning project, to learn step by step how client interact with servers.
The next step would be to add a CRT.sh integration to get notified when a certificate is issued for a certain range of domains (which is something we want since we saw an IRC bot do the same).</p>

<p>A Devianart Fork based on Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev">MTRNord (they/them)</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matrix-Art is a new social network prototype on Matrix.</p>
<p>It is a direct Devianart style clone. It currently has a focus on only images but is going to get extended to other media types eventually.
I am doing this as a toy project, so it may sometimes have slow progress. The goal is covering the main functions Devianart provides (Posting, Sharing, Profiles, Following, Collections, Comments) as well as integrations to other social networks on matrix using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3639">MSC3639</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of things are currently still missing, but I am trying to get uploading working next :)</p>
<p>An instance is hosted at https://art.midnightthoughts.space/ and the code is at https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-art</p>
<p>Currently, the interface is limited to viewing basic data from a matrix room. In the future, there are plans to have an open registration as well as login with any account to use it. :)</p>
<p>Note however that I suggest against using your personal account just yet, even though the login works, as it may have unexpected room joins at this time. This is known and expected, but not production ready.</p>
<p>Also, at this time, there are no plans of e2ee support. This may get added after the main features are finished.</p>
