<p>Hi everyone! Did you ever feel lost in the Matrix world? The room directory is big, but it's still hard to find something you like. Or are you a room moderator, but there is not much activity in your room because it doesn't have enough users?</p>
<p>This is why I want to share rooms (or spaces) I find interesting.</p>
<hr />
<p>This week's space is: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!inTwmMdGcmomkgejoM:matrix.altay.fr?via=matrix.org&amp;via=mozilla.org&amp;via=matrix.altay.f">RPG</a></p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>Spaces work continues with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083</a> (Restricted room memberships), which will include a new room version due to the new <code>join_rule</code> of `restricted. On the other side of things, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3245">MSC3245</a> (voice messages) and by extension extensible events, is moving as the implementation work is pushed forward. Lots of activity on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3215">MSC3215</a> (improved moderation tooling) as well which will no doubt prove to be invaluable as the Matrix network continues to grow.</p>

<p>Knock, knock TWIM! It's a new week, and I'm filling in for Dan today to bring you an update on Synapse's latest progress!</p>
<p>Hot off the heels of Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.36.0">1.36.0‚Äôs release</a> last week, we‚Äôve put out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.37.0rc1">1.37.0rc1</a>! It includes the long-awaited <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">‚Äúroom knocking‚Äù feature</a> (note that no clients currently support knocking), a completely reworked <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/modules.html">pluggable modules interface</a> and experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">backfilling history into rooms</a>. With knocking support in, this means Synapse now has support for <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/rooms/v7/">room v7</a>!</p>
<p>Among those exciting updates, we also have the usual churn of bug fixes and improvements across the board. Many updates to the documentation as well as we lean into using the new <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse">Synapse documentation site</a> more and more. Please help us test the RC if you can!</p>

<p>It has been <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/05/this-week-in-matrix-2021-02-05#gitter">several months</a> since we last updated you on MSC2716 for backfilling historical messages into existing rooms but we made some big progress this week and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9247">merged an experimental Synapse implementation</a> taking us one step closer to importing the massive archive of messages on Gitter over to Matrix! This iteration will only make the historical messages visible on the local homeserver but we have plans to make them federate in the next. It's still early days on this before we can actually use it on Gitter. Here is a proof of concept to get your juices flowing:</p>

<h3 id="neochat">NeoChat</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@carl:kde.org">Carl Schwan</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In terms of code, this week we didn't get much activity. The only noteworthy news is that we can now send spoilers, and use two new commands: <code>/tableflip</code> and <code>/unflip</code> thanks to Smitty van Bodegom.</p>
<p>Aside from that, we had 2 productive BoFs during Akademy 2021. The first one was about creating a library with shared chat visual components for KDE's chat apps: NeoChat for Matrix, Tok for Telegram and Kaidan for XMPP, KDE Connect and Spacebar for SMS, ... The second BoF was more about NeoChat and Quotient and we discussed how to move forwards with some problems (e.g. non-hacky text input auto-completion) but also the roadmap around E2EE, Spaces and Widgets support. Speaking about E2EE, we will have some very good news to announce next week, stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/me only learned about <code>/tableflip</code> and <code>/unflip</code> this today... and looking forward to this E2EE news!</p>
<h3 id="fractal">Fractal</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre Franke</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/04/this-week-in-matrix-2021-06-04#fractal">past couple of weeks</a>, <a href="https://aledomu.github.io/gnome/another-year-in-gsoc-and-fractal/">Alejandro</a> and <a href="https://blog.kaialexhiller.de/?p=6">Kai</a> started the coding period of their GSoC internship and explained on their blogs what they will be working on. Their projects are respectively to add support for multiple accounts, and to bring Fractal Next to feature parity with current stable. Read more details on their blogs, and subscribe to them to keep informed as they go!</p>
<p>Julian managed to <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/773">land the ‚ÄúExplore‚Äù view</a>, our room directory. There may be some changes down the road, but it looks good for now:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-06-25-pucq0-image.png" alt="2021-06-25-pucq0-image.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Newcomer Giuseppe De Palma removed bashisms from our git hook because they were preventing him from contributing. They then went on to <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/775">tweak the history style to remove the grey background around it</a>. They also got rid of a papercut from the login form: before his intervention, users needed to provide the full homeserver URL with the <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> scheme prefix. It will now <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/780">default to HTTPS</a>.</p>
<p>We also did some housekeeping work that should improve the experience for people joining us on the Fractal Next fun. After being away for a while, Christopher Davis came back with a patch to add a couple more build related directories to our <code>.gitignore</code>. Julian cleaned up the pseudo-milestone description that we had in the README, now that we have a proper <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/milestones/18">Gitlab milestone</a>. And finally, I added <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/777">a warning on the login screen</a> to better reflect on the Work In Progress state of the branch.</p>

Following that, they come up with their own decentralized protocol, including a security and performance analysis. They improve asymptotic complexity when compared to Olm/Megolm, and the assumptions on the underlying communication layer are easily fulfilled by Matrix. They also discuss that the very good asympotic complexity of MLS cannot be reached for a decentralized end-to-end cryptography protocol.</p>

<p>Hello dear Synapse Admins, <code>synadm</code> v0.30 is out. lt seems I was in &quot;story telling mode&quot; already when I wrote the release notes yesterday. That should perfectly suit a TWIM article as well üôÇ So there you go, copy/pasted from https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/releases/tag/v0.30 with love:</p>
<h4 id="new">New</h4>
<p><code>synadm</code> finally got some nicely rendered documentation pages hosted at https://synadm.readthedocs.io.</p>
<p>&quot;Login as a user&quot; admin API support:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm user login &lt;user id&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.user.html#synadm-user-login">Have a look at the new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>New subcommand <code>matrix</code>supporting execution of regular Matrix commands. As a first shot a command to issue any Matrix API call has been implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix raw endpoint/url -m post -f data.json</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix raw endpoint/url -m put -d '{&quot;key1&quot;: &quot;value1&quot;}' --prompt</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.matrix.html#synadm-matrix-raw">The new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that this is meant to be a convenience function in case a Synapse homeserver admin wants to quickly help users e.g set specific settings available via regular Matrix calls and not the Synapse admin API directly. Also note that it is not meant to replace the awesome Matrix CLI tools that are already out there. matrix-commander, matrixcli to mention just a few.</em></p>
<p>The second command below <code>matrix</code> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>synadm matrix login &lt;user id&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/synadm.cli.matrix.html#synadm-matrix-login">The new command's docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It implements a plain login on a Matrix server using username and password. It can even be used to retrieve a token for an admin user, e.g helpful for setting up fresh <code>synadm</code> installations. <a href="https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#getting-an-admin-token">Read about it here</a></p>
<h4 id="improved">Improved</h4>
<p>The README has been updated to point to the nicely rendered docs recently published at https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html</p>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>Update via PyPI or git as described in the update chapter: https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#update</p>

<p>with the change of policy we deployed on GNOME's Matrix instance, it occurred to me that we had overlooked an important aspect in our relationship with Matrix: do we own our Matrix account? And the answer is... maybe! In this post I cover the differences between personal account, organisation-owned account, the importance of segregating activities on Matrix... and why this <em>may</em> change with Portable Identities in the future</p>

<p><strong>Call for mutual help!</strong> The plumb feature needs more testing on busy IRC channels.

<p>Hola everyone! Today we're releasing the latest in bridge greatness, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.27.0">matrix-appservice-irc 0.27.0</a>. This release contains the bulk of our work done for libera.chat. As always, thanks to the community for testing, writing up issues and creating PRs so that we can build better bridges to our friends on other networks.</p>
<p>The highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Username/password SASL authentication support. The bridge now lets you set a !username.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridge operators can now choose to block messages in the I-&gt;M direction while Matrix users are not joined to IRC as a privacy preservation technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now configure the bridge to publish rooms to the public room directory (rather than the appservice directory). The bridge can now also use the whole alias namespace (e.g. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#foo:libera.chat">#foo:libera.chat</a> -&gt; #foo).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numerous bug fixes and quality of life fixes!</p>

<p>This is now live on libera.chat, and will be live on the other bridges very soon!</p>

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Even more read receipt improvements are here! In summary, with the magic of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a>, the bridge shouldn't ever &quot;view&quot; a LINE chat on your behalf in order to sync a message (which would send a read receipt to your chat contacts, even though you didn't read the chat yourself). For LINE messages that require viewing its chat in order to be bridged, like images/stickers (to get the image) and messages in multi-user chats (to know who sent them), the bridge instead sends a &quot;placeholder&quot; message that gets updated with the real LINE message content when you view the placeholder. That way, the bridge will only view a LINE chat when you view its Matrix portal.</p>
<p>A few stability fixes have been pushed as well. Namely, <code>sync</code> should be less likely to accidentally skip chats.</p>
<p>Only one final read receipt improvement remains, for LINE-&gt;Matrix read receipt bridging (which I mentioned last week): to make the bridge check all LINE chats (not just the most recently-used one) to see if messages you sent have been read (in LINE). This will work by cycling through all LINE chats where the final message is posted by you and doesn't have a &quot;Read&quot; marker on it yet.</p>
<p>Once that is taken care of, I'll consider the bridge to be in beta! üéâ</p>

<p>Janet Blackquill implemented custom emojis using the im.ponies.user_emotes extension. For now auto-completion works, the custom emojis will be displayed in the emoji picker and lastly there is also an UI to add new emojis. We plan to implement more of the im.ponies MSC (custom stickers, sticker pack) soon :)</p>

Creating and modifying spaces is also still work in progress until we figure out a proper design for it.</p>

<p>It provides a fully featured base for Dart and Flutter applications including E2EE, and Cross Signing. After more than 2 years of development we now declared it as stable. The Matrix Dart SDK (formerly known as famedly SDK) was initially a rewrite of the FluffyChat backend which was written in JavaScript.

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/maubot/gitlab">GitLab maubot plugin</a> recently received major improvements to webhook handling. The Matrix messages now look much nicer (similar to the GitHub maubot plugin) and it also sends fancy reactions for CI status.</p>

It's unfortunately not yet available on t2bot.io, because I'm too lazy to write a migration script to copy data from the very old standalone gitlab bot written in Go.</p>
<p>In the future I might figure out some interoperability between the github and gitlab plugins so that I can also get CI reactions for my repos (which are primarily on github, but have CI on gitlab)</p>

<p>After some fixes the bot is now back in shape. This means that all Rooms should again have the correct names from now on and accept invites again. Be aware the bot currently doesnt support encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>As a side effect also https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/spaces now found 3x the rooms as before.</p>
<p>Also the webpage got a big overhaul which brings a lot more mobile phone friendliness :) So you can finally properly use it on your phone as well.</p>
<p>Another change is that tombstoned rooms now get filtered from the list to keep it clean.</p>
<p>For developers a API reference is now available at https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/api</p>
<p>Also if you use the apis please note that the content is gzip encoded. The server currently doesnt respect the <code>Accept-Encoding</code> Header.</p>
<p>On the side of internal changes is now that the retries are limited to 5 times instead the previously buggy amount. This should reduce join requests from my server drastically.</p>
<p>For people usings the /servers api endpoint there is also now a include_members option. This means https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/servers?include_members=true</p>

<p>After having tried to convince several people to join the Matrix, my main conclusion is that it's too difficult for people. Apps that big tech companies produce are so simple that having to choose a client, choose (or set up) a homeserver and building bridges is too much of a push factor from the Matrix.</p>
<p>To help those people, I've written a quick guide that should help people without a programming background join the Matrix. I'm using this as a reference when people ask how they could join the Matrix, feel free to do this yourself as well: https://noordstar.me/b/how-to-join-matrix.md</p>

<p>I have spent quite a bit of time lately working on Pinecone network convergence for P2P Matrix. There's still quite a bit to do in order to call Pinecone &quot;complete&quot;, but a network of 50 nodes now bootstraps entirely from cold much more quickly and converges on full end-to-end reachability in roughly 6 seconds. This is a significant improvement to before! Keep an eye out for future P2P Matrix demo builds using these new protocol changes.</p>

<p>Hello! The last two weeks I mostly tried to make our database backend swappable so we don't need to rely on the sled database anymore. I was able to try out
rocksdb, but there were bugs in the rust bindings which required inefficient and unsafe workarounds.</p>

<p>This week I implemented the remaining API route for URL previewing. Already has some nicer url preview results like showing images with Twitter posts and proper YouTube previews instead of the cookie wall text :)</p>
<p>With this, synapse-media-proxy <em>should</em> be a drop-in overlay for all Synapse's /_matrix/media routes.
I don't really recommend using it in prod yet however, but I have a test instance that could use some responsible disclosure pentesting at https://media.pixie.town, please DM me <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:pixie.town">@f0x:pixie.town</a> if you find anything :) </p>

<p>Hi folks, just a quick update on the Libera.chat bridge situation. We're still rapidly working on the bridge, the milestone highlights for this week are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nearly 6k Matrix users are now connected to IRC and growing by the minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're midway though our #matrix* Freenode to Libera channel/bridge migrations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FOSDEM has been migrated over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're still working through our backlog of migration requests from users, a lot of you phoned in!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We're still continuing to rapidly work on the bridge, with a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases">release expected</a> on Monday ü§û. For any of you who aren't in the know yet, you can start bridging to libera.chat by simply joining a channel like <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libera-matrix:libera.chat">#libera-matrix:libera.chat</a> or by searching the <code>libera.chat</code> room directory.</p>
<p>I'm hoping we'll be nearing the end of our journey on this bridge, and it will settle into a natural stable state over the coming days! Anyway, thanks everyone for your patience and we hope to see you on Matrix or IRC!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi bridge followers, today we've released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.27.0-rc1">0.27.0-rc1</a> of the IRC bridge containing a huge number of changes following all the work we've been doing on libera.chat. Notable things to call out in this release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We've refactored the node-irc library to be typescripty and modern, rather than the quite old JS that it was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SASL support for username/password auth has landed, which hopefully means a smoother login process for many. (We're aware of some issues around setting usernames, watch this space)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing you to spin up the bridge with complete control over the alias namespace of a host (e.g. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libera:libera.chat">#libera:libera.chat</a> links to #libera).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally, a privacy feature to block incoming IRC messages when Matrix users are not all joined which is requested by some IRC networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please report bugs as you see them to https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc, and let's all pray this will be a smooth release :)</p>

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Read receipt improvements are here! They are in temporary branches until they've been tested for stability:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>better-receipts-dm</code> branch contains some smarts to prevent Puppeteer from having to &quot;view&quot; a LINE DM chat in order to sync it, which would make the contact you're DMing think you've read their messages when it was really Puppeteer that &quot;saw&quot; them. However, this doesn't work for non-text messages (like images) or messages in group chats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>better-receipts-msc2409</code> branch (which extends the above branch) uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> to detect when you read a bridged message on Matrix, so it can tell Puppeteer to view it on LINE on your behalf. This will let your LINE contacts know when you've read their messages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After this, only a few read receipt improvements are left to be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make Puppeteer check all LINE chats (not just the most recently-used one) to see if messages you sent have been read (in LINE). This will work by cycling through all LINE chats where the final message is posted by you and doesn't have a &quot;Read&quot; marker on it yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use MSC2409 to avoid having to view a LINE chat when syncing non-text messages (like images). The idea is to send a placeholder message that will get replaced with the real message (which requires Puppeteer to view the LINE chat) only when you actually view the placeholder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've been slowly refactoring the room and communities list to prepare it for spaces. This work is now mostly complete, changing ~4000 lines of code, of which 1500 just got deleted. All of the sidebars are now expandable and collapsible, so you can see the full name of your tags and communities and the lists should also update more dynamically now. Startup also only takes half as long as before on my system and Nheko uses 100MB less memory for my account. Next week I'll probably add spaces to the communities list as well as the room list.</p>
<p>Apart from that LorenDB has been rewriting the member list as well as the invite dialog in Qml and manu has been making progress on the room directory. All of that seems to be coming along nicely and behave much more reasonably than the old versions. There has also been a lot of progress on the Italian and Esperanto translations as well as a few smaller bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>I hope we will make it to space next week!</p>

<p>I just learned that in a poll of 89 universities in Germany, Matrix ranked third place in the chat category already. </p>
<p>The source is in only available in German, unfortunately: https://zenodo.org/record/4817795</p>
<p>However, the conclusion list (first table) may be understandable from context. It lists the top three solutions per category with their respective number of universities using it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@oleg:fiksel.info">Oleg</a> clarified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The evaluation was &quot;which solution are you using&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@florian:dsn.tm.kit.edu">Florian</a> added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Instant Messaging part starts at slide 15, the first chart on that slide is &quot;which solution do you use&quot;, the second is &quot;How content are you with the solution?&quot;, with Matrix having the best average of all solutions, namely ~8.8/10.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>This week the Spec Core Team has been reviewing various Spaces MSCs, most recently <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3230">MSC3230</a> (Space ordering). We're also hoping to square away the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issuecomment-655153491">aggregations MSCs</a> (message editing, reactions, etc) once and for all, though this will likely take a concerted effort from a few members to pull off.</p>
<p>Finally <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">MSC3231</a> is a (currently draft status) MSC from Callum, one of Matrix.org's <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021">GSoC students</a> this year! His project aims to allow native token-based registration to homeservers (the idea is so that you can generate a few tokens from your registration-disabled homeserver and hand them out to a few trusted friends and family members).</p>
<p>And finally, work still continues on finishing up the technical portions of the new release process for the spec. As mentioned last week, we've attempted to split the work up over multiple people in order to get it done quicker. Slowly but surely...</p>

<p>Another round of updates on my smart caching media proxy. After refactoring a lot (as always), I implemented <strong>thumbnailing</strong>! Now the only big feature left to add is url previewing.
I also have a test deployment configured on media.pixie.town now, so you can try fetching a bit of remote media through there, or view <a href="https://media.pixie.town/_matrix/media/r0/download/media.pixie.town/GLhyjFL8MPAzz5Oh1gIzF3lQ">this submissions screenshot</a></p>

<p>While they both implement Matrix' media endpoints, they serve rather different niches, where matrix-media-repo fully decouples the media repo aspect, my proxy cooperates with Synapse's filesystem and database, to speed up operation while ultimately making it a seamless drop-in and removal process.</p>

<ul>
<li>Send a bridge notice when getting unexpectedly logged out of LINE, to warn you to log in again.</li>
<li>Improve resiliency of LINE user avatar syncing.</li>
<li>Properly support syncing LINE rooms with participants who aren't in your LINE friends list (This was harder than it sounds...!)</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes (and ones before it) will be merged to <code>master</code> once I reorganize some messy commits.</p>
<p>The next big task is still to fix outbound read receipts (i.e. to make it so that the bridge syncing a message doesn't make your &gt; LINE contacts think you actually read that message). Once that is done, I'll consider the bridge to be in beta.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://thunderbird.net">Thunderbird</a> now has Matrix support based on <code>matrix-js-sdk</code> enabled in the Nightly builds.</p>
<p>The star feature is probably that we support multiple Matrix accounts in the same client. Right now all your unencrypted rooms with text messages should work fine. While we think we won't destroy your account's state, it's still recommended to use a testing account with it. During account setup, it will ask you for a password, even if the homeserver supports SSO. If you intend to log in through SSO, just leave the password field blank.</p>
<p>We're not quite at the point where we support all the things you love about chatting with Matrix. Many of the missing features and polish to make communication successful are tracked in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1712710">this meta bug</a>. The goal for that milestone is to enable Matrix in our Beta builds.</p>
<p>You can get a Thunderbird Nightly build at the bottom of <a href="https://thunderbird.net/#channel">thunderbird.net</a> by switching from &quot;Beta Channel&quot; to &quot;Nightly Channel&quot;. If you run into bugs with the Matrix integration, please report them through <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Chat%20Core&amp;component=Matrix">this form</a>. When filing a bug, please include debug logs. You can copy the debug logs for the account by going to the &quot;Show Accounts&quot; dialog, right clicking the account and selecting &quot;Copy Debug Log&quot;.

<blockquote>
<p>Callum, our GSoC student, after spending some time on Synapse, had now his first go at Nheko's codebase. He implemented, that you can now just enter the server name on registration instead of the full URL. This means entering conduit.rs or matrix.org works now nicely, since those servers are actually hosted at a different URL. He's now working on the Token Registration MSC, which he will implement in Synapse and Nheko, so exciting times ahead!</p>
<p>We also had a small contribution from pcworld, who fixed that if you only viewed the room list in the narrow layout, you would not get notifications for the last selected room.</p>

<p>Welcome Callum, Meenal, and Shay!</p>
<p>We're also working to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10062">unify and standardize the module API</a> which is used to extend Synapse, and your feedback would be very welcome. Similarly, if you have any experience with adding custom modules to Docker images or Debian packages and have thoughts on how we should best support that (or just examples of projects which do that well), please weigh in at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9944">#9944</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, we're looking forward to the release of Synapse 1.35 which will bring significant improvements to memory use during room joins, but that's for next week. üòâ</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a smart media worker/proxy, to offload initial spikes in traffic for homeservers behind slower network uplinks.</p>
<p>There's a <code>&lt;remote&gt;</code> component that sits on a small vps, handling the upload and download endpoints (and soon, thumbnails), with an in-memory cache to quickly respond to requests.
Media still gets forwarded to the <code>&lt;local&gt;</code> component where it gets stored in Synapse's media folder with an accompanying database entry, so all media is still stored long-term in the way Synapse expects it to be, so the proxy can be removed at any point. </p>
<p>Currently not production ready but you're welcome to snoop around the repo :)</p>
<p>https://git.pixie.town/f0x/synapse-media-proxy</p>

<p>Seems like quite a useful project! Other adventures in splitting out the media

<p>Hey folks, some of you (well, frankly most of you) wanted to hear about our plans for libera.chat. I've been hard at work
this week building a brand new bridge which is hosted on the libera.chat homeserver and it's nearly ready to go. We're just making a few final
preparations before taking it out of beta, but it's currently available as a portaling bridge. You can currently reach any channel on libera.chat by joining
<code>#&lt;channel_name&gt;:libera.chat</code>. You can also add the homeserver to your room directory in your Matrix client to search all the bridged rooms.</p>
<p>We're also hanging out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libera-matrix:libera.chat">#libera-matrix:libera.chat</a>, if you have any questions. Of course, the bridge is proving to be very popular so please be patient :)</p>

<p>Definitely one of the most sought-after Matrix bridges lately.
Props to Half-Shot, Libera.Chat and everyone else for getting
it all together in such short notice.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="plumbing-irc-channels-older-wrench">Plumbing IRC channels üßë‚Äçüîß</h4>
<p>Somewhat experimental feature that has landed this week is the ability to use single puppeting in a public Matrix room to bridge IRC channels.</p>
<p>This support comes through a new <code>PLUMB</code> admin command for network rooms that will ask the bridge bot to join a public Matrix room and an IRC channel.</p>
<p>On IRC side there will be only a single user/bot that will relay messages from Matrix users. This is a stop-gap between fully puppeting Matrix users on IRC and doesn't need explicit permission from an IRC network to use by channel operators as long as bots are allowed.</p>
<p>On Matrix side puppets will join and leave based on their presence on the IRC channel. The bridge bot does not need any special permissions in a room as it doesn't do permission synchronization so it can be kept without any power levels.</p>
<p>Unplumbing a room is as simple as kicking the bridge out and it will take the puppets with it.</p>
<p>As this is a fairly new feature it does have some rough edges so feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>With all this said, if you're in the need to bridge any IRC channel on any network with little friction, Heisenbridge should have you covered!</p>
<h4 id="sasl-support-unloc">SASL support üîí</h4>
<p>If you're using Heisenbridge to connect to Libera.Chat from a network block that has SASL enforcement enabled (like some VPS providers) you can now configure SASL credentials to authenticate at connection time to bypass this restriction.</p>
<p>This only implements SASL PLAIN for now. Certificate authentication may be looked at in the future.</p>
<h4 id="but-that-s-not-all">But that's not all</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identd will now always provide a unique ident for everyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved detection for stalled connections</p>

<li>
<p>IRC user ghosting issues fixed for good ü§û</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server TLS cert checking fixes, self-signed support</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week brings a variety of assorted bugfixes &amp; feature improvements in the <code>testing</code> branch. Included are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for <code>m.sticker</code> events for LINE stickers (with an option to use <code>m.image</code> if preferred)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear resolution of LINE emojis, and a config option to scale them (since they're tiny by default)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less frequent re-downloading of already-seen LINE stickers/emoji (there are limits to this, but it's still an improvement)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Option to disable syncing LINE stickers/emoji (in case re-hosting LINE imagery is a liability)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More reliable message syncing (should never get &quot;Decrypting message...&quot; or invisible images/stickers/emoji anymore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix crashes during inbound message &amp; read receipt syncing of multi-user rooms</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like last time, testing is much appreciated üòÄ</p>
<p>Remaining big tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rework message syncing so that receiving a message doesn't require &quot;viewing&quot; the LINE chat in the Puppeteer-controlled browser, which will make LINE send a read receipt even though you may not actually have read the message yourself (I mentioned this a while ago; it's still a todo)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for multiple bridge users at once (A public instance of the bridge will only be considered once multi-user support is ready)</p>

<p>As announced in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021#fractal">the general Matrix GSoC post</a>, we are lucky to get two interns this year again. Alejandro (whose previous work includes <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/626">switching to matrix-rust-sdk for syncs</a>) will implement multi-account support, while Kai (also <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;state=merged&amp;author_username=V02460">a regular contributor</a> by now) will help bring our application rewrite to the same functionality level as our current nightly and stable versions. Both projects will build on top of Fractal Next.</p>
<p>Julian came back from his vacation and immediately got quite busy reviewing and merging contributions from others. Kevin (also known as zecakeh) and him made good progress on several fronts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Room handling was improved. We now keep track of whether the user joined them, left them, or has been invited to them, as well as their categories (favourites, low priority‚Ä¶).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sidebar uses these categories and now uses a single list with <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/git/docs/gtk4/struct.FilterListModel.html">GtkFilterListModels</a> instead of one list per category. The greatly simplifies code for things like moving a room from one category to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>History style has been tweaked, state events and timestamps have been added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown can be enabled from the newly implemented popover and the message composer offers syntax highlighting, although a bug currently makes it so that sent messages are still not sent with a <code>formatted_body</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A persistent state store is used to load rooms on startup while sync is in progress.</p>

<p>We've been quiet in the past weeks, but certainly not due to lack of activity! So many awesome things have happened, I don't even know where to start. I guess I'll go chronologically:</p>
<p><strong>We published so many new crate releases.</strong> Most of our crates didn't see non-alpha releases for almost a year and now we've finally reset that counter! Now you can depend on <code>ruma 0.1</code> and get bug fixes and new functionality through <code>cargo update</code> without having to worry about breaking changes. Huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a> for automating our release process, without that this would have taken so much longer.</p>
<p><strong>We got initial spaces support!</strong> I'm super excited that we're now enabling client authors to take spaces into account, even if &quot;taking into account&quot; will initially just mean filtering out space rooms from their room lists. Code-wise, this was actually a <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/585">relatively small change</a>, with ruma-client-api receiving support for room types and ruma-events receiving support for the event types <code>m.space.child</code> and <code>m.space.parent</code>.</p>
<p><strong>We're swapping out ruma-signatures' crypto library.</strong> Since <code>ring</code>, which is what we've been using so far, doesn't currently support cross-compilation to WASM, there's long been some interest to exchange it for something else for webbrowser homeserver experiments. A viable alternative library was identified a while ago and now <a href="https://github.com/ShadowJonathan">@ShadowJonathan</a> has taken on the task of <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/589">implementing the switch</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to unblocking the WASM usecase, this work <a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring/issues/1299">revealed a bug in <code>ring</code></a>, which generated invalid PKCS#8 documents. We are pretty confident that once the switch away from <code>ring</code> (including a small compatibility shim to convert the invalid documents), a certain class of signature verification failures that Conduit has been getting will be fixed.</p>
<p><strong>We're taking part in GSoC again.</strong> As you might have seen in the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021">earlier blog post</a>, two students are working on Ruma as part of GSoC this year: <a href="https://github.com/Frinksy">@Frinksy</a> (for the first time) and <a href="https://github.com/DevinR528">@DevinR528</a> (for the second time).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some combination of me, Kegan, Bruno and neilalexander have been working on v3 of the CS /sync API. (Today's /sync API in matrix is v2; v1 was the old /events API).  We're not yet at the point of publishing a draft or MSC, but it's coming soon. It's really exciting work which flips Matrix around so that sync scales independently of the number of rooms you're in - and it's at last possible to write rich clients which only ever sync the bare minimum data needed to work: i.e. lazy loading eeeeeeeeverything.  Watch this space :)</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs entered proposed FCP state this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs are in FCP.</em></li>

<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3122">MSC3122: Deprecate starting verifications without requesting first</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="merged-spec-prs">Merged Spec PRs</h4>
<p>Here are all the actual MSC-related changes made to the raw Matrix spec this week!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3179">Clarify that implementations can use stable prefixes once an MSC proposal has merged</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>There's been activity from the Spec Core Team on a number of different MSCs, such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3189">MSC3189</a> (per-room/space profile data). Additionally a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3168">spec PR</a> for Matrix URI schemes has been getting feedback and is moving forward at a quick pace! There was also some feedback from the team on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2448">MSC2448</a> (blurhashes) which I'll get around to answering shortly üôÇ.</p>
<p>Otherwise I think this week was a bit implementation-heavy for the team (the Spec Core Team is a task in addition to our full-time jobs). Hopefully next week will grant us more of a breather.</p>

<p>Hello TWiMmers! The bulk of our update is in Matrix Live today, so go check out the video above ‚òùÔ∏è to hear about how we're reducing the amount of memory it takes to join large rooms, and why joins take so much memory in the first place.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we're mainly getting ready for the public debut of Spaces as a beta feature, but more on that next week... üòâ</p>

<p>Goooooooood afternoon folks and happy Friday! This week we're announcing the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.26.0">0.26.0</a> release of the matrix-appservice-irc bridge which contains precious goodies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can now <strong>disable</strong> the kick behaviour of the bridge on Matrix users if you are running a personal bridge, so losing your IRC connection no longer results in a kick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now remove bridges from rooms by using the admin room, so no need to use the provisioning API or modify the DB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've added a new feature to allow you to specify bridge options on a per room basis using room state. At the moment you can modify the limits of the automatic pastebin system but more features like reply formats are to come!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always please come tell us about it in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#irc:matrix.org">#irc:matrix.org</a> and make sure to check out the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-appservice-irc">new docs</a> if you get a bit stuck.</p>

<p>Be aware that the page is best viewed and used on desktop. Clicking a Room Node will open a new tab with the matrix.to link. If this fails this might be because of no canonical alias being available.</p>
<p>For the developers the data can be taken from https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/relations  The format currently is only available in the d3js format but in the future that API also will be extended for different usecases.</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>A reminder that <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> is available to communicate directly with the Spec Core Team. A clarification from the last edition of TWIM is that this room is intended to be a low-traffic room solely for asking about the status of a/your MSC, rather than the Spec process or anything else. There is however <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org</a> for discussion of the Spec process, and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> for discussion of the Matrix spec and MSCs in general.</p>
<p>Otherwise the Spec Core Team has been doing a little bit of house-keeping. For those that have been living under a rock, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">Spaces</a> is an upcoming feature intended to replace the old Groups/Community stuff with a much-improved implementation. And one that will actually make it into the spec! We've closed all old groups-related MSCs as they are now obsolete.</p>
<p>Additionally we've been giving some feedback on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946</a> (Spaces Summary) which is another part of the Spaces puzzle (and is still a blocker for the release of the feature), as well as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3079">MSC3079</a> (Low Bandwidth CS API) which allows Matrix to operate on resource constrained devices and networks. Yours truly has also been making some PRs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3180">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3179">two</a>) to help clarify the Spec process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's a release! <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/05/synapse-1-33-0-released">Synapse 1.33 is out</a>, and we plan to release a security patch for it on Tuesday, May 11th. This follows our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/discussions/9914">previous discussion</a> where we committed to trying to decouple routine security updates from our regular feature releases.</p>
<p>Read the release notes for details, but the big news is that we finally have experimental support for moving presence off of the main process. We're still testing it, but we hope it will allow instances that need presence to more easily scale out.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/04/30/this-week-in-matrix-2021-04-30#synapse">last week's TWiM</a> we shared a graph of Synapse's memory use when joining Matrix HQ for the first time. In particular, we saw a spike to 1.4 GB before settling at 800 MB.</p>
<p>In the week since producing that graph, we've managed to nearly eliminate the spike, halving it to 760 MB. After backfilling history, the room settles at around 650 MB:</p>

<p>Additionally, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> has a request:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a patch for synapse, that reduces the size of almost empty incremental syncs by 50% (30% if you include http headers). If you are a client developer, you may want to test your client against a synapse with that patch applied, since it broke quite a few clients, that relied on synapse sending empty fields. While synapse sends empty fields, other server implementations, like conduit, don't, so fixing any issues here will help with portability across different server implementations too. With a bit of hope this patch can actually be applied in a few weeks to the official synapse, but it was backed out from the next RC because of the breakage. So if you can, please test your client, which you are developing, against the following PR and fix any issues you experience from it: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9919</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The initial alpha version of <a href="https://gitlab.com/beeper/brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> is now public, which means you can now (try to) use <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-imessage">mautrix-imessage</a> on a jailbroken iOS device for iMessage bridging. Setup instructions are on docs.mau.fi: https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/imessage/ios/setup.html</p>
<p>Brooklyn was developed by ethanrdoesmc. It's an app/tweak that handles communicating with iMessage and runs mautrix-imessage as a subprocess for the Matrix side. The initial alpha supports basic text and media message bridging. Sending and receiving tapbacks, replies, read receipts and typing notifications will also be supported in the future.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Identd implementation to get verified usernames on IRC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLS support for IRC connections</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IRC excess flood prevention with a buffer</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Minor fixes to ghosting issues and some other stuff. This will be the last big update for a while as it has mostly stabilized enough for daily use.</p>
<p>More testers are still welcome to get the remaining issues ironed out so if you need to connect to unbridged and unplumbed networks and run your own homeserver it would be an excellent time to try it out.</p>

<h3 id="fluffychat">FluffyChat</h3>
<p><a href="https://fluffychat.im">FluffyChat</a> is the cutest cross-platform matrix client. It is available for Android, iOS, Web and Desktop.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">krille</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FluffyChat 0.30.0 has been released</p>
<p>In this release we have mostly focused on bugfixing and stability. We have switched to the new Flutter 2 framework and have done a lot of refactoring under the hood. The annoying freezing bug should now be fixed. Voice messages now have a new backend which should improve the sound quality and stability. There is now a more professional UI for editing aliases of a room. Users can now see a list of all aliases, add new aliases, delete them and mark one alias as the canonical (or main) alias. Some minor design changes and design fixes should improve the overall UX of the app exspecially on tablets.</p>
<p>Version 0.30.0 will be the first version with arm64 support. You can download binaries from the CI and we will try to publish it on Flathub. Together with the new Linux Desktop Notifications feature, this might be interesting for the Librem 5 or the PinePhone. Sadly I don't own one of these very interesting devices. If you have one, I would very like to see some screenshots of it! :-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shiny:shine.horse">Shine</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fluffychat update: Native Fluffychat Linux build now works well on aarch64 devices!</p>
<p>If you want to try the binary from CI, keep in mind that GDK_GL=gles needs to be set to force it to use the OpenGL ES. Flatpak build on Flathub already has it set up and works out of the box.</p>
<p>Some distributions can have issues with input fields and virtual keyboard, making it look like the input is set up as right-to-left. To my understanding, it's an issue of certain older GTK versions with Flutter.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now should stop showing you actions, that you can't do anyway, because that is confusing and useless. This includes the following and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Invite members, if you have no invite permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete messages, if you don't have redaction permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send a message, reply to one, edit one and more, if you can't even send the message!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell us, if we missed something or we removed an action, that you actually have permissions to do!</p>
<p>Apart from that we also started working on some of the features for the next major release. That release will mostly focus on bringing End-to-End-Encryption out of beta. As a first step, Nheko now shows if a message was sent from a verified device or not. This has 3 different trust levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>green</strong>: The message is from a device you verified. Either by device verification or cross signing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>greyish</strong>: The message is from an unverified device, but that user has never rotated their master signing key and has cross-signed that device. As such we can probably assume, that this is a trusted device. For extra safety, you should of course verify that user, but if it is just an internet personality you will never meet, you trust you are speaking to the right party anyway and can't really verify them anyway, since you don't know how they look either! We don't want to prompt users with red warning signs in such cases, which will lead to them not doing verification properly, because they just want the red marks to go away. Many people are also not interested in the MITM aspects of E2EE. We think this is an okay tradeoff, but any feedback is welcome of course! This is basically Trust On First Use (TOFU), if you heard that term before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The device is not verified. This can have a few reasons. Either we verified the user, but they didn't verify that device. Or we didn't verify that user and they have changed their master key at some point. Or the signatures for that device are wrong, etc. If you see such a device, you should probably investigate, why that is the case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some biggish changes, so if you experience issues, tell us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a>!</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>We've opened up a new room for MSC authors to come and ask about the MSC process, as well as for review and feedback on their MSC ideas over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a>. If you're unsure what the next steps for your MSC are, or aren't sure whether an idea would make sense for inclusion in the Matrix Specification, then this room is the perfect place to ask about it. Come on by!</p>
<p>In terms of MSC work, Spaces remains one of the most active topics in the spec this week, with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a> finally reaching Final Comment Period! A lot of work went into writing and reviewing the MSC, as well as crafting the implementation - so congratulations to everyone involved! Of course, any concerns can still be raised over the next 5 days by anyone before the proposal is ultimately merged to the spec.</p>
<p>There are a number of changes being merged to the spec as we move swiftly towards the next major Spec release. Those that have merged this week are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3154">MSC2403: Knocking and MSC2998: Room Version 7</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3151">MSC2874: Single SSSS</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3149">MSC1544: Key verification using QR Codes</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise there's been a smattering of discussion and updates on various MSCs, such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2730">MSC2730</a> (verifiable forwarded events), <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2249">MSC2249</a> (requiring a user to be able to see an event to report it) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2516">MSC2516</a> (voice messages).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We expect to release 1.33 on Tuesday; more on that next week. But generally speaking, much of our development focus has been on profiling the memory usage of small homeservers joining large, highly-federated rooms for the first time. For example, we see a graph like this when joining Matrix HQ:</p>

<p>At a first pass, we're aiming to significantly reduce the initial spikiness of that graph, and we <em>think</em> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9910">#9910</a> will help with the subsequent slow ramp up in memory.</p>

<p>Announcing a new bouncer style Matrix IRC bridge to <em>bridge</em> the gap between IRC and Matrix in a way that's easy to configure and manage by homeserver administrators for small scale deployment.</p>
<p>Meet Heisenbridge https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge ü•≥ (it's a Breaking Bad reference ü§¶)</p>
<p>It's written in Python and started off as an experiment if it's possible to create a somewhat well performing stateless IRC bridge that's practically almost zero configuration. It quickly found a use case of being able to join !channels on IRCnet that hasn't been possible in the past.</p>
<p>Intended target audience are people who run their own homeserver and would like to transition from a combination like ssh+irssi to pure Matrix (with weechat-matrix, of course!) but still keep IRC close without losing the &quot;fine details&quot; of the protocol that happens when plumbing a room properly.</p>
<p>As the bridge is written by someone who doesn't really know Python help is much appreciated in the form of filing issues, sending pull requests or just discussing about it on Matrix to tell how you would like to use it!</p>

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line/">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inbound read receipts! But with a view caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Receipts are only fetched for the &quot;most recently active&quot; room.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example: if you send a message in room A, then room B, receipts will only be fetched for room B and not room A, until you (or someone else, from LINE) posts in room A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will be fixed in the next update. I have an idea for some Puppeteer trickery to get it working.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read receipts in group chats are bridged as annotations (reactions) instead of &quot;real&quot; read receipts, until all members of the chat have read a message.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because LINE's read receipts for group chats don't tell show <em>who</em> read a message, but only <em>how many</em> people a message was read by.</li>
<li>To capture this in Matrix, instead of sending read receipts for a group chat message, the bridge puts a reaction of &quot;Read by #&quot; on it, with &quot;#&quot; matching how many people read the message so far. Once everyone in the chat has read a message, the reaction is removed and a &quot;real&quot; receipt is sent for all users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal changes to message syncing that should hopefully make inbound messages more reliable, or the very least improve code maintenance. </p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey there, it is your friendly neighborhood cat client! Pardon, chat client!</p>
<p>Jedi18 implemented forwarding of messages. Just select a message and press Alt-F or use the context menu to send a message to the room you select in the popup! This encrypts and decrypts messages and media appropriately, but be aware that sending an encrypted file to an unencrypted room uploads the file unencrypted. (In all other cases the media is not uploaded again.)</p>
<p>Furthermore matrix.to links are now rewritten to matrix:-URIs internally. This means joining rooms and such should now work the same across both of them. It also makes navigation to events work now and even has a shiny highlight effect now! You can also create links to events now from the context menu. These are generated as matrix.to links, since currently the onboarding experience should still be better. Once the next version of the matrix.to website gets deployed, you can even just click there to open the event in Nheko! (Instead of having to copy a <code>/join</code> command).</p>
<p>Since &quot;Copy link to event&quot; was confusing to people and AppAraat opened his present box, only to realize it did not contain &quot;Copy link location&quot;, we implemented that too as well as a copy action, to copy the event body for good measure. I hope everyone who got confused will forgive me!</p>
<p>Apart from that we also updated our screenshots on <a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io/">https://nheko-reborn.github.io/</a> (and all AppStream based store pages) to be higher resolution and reflect the current design. Furthermore we fixed the login on conduit homeservers and that no rooms were shown, if the server didn't support the groups API.</p>
<p>That's all, and keep on c(h)atting! &lt;3</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I announced this project last week. It's exactly what it sounds like: A puppetting bridge to puppet a telephone number from Matrix. It's currently pre-alpha and not ready for use on public-facing HSes.</p>
<p>Not too much has happened in the last week as I've been a bit busy. The main thing is that there's now a <a href="https://github.com/KB1RD/matrix-pstn-bridge/tree/voip-dev">dev branch where outbound voice calls work</a>. Other than the 2014 <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2014/11/30/bridging-matrix-sip-via-verto">SIP experiment</a>, I think this is the first bridge to make voice calls work?</p>
<p>I hope having a reference VoIP bridge can help pave the way for more VoIP bridging. I'm already looking into how code can be generalized for other bridges. For example, I've opened an <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk/issues/112">issue in matrix-bot-sdk to add helper classes and stuff for VoIP support</a>. I'd be curious to see how other bridge builders think this could be accomplished. üëÄ</p>

<p>Some context: I like how simple  EMS allows you to setup the Matrix homeserver, but it lacks any internal tuning or customization ability. Do you want more? OK, setup it yourself and try to stay normal while trying to configure coturn to properly run in docker cluster.  Because of that, I did a service where you can order initial setup and configuration of homeserver (yes, with coturn in docker cluster!) <strong>and</strong> with full control of customization and fine-tuning of manual configuration (website even has step-by-step guide how the process works).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of you might already have seen that bot show up in rooms. To clear up some confusion around it I will briefly explain what it does and what it is supposed to do:</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-do">What does it do?</h4>
<p>The Bot is simply existing to do the same task as Matrix Traveler (bot) already did for years now. It joins rooms, listens for an alias, tries to join it.</p>
<p>The main difference between these 2 bots is that my bot also searches for aliases in old messages.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-save">What does it save?</h4>
<p>It only saves the relations between rooms. This means it knows which room was posted where. It doesn't know who posted it, when it was posted, why it was posted or any other content of messages.</p>
<p>However due to matrix' nature it does need to get the data once onto a synapse to read trough it. This means it has the data on my synapse. (Running in helsinki at hetzner).</p>
<h4 id="what-can-i-do-if-i-do-not-want-it">What can I do if I do not want it?</h4>
<p>The easiest way is to just ban it. It will fully forget that room.</p>
<p>Kicking works too but it might again join if it gets found again.</p>
<h4 id="where-is-the-source">Where is the source?</h4>
<p>The source code is available at https://git.nordgedanken.dev/MTRNord/server_stats/-/blob/main/src/bot/mod.rs</p>
<p>For further questions feel free to join #server_stats:nordgedanken.dev</p>
<p>Also note this bot is still very early in development which is why it does not respond to you yet on any commands. This will be added in the near future as well as a readme in the repository</p>

<h3 id="matrix-uri-scheme">Matrix URI scheme</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jboi:jboi.nl">Jonathan</a> noticed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>matrix:</code> URI scheme has just been officially accepted (safelisted) into the HTML standard! üöÄ</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="what-is-the-matrix-uri-scheme">What is the Matrix URI scheme?</h4>
<p>You are probably familiar with <code>mailto:user@example.com</code> or <code>tel:+1-555-438-3732</code>. The former is usually used to open an email address in your mail client, while the latter is used for phone numbers. This allows applications to register themselves as a handler for it, like for example GMail or Thunderbird, and your browser and other applications can find them and tell them to open an editor or similar, with that identifier as the target. There are also a lot of other applications that have similar schemes like Telegram, Zoom and more.</p>
<p>In Matrix you have similar identifiers, most notably users (@user:example.org) and rooms (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#room:example.org">#room:example.org</a>). The matrix URI scheme now allows you to open such identifiers in your favourite Matrix clients. You can now just click on matrix:u/user:example.org or matrix:r/room:example.org and start chatting with the user or join the room. (There is a bit more to it, you actually need an action after the identifier for it, otherwise it will just open the user profile or show the room, if you are joined to it, but that is the idea. For more details, check https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/proposals/2312-matrix-uri.md )</p>
<p>As you can see the format of the matrix: scheme is a bit different that standard Matrix identifiers. This is mostly because they need to start with <code>scheme:</code>, where <code>scheme</code> is different depending on the application, but some characters are also treated differently in URIs, which is why the matrix scheme decided to avoid them where possible.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-mean-that-the-matrix-scheme-is-now-part-of-the-html-standard">What does it mean, that the matrix: scheme is now part of the HTML standard?</h4>
<p>In general desktop and mobile clients could already implement the Matrix scheme before, FluffyChat, Quaternion, gomuks and Nheko have even done so already. This means if you are using those clients, you can already use the Matrix scheme today!</p>
<p>On the web things are a bit more difficult though. Since you don't want arbitrary websites to intercept arbitrary schemes, schemes need to be safelisted in the HTML spec/browsers. So today web clients can't be registered to open matrix: URIs. But the first step is done now. The HTML spec now officially lists <code>matrix:</code> as a safelisted scheme.</p>
<h4 id="next-steps">Next steps</h4>
<p>For web clients like Element to be able to open matrix: URIs, a few more things need to happen.</p>
<ol>
<li>Browsers need to implement the HTML standard change and allow web apps to register the Matrix scheme.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Status in Firefox: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1688030</li>
<li>Status in Chrome(ium): https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1169258</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Web clients need to actually implement handling <code>matrix:</code> URIs.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Tracking issue for Element: https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/16875</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be wondering about matrix.to, which was used to share matrix identifiers before. In the long term matrix URIs will probably replace it. Watch the next few TWIMs to find out what happens and/or subscribe to the following issues: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to/issues/191 https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to/issues/192</p>
<h4 id="closing-words">Closing words</h4>
<p>As you can see, this was a big step for Matrix as a whole. This of course couldn't have been possible without <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">Alexey</a> writing such an awesome proposal and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mayeul:mayeul.net">MayeulC</a> pushing for the changes in browsers and the HTML standards. A lot of other people were also involved in implementing the scheme in their clients, sending the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/matrix">RFC to IANA</a> or working on matrix.to, which was our solution until now and will probably bridge the gap into the future. The matrix scheme being in the HTML standard may look small, but a lot of stuff was blocked on it, that can now start making progress. Exciting, isn't it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it gets better...</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MayeulC spotted, that Mozilla now safelisted the <code>matrix:</code> scheme in Firefox: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1688030#c15</p>
<p>Expect this to land around Firefox 90 probably.</p>
<p>So we can check one more thing on our list. Apart from Chrome, we are now only waiting on webclients to implement it. This is moving faster than I expected!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this truly lands in a Firefox version in the near future I'll be very, very happy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello folks! Today at 17:41, we sunset the matrix.org gitter bridge after many years of active service. It started out as a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter/commit/c641e6eb4916c1addbff5ba50d0bf0a5f2084690">tiny little project, forked from another gitter&lt;-&gt;IRC bridge</a> before eventually becoming part of the matrix-appservice-bridge family of bridges (thanks Leo for putting in the hard work there!). It never quite gained all the nice features that the IRC and Slack bridges enjoyed, in part due to it's dependence on the use of one bot account (serving as a relay). However, it was still the entrypoint for Matrix users into the likes of NeoVIM and Typescript and continued to run for several years.</p>
<p>Years later, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix">gitter.im gained the ability to speak Matrix</a>,  so the old bridge can finally be laid to rest. Thanks to everyone that used and supported the bridge, and we hope you enjoy using the new one!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre Franke</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In keeping with our tradition of sending an update every two months, here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been up to since <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/05/this-week-in-matrix-2021-02-05#fractal">the last one</a>.</p>
<p>Amongst a bunch of maintenance changes (dependency updates and the likes), we had a few ones that stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/695">Some views have been migrated to HdyStatusPage</a>. This provides a more homogeneous look across GNOME applications and help them fit better on smaller screens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We noticed regressions around message replacement and removal (edit display and redactions) and we started fixing them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another regression made it impossible to join rooms by alias or id. This was fixed as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We updated information in a couple places and we now have clearer contributing guidelines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We rarely talk about new issues that are still open and tend to focus on fixed ones. We do have <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/milestones/19">a milestone</a> with the remaining known blockers for our next version, 4.5, which we hope to be able to release Really Soon Now‚Ñ¢.</p>
<p>But as interesting as all that is, it pales in comparison to our bigger announcement. We are rewriting Fractal! Julian, Alexandre and Thib have documented the thought process behind this decision and the work done so far. For more details, have a look at <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2021/04/23/getting-fractal-up-to-speed/">Julian‚Äôs blog</a>. The summary is that even though such rewrites are usually frowned upon (for good reasons), two major technological shifts (from a homegrown backend to matrix-rust-sdk and from GTK3 to GTK4) made it an option that we needed to consider‚Ä¶ and so we did! This should result in a cleaner codebase, easier to maintain in the long run, and improvements that we can share with the rest of the Matrix community.</p>
<p>The work for the rewrite currently happens in a <code>fractal-next</code> branch. So far, we have the basic boilerplate in place. The app launches, offers a basic login form, does initial sync and while the interface then looks very similar to stable Fractal, it will just load an unsorted list of rooms for now. Not very impressive on the visible side, but Julian has also been very busy contributing to matrix-rust-sdk.</p>
<p>Hopefully we‚Äôll be able to break the aforementioned tradition and report more progress soon. Watch this space.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@asbjorn:olli.ng">Asbj√∏rn</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cactus Comments is a federated comment system for the open web built on Matrix.</p>
<p>We put out a blog post called <a href="https://cactus.chat/blog/mscs-were-excited-for/">MSCs We're Excited For</a>.</p>
<p>It's about some of the spec change proposals that we're keeping an eye on for Cactus Comments.</p>
<p>We also released Web Client v0.8.0!</p>
<p>This release brings some improvements to the <code>&quot;&lt;time&gt; ago&quot;</code> text, as well as the ability to let the client fetch more messages &quot;live&quot; (i.e. without reloading the page).  You can set a number of seconds in <code>updateInterval</code> to enable this, it is disabled by default.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make comment time a semantic <code>time</code> element (Thanks to @hectorjsmith for !4).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add hover text to comment time (Thanks to @hectorjsmith for !4).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show &quot;just now&quot; instead of negative seconds if message timestamp is ahead of the client's time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add ability to fetch new messages periodically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New config option: <code>updateInterval</code>, which controls how often to fetch new messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change thumbnail size from 32x32 to 64x64.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stylesheet: allow linebreaks in comments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>/ipns/latest.cactus.chat is updated to point to the latest release, so sites linking there should already be using the new version.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev">MTRNord</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>https://grafana.nordgedanken.dev/d/HDVgeCXGk/matrix-server-stats?orgId=1&amp;refresh=15m&amp;var-server_name=All&amp;from=now-1h&amp;to=now  (Warning big dashboard)</p>
<p>This dashboard is a small experiment on what metadata you can get from matrix without any auth.</p>
<h4 id="how">How?</h4>
<p>It utilizes the synapse database to lookup alive and responding servers and on these currently just runs a query each 5m to check the version.</p>
<p>It allows a) to see the amount of servers and which servers my synapse at any point knows and b) to track the individual versions.</p>
<p>For my server at point of writing this results in 2348 Servers of which are 2269 running Synapse, 70 running Dendrite, 8 running Conduit and 1 running Construct.</p>
<h4 id="tech-used">Tech used</h4>
<p>Used under the hood is a small rust script doing all the heavy lifting of many thousand requests each five minutes (around 2-3 per server currently).</p>
<p>The data is cached mostly in RAM as well as being written to a influxdb oss 2.x which allows for the grafana integration.</p>
<h4 id="more-information">More information</h4>
<p>If you want to opt out feel free to block requests with the &quot;MTRNord/server_stats&quot; User-Agent.</p>
<p>You can find the source code at https://git.nordgedanken.dev/MTRNord/server_stats</p>
