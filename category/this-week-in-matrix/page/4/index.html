<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3917">MSC3917: Cryptographically Constrained Room Membership</a> is rather interesting. It aims to make room membership in a room cryptographically verifiable via a &quot;Master Signing Key&quot; that's controlled by users. This is in addition to the homeserver signatures typically placed on events in Matrix. The purpose is to prevent a homeserver from being able to lie about your membership in a room. While not the end-all-be-all solution to this particular problem, it's certainly a well-reasoned take.</p>
<h4 id="matrix-ietf-115">Matrix @ IETF 115</h4>
<p>This last week (well, last few months), the Spec Core Team has been working on defining Matrix as the standard for interoperable messaging at the IETF level, under MIMI. The current drafts can be found in these places:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matrix as a transport for MIMI: https://turt2live.github.io/ietf-mimi-matrix-transport/draft-ralston-mimi-matrix-transport.html (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3918">MSC3918</a>)</li>
<li>Matrix as a message format for MIMI: https://turt2live.github.io/ietf-mimi-matrix-message-format/draft-ralston-mimi-matrix-message-format.html (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3919">MSC3919</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll be publishing these as proper Internet-Drafts once submissions open back up at IETF in a week or so. In the meantime, if you have any feedback then please let us know on the MSCs 🙂</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3032">MSC3032: Thoughts on updating presence</a>!</p>
<p>A loose collection of thoughts on how presence (the ability to see whether people are online/office) may be improved at the Matrix protocol level, and how it could be integrated into a profiles-as-rooms feature (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1769">MSC1769</a>). Check it out if presence is something you're interested in!

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a> explains</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A soon-to-be working group within the IETF called &quot;More Instant Messaging Interoperability&quot; (MIMI) is aiming to solve, well, messaging interoperability for primarily reasons of the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA). The DMA requires &quot;gatekeepers&quot; to interop with other platforms while maintaining the same level of encryption, and we think Matrix is the perfect fit for this use-case. While we'd likely be saying goodbye to Olm and Megolm in the process, we'd be saying hello to Messaging Layer Security (MLS) and its decentralized counterpart DMLS - a good thing in our books, at the moment. </p>
<p>In terms of what we've done this week in publishing our drafts (and soon to be real Internet-Drafts under the IETF process), we're formally proposing that Matrix's Federation API and event schema be used for messaging interoperability. Our very own Matrix spec process will be impacted by this sort of direction as it makes it (theoretically) &quot;harder&quot; to change details of the spec. To avoid it being extraordinarily difficult, we'll be nailing down some of the edge cases of the Federation API and event format ( 👀 extensible events) naturally as we work closer and closer to an RFC series. We'll also be making some architectural changes to our specification itself to better support half of it being in the IETF domain, like defining room versions more clearly and splitting non-core spec out of the way. It's worth noting that this is a relatively slow process as we work towards the deadline of DMA a few years from now, but the changes might be felt by the ecosystem on a more rapid scale.</p>
<p>At the moment, we're planning to attend IETF 115 to help keep Matrix on the map for MIMI and raise our feedback about the proposed working group charter. Discussions about whether Matrix is the correct fit are already ongoing, but expected to increase as we get closer to IETF 116 next quarter. We were also already at IETF 114 a few months ago where many of these conversations started.</p>
<p>Future work is currently expected to come through under my name, as have the current drafts (both with obvious input from Matthew as project lead). Watching this space and the spec process for updates is best 🙂</p>

<h3 id="telodendria-website">Telodendria (<a href="https://telodendria.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jordan:bancino.net">Jordan Bancino</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone, I'm working on a little Matrix project called Telodendria.</p>
<p>Telodendria is eventually going to be another homeserver implementation.  It isn't one yet; I'm still in the <em>very</em> early stages of prototyping it, and writing some boilerplate code, but I've been encouraged to throw the project out there for more exposure, so here we are!</p>
<p>Telodendria is written in ANSI C, will use a custom flat-file database, and relies <em>only</em> on a POSIX system to be built and run. It won't pull in any dependencies; as much as possible will be written from scratch, including the HTTP stack, JSON parser, and any other baseline stuff a Matrix homeserver needs.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>One of the goals is simply to build a useful homeserver, but also just to learn about the inner workings of Matrix and the technology that supports it, as well as to have a bit of fun in the process.</p>
<p>At this point we've got Synapse, Dendrite, Conduit, Construct, and a few other great projects. So you're probably asking, What <em>practical</em> reasons are there to build another homeserver? The best answer to that is in <a href="https://telodendria.io/man/man7/telodendria.7.html">Telodendria's manual</a>, but what it really comes down to is being portable and lightweight.  It'd be cool to have a Matrix homeserver server that can run <em>anywhere</em>, but specifically targets the more obscure operating systems like the BSDs. Additionally, it should be light enough to perform well on Raspberry Pis, routers, cheap VPSs, and other low-power and low-storage devices that might not be as capable of running a full database plus a hefty Matrix homeserver.</p>
<p>For me personally, I just want a homeserver that feels like it belongs on OpenBSD and is capable of handling my use case without having to install any third-party packages. I'm a digital minimalist that wants to cut down on his software requirements, and Telodendria is one of the ways I've set out to do that.</p>
<h2 id="want-to-get-involved">Want to get involved?</h2>
<p>There's definitely plenty of code and documentation to be written, so if you're looking for a challenge and believe in the project's philosophy, you're highly encouraged to get involved in whatever way you're able.</p>
<p>The development discussion happens entirely on Matrix. If you're unsure where to start, start by joining the project rooms <a href="https://telodendria.io/man/man7/telodendria.7.html#DESCRIPTION">listed in the manual</a>. Do be sure to also check out main <a href="https://telodendria.io">project website</a>, which has a list of all the manual pages. The manual should contain much of the information you'll need to get started, but it's far from complete, so if you find the information to be insufficient, don't be afraid to ask questions in the rooms listed above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of the Synapse team are out at the moment; we have mostly been in maintenance mode, both for the project and the Matrix.org deployment. With that said: we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.70.0">Synapse 1.70.0</a> on Tuesday followed by a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.70.1">1.70.1</a> patch release today. Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>better support for <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/client-server-api/#threading">threads</a>,</li>
<li>full support for Matrix <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/changelog/#v13">1.3</a> and <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/changelog/#api-changes">1.4</a>, and</li>
<li>small fixes to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/milestone/10">experimental faster joins work</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you as ever to our community of contributors, server operators and users who've been involved in this release. We'll be cutting a release candidate for Synapse 1.71 on the upcoming Tuesday (1st November), aiming to release the week after (8th November).</p>
<p>As for this week: we've been testing Synapse against the recent Python 3.11 release, dealing wit h CI deprecations and working through our backlog of old PRs. Lots of small things to juggle!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess the most exciting news is that the macOS M1 builds are now merged to master and will be available for the next release. Seems like those are even faster on macOS that the intel builds! (Time from launch to be able to send a message is about 1 or 2 seconds.) The builds are using the generous cirrus CI open-source offering, so thank you!</p>
<p>Another good news is that a fox fixed the upload widget sometimes breaking Nheko when trying to upload specific files on some platforms. Apart from that there were also minor fixes to room sorting in communities, performance fixes to the parent community links as well as work on enabling more warnings when developing Nheko (to ensure our code is better quality, more secure and less error prone).</p>

<p>Happy Friday all!  Once again we have a new build of the Circles Android app for your beta testing enjoyment.</p>
<h2 id="updates-in-this-release-v1-0-5">Updates in this release (v1.0.5)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Renamed the app back to &quot;Circles&quot;.  Technically the proper name of the app is &quot;FUTO Circles&quot;, but it will show up on your home screen as simply &quot;Circles&quot;, similar to how Google Photos is &quot;Photos&quot; and Google Maps is &quot;Maps&quot;.  The Circuli name was too hard for most English speakers to pronounce, and it didn't solve our other issues with the name.  &quot;FUTO Circles&quot; should do the trick.</li>
<li>We're keeping the Circuli name for our online service.</li>
<li>Added QR-code-based device verification.</li>
<li>Made registration tokens optional, i.e. it's up to the server whether to require them or not.  Currently we do require registration tokens on our servers, and you can sign up with the token 0000-1111-2222-4444.</li>

<p>Long-awaited and with a bunch of final bug-fixes on the server side, this week eventually saw the merging of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1054">sliding sync extensions</a>, enabling e2ee and to-device message support via sliding-sync on main. With that, and some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1154">additional APIs on</a>, a new Element-x with e2ee support was made available. A release that also features the latest <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1138">work on the timeline API</a>, which, too, has seen its fair share of progress this week - mainly internal fixes and debugging helpers.</p>
<p>As a result of the sliding sync work, just earlier today, an important PR was opened for jack-in, the experimental debugging TUI client based on matrix-rust-sdk (which we use for debugging sliding sync): <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1156">now allowing you send (encrypted) messages</a>, too.</p>
<p>Following last weeks announcement we also made the Rust-Sec public, indicating why we recommend uprgading to 0.6.1, which we released shortly prior.</p>
<p>Other than that, work has been progressed in the background on the pretty complex problem of async in uniffi and system-specific runners, namely libdispatch on ios rather than tokio, as well as work on uniff proc-macros.</p>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2700">MSC2700: Thumbnail requirements for the media repo</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC has the goal of clarifying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">mimetypes</a> of media that a homeserver both MUST and SHOULD support thumbnailing for. The intention is to give clients a clearer picture of what file formats will receive a proper thumbnail before they are uploaded to the homeserver.</p>
<p>Comments on the MSC seem to suggest that the MSC as it stands does not completely solve the problem: while it does give clients an explicit list of supported mimetypes, the list is quite short. And the list of SHOULD mimetypes cannot be relied on.</p>
<p>The MSC also clarifies that encrypted media should always be uploaded with a mimetype of <code>application/octet-stream</code>, instead of the original media's mimetype, which seems like a welcome and uncontentious point. And finally, it defines <code>501 M_UNSUPPORTED</code> to be returned instead of an internal server error on thumbnailing failure.</p>
<p>I believe the next step for this MSC is for the current threads to be incorporated into the text; so don't miss the threads when reading it!</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan Abolivier</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we've released Synapse 1.69! It comes with improved caching tools for third-party modules, and support for a bunch of experimental features, such as thread-aware read receipts (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3771">MSC3771</a>) and an approval flow for new registrations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3866">MSC3866</a>). As part of this release, we've also laid out the removal schedule for the long-deprecated legacy Prometheus metric names, and the <code>generate_short_term_login_token</code> module API method. Read all about it on the matrix.org blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/17/synapse-1-69-released</p>
<p>Another big thing in Synapse 1.69 is experimental support for faster remote room joins! You can read more about it on the blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/18/testing-faster-remote-room-joins but briefly, we are ready for server admins to begin testing, with some caveats. If you've read the post and feel confident, turn it on, give it a spin and let us know how it goes!</p>
<p>Alongside 1.69, we're also disclosing a moderate severity vulnerability that we fixed back in Synapse 1.62. If your deployment runs a Synapse version older than 1.62, and is openly federating, please update to a more recent version of Synapse at your earliest convenience. More info on this in advisory <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-jhjh-776m-4765">GHSA-jhjh-776m-4765</a> and <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31152">CVE-2022-31152</a>.</p>
<p>This week we've also released the first release candidate for Synapse 1.70 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.70.0rc1">1.70.0rc1</a>). This release will include experimental support for thread-aware notifications (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773">MSC3773</a>) and filtering (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3874">MSC3874</a>), improved validation, advertising support for Matrix 1.3 and 1.4, and the usual load of bugfixes and internal improvements.

<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.10.4">Dendrite 0.10.4</a> which contains the following features and fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various tables belonging to the user API will be renamed so that they are namespaced with the <code>userapi_</code> prefix
<ul>
<li>Note that, after upgrading to this version, you should not revert to an older version of Dendrite as the database changes <strong>will not</strong> be reverted automatically</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The backoff and retry behaviour in the federation API has been refactored and improved</li>
<li>Private read receipt support is now advertised in the client <code>/versions</code> endpoint</li>
<li>Private read receipts will now clear notification counts properly</li>
<li>A bug where a false <code>leave</code> membership transition was inserted into the timeline after accepting an invite has been fixed</li>
<li>Some panics caused by concurrent map writes in the key server have been fixed</li>
<li>The sync API now calculates membership transitions from state deltas more accurately</li>
<li>Transaction IDs are now scoped to endpoints, which should fix some bugs where transaction ID reuse could cause nonsensical cached responses from some endpoints</li>
<li>The length of the <code>type</code>, <code>sender</code>, <code>state_key</code> and <code>room_id</code> fields in events are now verified by number of bytes rather than codepoints after a spec clarification, reverting a change made in Dendrite 0.9.6</li>

<li>Release candidate 1.5.4 is available for the tester on the PlayStore. It includes a lot of new features, most of them behind lab flags: new device management, new WYSIWYG editor, Voice broadcast, etc. Also the application is now targeting Android 13 devices.

<p>It's been a little while since our last update, but Populus development continues! In addition to the usual bugfixes, we've made a number of ergonomics improvements suggested by the experiences of other users at my university. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Buttons for message actions (react, redact, reply, and so on) are now displayed in a way that doesn't overlap with sender names</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avatar images for discussions can now up uploaded simultaneously with discussion creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Older collections of discussions can be &quot;archived&quot; using <code>m.lowpriority</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moar tootips!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We've also made some minor graphical improvements: loading messages are now indicated with a nice low-contrast SVG hint, rather than the literal-minded &quot;loading message&quot; message. Some icons have been improved, and the bartab (lines in the margins) display logic has been improved. And, we're now on the latest JS-SDK version.</p>

<p>👋 Hello form the VoIP team. This week we have a bunch of news. 1) We released Element Call version 0.3 with a lot of UX polishing  including i18n (thx to the great community) and paving the way for a proper 2) integration into Element Web and Desktop. If you want to give it a try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use https://develop.element.io or Element Desktop Nightly</li>
<li>Enable in Settings -&gt; Labs -&gt; Calls
<ul>
<li>Element Call Videorooms</li>
<li>New group call experience</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now you can create
<ul>
<li>A new video room backed by Element Call or</li>
<li>Enable Calls in the Rooms settings of a room and just press the regular call button</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>And by the way we also added screen-sharing with Element Desktop Nightly using the embedded Element Call.</li>

<p>While the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1054">sliding sync extensions</a> are being tested and bugs found during the tests reported and fixed, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1106">FFI for the new timeline API</a> has been approved and merged this week. The third big chunk that was merged this week, was a refactoring to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1098">Replace QR with SAS verification</a> and the yet to be merged <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1124">signaling for SAS verification</a>. </p>
<p>While forcing the (not clearly spece'ed) sending of authentication tokens for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1120"><code>get_profile</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1118"><code>get_display_name</code></a>, we've also noticed a bug where we sometimes, unintentionally include the access_token in debug output - <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1130">and fixed that</a>. We will be providing a patch release and RustSec about this soon.</p>
<p>Other than that, this week has seen many smaller fixes, like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1131">making the store-setters on client-builder actually adhere to the builder pattern</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1119">removing string from storerrors</a>, and improvements like the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1126">API to set local trust</a>  or setting workspace wide dependencies for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1116">uniffi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1122">others</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io">TravisR</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the year, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/04/this-week-in-matrix-2022-03-04#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F">t2bot.io passed 1 Million known rooms</a> and now it's passed 10 Million bridged users (10,039,915 users to be exact, at time of writing). Most of these users will be people who have participated in a channel/chat on Discord or Telegram that was bridged to Matrix through t2bot.io's free service, with about 500 thousand being active each month.</p>
<p>Approximately 8 Million of the users are from Telegram, covering about 11% of all Telegram users (previously 15% based on information available at the time). The remaining 2 Million are Discord users, roughly 0.5% of Discord's user base. For perspective, t2bot.io has just over 683 Million events in the database and is bridging between 30 and 40 thousand people a day.</p>
<p>Like last time, this is just a milestone update, though it's also a good reminder to host your own server if you can. Element's own <a href="https://element.io/matrix-services">hosting platform</a> is a great option if you'd like to have a server without running it yourself, and <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> offers a richer bridging experience than t2bot.io can feasibly provide. If you'd like to go down the self-hosting route, check out Thib's video guide on hosting synapse or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsw1bbBjAM">last week's Matrix Live</a> for a better understanding of what hosting Synapse actually means.</p>
<p>As for an interesting statistic: despite not having much functionality that deals with Spaces, t2bot.io can see 2687 Spaces from the wider world. The plan in the coming months is to support a way to bridge a whole Discord server to a Matrix Space, making this statistic hopefully more interesting as time goes on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.5">Dendrite 0.9.5</a> which includes a number of fixes, particularly for federation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The roomserver will now correctly unreject previously rejected events if necessary when reprocessing</li>
<li>The handling of event soft-failure has been improved on the roomserver input by no longer applying rejection rules and still calculating state before the event if possible</li>
<li>The federation <code>/state</code> and <code>/state_ids</code> endpoints should now return the correct error code when the state isn't known instead of returning a HTTP 500</li>
<li>The federation <code>/event</code> should now return outlier events correctly instead of returning a HTTP 500</li>
<li>A bug in the federation backoff allowing zero intervals has been corrected</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> utility will no longer error if the homeserver URL ends in a trailing slash</li>
<li>A regression in <code>/sync</code> introduced in 0.9.4 should be fixed</li>

<p>simplematrixbotlib is an easy to use bot library for the Matrix ecosystem written in Python and based on matrix-nio.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de">HarHarLinks</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib">simplematrixbotlib</a> has reached version <a href="https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib/releases/tag/v2.7.0">2.7.0</a>, adding support for end-to-end encryption! 🎉
Come chat over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#simplematrixbotlib:matrix.org">#simplematrixbotlib:matrix.org</a>!</p>
<p>Here is a summary of things that have happened since we last announced v2.6.3 on this channel:</p>
<ul>
<li>🌐 The repo canonically moved to https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib, but the PyPI package remains available in the usual place.</li>
<li>🔒️ E2EE support! To enable it, simply install the optional e2ee dependencies. Find out how in <a href="https://simple-matrix-bot-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#e2e-encryption">the manual</a>.</li>
<li>😄 Emoji verification support! Enable the option and you'll be able to interactively verify between the bot and your devices. (But mind that for now, <a href="https://simple-matrix-bot-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#interactive-sas-verification-using-emoji">in-room verification is not supported, but only to-device</a>).</li>
<li>☝️ Fingerprint verification support! As an additional method, the bot will print it's encryption fingerprint so you can &quot;manually verify&quot;.</li>
<li>🗄️ Extensible config file! It is now easier than ever to add your own configuration options to the built-in TOML config file.</li>
<li>🧹 The usual housekeeping, bumping matrix-nio to 0.19.0.</li>
<li>🗨️ I (<a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks">HarHarLinks</a>) will be presenting the library this weekend at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-summit-berlin-2022:c-base.org">#matrix-summit-berlin-2022:c-base.org</a>! If you are in the Berlin 🇩🇪 area, come visit c-base!</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest to use bot library for Matrix. Get started in just 10 lines of code:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>import simplematrixbotlib as botlib
</span><span>
</span><span>config = botlib.Config()
</span><span>config.emoji_verify = True
</span><span>creds = botlib.Creds(&quot;https://home.server&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;)
</span><span>bot = botlib.Bot(creds, config)
</span><span>
</span><span>@bot.listener.on_message_event
</span><span>async def echo(room, message):
</span><span>    if botlib.MessageMatch(room, message, bot, PREFIX).is_not_from_this_bot():

<p>This new bot allows users to use webhooks to forward monitoring alerts (e.g from prometheus) to matrix rooms. This means that you no longer have to use E-Mail or Slack to receive alerts. To set it up visit <a href="https://github.com/moan0s/alertbot">Github Alertmanager</a> or
join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#alertbot:hyteck.de">#alertbot:hyteck.de</a></p>

<p>Hi all,
quite a lot happened since the last twim post a few months ago.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, we refactored the feed page and user page for a better viewing experience. We also now allow displaying and commenting post images in a dedicated view.
Also, you can now send follow request using knocking, thanks to profile as space support. (Yes, MSC is coming)</p>
<p>Finally, we have now multi account support, better stories display and refactored login and settings page.</p>
<p>Well... we almost modified everything :D</p>
<p>See more at https://minestrix.henri2h.fr/posts/</p>
<p>Stay tuned, event organization is coming soon (you can see the first implementation in the blog post.</p>
<p>PS: For those at the Matrix summit, I will be presenting it tomorrow

<p>Have you ever felt lost in the Matrix world? Too many rooms and spaces to manage? Well, back by popular demand  (with Timo's blessing), I present, The Room of the Week! Every week we strive to highlight a room or a space that we believe deserves attention for discussing interesting going on across the Matrix Network.</p>
<p>This week on room of the week:</p>
<p>We Are All Tech enthusiasts on The Matrix Network, but do you ever experience Tech burnout? Do you ever wish you could find discussions in The Matrix Universe about things other than Tech? Well, this week we bring you a very technical solution!</p>
<p>Because we are highlighting:</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#non-technology:matrix.org">#non-technology:matrix.org</a></p>
<p>A space where you will find information about everything <em>except</em>  technology. Groups are helpfully categorized by Subspace, and feature discussions about everything from musical instruments to beverages. If it isn't about computing, it's there.</p>
<p>If you have a room you wish to see highlighted, join us at:
https://matrix.to/#/!bIyiUUnriVoHtYzuPS:fachschaften.org?via=chat.shawnsorbom.net&amp;via=matrix.org&amp;via=fachschaften.org
