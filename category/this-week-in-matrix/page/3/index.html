<blockquote>
<p>Back in July I started a discussion on wikidata for adding a matrix space property, after much discussion in the wikidata community (lead mostly by tgr) we instead landed on a <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P11478">Matrix room property</a>. This now enables slightly more accurate semantics when describing matrix rooms belonging to organizations, projects, and people on wikidata.</p>
<p>Wikidata is a knowledge base available under a free license and using standard machine-parsable data to add information to what is known as the &quot;semantic web&quot;, this allows querying for information like for example: <a href="https://query.wikidata.org/#%23%20Organizations%20with%20matrix%20rooms%0ASELECT%20DISTINCT%20%3Forg%20%3ForgLabel%20%3Froom%20%3FtypeLabel%0AWHERE%20%0A%7B%0A%20%20%3Forg%20wdt%3AP31%2Fwdt%3AP279%2a%20wd%3AQ43229.%20%23%20Find%20items%20which%20are%20some%20kind%20of%20organization%0A%20%20%3Forg%20p%3AP11478%20%3Fs.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20Which%20have%20some%20statement%20%3Fs%20about%20having%20a%20matrix%20room%0A%20%20%3Fs%20ps%3AP11478%20%3Froom.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20the%20statements%27s%20matrix%20room%20value%20is%20%3Froom%0A%20%20OPTIONAL%20%7B%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20And%20which%20optionally%0A%20%20%20%20%3Fs%20pq%3AP31%20%3Ftype.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20is%20of%20type%20%3Ftype%0A%20%20%7D%0A%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20%7B%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22%5BAUTO_LANGUAGE%5D%2Cen%22.%20%7D%20%23%20Helps%20get%20the%20label%20in%20your%20language%2C%20if%20not%2C%20then%20en%20language%0A%7D%20ORDER%20BY%20%3ForgLabel">Organizations with matrix rooms</a></p>

</ul>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>As you can tell from the above MSC list, Extensible Events continues to charge forwards, with Travis working busily away at replicating all of the existing event functionality (plus new functionality - image albums anyone?) in a world containing Extensible Events. As always, take a look at the core MSC (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) for a background on what Extensible Events is, and why it's so exciting.</p>
<p>This week has also seen <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/rooms/v10/">room version 10</a> become the default recommended room version in the spec! As a reminder, v10 brings the ability to have a room that's both <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#knocking-on-rooms">knockable</a> and <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms">restricted</a> at once, as well as more strictly enforces the types of power level values.</p>
<p>Otherwise we've seen lots of movement in other areas of the spec. Expect to see some work done around push rules (which have historically been rather complicated and fiddly...) and notifications in the days to come.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3779">MSC3779: &quot;Owned&quot; State Events</a>!</p>
<p>I remember this MSC fondly. It was originally born out of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3489">MSC3489</a>'s need to allow any user in the room to send <code>m.beacon_info</code> state events. This can easily be achieved today by lowering the required power level of <code>m.beacon_info</code> to the default user level. However, you then run into the issue of any user being able to edit any other user's <code>m.beacon_info</code> event!</p>
<p>Thus this MSC attempts to modify the state events permission model so that users can &quot;own&quot; certain state events that they send. We already somewhat have this functionality - if you put your Matrix ID as the state ID for any state event, only you or users with a power level higher than you can edit it.</p>
<p>Sadly this little trick (which we use for <code>m.room.member</code> events) doesn't work in the case of live location sharing, as the feature demands the ability to share location from multiple devices at once. Hence, trying to send two <code>m.beacon_info</code> events with the same state key would overwrite each other.</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to expand the functionality by modifying the definition so that a user &quot;owns&quot; a state event if the state key <em>starts</em> with their Matrix ID. Problem solved... for the most part!</p>
<p>Do check out the MSC if you have some use cases in mind that would benefit from something like this.</p>

<h3 id="hookshot-2-6-0">Hookshot 2.6.0</h3>
<p>Evenings greetings! It's been a while since we've done a Hookshot release, so this one is pretty large. We've got two major features this time around, <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/encryption.html"><strong>Encrypted Room Support</strong></a> and <strong>Service Bots</strong>. The former now allows you to invite the hookshot bot to encrypted rooms and issue commands to it as normal, it should work entirely transparently. It currently requires a homeserver with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3202">MSC3202</a> support, such as Synapse. One final note is that it's extremely experimental and beta-y, so please do not run this on your production instances or it might format your cats. However, plaese do report all your findings to us. We love fan mail üìß</p>
<p>Service bots is another great feature that now allows you to split hookshot into several different bots, so you can have a GitHub bot, a GitLab bot, a JIRA bot and so on. It's <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/service_bots.html">extremely flexible</a>, so please have a go and let us know what you think.</p>
<p>You can find this release at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/2.6.0, or by doing <code>docker pull halfshot/matrix-hookshot:2.6.0</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, the highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add support for end-to-bridge encryption via MSC3202. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/299">#299</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add support for additional bot users called &quot;service bots&quot; which handle a particular connection type, so that different services can be used through different bot users. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/573">#573</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add new GitHubRepo connection config setting <code>workflowRun.workflows</code> to filter run reports by workflow name. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/588">#588</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parent projects are now taken into account when calculating a user's access level to a GitLab project. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/539">#539</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure bridge treats published and drafted GitHub releases as different events. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/582">#582</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove support for Pantalaimon-based encryption. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/299">#299</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase maximum size of incoming webhook payload from <code>100kb</code> to <code>10mb</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/606">#606</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li>Welcome to 2023, a new year, a new you and a new version of Element for iOS! This upcoming release includes many small changes and bug fixes, the highlights of which are:
<ul>
<li>You can now create links and code blocks with the Rich Text Editor.</li>
<li>The final results of a Poll will be shown when it ends so you don‚Äôt need to scroll back to find them.</li>
<li>Both Threads and Voice Broadcasts have been improved and are more reliable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meanwhile ElementX is slowly making its way towards a public appearance:
<ul>
<li>We have improved how we handle multiple sliding sync windows and implicitly the room list</li>
<li>Better room message backpagination</li>
<li>Improved video playback and timeline media handling</li>
<li>And it‚Äôs all running on the latest version of the RustSDK which brings a slew of bug fixes too</li>

<p>Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even though the end of the year is usually a quiet time, big steps forward have been made in the last couple of weeks on many important areas of the rust SDK.</p>
<p>With Sliding Sync being tried out in Element-X a few more bugs and edge-case scenarios have been uncovered, where it doesn‚Äôt play well yet. For example resending the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1307">correct extension settings on session restart</a> including <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1321">to-device-tokens</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1333">invalidation indexes</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1340">incorrectly skipping to-device processing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1335">various other smaller fixes</a>. The latter PR also contains a first set of integration-tests running testing the SDK against synapse and the sliding-sync-proxy. We intend to expand on that and include it in the CI as soon as github actions are unblocked for it.</p>
<p>Similar has been done on the Timeline feature, with a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1327">better more flexible timeline pagination implementation</a>, a new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1324">virtual loading indicator item</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1344">improved logging</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1287">date dividers and read markers</a>. All good stuff, making it easier to implement a useful chat UI on top of it.</p>
<p>On async UniFFI we see the same picture: with Swift, Kotlin and Python now executing rust futures as well as handling their error results properly. And time couldn‚Äôt be any better as we can hear the creaking of the blocking-runtime we currently have under the hood in Element-X and it is starting to show the limits of what we can implement in a useful manner. We are confident we can start experimenting with it in live apps fairly soon.</p>

<p>Since the last few official Matrix holiday updates didn't mention as many of the cool community projects as I would have liked, I tried to work with the community to publish a community side review of 2022 as well as possibly some small teasers of what 2023 will bring. There are a lot of very varied updates, since everyone seems to have tackled the challenge differently, but I hope you you enjoy the result as much as I did: https://blog.neko.dev/posts/matrix-year-in-review-2022.html</p>
<p>A few days later we also published the same blog post on matrix.org, with a few typo fixes and cleanups: https://matrix.org/blog/2023/01/03/matrix-community-year-in-review-2022</p>
<p>This was a bit shot notice, so I would like to extend my gratitude to everyone who contributed and took some time in probably one of the busiest periods in a year! For the same reason, I hope you can excuse if one of your favourite projects is missing. If you have anything that is sorely missing, feel free to reach out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#year-in-2022:neko.dev">#year-in-2022:neko.dev</a> and maybe I can amend the blog post.</p>

<p>After a lull from the holiday period, work has continued on different parts of the spec. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706">MSC3706</a> has merged, which furthers the spec side of the work to make joining rooms faster in Matrix (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3902">MSC3902</a> for the overview).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3938">MSC3938</a> has also been merged to the spec. The proposal removes a deprecated <code>keyId</code> field and cleans up the endpoint by disallowing trailing slashes.</p>

<p>Sliding Sync (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575">MSC3575</a>) is the next generation of sync - how Matrix clients receive new data from their homeserver. The spec side of the feature has been designed to be modular, with different extensions of spec provided different functionality. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3885">MSC3885</a> is one of those extensions, and defines how <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#send-to-device-messaging">To-Device Messages</a> (how different user devices talk directly to each other) would be requested by a Matrix client from the homeserver.</p>

<p>Element-web client on IPFS</p>
<p>It has been a while since last time anyone announced their effort to host (and keep up to date) Element-web on IPFS.
Since Element-web is a client-side static web application, it works just fine when accessed through local IPFS gateway (like kubo/go-ipfs, ipfs-companion browser addon makes it almost seamless).</p>
<p>Latest version (updated within 2 days of the release):
/ipns/element.sibnsk.net  (/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dj43aqkofq4ggbd7nnpvg8j1ia79deab41bfe4zrp86xoht5w2j)</p>

/ipns/elements.sibnsk.net (/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dmc2sqzfh36v85ucddrw3vbd21erk77wc1pot16j5mqqjmwjyc3)</p>
<p>Note: those are unpacked release archives from github with <code>config.json</code> being a copy of <code>config.sample.json</code>.</p>
<p>Files stored on IPFS benefit greatly from more people accessing, storing and sharing them, so everyone is invited to use and pin (periodically, as new versions are released).</p>

<p>The one mobile-first, decentralized community organizing app</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ben:effektio.org">ben</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week, we merged the core API for <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/413">Tasks / ToDoList and Todos</a> using matrix events into <code>main</code>. <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/issues/424">While connecting the flutter UI</a> is ongoing (which has reverently been <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/418">revamped to be more streamline and intuitive to use</a>) this marks a major milestone in getting the proof of concept done. It shows that using stateful objects inside matrix spaces that can be collaborated upon with simple matrix events is feasible for regular end-user-style applications. The <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/413">PR</a> also brings with it integration tests and a TUI app show-casing live-updating tasks lists and tasks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile many issues have been fixed around chat, the code has been updated to latest matrix-sdk and <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/419">we are working hard on reactivating the integration test suite</a> for better quality assurance. Which is increasingly important as we are sketching out the other generic stateful objects - like the <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/428">comments system</a>, news, pins and reactions.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have received a lot of positive feedback about <a href="https://effektio.org/whitepaper/">the whitepaper we launched last month</a> outlining what we are after when building this and how we intend this all to move forward. If you haven't read it yet, we are still curious to know what you think of it.</p>

<p>Since the last time in November, there's been a bit of activity on Trinity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for end-to-end encryption has been fixed, so that the bots can now reliably answer in private chats and encrypted rooms. Thanks to the kind folks in the Matrix Rust SDK channel for the provided help! Hopefully next time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIbBLs1q99w">we demo Trinity live</a>, we won't embarrass ourselves with that bug ever again üòä</li>
<li>The admin command is now always aware of the room it's applied to, thanks to a contribution by @ahal:mozilla.org.</li>
<li>There's now an experimental OpenAI chatbot, that you can enable in conversation mode in a room (i.e. it'll answer every single message), or that you can trigger with a prefix <code>!ai</code>.</li>

<p>As my first real project written in Rust, I present a translation bot that uses the DeepL translation API to easily translate conversations between participants in a room.
The bot has source language detection, so you can type in your native language and it'll translate to anything you'd like right inside of your Matrix client.
I've released the source code under the MIT license, so feel free to expand and improve on it: https://github.com/du64/scripts/tree/main/matrix-translation-bot</p>

<p>There is a large interest in FOSDEM from the Matrix community, and we are very excited to see not just a stand, not just an online track, but the first ever in person Matrix devroom happening this year! The officially allotted time <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/matrix/">for the Matrix devroom</a> at FOSDEM however is only half a day.
Some friends and matrix enthusiasts who met at the first Matrix Community Summit Berlin in 2022 feel there is more to discuss and want more time to meet more of this amazing community we are part of, without taking away from the FOSDEM experience itself.</p>
<p><strong>We are happy to announce the FOSDEM23 Matrix Community Meetup at <a href="https://hsbxl.be/">Hackerspace Brussels</a> (HSBXL)!</strong>
The meetup is set to begin on Friday 03 February around 13:00 local time (CET) and will go into the evening. See https://hsbxl.be/contact/ for multiple well documented ways how to find us. Thank you HSBXL for providing a location for this!
There is no definite schedule, instead we want to give the space for discussions to develop organically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a> style. If you have a certain interest to learn about something or you want to present something in particular, we want to hear about it!
Furthermore, be aware that HSBXL is hosting more events in the FOSDEM &quot;fringe&quot;, such as a <a href="https://hsbxl.be/events/byteweek/2023/hsbxl-beer-event/">beer tasting</a> on Friday right after our Matrix Meetup, and also the <a href="https://hsbxl.be/events/byteweek/2023/bytenight/">bytenight</a> party on Saturday.

<p>Yes, you are reading correct. This is about Matrix Art ^^</p>
<p>After quite some while, I started to work on it again. I merged the new design into main, updated the UI, and it is available at https://art.midnightthoughts.space/ again.</p>
<p>Current goals are to add the User and Post pages again and implement of the new storage system. The new system uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/travis/msc/trees/proposals/3089-file-tree-structures.md">Spaces as FS</a> at its core for the timeline.</p>
<p>Specifically, Matrix Art is basically a big Space containing a Folder for each User, similar to a Room Directory. In that, there are Timeline spaces which act as the Public Feed. This allows Matrix Art to provide a way of having invite only feeds as well, using normal room permissions.</p>
<p>In practice, the tree is like this (thanks to Travis for designing this many months ago): </p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>+ üìÇ Matrix Art User Dir (public, m.space)
</span><span>    + üìÇ User A (public, m.space)
</span><span>        + üìÇ Timeline (m.space)
</span><span>            - üìÑ Image A
</span><span>            = Room A (invite protected, &lt;no type&gt;)
</span><span>                - üìÑ Image B (counted as under the timeline)
</span><span>    + üìÇ User B (public, m.space)
</span><span>        + üìÇ Timeline (m.space)
</span><span>            - üìÑ Image C

<blockquote>
<p>Quick update on the <a href="https://matrix.directory/">matrix.directory</a> website: we've added the custom event type <code>io.element.functional_members</code>. As you may know, many projects within Matrix don't use any custom event types at all. This can make it difficult to find custom event types, which is (ironically) why I created the matrix.directory website in the first place.</p>
<p>You can find the source code for the website on <a href="https://github.com/BramvdnHeuvel/Matrix-Events-Directory">GitHub</a>. I encourage you to check it out and contribute any custom event types you may have. Your contributions will help make the website a valuable resource for the Matrix community.</p>

<p>If you're feeling adventurous and want to try out the new end-to-end encryption feature, you can already get it from Flathub and some distros. We're also working on supporting it in our Windows, Android, and macOS builds, so stay tuned for updates.</p>
<p>And in the spirit of the season, here's a Christmas joke: Why was the JavaScript developer's house cold? Because he left his closure open!</p>
<p>Merry Christmas and happy chatting, everyone!</p>

<p>Happy Holidays from us at Element! This is our last update for 2022, and it‚Äôs a good ‚Äòun.</p>
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre still working on Notifications, reviewing how they work across platforms for new users, and planning the improvements we‚Äôre looking to make in the new year. While we look at this user experience holistically, we‚Äôre making some subtle changes to the product including removing the bold dot and ordering rooms by activity by default for new users.</li>
<li>We‚Äôre also continuing to improve the password reset flow so that user‚Äôs who can‚Äôt remember their passwords have a smoother experience regaining access to their account.</li>
<li>And, thanks to a contribution we now have the ability to multi-select members when changing users‚Äô permissions in a room! Head to Room Settings &gt; Roles &amp; Permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In labs (you can enable labs features in settings on develop.element.io or on Nightly):</p>
<ul>
<li>Rich text editor improvements are still coming so be sure to check them out, including updates to emoji handling and  inline code formatting.</li>
<li>Threads! Threads notifications and performance improvements are landing thick and fast. We‚Äôre nearly ready to enable the feature by default and we‚Äôll be excited to do that in the new year.
<ul>
<li>Be sure to check that you‚Äôre still in the threads beta for this release as in fixing some bugs your setting may have been changed.</li>

<blockquote>
<h1 id="libquotient-0-7">libQuotient 0.7</h1>
<p>It took us (yes, us - there's more than one person actively working on the project!) a very long time but libQuotient 0.7.0 is out, with a <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.7.0">huge wall of release notes</a>. Big, big, BIG thanks to Carl Schwan and Tobias Fella for their contributions and early adoption of this release in NeoChat (NeoChat maintained compatibility with libQuotient's development branch, along with the stable branch, for quite some time by now). A short summary of most significant things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements: C++20, Qt 5.15 or 6.x</li>
<li>E2EE code is now in beta quality, features:
<ul>
<li>sending/receiving new messages</li>
<li>getting historical messages where Megolm keys are already loaded</li>
<li>encrypting/decrypting attachments</li>
<li>device verification (to-device flow only, no in-room verification yet)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Individual APIs for <code>m.fully_read</code> and <code>m.read</code> markers</li>
<li>Client-Server API backend uses Matrix 1.5 API definitions</li>
<li>A complete rewrite of the event types framework to make it truly extensible; you can now add both base classes and specific event types on the client side without touching the library code (the library still provides standard ones)</li>
<li>Account registry for multi-account usage; account access tokens and pickling keys are stored with Qt Keychain</li>
<li>Sticker events support</li>
<li>Pinned messages support</li>
<li>First-class support in Network Access Manager for <code>mxc:</code> URLs, to enable showing inline images in messages</li>
<li>A lot of code tightening, bug fixing, performance improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to those who observe those - and hopefully I'll get to my senses and release 0.8 sooner than in another year üôÇ</p>

<blockquote>
<h1 id="matrix-spam-ml">Matrix Spam ML</h1>
<p>As part of the efforts for working on detecting spam using ML I started to write a moderation bot.</p>
<p>This bot is written from scratch with some design decisions that hopefully will improve usability for both newcomers and seasoned admins.</p>
<p>These decisions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an action can be done using a reaction, then it will be done using a reaction.</li>
<li>There is a private admin room and a public room for warnings, where admins issue actions. This is meant to serve as a human-readable ban list if admins want to provide this to their users.</li>
<li>The bot will at a later point be able to issue reports to server admins via email and matrix easily by allowing admins to just react after doing a ban. The bot will initially ask how to contact a server if it didn't issue a report to the server before. The bot will remember the setting supplied last time for a server and allows updating the settings if they change. These reports will contain a warning that it was issued from the bot and that replies are necessary for it to be properly relayed back to the admins for further questions. These replies will end up as threads in the admin room. Also, as part of the report, the event JSON for the report will be sent with the report to allow server admins to review the case themselves. (This is still WIP)</li>
</ul>
<p>The warnings also contain a &quot;false positive&quot; action. This is meant to be used to feed back into the used model for further training and improving it.</p>
<p>All in all, I hope to simplify the process of moderation based on what I experienced as an admin. Feel free to chime in at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spam-ml:midnightthoughts.space">#matrix-spam-ml:midnightthoughts.space</a> to suggest ideas for the bot. At the time of writing, it is still very much a prototype/demo.</p>
<p>The code can be found at https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-spam-ml/tree/main/bot</p>

<p>The bridge now avoids double bridging even with multiple users running the bridge client side.

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1255">the last fixes ported over from the demo branch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1270">the growing-full-sync-window support</a> added, we turned our head back to debugging a few remaining <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1405">deserialization</a> and decryption bugs in Sliding Sync when we were hit by a new tokio-thread-panic on Element-X at the end of the week. A quick debugging revealed that it was caused by out of bound indizes supplied by the server. We are still looking into making our code more defensive for these circumstances, too.</p>
<p>Async Uniffi is progressing nicely meanwhile, with now both Swift and Kotlin being able to run and execute a Rust created future. We now have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1228">fallible function support implemented on the proc-frontend</a> and further work is coming up to support <code>&amp;str</code> and <code>&amp;[u8]</code>.</p>
<p>This week also saw the first experimentation in replacing the default Sled database backend. A first PoC attempt was made with sanakirja (pijul is based on), but after learning that its API is unsound and can lead to UB, the team agreed that this requires quit a bit more work (especially in terms of safety guards) than we have time for in the short term. Thus, offering a sqlite-backend for mobile in the short term at least for the crypto store has been agreed upon.</p>

<h1 id="introducing-the-matrix-events-directory">Introducing the Matrix Events Directory</h1>
<p>Are you a client developer working with custom event types in the Matrix ecosystem? It can be tough to keep track of all the different events that are being used, and even harder to interoperate with other developers' clients and bots. That's why I've built the Matrix Events Directory, a website where you can look up and register custom event types. </p>
<p>Here are just a few ways the Matrix Events Directory can help you:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you come across an event type that you're not familiar with, you can use the directory to find out more about it and decide if you want to do anything with it.</li>
<li>If you're working on implementing a new feature in your client, you can use the directory to see if anyone else has already done it and potentially interoperate with their work.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope that the Matrix Events Directory will improve interoperability and make it easier for the community to define and use their own custom events, while still being able to build on top of the Matrix spec. </p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3945">MSC3945: Private device names</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3944">MSC3944: Dropping stale send-to-device messages</a></li>

<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs are in FCP.</em></li>

<p><strong>Accepted MSCs:</strong></p>

<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Both new MSCs this week are from <a href="https://github.com/uhoreg/">@uhoreg</a>, and look pretty great from a spec polish perspective (I've been a fan with doing away of public device names for ages). Check them out!</p>
<p>Otherwise, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3898">MSC3898</a> (Native Matrix VoIP signalling) received some review and attention this week.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3391">MSC3391: API to delete account data</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC would allow users to actually delete account data they've set üéâ Currently you cannot delete top-level keys from your account data, only remove their content.</p>
<p>Deleted account data items will come down <code>/sync</code> as having their content updated to <code>{}</code>, which clients that implement MSC3391 will take to mean that the account data item has been deleted. Clients that don't implement MSC3391 will store the content as <code>{}</code>, which commonly means an unused account data item anyhow. </p>
<p>Yours truly is currently writing an implementation for this in Synapse, and so far implementing the spec as written seems sound!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's Friday which means it's time to talk about the newest Synapse release, v1.73.0! A few details:</p>
<p>Please note that this version removes legacy Prometheus metric names entirely. This also means that the <code>enable_legacy_metrics</code> configuration option has been removed; it will no longer be possible to re-enable the legacy metric names.</p>
<p>If you use metrics and have not yet updated your Grafana dashboard(s), Prometheus console(s) or alerting rule(s), please consider doing so when upgrading to this version.</p>
<p>In addition, a few notable features and bugfixes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move MSC3030 <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> endpoints to stable <code>v1</code> location (<code>/_matrix/client/v1/rooms/&lt;roomID&gt;/timestamp_to_event?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;</code>, <code>/_matrix/federation/v1/timestamp_to_event/&lt;roomID&gt;?ts=&lt;timestamp&gt;&amp;dir=&lt;direction&gt;</code>).</li>
<li>Reduce database load of Client-Server endpoints which return bundled aggregations.</li>
<li>Fix a long-standing bug where paginating from the start of a room did not work. Contributed by @gnunicorn.</li>
<li>Fix a bug introduced in Synapse 0.9 where Synapse would fail to fetch server keys whose IDs contain a forward slash</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>So... some people are distracting me by asking me to play Valheim all the time since Mistlands was in public beta (it is released now). To make that easier to synchronize, especially if not everyone can be online all the time, I wrote a small bridge: https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/valheimmatrix</p>
<p>Your own messages are
bridged from Valheim to Matrix, while other peoples messages are bridged
(privately) from Matrix to Valheim. This prevents loops and does nice puppeting,
but it means everyone needs to run their own bridge. It also means you can see
other peoples messages on Matrix, as long as they have the mod enabled, even if
you are not signed in yourself.</p>
<p>It is a very hacky experiment, but it works, so... why not show it off? Definitely check out the game, it is great!</p>

<p>It's been a tiny while since I've given an update on the Gitter bridge because I've been focusing on other <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">feature parity</a> areas like the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive">Matrix Public Archive</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/13356">speeding up <code>/messages</code> in Synapse</a> but there have been a number of changes over this time üî¢</p>
<p>The first big exciting thing is that <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2309">Gitter now bridges threaded conversations as native threads on Matrix</a> (no more impedance mismatch)!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/bxtVGAtpdvMnLgJZGcabRgza.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We've also been plugging along on less visible changes during this time like bug-fixes for bridging DM's and fleshing out more of the bridge scenarios like <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2200">leaving</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2265">deleting a room</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/merge_requests/2257">bans</a> to ensure things stay in sync. We also started <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#21460-2022-02-01-bridge-private-rooms-to-matrix">bridging private conversations</a> to Matrix behind the scenes back in February so we have a break-away point-in-time to import back from when we do the massive history import to backfill everything. Please note, that you still can't access these private rooms on Matrix but this will come later either in the form of <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/issues/2819">inviting MXID's from the Gitter side</a> or when we give access to the <code>gitter.im</code> homeserver itself to self-manage from that side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apart from playing Valheim, I at least also did some productive things! (Apart from everyone else who has been helping squashing bugs and jugendhackt of course.)</p>
<p>Nheko now supports MSC3664. Support for this is automatically enabled if it is enabled server side. This allows you to get notifications for events that relate to another event. For example you might want to get notifications for a reply to one of your messages. So you need to check if the replied to event was sent by you. Similar things can be done for relations like &quot;notify me for reactions to my posts in rooms with less than 20 users&quot;.</p>
<p>By default only notifications for replies are enabled. You might not notice a difference, since by default you get notified for them because the fallback includes your username, but not all bridges implement that correctly and for me the reply fallback has been one of the biggest sources of bugs, so I'd like to get rid of it long term. (Also some users disable username mentions, because their name is too generic to be useful, in which case this can help as well since it actually checks the sender.)</p>
<p>Anyway, have fun playing around with this!</p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://effektio.org/2022/12/06/blockchain-is-dead-long-life-web5-the-effektio-white-paper/">we have release</a> the <a href="https://effektio.org/whitepaper">EFFEKTIO white paper</a>, outlining what we are working on, why we think this matters, where we intend to head with it and what perspective we come from. We‚Äôve published this 30-pager as a Google Doc with comments activated (if you have any feedback on it) as well as with a 2-page executive summary for the busy. You can also join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#foyer:effektio.org">#foyer:effektio.org</a> if you‚Äôd like to discuss it with us.</p>
<p>For a couple of weeks now, we have a fresh <a href="https://effektio.org/nightly-build">nightly build</a> available whenever changes have been merged within the 24 hours prior. Unfortunately the Android package, with mobile being the main target the UI has been developed for, can‚Äôt be installed as is (you need to clone and build it yourself for now), the Desktop App for Linux, Windows and Mac do give you an impression what we are after. Mind you that a) other than the chat all sections are still mainly UI mocked and b) it is still in heavy development: things break sometimes.</p>
<p>On the app itself, we have spent a lot of time on getting the chat right. The app‚Äôs core was upgraded to matrix-sdk 0.6+ to get the latest timeline API in, which required quite some refactoring. But allowed us to implement reactions, edits and replies. Encrypted Messages are still somewhat unreliable though. Prior to the nightly builds we‚Äôve also taken some time to clean up the UI to give it a more polished look and make clear which things are simply not enabled yet. On the non-chat side of things, we‚Äôve mostly worked on UI things (check out the ToDo-Sections and Pins), while we were waiting for the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14149">synapse fix on reading the timeline from the beginning</a>, which is now released in 1.73. Happy to get back to implementing the state machines soon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>libolm 3.2.14 has been released. This is maintenance release. The main change was improvements in the TypeScript types. There were also some improvements in the Python packaging, which should mean that the pre-built Python package for Linux is compatible with more distributions. Unfortunately, there are some issues with the i686 and aarch64 Linux builds, meaning that those packages are not currently available for the current version. However, if the previous version works for you, there is no reason to upgrade. We are investigating the issue, and may provide new packages later.</p>

<p>If you write code in Elm, you can now send messages in a Matrix room using a webhook.</p>
<p>I built <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/noordstar/elm-matrix-webhooks/latest/">noordstar/elm-matrix-webhooks</a>, a small wrapper around the Webhook API of <a href="https://github.com/nim65s/matrix-webhook">nim65s/matrix-webhook</a>.</p>
<p>I am building an Matrix SDK in Elm but I've never created or published a library before. This is a practice library to see what I can expect. You can install the library using</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span>elm install noordstar/elm-matrix-webhooks
</span></code></pre>
<p>And you can send a webhook message using a function like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="elm" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-elm "><code class="language-elm" data-lang="elm"><span style="color:#569cd6;">import </span><span>Matrix.Webhooks </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">as </span><span>Hook
</span><span>
</span><span>send </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">: String -&gt; Cmd </span><span>msg
</span><span>send </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">= </span><span style="color:#b4cea8;">Hook</span><span style="color:#569cd6;">.</span><span>sendMessage toMsg webhook
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#608b4e;">-- send &quot;Hi TWIM!&quot;
</span><span style="color:#608b4e;">-- send &quot;I support **Markdown!**&quot;
</span><span style="color:#608b4e;">-- send &quot;That&#39;s cool, isn&#39;t it?&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>There is currently no room for this library. Just contact me @bram:noordstar.me for the library or visit <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-webhook:tetaneutral.net">#matrix-webhook:tetaneutral.net</a> for questions about the Webhook API.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After porting the remaining fixes over from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1255">demo branch for element-x as PRs to <code>main</code></a>, we've spent a significant time debugging the two biggest know pain points: double echos for sending messages, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1260">for which we've merged a fix</a>, and unable to decrypt, which appears to be caused by a broken to-device message exchange (with an incomplete <code>sender_key</code>), which we are still investigating. Furthermore we've exposed the ability to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1257">send reactions over FFI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1261"><code>LoginBuilder</code> and <code>SsoLoginBuilder</code> can now be used with <code>.await</code></a> and merged <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1259">some smaller sled crypto store improvements</a>.</p>
<p>The latter came up when investigating, whether we could use <a href="https://docs.rs/sanakirja/latest/sanakirja/">sanakirja</a>, the <a href="https://pijul.org/">pijul</a> database backend, as a multi-process crypto store backend for mobile. This investigation is still on-going.</p>
<p>Further than an investigation is the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">uniffi async support</a>. After completing the Python backend, Swift is also passing all tests now. Additional Docs should clarify most questions. We are as excited about this as the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409#issuecomment-1331959797">Mozillians</a> seem to be.

<p>I built a ChatGPT bot for Matrix! It does exactly what you think it does: you send a message, and ChatGPT will respond. It's very cool being able to talk to ChatGPT while on a mobile device.</p>
<p>It sends read receipts when messages are received by the bot, and the bot sends a typing indicator as ChatGPT is &quot;thinking&quot; üòÄ</p>
<p>It currently only works in unencrypted chats. I haven't managed to get encryption using <code>matrix-bot-sdk</code> working reliably yet. If it's meant to be working, tips or PRs are very welcome! I've really enjoyed tinkering with<code>matrix-bot-sdk</code> on a few projects so far.</p>
<p>Keep in mind any text you send it will go to the closed source servers of OpenAI, and it is unlikely to stay free forever.</p>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3890">MSC3890: Remotely silence local notifications</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC aims to provide a solution to remotely toggling do-not-disturb across your various Matrix clients without needing to set it on each device manually. It does so by using account data which is synced to each client. Upon a client seeing data intended for them, they will silence notifications locally until told to do so otherwise (either remotely or by the user interacting with the client directly).</p>
<p>Quite a neat idea, and adds more powerful functionality to the &quot;device manager&quot; of a client. Also handy if your other clients are things like embedded systems!

<p>In the meantime, this release was so good we couldn't keep it from you any longer. This release is packed with quality of life improvements, and general bugfixes / stability. Deploy away!</p>
<p>The highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub <code>assign</code> command now automatically chooses the top issue and/or authenticated user if not provided.</li>
<li>The RSS feed connection no longer feels the need to spam you when GitHub fails to respond within 10s. It now waits for 30s.</li>
<li>Hookshot now supports creating GitLab connections without automatically provisioning a webhook. When this happens, the bot will tell you to talk to your admin to setup the webhook manually.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@spiritcroc:spiritcroc.de">SpiritCroc</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Version 1.5.8.sc62 of SchildiChat-Android got released this week, which adds a few new interesting features on top of Element:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reworked reply rendering, to follow the rich replies specification. This improves the following:
<ul>
<li>Update the replied-to message in case the original message gets edited or deleted</li>
<li>Fix replies edited on desktop not being shown as replies on Android</li>
<li>Fix replies edited on Android being shown on Desktop with the replied-to event twice</li>
<li>Fix some weird rendering issues, like lists in a reply being completely broken</li>
<li>Nicer design, using the original sender's color, and a maximum height for the replied-to event</li>
<li>Render the replied-to event also for media replies, for example when the mautrix-telegram bridge sends an image reply</li>
<li>In the future, this will also allow us to render replied-to images instead of just writing &quot;Image&quot; in there, but this one is still on the TODO-list since I didn't want to delay a release further.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Render captions as per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2530">MSC2530</a>.</li>
<li>We now allow sending all kinds of room-specific or account-specific global custom emotes as per <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2545">MSC2545</a> (but you still need to configure them with a different client before sending).</li>
</ul>
<p>For those about to ask if I'll upstream these changes to Element: I'm currently not planning to do so, but you are free to pick my changes yourself and create a PR. For rich replies, see also <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/issues/3731#issuecomment-1330363453">here</a>.</p>

<p>Announcing <a href="https://github.com/FSG-Cat/Cats-PS-Collection/releases/tag/FMA_v1.0">Feline Matrix Assistant</a>. This is a PowerShell 7 cross platform script that aims to gather a few somewhat common matrix tasks in one place with a somewhat user friendly interface. </p>
<p>It was designed to enable users on Windows to easily access things like custom powerlevel rooms and manual room upgrades that normally require using Linux to run bash scripts if one does not want to figure out how to make the web requests using their preferred method themselves. </p>
<p>One of the other reasons i made this is just because i wanted to get more familiar the CS API and because i needed it my self because im currently a Windows user.</p>

<p>The last few weeks of Sliding Sync in the various mobile clients is showing its fruits: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1193">Sliding Sync offline caching and session recovery</a> was merged this week, giving you the latest state of your sliding sync in milliseconds without ever having touched the network now. You need to activate it via a setting on the SlidingSyncBuilder - FFI is exposed as well. This PR also adds recovery when the server rejected our request upon a failing position, indicating our session was reset. Previously, you needed to reconstruct the entire sliding-sync with all its state yourself, now this does it internally and transparently for the API user. Additionally, we merged <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1249">a fix for invited rooms</a>, which caused a panic on FFI usage, and have one other <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1248">fix to the sliding-sync state post cache coming up</a>.</p>
<p>Talking about fixes, the retry code path had a bug, which caused retries even when the API clearly stated we needed to change request, which <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1237">is fixed now</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1247">memory store won't continue to keep all media cached anymore</a>. More fixes are being pulled out of the demo branch and coming up as PRs next week.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mgoerens:matrix.org">mgoerens</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introducing a new way to run Synapse on top of Kubernetes ! </p>
<p>The current capabilities of the Synapse Operator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy Synapse: the operator can generate a default homeserver.yaml, or it can work with a custom homeserver.yaml, provided by the user.</li>
<li>Deploy the Heisenbridge and the mautrix-signal bridge: the operator automatically (re)configures Synapse to add the corresponding app_services.</li>
<li>Deploy a PostgreSQL database for Synapse (depends on the postgres-operator).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the operator is deployed, the <code>Synapse</code> resource becomes available. Deploying a basic instance goes as simple as:</p>
<pre data-lang="shell" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-shell "><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span>$ cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; synapse.yaml
</span><span>apiVersion: synapse.opdev.io/v1alpha1
</span><span>kind: Synapse
</span><span>metadata:
</span><span>  name: my-synapse
</span><span>spec:
</span><span>  homeserver:
</span><span>    values:
</span><span>      serverName: example.com
</span><span>      reportStats: true
</span><span>EOF
</span><span>$ kubectl apply -f synapse.yaml 
</span><span>synapse.synapse.opdev.io/my-synapse created
</span><span>$ kubectl get pods
</span><span>NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
</span><span>my-synapse-84d56d54df-c699k   1/1     Running   0          63s
</span></code></pre>
<p>The operator takes care of the deployment and lifecycle management of the Synapse instance. Similarly, the <code>Heisenbridge</code> and <code>MautrixSignal</code> resources can also be deployed alongside Synapse and are managed by the operator.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">operator</a> is written in Go. To know more about the project, please visit https://github.com/opdev/synapse-operator, there are explanations on how to deploy the operator, and examples demonstrating the main features. Or ping me on Matrix if you want to have a chat about it ! I'd love to collect some feedbacks !</p>

<p>Continued review on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706">MSC3706</a> (extensions to <code>/send_join</code> for partial state) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3852">MSC3852</a> (user agent information on /devices) by the SCT was seen. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3743">MSC3743</a> (standard error responses for unknown endpoints) was also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1347">merged</a> to the unstable spec!</p>

<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3896">MSC3896: Appservice media</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC calls out the issue that today application services, especially those that bridge third-party networks, need to re-upload all bridged media to the homeserver in order for users to view it. This can create a large strain on disk resources for homeservers that bridge third-party networks and is a problem that is worth considering.</p>
<p>The approach the MSC takes to solving this is to allow application services to reserve an exclusive namespace for MXC URL's, such as <code>mxc://example.com/_discord_.*</code>. When a user's client attempted to request a media item that falls within the exclusive namespace, the homeserver would request the media from the application service (which in turn could pull it from the third-party network's CDN) rather than the homeserver's local media repo.</p>
<p>Seems like a cool idea! Check out the MSC and leave your thoughts if you're interested or have suggestions.</p>

<li>automatic ban list (can be enabled by postmoogle admin) - no more nasty spammers will ever bother your host and if they will - Postmoogle will <del>cut the wires</del> drop TCP connections before even talking with them</li>
<li>automatic greylisting (can be configured by postmoogle admin) - good SMTP software must resend emails (and 99.99% of them do), RFC said.</li>
<li>internal email queue to re-send failed emails (with 45x errors) automatically - because Postmoogle is good SMTP software and it follows RFC</li>
<li>bridging email threads ‚áø matrix threads/reply-tos (for new emails) - that's a hard one. TL;DR: reply to email in matrix room (either by matrix thread or matrix reply-to) = email reply on email side, works both ways</li>
<li>multi-domain mode with the ability to select a domain for sending emails per room/per mailbox (all other domains will act as aliases)</li>
<li><code>!pm send</code> and thread replies send multipart emails by default (both HTML from formatted markdown and plaintext in the same email)</li>
<li>lots of other enhancements and fixes under the moogle</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>You may have noticed it has been a bit quiet from our side lately. Partially that is because I was just busy fixing issues in our new features on the Synapse side (or implementing MSCs in Synapse). But we also just have been fixing boring old issues in our project, that have been not annoying enough to get attention. For example there was a warning when configuring the project with CMake, which now shouldn't happen anymore, but also is just really boring to talk about.</p>
<p>So maybe some more exciting stuff, in theory, if your distribution builds curl with the correct flags, Nheko now supports connecting to servers over HTTP/3. This in itself is not that useful, but it might improve how Nheko behaves when switching connections or when using mobile data.</p>
<p>Nheko now also shows a completer for /commands (stuff like /me, /react or /sovietflip).</p>
<p>You can also now invert the Enter setting, so that you can send using Shift+Enter (thanks to LordMZTE) and you can update your status message over D-Bus (thanks LorenDB), which allows you to show what song you are listening to or what project you are working on, if you enable the D-Bus API and implement that as an addon in your music player or IDE.</p>
<p>Also lots of boring cleanups going on behind the scenes still, so expect cool stuff to be slower for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>It's been a busy week for the matrix-sdk team. As the week before, a lot of time was (well) spent on fixes and smaller improvements for mobile integration, during which a few bugs and problems where discovered and squashed. While this is ongoing, some of them already found their way back into mainline or at least have PRs pending for it: Like the bug in the read marker tracking which sometimes caused a crash <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1231">1</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1233">2</a>, a problem with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1235">timeline construction being async</a> or some minor fixes on the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1225">xtask for swift</a>. We've also noticed a significant regression in the automatic retry mechanism, which would just continue to spin for ever if the server gave a fully warranted error code back - if you experienced this, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1237">this PR should be solving it for you</a>.</p>
<p>A significant milestone was achieved this week on Async UniFFI. After getting a first PoC ready the week before, Ivan packaged it all up and sent <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">a draft PR upstream</a> with async python code calling an async rust code over FFI and interpreting the rusty result. So cool! Swift and kotlin targets are next.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As that <a href="https://tobiasfella.de/posts/neochat-e2ee/">blog post</a> by Tobias mentions, releasing libQuotient 0.7 is the immediate next step - and in line with that, 0.7 RC has been published! Not much has changed since two betas; despite a very big piece of E2EE introduced in 0.7 release cycle, things have been mostly ironed out earlier in the year. Packagers are welcome to try their tools on the new release. Be mindful though that E2EE has just been introduced and wasn't widely tested; besides, a few pieces are still missing (read the blog post!); so while it's probably reasonable to switch E2EE on for packaging libQuotient, it's NOT recommended to do the same in client applications, unless accompanied by warnings and disclaimers all over the place. The <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.7-rc">release notes</a> are still shallow and boring - the longer text will come with the final release.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> has received lots of optimizations to cut down playbook runtime, sponsored by the <a href="https://etke.cc">etke.cc managed Matrix hosting service</a>. The <a href="https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/ansible">etke.cc Ansible playbook</a> (which is an extension of <code>matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</code>) is growing to support more and more services (besides just Matrix), so the Matrix playbook being leaner prevents runtimes from becoming too slow and improves the customer experience.</p>
<p>The playbook now runs about 2x-5x faster, thanks to:</p>
<ul>
<li>various optimizations (using <code>include_tasks</code> instead of <code>import_tasks</code> in all Ansible roles)</li>
<li>the introduction of additional install-only tags (<code>--tags=install-all</code> or <code>--tags=install-COMPONENT</code>) which skip slow and often unnecessary to run uninstall tasks</li>

<p>Hi everyone, we have released Mjolnir <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/releases/tag/v1.6.1">v1.6.1</a> (via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/releases/tag/v1.6.0">v1.6.0</a>)</p>
<p>Which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Always echo policy list changes. List changes are now always enabled, whereas before they where only shown with <code>config.verboseLogging</code>. Mjolnir now no longer hides changes made by the same mjolnir account, providing the user with feedback for changes they have made to policy lists after using the ban/unban commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy lists created by mjolnir will now be done so with support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3784">MSC3784</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mjolnir now supports specifying the config file with the argument <code>--mjolnir-config</code>. It is highly recommended that you do this as opposed to relying on the environment variable <code>NODE_ENV</code>. The documentation for running with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/blob/v1.6.1/docs/setup_docker.md">docker</a> and from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/blob/v1.6.1/docs/setup_selfbuild.md">source</a> have been updated accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix the WordList protection which was matching every message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rework the banning and unbanning of entities in PolicyLists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unbanning no longer searches for rules by <code>state_key</code> but by entity.</li>
<li>Users with longer mxids can now be banned.</li>
<li>Mjolnir no longer waits for the next client sync before applying server ACL and member bans after using the ban command</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve the clarity of the unban command. Users marked as banned by the <code>Flooding</code> and <code>FirstMessageIsMedia</code> protections can now be unbanned with the ban command. Using the unban command without <code>true</code> will now warn the user that room level bans will not be overridden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replaced <code>acceptInvitesFromGroup</code> with <code>acceptInvitesFromSpace</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <code>config.protectAllJoinedRooms</code> leaking into explicitly protected rooms and mjolnir trying to protect watched lists in some circumstances. You would only have been impacted by this if you ran <code>latest</code>.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<h3 id="matrix-v1-5">Matrix v1.5</h3>
<p>Matrix v1.5 was released on November 17th, 2022! üéâ</p>
<p>While not as feature-packed as previous releases (v1.5 was intended as a maintenance release), it's still worth checking out! Included are two new MSCs that have landed, as well as loads of little bugfixes and clarifications to the spec text itself. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aclarification+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A%3E2022-10-01">all who helped fix issues</a> since v1.4!</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/11/17/matrix-v-1-5-release">Matrix v1.5 blog post</a> for all the juicy details.</p>
<h3 id="extensible-events-are-shaping-up">Extensible Events are Shaping Up!</h3>
<p>As may be apparent from the new MSCs this week, the SCT has been looking at extensible events to iron out some of the finer details of the system. They're not necessarily in the best position to review at the moment, but keep an eye on this space for when review would be most welcome üôÇ</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2705">MSC2705: Animated thumbnails for media (and thumbnail content-type requirements)</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to define a method for clients to indicate to their homeserver that they would like to have animated version if possible when requesting a thumbnail of some media. This would allow clients to provide a toggle to the user for whether media in the timeline should be animated, or whether room and user avatars should be animated, etc. Potentially separate options for each!</p>
<p>Today, there is no way for the client to indicate per-request whether they would like to receive an animated version of a thumbnail. This leaves the choice up to the homeserver, which gives individual users much less control.</p>
<p>The MSC also defines mimetypes that animated thumbnails should return. And it has an implementation in <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a>!</p>
<p>Check it out if animated avatars/thumbnails peaks your interest.

<blockquote>
<p>Another week has gone by and we here at Synapse Inc have been working hard on
faster room joins, bugfixes, and other fun items to make Synapse faster and
better, in addition to releasing v1.72.0rc1. Just a few highlights of the release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding experimental support for MSC3912: Relation-based redactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding an Admin API endpoint for user lookup based on third-party ID (3PID).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing a background database update, introduced in Synapse 1.64.0, which could cause poor database performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving the performance of /context in large rooms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, please note that we now only support PostgreSQL 11+, as PostgreSQL 10 has reached end-of-life.

<p>Since our last update, Populus viewer has added two features, both a bit overdue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Populus viewer now supports .well-known discovery, so you just need to know your matrix server name, rather than the full subdomain in order to connect.</li>
<li>Populus viewer now supports the &quot;restricted&quot; join rule for annotations, so that annotation membership can be restricted to members of the underlying resource space. This will likely be the default for newly created annotations in the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our server (at populus.open-tower.com) has also been rebuilt and reconfigured a bit, and will likely be converted from a test-bed to a stable home for annotation-based discussions in the coming weeks.

<p><a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> is a functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript with the promise that their generated JS code will <em>NEVER</em> raise any runtime errors and show high performance.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that certain implementations like <a href="https://cactus.chat/">Cactus Chat</a> already <a href="https://gitlab.com/cactus-comments/cactus-client">use Elm</a>, I could not find an SDK for it. That's why I've started to write one: https://git.noordstar.me/bram/Elm-Matrix</p>
<p>The SDK is currently in early development. The <code>/v3/sync</code> endpoint is functional and there are already a few other ways to interact with the API, so the repository can already be tested by developers who are familiar with Elm. If you aren't that familiar with the language, it is better to wait until I release the first complete version.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trinity is an experimental bot framework written in Rust and using matrix-rust-sdk, as well as
commands / modules compiled to WebAssembly, with convenient developer features like modules
hot-reload.</p>
<p>Two weeks of updates, because I've been slightly late last week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trinity now uses WebAssembly components as created with
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component"><code>cargo-components</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen"><code>wit-bindgen</code></a> under the hood for the Matrix
modules. This is quite experimental and early stage, but this allows multiple exciting things in
some not-so-distant future: switch API implementations at runtime, more security by isolating
specific APIs, using source languages for the modules that can be compiled with wit-bindgen, etc.</li>
<li>In particular, we've made a proof-of-concept for a bot module written in C (!) and compiled to
WebAssembly, and we've been very close to having a bot module written in Java using the excellent
<a href="https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm">TeaVM</a> project.</li>
<li>New APIs have been added for the modules:
<ul>
<li>a simple key-value store, that is backed by the <a href="https://github.com/cberner/redb/">redb</a> pure
Rust project, which comes with great performance.</li>
<li>modules can now specific help messages as well as admin commands (that will be available only
to a predefined admin user).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which then allowed to write a shiny new Mastodon module: configure it in a room with a set of
credentials, a Mastodon URL instance, define which users are allowed to use it, and then post
statuses from the room using <code>!toot message</code>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Major breakthroughs have happened behind the scenes this week: we were able to get a simple python3-asyncio to poll our rust-side future and receive its result via uniffi. While there isn't much to show for the outside world, this is a major step towards having async-uniffi. The team is super excited about this development.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Sliding-Sync-Land, we have debugged the session reset and added <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1193">transparent session recovery to the offline-caching PR</a>. Together with the latest <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1219">PR that hands over the already received timeline events to the new Timeline API</a>, this should visibly speed up things and improve overall performance across all major clients using both of these. Further more, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1215">Timeline API has UTD decryption retry support</a> now. The client interfaces are moving ahead fast.</p>
<p>On the always-on-going-improvement-front, we have upgraded to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1200">ruma</a>, merged <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1201">the component generation for swift in xtask</a>, switched to custom <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1208"><code>cargo</code> build profiles</a>, have a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1213">signaling mutex for crypto now</a>, moved <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1212">large parts of <code>deserialized_responses</code> to <code>matrix-sdk-base</code></a> and made the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1216"><code>sync_token</code> accessor private</a>.</p>

<p>The Python implementation can be found at <a href="https://git.noordstar.me/bram/pyboy-to-matrix">bram/pyboy-to-matrix</a>. It only supports GameBoy games (no GBA), but it only needs one process (or Docker container) to run both the emulator and the Matrix bot.</p>

<p>This week the Spec Core Team has been working with the IETF More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working group to define a charter. With a charter, the working group is able to start thinking about implementation and design details, which means talking even more about Matrix!</p>
<p>We had the opportunity to discuss Matrix with several interested people at IETF this week, and are extremely excited for the (long) road ahead: even in the event where Matrix doesn't get accepted, we hope the protocol(s) the working group publishes will be fit for purpose and adopted widely (not to mention our own spec will be better as a result). </p>

<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3381">MSC3381: Polls (mk II)</a>!</p>
<p>Polls! They are useful for quickly gauging whether a group of people agree, or entirely disagree on a topic or choice. This is an MSC with a fairly long history, but has received experimental implementation in a small number of Matrix clients. The concept uses Extensible Events, and there are plans to rewrite it off the back of changes in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a> (extensible events). But for now, it works and is a fun feature.</p>
<p>It's likely worth waiting for the rewrite before commenting on the MSC with detailed changes, but otherwise feel free to have a read to see how it currently works!

<ul>
<li>legacy Prometheus metric names are now disabled by default, and will be removed altogether in Synapse 1.73.0.
If not already done, server administrators should update their dashboards and alerting rules to avoid using the deprecated metric names.</li>
<li>Synapse 1.71.0 will be the last release to support PostgreSQL 10. Server administrators are encouraged to upgrade their PostgreSQL servers before the next release, if needed.</li>

<li>Unstable support for discovering an OpenID Connect Server (MSC2965)</li>
<li>Unstable support for private read receipts</li>

<li>Support for Room Version 10</li>
<li>Unstable support for sliding sync</li>

<li>Many features were moved out of unstable feature flags because they were stabilized in Matrix 1.4</li>
<li>We made message construction easier than ever with improvements to markdown detection and improvements to reply and edit creation</li>

<p>As usual a lot of work is been going in the background without any visible, tangible outcome yet.

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>This week we've been continuing our mission to define Matrix as the interoperable standard for instant messaging! With many of our discussions expected to happen next week in this area, we've prepared some drafts for the wider community to review (with even more on the way!). With <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/3923">MSC3923</a>, we're asking for feedback on whether people think the approach is something that could work for Matrix, though there is a cautionary note that there's a lot of TODOs to fill still. </p>
<p>We hope to have even more news next week, but as a reminder: The IETF process is fairly slow-moving as it takes a lot of time to get through the different stages. Keep an eye on MSCs tagged &quot;IETF&quot; or &quot;MIMI&quot; - or watch this space - for updates on how it's going üôÇ</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3911">MSC3911: Linking media to events</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to be an addition to authenticated media in matrix (specifically <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/3916">MSC3916</a>) where successful authentication would also be conditioned on whether or not the user was able to view an associated event in a Matrix room. In plain english, that means that if the media was sent in a room, then you'd need to be in that room to be able to see the media (even if you tried to load the media outside of a matrix client). This change helps address some concerns about media leaking outside of the room it was sent. It also opens up possibilities to delete media if all associated events have been redacted.</p>
<p>Check it out if you're interested in advancing media in Matrix!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://telodendria.io">Telodendria</a> is moving along slowly but steadily. Here are a few brief things to note for this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Telodendria/Telodendria">GitHub</a>:</strong> There's now a read-only Git mirror of the source code hosted on GitHub, which you can browse online, or clone if you want to do local work with it.</li>
<li><strong>Network &amp; Memory Improvements:</strong> I did a lot of work with my debugger this week and made a number of network and memory improvements that make Telodendria <em>much</em> more stable and efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Data API:</strong> I just have begun writing code for persisting data and caching it. At the current pace, I'd expect to see that done around the end of this year.</li>
<li><strong>Get Involved:</strong> If you want to speed up development, I'm happy to delegate any of the tasks in <a href="https://github.com/Telodendria/Telodendria/blob/master/TODO.txt"><code>TODO.txt</code></a> to you.</li>
<li><strong>Matrix:</strong> As a reminder, Telodendria is organized entirely on Matrix at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria:bancino.net">#telodendria:bancino.net</a>. There you'll find a number of rooms for various purposes, including submitting patches, discussing Telodendria, and digesting the official newsletter.

<p>Welcome to another Friday! Here in Synapse-land we have been hard at work on this week's release candidate: v1.71.0rc2. It contains bugfixes, a few new features, and continued work on speeding up Synapse. Some notable elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Legacy Prometheus metric names are now disabled by default, and will be removed altogether in Synapse 1.73.0.
If not already done, server administrators should update their dashboards and alerting rules to avoid using the deprecated metric names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synapse now supports back-channel logouts from OpenID Connect providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synapse now supports use of Postgres and SQLlite full-text search operators in search queries.</p>

<p>Announcing the first alpha release of <a href="https://gitlab.futo.org/cvwright/swiclops">Swiclops</a>, a server that handles authentication, registration, and other user management tasks for a Matrix homeserver like Synapse.</p>
<p>Swiclops can be configured to provide user-interactive authentication (UIA) on the Matrix <code>/login</code> endpoint, similar to <a href="https://github.com/Sorunome/matrix-doc/blob/soru/uia-on-login/proposals/2835-uia-on-login.md">MSC2835</a>.  This opens up many exciting possibilities for the future, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requiring acceptance of the latest terms of service at login</li>
<li>Multi-stage authentication protocols, such as WebAuthn or PassKeys, or various password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols</li>
<li>Two-factor authentication</li>

<blockquote>
<p>We wouldn't ordinarily make so many releases in one week, but we've been quite busy! Instead of including the entire set of changelogs, please see the releases below which have more details about what's changed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.10.7">Version 0.10.7</a> today, which fixes a variety of things in <code>/sync</code> amongst other things</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.10.6">Version 0.10.6</a> on Tuesday, which optimises history visibility, improves E2EE and tweaks some state resolution code</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.10.5">Version 0.10.5</a> on Monday, which adds hCaptcha support, improves E2EE and a range of other fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a Dendrite homeserver, staying up-to-date is highly recommended so please upgrade when you can. Otherwise, if you want to play with Dendrite without having to set up your own infrastructure, the <code>dendrite.matrix.org</code> homeserver is open for registration (upon completion of a CAPTCHA, so you may need to register using <a href="https://app.element.io">Element Web</a>).</p>

<p>A Minimal, simple, multi-platform chat client for the Matrix protocol.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alariej:matrix.org">JFA</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quadrix v1.4.5 has been released and is available for mobiles and desktops in the respective app stores (Google Play, App Store, Mac App Store, Microsoft, Snap Store, Flathub).</p>
<p>The main improvement in this release is the added support for the .well-known API call, which allows to register and login on homeservers using a base domain URL.</p>
<p>Also, the displaying of redacted and edited messages has been improved.</p>
<p>I started testing Quadrix on the Conduit server implementation (thanks to @timo:conduit.rs for a test account on conduit.rs) and noticed right away some major issues. A few fixes are already included in this release.</p>
<p>Finally, for PinePhone users, the Ozone/Wayland switch has now been disabled in the flatpak build for Phosh, because of a compatibility issue between Electron and the on-screen keyboard. On Phosh, the app now runs in XWayland mode (it looks blurry) but at least the OSK works.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As already mentioned, the Apple Silicon builds are now properly packaged.</p>
<p>Additionally we fixed the pagination issues in our search and you should now be able to find more messages. As part of that we also optimized a few database queries again to reduce disk load when running Nheko (which became more noticeable after we enabled some durability flags on the database last week).</p>
<p>There have also been more fixes to the pushrules code. Test code now outnumbers the actual implementation by 4:1. As an additional feature, we do highlight messages marked as &quot;highlight&quot; via a pushrule (i.e. when someone mentions you) in the timeline by adding a red outline.</p>
<p>As part of the push work I also implemented and fixed a few things in Synapse related to pushrules. If replies are not highlighted for you currently, it might be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14356">this bug</a>. A longer term fix will be <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3664">MSC3664</a>, which <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11804">I also implemented</a>.

<p>Hello from Nordeck üëã This week we finally released the first of our widgets as open source: It's the <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-poll">matrix-poll-widget</a>.</p>
<p>The widget allows to conduct polls in Matrix rooms. But unlike <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/travis/msc/polls/proposals/3381-polls.md">MSC3381</a> it is designed for more complex scenarios, like polls with multiple parties in a council. You have full control over your data, as it's stored in your Matrix room. It is currently in use in the German public sector.
The widget is built using TypeScript, React, and the <code>matrix-widget-api</code>. We also extracted a thin layer of code that is shared between our widgets into our <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit"><code>matrix-widget-toolkit</code></a>, another project we made open source recently. Our remaining widgets will follow in the next couple of weeks. We keep you updated here.</p>

We will wait for the 3.0.0 release until we have implemented the Matrix 1.4 spec changes (<code>m.replace</code> will be really hacky due to a - in my opinion - <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/client-server-api/#server-side-replacement-of-content">spec bug</a>).</p>
<h2 id="support-realm-database">Support realm database</h2>
<p>We now support realm as a database backend. This allows you to use Trixnity on iOS with a persistent database.</p>
<h2 id="added-exchangeable-mediastore">Added exchangeable MediaStore</h2>
<p>Media is not saved into the database anymore, but in an exchangeable <code>MediaStore</code>. It is also streamed, so you can download and upload large files. There is <code>trixnity-client-media-okio</code> for a multiplatform file based implementation.</p>
<h2 id="improved-stateflowcache">Improved StateFlowCache</h2>
<p>The <code>StateFlowCache</code>, which basically is a reactive cache on top of an arbitrary database does not need a <code>CoroutineScope</code> parameter for any read or write operation anymore. It was needed to react to the lifecycle of the consumer, so that not used data could be removed from the cache. This was really error prone, because if the consumer passed a wrong <code>CoroutineScope</code> with a too long lifecycle, the cache could grow unlimited. We figured out to solve this with Kotlin <code>Flow</code>s, so everything is lazy and the lifecycle can be determined from the Flow consumer!</p>
<p>We also fixed a long standing bug, which could cause to return a <code>Flow</code>, which does not emit updated values.</p>
<h2 id="power-level-caluculation-support">Power level caluculation support</h2>
<p>We implemented some functions to calculate power levels (e. g. <code>canBanUser(...)</code>).</p>
<h2 id="naming-change-of-classes-and-interfaces">Naming change of classes and interfaces</h2>
<p>We changed the naming of all interfaces from <code>IXyz</code> to <code>Xyz</code> and the implementation of it from <code>Xyz</code> to <code>XyzImpl</code></p>
<h2 id="server-api-improvements">Server-API improvements</h2>
<p>We made some improvements to the various server APIs to allow implementing proxies filtering requests and responses.</p>
