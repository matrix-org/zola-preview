<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3442">MSC3442: move the prev_content key to unsigned</a></li>

<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>The actual spec changes for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2844">MSC2844: Global version number for the whole spec</a> have now been merged [<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3420">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3421">two</a>]. You can take a look at <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/#specification-versions">this section</a> of the unstable spec to now see an explanation of the Matrix spec version numbering scheme.</p>
<p>Additionally, take a look at the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/client-server-api/#rooms-1">Client-Server API</a>, where all current APIs have been bumped from <code>/r0/...</code> to <code>/v3/...</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/old_master/proposals/2844-global-versioning.md#endpoint-versioning">this bit of MSC2844</a> for the rationale behind this change.</p>
<p>The pieces are starting to fall into place for the upcoming Matrix 1.1 spec release!</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1840">MSC1840: Typed rooms</a>!</p>
<p>This is a concept that was used in the Spaces MSCs to allow servers and clients to denote a room as a Space vs. a typical Matrix room (and set up their UI appropriately). Only the type for a Space has been specified so far, but there are many different applications room types could serve; for example profile rooms!</p>
<p>This MSC aims to create a general concept for a typed room, whereas future MSCs would identify those types and their meaning.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happy Friday! The Synapse team has been sorting out what we hope to accomplish before the end of the year, and it's looking like our main focus will remain research and experimentation towards making large room joins go very fast. We don't yet see an incremental path from where we are now to where we want to end up, so progress will likely come as a few discrete milestones, rather than a gradual acceleration over time.</p>
<p>Aside from room joins, we expect to spend a good bit of time time on bug fixes and preventative maintenance. For example, we hope to get Sydent passing <code>mypy --strict</code> by this time next week. Doing so would have prevented recent production issues, including one which caused phone number verification to silently fail.</p>
<p>Preparations for releasing 1.45.0 continue apace; I'm loking forward to telling you about it next week!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Making steps towards stable E2EE, we have now implemented bootstrapping cross-signing on a new account. This allowed me to finally enable cross-signing on my Nico (nheko.im) account (which I intended to only use with Nheko). Thulinma also added a way to refresh the current device list as well as highlighting your current device in the device list, which should make it easier to recover, if a misscommunitcation with the server lead to an outdated device list. Meanwhile LorenDB has been plugging away on converting more dialogs to Qml and we merged like 3 converted dialogs!</p>

<p>Can you believe we didn‚Äôt have a dept. of Widgets yet? We do now!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks! This week I took a bit of time out of my day to create a new widget for Matrix. We have the concept of &quot;Spanners&quot; at Matrix where one person wants to take control of a resource, and they will say &quot;I am taking the spanner&quot;. This prevents other people (verbally at least) from trying to use the resource at the same time.</p>
<p>For years we have been getting by with sending messages into Matrix, but no more! For now anyone can use the Spanner widget to set up a similar system in their room.</p>
<p>You can try this out now with <code>/addwidget https://half-shot.uk/spanner?spannerName=YourSpannerName</code> (although no promises about the uptime of half-shot.uk)</p>
<p>The repo can be found https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-spanner-widget.</p>
<p>You will need to ensure that all users who plan to use it must be able to send state events of type <code>uk.half-shot.spanner</code>. Otherwise, it should be ready to go!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@janshai:beeper.com">janshai</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rager is a CLI tool for matrix client developers to easily view and parse rageshake logs. It handles syncing (with many parameters to sync only the logs you want), searching through downloaded logs, and paging through any log on your device (with peudo-syntax highlighting to make it easier to understand), right from the comfort of your terminal. It has been in development for a few months (being used/tested by devs at <a href="https://www.beeper.com">beeper.com</a>) but I feel like it's now in a good enough state to release for everyone else to use. If it's something that may help you, try it out and let me know if it works for you!</p>

<p>Hi everyone! </p>
<p>We believe that having your own homeserver should be easy and require little technical knowledge. That's why we launched <a href="https://hingst.net">Hingst</a>, a privacy focused Matrix hosting service which takes care of (almost) everything for you. </p>
<p>Our goal is that our users spend no time whatsoever on maintaining the actual server so they can focus on what matters - chatting with friends and colleagues. </p>
<p>All servers are located in Sweden and of course they run entirely on renewable energy! </p>
<p>That's all for now. Thanks for reading :)</p>

<p>This week, I had the great pleasure of chatting with a lovely bunch from Element about Spaces. <a href="https://element.io/blog/spaces-blast-out-of-beta/">This feature just got out of beta</a> and they tell us all about it.</p>

<h3 id="the-spec">The Spec</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello TWIM, it's me, not-anoa, again with your weekly spec update. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to figure out how to run the tooling which generates fancy graphs, but it looks like you'll have a more qualified person next week üòá</p>
<p>This week we saw a couple new MSCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a> - Letting guests do more things (which is needed for things like full mesh conference calling)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3429">MSC3429</a> - A room preview API. Turns out this is more or less a duplicate of another MSC, but has a different approach. Be sure to check both out üôÇ</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also been making progress on trying to get the spec release out by formally specifying all the new global version numbering and new endpoint versioning (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3420">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3421">this</a>), and have been <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3432">experimenting</a> with how room versions are represented by the spec.</p>
<p>From page 6 of the open MSCs there's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2723">MSC2723</a>. The MSC is relatively small, but solves a fairly important problem with forwarded messages in Matrix: where were they forwarded from? From a glance, it has minor technical feedback and could do with an implementation (psst: client authors, this should be easy and fit well into a North American Long Weekend project üòá).</p>
<p>That's all I have for you today, but if I've missed something: sorry, and you should be in capable hands next week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week I have completely rewritten the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone">Pinecone</a> router with the aim of improving code quality and boosting performance. It now uses significantly less resources, making it much easier to simulate larger networks and using less battery power on mobile devices.</p>
<p>While there is still some work to be done to ensure the Pinecone network gracefully handles large-scale mobility events, protocol development is slowly progressing and we will soon be looking at how Matrix federation can be made more efficient by using routing intelligence from the overlay network.</p>
<p>If you have a passion for routing protocols and/or peer-to-peer systems, we're looking to hire engineers to work in the P2P Matrix space ‚Äî get in touch by <a href="mailto:elementio@jobs.workablemail.com">emailing your resume to us</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/05/synapse-1-44-0-released">released Synapse 1.44</a> this week! The release was mainly focused on bug fixes and internal cleanups. In particular, we've made significant strides toward enforcing static type annotations across several more Synapse modules, we continue to remove &quot;magic&quot; code from our configuration handler, and we've landed significant refactors to both the user directory and federated event authentication. These changes pay off significant technical debt, reduce Synapse's maintenance cost, and ease future bug fixes.</p>
<p>But that's not all. This release also includes performance improvements around JSON serialization, new capabilities for extension modules, and better metrics around cache evictions. See <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/05/synapse-1-44-0-released">the announcement</a> for more details.</p>

<p><a href="https://schildi.chat/">SchildiChat</a> is a fork of Element that focuses on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list for both direct messages and groups, which is a more familiar approach to users of other popular instant messengers.</p>
<p>Both the Web/Desktop and the Android variant have received a couple of new features during the last weeks, so it's time again to share some of the highlights with you!</p>
<h4 id="web-desktop">Web/Desktop</h4>
<p>The Web/Desktop variant has received plenty of love for the last few weeks, so best to list some of the bigger changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a setting for the room list style: you can now choose between &quot;roomy&quot; with big avatars and two-line previews, &quot;intermediate&quot; for a smaller avatar and a single line preview, or &quot;compact&quot; to get a tiny avatar and the room preview in the same line of the room name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a setting how to color usernames in the chat: either uniform, based on the MXID, or based on the user's power level (Android has this feature for some time already, too!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a setting to not open automatically the most recent chat when switching spaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved theme settings: you can now choose custom themes independently for both light and dark mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workaround for switching between light and dark mode together with the system on Linux</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>macOS builds are now signed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>... and many more (read the release announcements on <a href="https://github.com/SchildiChat/schildichat-desktop/releases">GitHub</a> or join our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#schildichat-web-announcements:matrix.org">announcement room (#schildichat-web-announcements:matrix.org)</a> to stay informed)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A CLI tool for creating and revoking tokens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hooks for new messages, message edits</p>

Those URLs are not quite following the RFC but are accepted widely enough to warrant a fix, and a new release.

<h4 id="an-unofficial-matrix-server-for-the-newgrounds-community">An (unofficial) Matrix server for the Newgrounds community.</h4>
<p>Since I was pressed for time last week, I didn't go much in depth on how this server works. Here is a brief overview of its components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>https://app.ngmvs.one: A self-hosted Element Web with some theming tweaks, and the easiest way to visit the server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>https://matrix.ngmvs.one: the homeserver itself (Synapse). It has open registration, but only for <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/supporter">Newgrounds Supporters</a> (ie. patrons) via SSO logins with Newgrounds accounts. But Newgrounds doesn't have its own &quot;Log in with Newgrounds&quot; capability, so that leads me to the next component:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs/ng-saml-idp">ng-saml-idp</a>: middleware built on <a href="https://pysaml2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PySAML2</a> for using Newgrounds logins as a SAML2 Identity Provider. The code is tailored for my Synapse installation, but it can easily be tweaked to allow Newgrounds SSO logins to any SAML2-compatible service!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs/wbot">W-Bot</a>: a Matrix appservice/bot built on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python">mautrix-python</a> that serves two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Creates Matrix rooms for Newgrounds movie/game submission pages (ie. maps <code>#portal_view_&lt;ID&gt;:ngmvs.one</code> to <code>https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/&lt;ID&gt;</code>), and adds a widget containing the submission itself to these rooms (but only if it's a movie--widgets for games will only have a link)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restricts membership of any room it moderates to logged-in Newgrounds Supporters. Users without a :ngmvs.one account can authenticate to the bot via the &quot;login&quot; bot command, which lets them log into their Newgrounds account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Point 2 also means that anyone on the Matrix network can make a room that's restricted to Newgrounds Supporters. Just make sure the bot has a high enough power level to kick users!</p>
<p>Public (and federation-accessible) instance is at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@w-bot:ngmvs.one">@w-bot:ngmvs.one</a>.</p>
<p>(PS: The &quot;W&quot; stands for &quot;double&quot;--because of its job of &quot;copying&quot; rooms into Matrix.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/newgrounds-mvsx/">MVSX</a>: a Firefox extension that, when visiting a Newgrounds movie/game submission page, puts a button in the URL bar that sends you to the Matrix room created for that submission by W-Bot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This week's updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>W-Bot now has the <code>inviteme</code> command to invite the issuing user to the invite-only space room for logged-in Newgrounds Supporters. (Users should be invited there automatically, but this command is for people who leave / reject invites to that space &amp; want to re-join it later.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MVSX extension has been updated to allow joining rooms with Matrix clients other than <a href="https://app.ngmvs.one/">app.ngmvs.one</a>. Right-clicking the URL bar icon now shows a drop-down list of alternative clients, and lets you set which one to use by default (on left-clicks of the icon).</p>

There should hopefully be rooms for everything now, although a few are still missing room icons - that will come over the next days. Here‚Äôs to hoping that the retro computing community can also thrive outside of Discord üòÅ.&quot;</strong></p>

<h2 id="dept-of-spec-scroll">Dept of Spec üìú</h2>
<h3 id="the-spec">The Spec</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! It is not-anoa here with the spec update this week, which unfortunately means no pretty graph of MSCs (sorry). I do however have some curated updates to the spec for you:</p>
<p>This week we saw a couple new MSCs get opened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3417">WIP: MSC3417: Call room room type</a> from SimonBrandner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3414">WIP: MSC3414: Encrypted state events</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Though WIP, both are exciting steps towards much larger goals - looking forward to see how they progress! We also saw FCP finish on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC3231: Token authenticated registration</a>, part of Callum's <a href="https://calcuode.com/matrix-gsoc/">GSOC project</a> this summer - congratulations! <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a> also finished FCP this week, making it a good time for clients to consider that access tokens might expire or appear in a different format in upcoming versions of the spec. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2582">MSC2582: Remove mimetype from EncryptedFile object</a> was also merged to the spec - thanks Sorunome for finding the duplicated field which was duplicated!</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the Spec Core Team (SCT) has been thinking about how we can release the spec as we've been talking about doing so for months. We're declaring a bit of a freeze on new things entering the spec for the time being, but that doesn't stop MSCs from completing FCP or being opened - they just might miss the v1.1 cut (sorry). Most of the work needed to release is deployment stuff rather than Matrix stuff, so the hope is is we can get it all worked out soon.</p>
<p>I don't have the random MSC script on hand, but I do have access to the MSC list and found <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">WIP: MSC3030: Jump to date API endpoint</a>. It's listed as work in progress, but is one of the MSCs I personally look forward to being accepted in time!</p>
<p>That's all for spec this week. I'm not sure about next week, but you might be stuck with me again. Maybe I can find those fancy graph tools in time...</p>

<p>Thanks a lot not-anoa, that was a great spec update!</p>

<h3 id="slack-bridge-1-9-0-rc1-with-a-psa">Slack bridge 1.9.0-rc1, with a PSA</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks, it's been a while since we released changes to the Slack bridge but here we are on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/1.9.0-rc1">our next RC</a>. This one includes a few new things, most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The bridge now automatically invites users to private rooms if there is a message and they are not joined. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/613">#613</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update bridge to matrix-appservice-bridge 3.1.0 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/614">#614</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, a PSA: If you were struggling to bridge your rooms to matrix while using the matrix.org bridge, this should now be fixed. An update made to the Slack APIs silently broke the oauth flow, which has since been fixed. This was a misconfiguration-gone-unnoticed in our Slack app configuration, so self hosters don't need to upgrade. The details are in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/617#issuecomment-932047990</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I am a bit busy at the moment, Nheko is getting a lot of valuable smaller contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Updated the emoji pickers to Unicode 14, so that you can properly troll people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pasting images should now work properly again on Windows and macOS, including pasting SVGs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The help and version command line parameters now work properly, even if an instance of Nheko is already running.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There has also been a lot of progress on the translations! We just cracked 50% translated, but since that includes a lot of languages with only a few percent, this is actually much more than it sounds! We actually have 8 languages with over 90% translations now. If you speak one of the languages at 70% or so, any help translating the remaining bits is very much appreciated. You can easily translate without an account here: https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/#translations If you want to translate without having to rely on the upvote mechanism, feel free to ask for translation permissions directly in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a>. That is also the right room to ask questions about the translation process or translations themselves.</p>
<p>Nheko is also participating at Hacktoberfest this year. Translations done using the webinterface won't get counted for that though, you would need to submit a pull request manually for that. If you always felt like contributing to Nheko would be fun, but you had no reason to, now you can do it to let someone plant a tree for you (or get a T-shirt)!</p>
<p>That's all, I need to get back on my train!</p>

<h3 id="hydrogen">Hydrogen</h3>
<p>A minimal Matrix chat client, focused on performance, offline functionality, and broad browser support. https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hydrogen saw a few bug fixes (<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.14">0.2.14</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.15">0.2.15</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.16">0.2.16</a>) this week again, and also gained the possibility to recover from low-storage scenarios where the browser would clear indexedDB.</p>
<p>One of the bugs fixed might have caused a timeline corruption, so when you get the 0.2.16 update the history cache will be cleared and you'll notice a bit of delay as you do an initial sync again.</p>
<p>Aside from working on Hydrogen as a standalone app, I'm also making it easier to embedded in other projects. More info to come on that!</p>
<p>We've also had a priority planning this week, which spawned an updated backlog. <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/projects/1">Have a look</a> if you're interested what can be expected next (although be aware that the backlog has proven volatile in the past üôÇ).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After 4 years, <a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-email-bot">matrix-email-bot</a> finally got an update. Now at v2, the bot has been rewritten using TypeScript and matrix-bot-sdk (farewell, js-sdk from 2017). It still requires manual setup and the behaviour overall should be the same as before, though the amount of testing is somewhat minimal - please complain in #email:t2bot.io if something goes wrong. </p>
<p>The bot also now supports encrypted rooms out of the box, including on the t2bot.io instance. Check out <a href="https://t2bot.io/emailbot/">t2bot.io/emailbot</a> for information on how to get the bot set up in your room.</p>

<h3 id="newgrounds-mvs-matrix-advancement-server">Newgrounds MVS (Matrix adVancement Server)</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mr_johnson22:matrix.org">mr_johnson22</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An (unofficial) Matrix server by and for the <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a> community.</p>
<p>This is a Matrix server with membership restricted to <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/supporter">Newgrounds Supporters</a>. Newgrounds is an independent arts &amp; entertainment site that has been around for over 20 years, and I felt that its spirit of independence is a perfect match with the openness of Matrix!</p>
<p>The most notable feature of the server is <em>comment rooms for Newgrounds submissions</em>. Unlike other content-sharing sites, Newgrounds submissions don't have comment sections, but <em>review</em> sections, which let you post a single comment (and optional rating) for a submission. This encourages reviews to be focused on providing constructive feedback instead of being a place for off-topic discussions. With that said, open comment systems are nice too, so this Matrix server provides it! Simply visit <code>#portal_view_SUBMISSION_ID:ngmvs.one</code> to view!</p>
<p>These comment rooms are world-visible, but (at least for the time being) only Newgrounds Supporters may join these rooms &amp; post comments in them.</p>
<p>To help along with this, I made a Firefox extension to make joining these rooms a breeze: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/newgrounds-mvsx/">NG MVSX</a>. Simply view a Newgrounds submission page, and click on the icon that appears in your URL bar!</p>
<p>Code for all components is open-sourced on <a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs">GitLab</a>.</p>
<p>This is all very new, so things might break! If they do, tell me in <code>#ngmvs-public-discussion:ngmvs.one</code></p>

<h3 id="the-latest-in-appservice-proposals-synthetic-events">The latest in appservice proposals: Synthetic events</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, I've been let loose on more spec things: This time I'm looking at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">synthetic events</a>. The goal with this proposal is to give appservices more visibility over the innards and actions of a homeserver. When a user registers, we want an appservice to know (perhaps to send them a little greeting, or to provision some resources) or perhaps you want to clear up bridge resources when the user deactivates their account.</p>
<p>The hope with this proposal is that it's going to set the foundations for services to be able to hook into and provide richer functionality based upon user actions outside of rooms. It might sound a little dry right now, but eventually I'm hoping this can be extended in lots of ways and potentially do away with per-implementation modules, instead writing services that work with all homeservers.</p>
<p>Please give the proposal some love/feedback :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When asked if that was a specification change he drafted because of limitations faced when trying to implement a bridge, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, so it's something I've been plotting for a while, but internally we wanted the ability to &quot;act&quot; based upon signups to a homeserver i.e. sending a welcome. In the past this has been implemented client-side in Element, but that has obvious caveats.</p>
<p>The traditional response has usually been to write a Synapse module, but I wanted to do something that could be used on other homeserver implementations and also not have to have it co-located with the homeserver, so the natural home for this kind of logic was appservices. </p>
<p>There are other things there too like logouts / deactivations which are good for erasing data on a service too. Generally I'm hoping it can be extended further once it's stable, for other use cases too</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3401">MSC3401</a> (Native Group Voip Signalling) has been receiving positive feedback over the course of the week. The MSC spells out how one would go about implementing native, decentralised group voice and video calls over Matrix without the need for a third-party service. This is the next step forward after the full-mesh group signalling work, as demoed in previous editions of TWIM, lands. Quite exciting stuff!</p>
<p>Otherwise there was another Spec Core Team retro this week. Discussion focused mainly on how to handle event types that not every implementation using Matrix may need (think pinned messages and how that might not be very useful for IoT networks...). Watch this space!</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2666">MSC2666: Get rooms in common with another user</a>!</p>
<p>This is actually already implemented and enabled by default in Synapse, believe it or not. But no clients have support for it yet (there is an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/4897">outstanding matrix-react-sdk PR</a>...).</p>
<p>This is a pretty cool feature in my opinion, any client want to be the first?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/09/21/synapse-1-43-0-released">released Synapse 1.43</a>! This mainly contains internal changes, including those in preparation for Spaces leaving beta, but it's worth calling out that this version of Synapse now uses the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: room version capabilities</a> API to ask clients to prefer <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">room version 9</a> when creating restricted rooms.</p>
<p>Support for room version 9 was introduced in Synapse 1.42, so we'd strongly encourage administrators to upgrade.</p>
<p>Perhaps more notably for Synapse developers, we've spent quite a lot of time over the past few weeks improving the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/">SyTest</a> suite of integration tests. Several of the tests had race conditions which would cause them to occasionally fail when testing a multi-worker deployment of Synapse. These flakey tests have plagued our continuous integration pipelines, and are finally being fixed.</p>
<p>The long term plan is still to transition to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a> (written in Go) and away from SyTest (written in Perl), but we still need to ensure that SyTest is reliable in the meantime.</p>

<p>Hi there,
Didn't post updates about the etke.cc service for a while. If somebody not familiar - we setup and maintain matrix servers (based on awesome <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>)... and setup VPN... and DNS recursive resolver, and... AND!!!! Provide hosting, yes. So, starting today that's available for everyone (we offer it for some time in &quot;well, you know, we don't provide hosting, but if you want it so hard...&quot; way and it works good)</p>
<p>Even with that update (literally the most requested thing, was in every third order we got), provided hosting considered as your own server, the only difference that you don't pay hosting provider directly, but through us. So, you get root access to the server and we treat it as any other customer's infrastructure</p>

<p>What improvements did hifi bring to the formatting you may ask? I asked, and hifi answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the fallbacks are inconsistent and usually are markdown which is a lie üòÖ
replies and mentions are completely all over the place in the fallback in addition to being markdown 
the unformatted html is now something in between and doesn't do code blocks at all because those ticks are just noise on irc 
it tries to look like more that you pasted long text rather than sending markdown </p>

<p>That's very considerate for IRC user, thanks hifi!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3394">MSC3394: New auth rule that only allows someone to post a message in relation to another message</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs are in FCP.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>If MSC2918 above is giving you feelings of d√©j√† vu, don't worry. It already had FCP proposed, but due to a resolved concern being incorrectly processed by mscbot on github, a new FCP proposal was carried out.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> (Polls - mk II) receive a fair amount of attention this week. It implements inline polls via a new <code>m.poll</code> type and makes use of the concept of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">extensible events</a>. Do check it out if you're interested in voting through means other than message reactions!</p>
<p>Otherwise Alexandre Franke and myself will be looking at cleaning up the CI of the matrix-org/matrix-doc repo next week, as well as continue to move the infrastructure for the new spec release forwards.</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1235">MSC1235: Proposal for Calendar Events</a>.</p>
<p>This one is entirely new to me, and has some slight overlap with some work for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2762">MSC2762: Allowing widgets to send/receive events</a>, where we were thinking about how a widget could act as a calendar using Matrix rooms and events as a calendar backend.</p>

<p>The Synapse team is busy gearing up for 1.43.0 next week, which will make room version 9 the default for newly created <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>We've also been doing quite a lot of work on Sydent. Notably, last week's 2.4.0 release introduced a few regressions which have been resolved in subsequent point releases. The one-shot <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/v2.4.3/docs/casefold_migration.md">case folding migration script</a> for Sydent is still performing unexpectedly slowly; look for that to be resolved soon.</p>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, now is a good time to ensure you're ready for the deprecation of PostgreSQL 9.6 (November) and Python 3.6 (December). Do you have plans to upgrade to Pg 10 and Py 3.7 or newer? If not, there's no time like the present! üóì</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko got a lot more colorful this week. red_sky (nheko.im) and LorenDB finished up the jdenticon support. This means instead of the first character of a users display name, you now have the option to see a colorful avatar for users without an explicit avatar. You may have seen something similar on Github and other platforms. Currently this needs the <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/qt-jdenticon">qt-jdenticon</a> plugin, which is a bit troublesome to install correctly, but we should improve that in the near future.</p>
<p>Prezu added a homeserver entry field to the room directory, making it much more useful (no history yet though). Thulinma added a /goto command to navigate to specific events or room and fixed scrolling to a specific event (in the past it only approximately scrolled to the right location). Symphorien added the Alt+A shortcut to navigate between rooms with active mentions and notifications. Additionally Priit completed the Estonian translation.</p>
<p>Additionally we released a security fix on Monday (together with a few other clients). We only released a fix for the master branch in Nheko instead of also the latest stable release. This confused a few people, but I hope my explanations made sense. The gist of it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the master branch the local homeserver admin could force Nheko to forget which identity keys it saw for a user and as such insert a new device with the same device id, but attacker controlled identity keys and request old encryption keys from Nheko. In Nheko's case we had some protections against that, but if the server sent a device_list.left event for that user, Nheko would delete those protections. From our understanding this could not be abused over federation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 0.8.2 this can also be abused, but 0.8.2 does not implement key sharing completely. It can only forward the currently in use encryption key, not historical ones. As such the impact in our opinion was too limited to release a security fix. 0.8.2 does not allow you to send encrypted messages only to verified devices as such the homeserver admin could always insert just a different device to get access to new encrypted messages. Because of that we have a big warning in the README and when enabling encryption in 0.8.2, that one should not rely on the security of the E2EE implementation in it. We are aiming to have stable and secure E2EE in the next release (and so far it is looking good), but if you are using 0.8.2 I can only repeat, that it won't protect you from an attacker even without the disclosed security issue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this clears up some of the confusion. Feel free to visit us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> and tell me, that I am wrong.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca">uhoreg</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week saw two releases of libolm, a library that implements olm, megolm, and some other Matrix-related encryption functions.  The main changes in version 3.2.5 are new functions for getting error codes rather than error strings so that implementations don't need to rely on string parsing to decode errors, and added support for fallback keys in the Android and iOS bindings.  There were also improvements in error handling in the  unpickling functions, and the shared library no longer exports certain private symbols, which caused problems when those same symbols were exported by other libraries.  The initial implementation of this last change caused build failures in some environments, so version 3.2.6 was released to fix this.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am super happy to finally give you another update on TheBoard, due to holidays during the last weeks I had less time to work on TheBoard. But now there still accumulated enough changes for a little Update:</p>
<p>I experimented what technologies I could use for the still required GUI elements. A new User List was implemented using Vue.js. Vue seemed to be a little overkill for the kind of GUI required in the case of TheBoard. So I re-implemented the user list with react-no-js.
I am happy with <strong>react-no-js</strong> and it is used for a <strong>user list plus a tool settings menu</strong> on the right hand side of the canvas.</p>
<p>The tool panel in particular opens up a lot of possibilities. The eraser already makes use of it by giving the option to only delete specific item types (Image, stroke or text). This can be very handy if you want to delete strokes drawn on top of an image without deleting the image as well. What can be deleted is highlighted by a new <strong>filter system</strong> which allows to make any modification to objects selected by a filter function (see the attached image)</p>
<p>Other small changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Animated camera movement (for a upcoming &quot;follow other user&quot; feature) currently used for the Go Home Button</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opening a board now loads at the last edited location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The touchscreen navigation (zoom/pan) was re-implemented and should now work much better</p>

<p>The Board is very exciting! I could see in <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard#planned-use-cases">the planned use cases</a> that Timo already intends to make a widget out of it. It would be very useful for real-time collaboration, but that's not all! When asked if a standalone app will come, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo</a> confirmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed. I wasn't thinking about a builtin home-server yet. But a standalone app is still planned because I want the app to be able to manage different boards. Therefore I need to be able to control room creation and listing rooms. It should basically feel like onenote if you intend to use it like that.</p>

<p>@s7evink The game is called AAGRINDER, hosted at <a href="https://aagrinder.xyz">aagrinder.xyz</a>, the code is <a href="https://gitlab.com/MRAAGH/aagrinder">here</a>, the bridge implementation is <a href="https://gitlab.com/MRAAGH/aagrinder/-/blob/main/server/matrixappservice.js">here</a>, wiki is <a href="https://wiki.aagrinder.xyz/index.php?title=Main_Page">here</a>. The game is a text-based sandbox multiplayer browser game that I (Maze) have been building for the past 3 years. Built from nothing, no game engine. It generates an infinite procedural terrain to venture in. The integrated chatbox is nothing special but it's really nice to have it bridged to Matrix now, it's less lonely when playing alone. The appservice bridge creates users matching player name and color. Display names from Matrix are presented in the same color as in Element.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension">Dimension</a>, an integration manager alternative for Element, got a refresh from @TimeWalker to bring the project up to modern day standards. Please give it a go if you've been running Dimension, and report bugs if there's problems! While I haven't personally had time to maintain it as much as I'd like, it's great to see people taking on 3 year old bad code and fixing it üòÑ</p>
<p>For TWIM readers, Dimension is an &quot;integration manager&quot; that replaces the default one shipped with Element. It's not entirely mobile-ready yet, but does give a user interface for managing various bots, bridges, and widgets. In practice, an integration manager isn't needed as most bots and bridges (and even widgets) can be set up without an integrations manager, like all of https://t2bot.io/ (ironically, given Dimension was originally targeted at t2bot.io). People do still use it though to configure self-hosted platforms with their very own Element, Synapse, bridges, and bots. </p>
<p>While I still probably won't have much time personally to maintain it, PRs are certainly accepted. Dimension is a bit complex to work within and test, but people in #dimension:t2bot.io should be able to help out.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, we're massively pleased to announce the third major release of the TS/JS bridging library <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/3.0.0">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>. This release contains several large breaking changes to the previous way of life, most notably we have stopped using the matrix-js-sdk for most of our code, instead using the matrix-bot-sdk (Hi TravisR , we see you up there!).</p>
<p>There are several reasons why we went this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notably, this library focuses work on simply implementing APIs and bridge/bot logic. There is no additional cruft to support client use-cases or browsers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's historically had a brilliant coverage of the CS and AS APIs, and has been extremely flexible to add new stable and unstable APIs to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the start of this project, it was the only library with a complete Typescript coverage. Typescript types continue to be extremely useful to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're hoping to make use of the upcoming encrypted appservices support, to replace the slightly janky pantalaimon support the bridge library currently uses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to Travis and the matrix.org bridge team for working through these changes!</p>
<p>There are a bunch of common sense improvements that break API compatibility in this release also, so please be sure to check them out and update. We don't anticipate supporting 2.X except for extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll be updating the matrix-org suite of bridges over the coming weeks so please watch for bugs and let us know how we're doing!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You might remember my short story from last TWIM about the race between different translators? Seems like that one was good enough to motivate a few people to contribute translations. While those don't seem to be 100% complete yet, we saw a significant jump in translation percentages (especially Portuguese), so thank you to everyone who contributed to that!</p>
<p>Thulinma also made the whole userprofile scrollable, which improves the experience on small screens a lot. He also implemented message deduplication by event id, which is required by the spec to be done on the client side. This fixes a lot of duplicates when using conduit and your join event appearing 2~3 times on synapse.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue with how different homeservers update one time key counts and added some additional code to remove old one time keys, if we ever uploaded to many (which might have happened in the past in a few edge cases). We also now escape img tags in usernames correctly in more places, redundant date separators when paginating back in a room should not appear anymore and tastytea decreased the margins on blockquotes, so that they look less jarring and take up less space.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/patience">Patience</a>, a full stack integration testing approach for Matrix clients and servers, has added initial support for Hydrogen this week.

<p>This project is still in its early stages, but we hope to eventually have support for many different clients and then use it to test common flows like user verification, which can differ quite a lot across clients.

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>You may be wondering: what's up with all of these abandoned MSCs?? The answer is that the matrix-org/matrix-doc repo <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3367">changed its base branch</a> to <code>main</code> to help preserve the git history since the spec website rewrite. In doing so, all PRs were automatically updated to the new base branch by github... except those that were coming from deleted users and repos. Those ones were simply closed!</p>
<p>But as they seemed to be have been effectively abandoned by their authors, it was more of a cleanup than an accident. However, if your MSC was affected by this change and you would like to continue it, please contact someone in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-office:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-office:matrix.org</a> and we'll help you out.</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of this week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2448">MSC2448: Using BlurHash as a Placeholder for Matrix Media</a>!</p>
<p>MSC2448 defines a way for clients to include a &quot;blurhash&quot;, or a short, textual representation of a blurred version of an image, inside events which other clients can show while waiting for thumbnails to download from media servers. This replaces the potentially blank space while an image's thumbnail is loading with a (IMO) beautiful alternative!</p>
<p>Yes I wrote this MSC... but I swear it's what <a href="https://github.com/anoadragon453/pick-a-spec">the script</a> picked! We do not question the script!!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/08/31/synapse-1-41-1-released">Synapse 1.41.1 is out</a> and it contains patches for <strong>two security vulnerabilities</strong> which could inappropriately disclose private room metadata to unauthorized users on a participating homeserver. Please upgrade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">Room Version 9</a> is coming in Synapse 1.42 next week. This version fixes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3373">an oversight</a> in which event fields are protected from redaction in room version 8, making it possible for restricted rooms to break if a join event is redacted. Because event IDs are based on the redaction algorithm, we can't fix this without creating a new room version.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility across the federation, Synapse 1.42 will still instruct clients to create restricted rooms using room version 8. Synapse 1.43, scheduled for release on 21 September, will begin instructing clients to use room version 9 instead.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had a race between 3 Translators this week. All 3 of them were trying really hard, so in my opinion every placement is a first place, buuuuuut Thulinma actually came first by bringing the Dutch translation from 5% to 100%. A few hours later Priit came in as a close second updating the Estonian translation to 100%. ISSOtm noticed that and tried to catch up which resulted in a 3rd place finish for the French translation. Now I understand the excitement people feel watching others compete in sports without having to do anything themselves!</p>
<p>red_sky (nheko.im) meanwhile fought a much more difficult enemy, Apple documentation and code signing! To be honest, I expected him to be beaten, but Nheko's DMGs are now actually properly signed and notarized. So if you are on macOS, you should now see less ugly warnings when installing Nheko. All nightlies building of the master branch are signed as well as our future releases.</p>
<p>In more community contributions, resolritter fixed the right click menu not working on replies. So you can copy a link from a reply now by right-clicking it without having to scroll up. Thulinma fixed window alerts not working when using conduit, because Conduit does not implement the /notifications endpoint Nheko uses and he helped me debug and fix device lists not showing up when using Conduit as well as sessions always getting rotated in &quot;Send encrypted messages to verified devices only&quot; mode.</p>
<p>In our work to stabilize E2EE we also now require a proper secrets daemon running on Linux (and other platforms, but there it is always provided by the OS). This is used to store the pickle key as well as the cross-signing secrets, so that an attacker can't read the from the config file. We already used such a daemon before, but we failed silently and we didn't use it for the pickle key until now. So if this prevents you from running Nheko, please open an issue so that we can work on a solution. Those APIs can be really fickle so additional testing and feedback would help us out a lot!</p>
<p>Also exciting is that Nheko now supports playing encrypted audio and video files without storing a temporary unencrypted copy on disk as well as animated images like WebP and GIF! It took us a while to figure out a proper solution, but now you can send animated stickers and you will finally be able to understand why other people were lauging at still images. (We also had to fix some bugs in our sticker editor, where we didn't add the mimetype to the sticker info for that.)</p>
<p>Some more embarrassing news, I didn't know I was a moderator in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:fachschaften.org">#conduit:fachschaften.org</a>, so I happily pinged everyone in the room while discussing room mentions. To prevent that from happening in the future, Nheko now shows a red warning above the message input if you will be pinging the whole room to give you time to reconsider. If that is not enough to stop me from doing that, we might require confirmation before sending such messages in the future, but so far this seems to work. Pinging everyone by accident can really scare you and composing a message in Matrix shouldn't be scary!</p>
<p>I hope I didn't forget anything and please make sure you check out Conduit, since they are doing a great job in revealing bugs in Nheko!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/circles-ios">Circles</a> is a project to build a secure, end-to-end encrypted social network, using Matrix as the foundation.</p>
<h4 id="news">News</h4>
<p>We're getting very close to a real App Store launch.  The latest beta release this week is <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/cWuDwqpG">0.98</a>  This version might be The One!  So please, if you haven't tried Circles in a while, give this one a shot.  Also please share the link with any friends and family who you think might be interested.  The current signup token has plenty of slots for everyone.</p>
<p>If you want to see some activity in your circles, invite me to follow your Community circle and I'll invite you to follow back.  I'm @cvwright:kombucha.social.</p>
<h4 id="warning">WARNING</h4>
<p>If you've been using Circles with your own (non-Kombucha) server, you probably DO NOT WANT this version.  Support for bring-your-own-server will return very soon after our App Store launch.</p>
<h4 id="latest-updates">Latest updates</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Broke and then re-enabled new account signup.  Thanks to everyone who helped diagnose this one, and sorry if you were unable to sign up using a recent build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a weeks-old bug where posting a message into a circle would then send you back to your list of all your social circles.  Big thanks to Yosef for bringing this to my attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug in recent 0.9x builds where the Matrix rooms underlying circles and groups were being created with invalid encryption parameters.  If you've been unable to post anything, this is the likely culprit.  The fix is to update to the latest build, then delete your old circles/groups and create new ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have a new icon.  It's blue!  I was worried that Apple might think the old icon looked too much like the Apple Photos icon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New and improved interface for managing your account information.  Added support for changing your password and for deactivating your account.  I hope you never want this last one, but Apple requires it for apps that allow you to create accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed support for Markdown formatting in posts and image captions.  This is a sad one, but unfortunately the performance of the open source library that we were using for Markdown just wasn't up to the task.  On the bright side, our timelines load much more quickly now, and the scrolling should be much smoother.  Look for Markdown support to return with the release of iOS 15 later this year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another update to the Recent Activity list.  Now it should refresh itself automatically if/when it initially comes up empty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved layout and usability on iPad.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tobi_fh:matrix.org">tobi</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CoMatrix project enables the usage of the Matrix protocol (more precisely Matrix Client-Server API) for constrained IoT devices via CoAP and CBOR in a constrained network (e.g. a 802.15.4/6LoWPAN network).</p>
<p>CoMatrix provides a gateway, which ports Matrix to CoAP/CBOR/(DTLS). This gateway communicates with constrained IoT devices on one side via CoAP+CBOR and translates to the Matrix protocol on the other side (i.e. HTTP+JSON). CoMatrix also provides a client library (for RIOT-OS) which is a starting point to implement CoMatrix clients (for constrained devices) which are able to interact with Matrix homeservers via the gateway.</p>
<p>Currently CoMatrix supports the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sending of messages to a Matrix room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receiving the last message of a Matrix room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User registration at a Matrix Synapse HS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joining a Matrix room upon invitation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Login of a user at a Matrix Synapse HS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logout of a user at a Matrix Synapse HS</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@thejhh:matrix.org">thejhh</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have made a small 120k pipeline-agent software (including all dependencies except NodeJS v8)  which can run on multiple platforms (including OpenWRT) and takes pipeline work over the Matrix protocol. In the end it's going to be used to setup things like VPN connections between gateways. </p>
<p>We also have a commercial web portal almost published where one can create web apps and configure pipelines to process the results. And yes, the portal also uses Matrix as its persistent storage -- it was implemented using my Matrix CRUD Repository from last week :)</p>
<p>The agent software (pipeline-runner) is open source  and has zero (0) runtime dependencies except NodeJS, and available from here: https://github.com/sendanor/pipeline-runner -- It's still in early development, though.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2582">MSC2582</a> (Removing mimetype from EncryptedFile object) was one of those MSCs that were relatively small, but had been languishing for <em>ages</em>. Partly because it required client implementations to update, but also partly because one needed to go in after a while and actually confirm that all known clients had updated. @uhoreg took up the mantle on his own to do so, and as a result this MSC has hit FCP and is soon to be merged. Thank you!</p>

<p>Remember that this is only done in exchange for an access token, which is then used for all subsequent requests. Still though, I can see the merit!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el">Ement.el</a>, a Matrix client for Emacs, gained some more improvements this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multi-account support was merged, so you can now use multiple accounts at the same time.  You can even be in the same room in two different accounts, at the same time, in side-by-side windows (which is useful for testing).  (Note that existing users will need to log in again, because the format of the saved-session file changed.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rooms you have been invited to now show up in the rooms list, and you can join them by clicking a button in the room's buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypted rooms now display a warning in the header and suggest that users consider using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon/">Pantalaimon</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Membership events are now formatted more usefully, similar to Element's style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completion for room and user names and IDs is implemented using standard Emacs commands and bindings (i.e. <code>C-M-i</code> by default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last-read marker may be jumped to, even if it's at an earlier event that has not yet been retrieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emotes (i.e. <code>/me</code>-style messages) can be sent by pressing <code>e</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timestamps in the room list are shaded according to how &quot;hot&quot; (i.e. recently updated) the room is (see screenshot).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various small fixes and enhancements.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now supports uploading to online key backup and warns you before enabling it, that we don't recommend using the asymmetric version. If you update to one of the current builds (and or the next version), you will also experience a bit longer load times on first startup. That is because we force-cleared the cache to be able to handle the new goodies like spaces and sticker/emote-packs. In the best case, everything is seamless.</p>
<p>We also had contributions by various people:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>resolritter cleaned up that while tab moved you down most popup lists, it didn't move up when shift was pressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harmathy extended the FAQ to answer commonly asked questions like &quot;Does Nheko support E2EE&quot; or &quot;What commands are supported&quot;. Don't worry, we know most of you won't read that and will still answer that question when you undoubtedly come asking it again. We just can now be even more passive aggressive than just pointing at the right wiki page. Instead we will point at the FAQ now, which will point at the wiki!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thombles made the emoji completer behave more nicely. Instead of jumping to the bottom left corner before closing, it will now just close. It should also now behave correctly when selecting text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alfasi updated the install instructions for Gentoo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure we have ever seen that many new faces contributing to Nheko in a week, I'm pretty happy to see that!</p>

<h3 id="ruma">Ruma</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ruma.io/">Ruma</a> is a set of Rust library crates around Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org">jplatte</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been so long since our last update that I couldn't possibly list all of the individual changes, but here's a rough overview of the work since then (three months ago):</p>
<p>There's been loads of bug fixes, many compatibility improvements and at least one large refactoring. We've been much faster about releasing changes to crates.io after ruma 0.1.0, now we're already at ruma 0.4.0 (!);  the changes needed to upgrade are really not that significant though. Notable areas of improvement are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UIAA: No more stringly-typed auth type + map of properties. The <code>AuthData</code> enum that holds the authentication information clients send to servers now has one variant for every auth type defined in the spec.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event relations: These used to be serialized wrongly for encrypted events and were only (de)serializable as part of a larger event (making using them in custom ways impossible). Both of these issues were fixed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the GSoC coding period is over and our students have both written a blog post summarizing their work: <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/gsoc-coverage/">API Coverage project (Adam Blanchet)</a>, <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/gsoc-tools/">Tooling project (Devin Ragotzy)</a></p>
<p>If you want more detailed updates about Ruma, please watch <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">our repository</a>'s GitHub releases, since nobody in the project currently wants to write regular blog posts or TWIM updates (if you are interested in changing that, get in touch over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a>).</p>

While the main focus has been fixing bugs and sustaining the codebase, one significant highlight is that read receipts and fully read markers are distinguished now, which should improve interaction with other clients that has been treating them differently for quite some time now.

<p>Half-Shot's bridge notes this week</p>
<ul>
<li>GSOC! abbyck/Abhinav's email bridge</li>
<li>Bridge team has been busy, on the EMS side we've released Signal/WA for early bird testing.</li>
<li>Landmark changes in bridge libraries: we've released 3.0.0-rc1 of matrix-appservice-bridge. Both the IRC bridge and the Gitter bridge have tested it with great results.</li>
<li>Tadzik has been making massive gains on the IRC bridge, formatting tweaks and bugs being nailed.</li>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>Don't be mistaken by the rather empty list above, there were many PRs to the contents of the spec flying around this week! These include some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3336">further</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3343">contributions</a> from lukaslihotzki, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3339">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3340">clarifications</a> from dkasak and some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3350">spec</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3353">contributions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3349">tooling</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3351">documentation</a> additions from richvdh. Also a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3337">clarification</a> from uhoreg.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone for your PRs!</p>
<p>Otherwise, there has been a small amount of activity across the spectrum of MSCs this week. One MSC to call out is https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3283, which could do with some more input from the wider community.</p>
<h4 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h4>
<p>And finally, something fun. I've written <a href="https://github.com/anoadragon453/pick-a-spec">a small script</a> to pick a random MSC that people may or may not want to have a look at.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, we tagged the v0.5.0 release candidate, which contains two major advancements on the encryption front: support for server-side key backups and support for cross-signing. The addition of these features makes Dendrite significantly more user-friendly, as it is now possible to log out or share keys across devices without losing your conversations.</p>
<p>We'll be aiming to finalise this release next week. Stay tuned in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Sytest compliance currently sits at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 65%, up from 61% last time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 92%, same as last time</p>

<p>We are on track to release Synapse 1.41 next week. This version will use an unstable property proposed by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: Room version capabilities</a> to advertise to clients that they may create restricted rooms using Room Version 8, despite the default room version remaining at 6 for the time being.</p>
<p>This strikes a balance between the broad compatibility of an older default room version, while still making newer features available <em>when requested</em> at room creation time. However, from next week you are more likely to encounter v8 rooms, so please do ensure your homeserver is running at least 1.40.</p>
<p>I'd also like to tip my hat to Element employee Olivier, who has put in the work to ensure that tagged Sygnal releases are automatically built and uploaded to Docker Hub via GitHub Actions. Thanks, Olivier!</p>

<p>Focus is shifting to v2.0.0 which will be a major refactor. The 1.x series will at least receive bug fixes if not features. Do note that if you are using the master branch or latest tag for Docker it may cause a breaking change in the future when the work starts being merged. Highly suggest moving to version tags regardless of the deployment method. If you are using <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> it has been updated to v1.0.0 as of writing so pulling the latest master there is advised.</p>

<p>If the car wasn't enough, I bring more news! Our matrix.org bridge library, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> has had a total shakeup. Version <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/3.0.0-rc1">3.0.0-rc1</a> is out and with it comes the migration from the matrix-js-sdk to the matrix-bot-sdk. This is a massive change underneath that should result in faster performance, better typings and hopefully lower memory footprints too.</p>
<p>I'd encourage everyone using this library to update and see how well it works for you! The IRC and Gitter bridges have already experimented with this change and have seen good results, so I look forward to hearing feedback :)</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now shows you the verification status of all devices in a room as well as in the memberlist. This is important so you can tell, if an unverified device may get access to a message, if you send it. You can always disable sending messages to unverified devices for extra peace of mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>callum's work on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">Token Authenticated Registration</a> got merged! üéâ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manu's room directory (finally) got merged. This means you can now discover public rooms on your server and join them by clicking the room directory button, that Nheko had for 3 years but was disabled until now! Support for the room directories of other servers as well as filtering by network should come in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is now an &quot;Allow them in&quot; button on pending knocks in the timeline, joins via room membership in a different room now tell you, what user's server was used to sign off on the join and you can set a room to restricted or knock only. (You currently can't change the list of allowed servers though).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dialogs should now have a close button again on Windows, the emoji search field now clears on closing the emoji picker and we added a workaround for stickers not showing on Element iOS, because iOS can't display stickers without a thumbnail, even if a thumnail makes no sense for stickers. (We just copy the sticker url into the thumbnail url.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko can now download encryption keys from online key backup. Uploading to online key backup will come soon(tm).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are interested, I will talk about Nheko tomorrow (21.08. starting 16:10) at FrOSCon in the Matrix dev room. Make sure you check out the other talks too, if you speak German! https://programm.froscon.de/2021/events/2706.html</p>

<p><strong>Delight team</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This week, our web, iOS and Android engineers are all enjoying some time off. </li>
<li>On backend, we‚Äôve completed pagination of the Spaces Summary. This week, we‚Äôve been looking at performance improvements to the Summary API.</li>
<li>We intend to mark room Version 8 as the preferred version for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083 restricted rooms</a> on matrix.org and in Synapse 1.41 (due for release next week) via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244</a>. Once this change is made, Element clients will show UI to create restricted rooms within a Space, and prompt users to upgrade rooms if necessary when making them restricted.</li>
<li>Our design team is exploring some tweaks on how to make Spaces a little bit clearer and easier to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Web</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We released 1.8.1 which fixed some regressions with calls - sorry for any failed calls!</li>
<li>Work on our threads prototype continues. We‚Äôre hoping to have something to look at internally next week.</li>
<li><a href="https://sentry.matrix.org/sentry/riot-web/">Sentry</a> submission support has been added to Rageshakes. We expect to enable this on https://app.element.io next week.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Since element now landed voice message support I build a small maubot plugin which prevents audio and voice messages as those cannot yet get restricted by power level.</p>
<p>It starts by warning you via replies, after a configured amount of warnings goes over to kicking and after a certain amount of kicks it will ban you in the room the event was sent in.</p>
<p>The counter is global so if a user in room A runs out of warnings and the same user sents a voice message in room B where the bot is present the bot will ban the user also in room B without further warnings.</p>

<p>Howdy folks, it's been aaaaages since I've done mad little project but I had some LEGO and was bored on a Sunday. I present to you <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-poweredup">matrix-poweredup</a>! This is a little bot that connects to any LEGO PoweredUp devices (using the node-poweredup library). You can then start controlling the motors via Matrix, and have the sensors report back into the Matrix room. It's currently limited to a RC buggy I picked up over the weekend but it's very extendible. It also includes a web application to control things via a gamepad, if that's your bag.</p>
<p>There will be a little demo at the end of Matrix Live, so watch this space</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/circles-ios">Circles</a> is an iOS app for end-to-end encrypted secure social networking and sharing, built on top of Matrix.  Its goal is to provide a safe and convenient way for close friends and families to share things that they wouldn't post publicly -- e.g. for parents to safely share pictures of their kids.  You can also use it to share updates with your friends, without a creepy advertising company data mining every word.</p>
<p>Circles features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social &quot;wall&quot;-like functionality and timeline of friends' posts for each of your social circles, e.g. Friends, Family, Neighbors, Coworkers, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypted photo galleries</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recent updates to the Circles beta include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for use with any Matrix homeserver, including a new encrypted recovery and key backup mechanism that should be compatible with other Matrix clients like Element.  (<strong>Please note</strong>: For use with standard Matrix accounts, be sure to select &quot;Advanced options&quot; at login and enter your passphrase for key backup / recovery.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emoji reactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown formatting for text posts and image captions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better support for larger screens (iPad)</p>

<p>As a hobby, I built a website called <a href="https://digital-justice.com/">Digital Justice</a>. It's a website that explains in layman's terms what certain digital topics are <em>(like data sovereignty, software autonomy and abandonware continuity)</em> and why those topics matter.</p>
<p>I'll also write several articles related to digital rights. For now, there's three articles: one that explains <a href="https://digital-justice.com/articles/how-to-join-matrix.html">how to join Matrix</a>, one that explains <a href="https://digital-justice.com/articles/decentralize.html">how and why the government should strive towards decentralization</a>, and one that explains <a href="https://digital-justice.com/articles/skip-signal.html">why users should consider using Matrix instead of Signal</a>.</p>
<p>The website may be a bit too simple for privacy gurus who know their stuff, but it's meant as an accessible resource to help people understand why privacy matters.

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>Work on Spaces continues with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946</a> (Space Summary API), specifically revolving around how to paginate the summary. This has called into question how <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1898#issuecomment-896717689">pagination across Matrix works in general</a>, which is a prime target for refactoring - perhaps an upcoming consistent pagination MSC? :)</p>
<p>Otherwise, as listed above, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">MSC3289</a> (room v8) has merged! It brings with it the ability to grant the ability to join a room based on one's membership in another room. While the was originally conceived for allowing users that are part of one Space to be allowed to join rooms, it has been built upon in other creative ways. Such as in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3325">MSC3325</a>, where it could be used to make room upgrades more seamless!</p>
<p>And finally, a special thanks to Lukas Lihotzki for all of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Alukaslihotzki+sort%3Aupdated-desc+">their spec PRs</a> this week. They're been stellar!</p>

<p>Big news! <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/08/10/synapse-1-40-0-released">Synapse 1.40 is out</a> and it comes with support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3289">Room Version 8</a>! Version 8 includes &quot;<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>&quot; which are only visible and joinable by members of a specific Space (or via direct invitation). This finally makes it <em>useful</em> to use Spaces as containers for private rooms, like you might with a company, guild, or open source community. Once invited to the parent Space, members can join and discover the otherwise private rooms within. No more <code>/invite</code> spam every time you bring someone on board!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el">Ement.el</a>, a Matrix client for Emacs, continues to improve.  Some of the changes in the past week:</p>
<p><em>Additions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Messages may now be written in Org-mode syntax (a format similar to but more powerful than Markdown).  Internally, it's automatically converted to HTML and sent as the message's formatted body.  This supports nearly any HTML feature that Org-mode can export to, including rich text, bulleted and numbered lists, and even tables (this message is being written directly in Org syntax; see a table of new bindings at the end of this list).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An optional pop-out compose buffer makes writing and editing long messages easier (also being used for this message).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read/fully-read marker lines are now displayed after the last read message, and these are synced with the server and other clients.  These lines can also be placed with a command, making it easy to return to a certain event later, even on other clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usernames at the beginning of messages may optionally be colored to match the addressee's username.  This especially helps following conversations in busy rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ement.el is confirmed to work with Pantalaimon, the E2EE-aware reverse proxy, making encrypted rooms work transparently.  Once Pantalaimon is installed and configured, connecting through it with Ement.el is trivial, and this step is documented in the readme.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Improvements</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Per-user displayname and message colors have improved (and configurable) contrast ratio with the background color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reactions are sorted by the number of users who have sent each one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unread rooms are displayed more prominently in the room list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New default bindings make it quick to jump to the mentions and notifications buffers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync timeouts are handled more gracefully and Ement.el re-syncs automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various minor fixes and enhancements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And here's the new-bindings table, written directly in Org syntax and sent automatically as HTML:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Binding</th><th>Command</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>S-SPC</td><td>Scroll up</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-SPC</td><td>Move to last-read marker</td></tr>
<tr><td>C-k</td><td>Delete message</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-g M-l</td><td>Switch to room list buffer</td></tr>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You now get notified, if someone reuses a megolm session index, because that in theory could be used by an attacker to send seemingly verified messages. We also now render decryption errors more nicely and users can now explicitly request decryption keys (in addition to the automatic key requests in the background that already existed). We also fixed an issue, that could corrupt the database when using the flatpak and if you lost your network connection, Nheko should now reconnect faster instead of potentially waiting 17 minutes for a TCP timeout. The storage for cross-signing secrets should now be more reliable, you can close image popups with the &quot;Escape&quot; key, close the current room by double clicking it and a few more miscellaneous bugfixes.</p>
<p>You can track the remaining E2EE bits, before we declare our E2EE support as stable, in this comment now: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/23#issuecomment-894689158</p>

<h3 id="hebbot">Hebbot</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@felix:haecker.io">Felix</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I released Hebbot v2.0 (the matrix bot which generates the thisweek.gnome.org blog posts)</p>
<p>https://github.com/haecker-felix/hebbot/releases/tag/v2.0</p>
<p>It has learned how to handle images / videos, and can now insert them directly into the rendered markdown. Creating new posts has been significantly simplified and now makes even less work for the author. For example, Hebbot now automatically generates a command to quickly download all images/videos at once.</p>
<p>Maybe other communities are interested in creating a &quot;This Week in X&quot; blog as wellüëÄ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I find &quot;read it later&quot; services like Pocket extremely useful, but fail hard at actually keeping my read it later list at a sane level. For me it's hard to maintain the list and actually read through things as choosing which one to process feels overwhelming due to the amount of items.</p>
<p>Randomization to the rescue! I made a Pocket plugin for Maubot which gives me a random article from my list and allows me to easily archive it. Now I don't need to decide which article to pick, the computer does that for me!</p>

<p>Ps. Maubot is truly awesome as a bot system, well documented and easy to develop on üòª</p>

<p>Hi everyone! Did you ever feel lost in the Matrix world? The room directory is big, but it's still hard to find something you like. Or are you a room moderator, but there is not much activity in your room because it doesn't have enough users?</p>
<p>This is why I want to share rooms (or spaces) I find interesting.</p>
<hr />
<p>This week's room is: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gamedev:matrix.org">#gamedev:matrix.org</a> </p>
