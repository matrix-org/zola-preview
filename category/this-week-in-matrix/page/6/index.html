<p>Hi there! I'm Marco Melorio and I'm participating in this year's Google Summer of Code, under the GNOME Foundation. I'm working on Fractal, the GNOME matrix client, with the help of my mentor Julian Sparber. More specifically I'm working on implementing a media history viewer to the app.</p>
<p>To follow my progress on the project you can check out my blog <a href="https://melix99.wordpress.com/">here</a>. I've already published a small <a href="https://melix99.wordpress.com/2022/06/07/introduction/">introduction post</a> about me and a first <a href="https://melix99.wordpress.com/2022/06/17/gsoc-update-1-planning/">update post</a> which includes a mockup and milestones about the project.</p>

<h3 id="synapse-website">Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week the team released Synapse 1.61, which main new feature is media retention. That's right, you can now control how long Synapse keeps media files around, which should help server admins manage Synapse's disk space usage more efficiently. On a different note, this release of Synapse removes support for groups/communities (which was deprecated back in Synapse 1.56), as it has now been replaced by Spaces. Farewell groups, you have served your users well.</p>
<p>See the full Synapse 1.61 release announcement on the matrix.org blog here: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/17/synapse-1-61-released</p>
<p>Aside from this, the team is as always hard at work on making Synapse better and more efficient.</p>

<p>New version of Quadrix (1.0.6) available on desktops and mobiles. Mainly bug fixes, plus the addition of a button to deactivate the account on the server (this apparently will be soon mandatory for iOS and MacOS messaging apps).

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I skipped the last update, this one is a bit longer :3</p>
<p>First of all there have been lots and lots of updates to the translations! Finnish is now at 100% thanks to the tireless work of Aminda and Lurkki.</p>
<p>Nheko now also shows a nice badge on Unity compatible desktops (like KDE) for unread messages (although that doesn't work properly for multiple profiles being open at the same time due to limitations in that desktop protocol. Thank you d42 for contributing this, may you role a natural 42 every dice throw!</p>
<p>Syldra fixed up the paste behaviour (which didn't properly tie into undo in some edge cases), cleaned up how we find some of our dependencies and made cusor movement more consistent across systems.</p>
<p>Finally we fixed our glare resolution when verifying other sessions, which will be especially noticeable when verifying Cinny, since that responds to verification requests in a different way than I tested before! This should get rid of a whole range of verification issues people might have experienced. As part of our stabilization for the next release, we also fixed a crash on logout because I fatfingered and deleted a return statement, we now send an Element Android compatible height attribute on emotes, properly compile when the C++ version is set to 20, we once again support the current version of the hidden read receipts MSC (so that others can't tell what you read), edits now properly update in replies again, you can close the image overlay again by clicking outside, cancelled uploads properly get removed again, logging out and back in now doesn't mess up your configuration anymore and pinned messages now properly refresh once the events are loaded.</p>
<p>Phew, that was a mouthful. And we are not even done yet!</p>
<p>I spent some time on making Nheko compilation a bit faster again as well as improve startup speed. This might order your room list a bit weirdly for a few days after updating, but should normalize when receiving a few messages in some rooms. With this we now don't need to load the last message in all rooms on startup. This makes Nheko startup now only take 7 seconds on my old laptop (when not doing something CPU heavy at the same time). The remaining startup time is 40% building up the font database and 40% loading the powerlevels for each room. So we do have the chance to speedup startup by probably another 60%. It is unlikely that is necessary though.</p>
<p>When I discovered Matrix, Element was still called Riot. At the time some of the big design changes started happening to make it the Element you know today. One of the sideeffects was that the roomlist was consistently taking up 20% of my CPU on my Laptop, which I used at the time (and am forced to use now again, since I broke my newer laptop). It also used a lot more RAM than it does today. So for that reason I started shopping around for what other clients there are and I found Nheko. Clearly because it isn't a webclient, it had to be faster and use less RAM. Well, it did maybe a bit, but frankly the difference wasn't that much. Especially since at the time it loaded and rendered ALL your messages on startup (kinda). It never removed messages from memory, so it would just continuously render more and more parts of your timeline, which clearly increased RAM usage. It did however never resort the full roomlist, which made it not use a lot of CPU.</p>
<p>Since I didn't know any web development at the time, but I knew some C++, I started contributing to Nheko. At some point I made the roomlist constantly resort, which used quite some amount of CPU, but I quickly fixed that. At the time the most noticeable difference was that my fans didn't spin when using Nheko, but Element did (because of the roomlist sorting, iirc). RAM usage was pretty bad though. So that was one of the next projects, removing all events from RAM and only pulling them from the database as needed. While this means some additional load when switching rooms, it did decrease RAM requirements by quite a bit. Some new features made us still require loading data for every room from the database on startup, which causes quite some noticeable startup delay. The latest changes however got rid of most of that. We now don't need to load the messages from the database anymore. The only thing we still load is a small info object with roomname, notification and member count as well as the power levels of the room.</p>
<p>Since I recently broke my new and fast laptop, I decided to checkout how things changed on my old and slow laptop. Nowadays I am not in 15 rooms anymore, but I am in 900 rooms, but Matrix, servers as well as clients, has also gotten a lot more performant. So in the end I decided to do a little benchmark of where things stand. <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This is completely unscientific and unfair, so please take those numbers with a grain of salt. Almost no one runs such a slow laptop as I do, so likely your measurements will completely different. Even more, I was video recording the benchmark, which makes both clients a lot slower. Nonetheless it does somewhat mirror my personal experience.</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion that with 900 rooms, Nheko takes about 10-20 seconds to load and be ready for use on my system, while Element takes about 3 to 4 minutes. So basically Element handles 60 times as many rooms about 2x slower than it did back in the day, while Nheko got a bit faster or about the same speed on the same hardware (but still 60x as many rooms). I've attached a sped up video to this post, so that you can compare it for yourself. But since a lot of people ask, I guess the reason is that I wanted to see how fast you can make a Matrix client. I think I somewhat achieved that in the startup time department, but switching rooms still has a loooooong way to go. Also it is just fun to implement whatever you want in a client, since you are the maintainer and none can tell you how bad of an idea it is. That's probably the reason a lot of people start their own clients? (Although I didn't start Nheko, I just wrote too much code and people didn't want to review it anymore.)</p>
<p>That's it, I hope your eyes didn't glaze over with me babbling on about things. See you next time! :3

<p>Four days of Barcamp sessions, presentations, meeting others and Berlin culture!
The Matrix Summit 2022 brings people together who work with Matrix.
Thu, 25th to Sun, 28th August at the iconic hacker space c-base in Berlin.
This event is organised by the local Matrix Meetup community.
While people of every skill level are welcome on all days, we're going to highlight real world use cases of Matrix on Sunday. We're inviting newcomers and other communities to learn about decentralised communication software. In return we're learning how Matrix is already used by the German education and health sectors.</p>
<p>Our Call for Presentations starts next week. The event is going to be bilingual: English and German.</p>

<p>A P2P Matrix home server created using libp2p.</p>
<p>An early-stage home server prototype that communicates in a fully decentralized manner: every user runs their own server locally!</p>
<p>This is achieved with the libp2p library which provides decentralized node discovery, NAT traversal and gossip-based communication capabilities.</p>
<p>The server implements the Matrix API specifications (with many advanced features still missing, like client-side end-to-end encryption), but did little modification on federation side so that it doesn't rely on the centralized domain name system to setup and authenticate other nodes. On the other hand, this means it cannot federate with existing home servers yet, because of the different trust model (domain name/HTTPS vs self-owned cryptographic keys).</p>

<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2000">MSC2000: Server-side password policies</a>!</p>
<p>This is a proposal that adds a mechanism for homeserver administrators to define a password policy for users. This policy can decide rules such as a minimum password length, whether a digit is required, etc. This policy can be enforced by the homeserver when a user registers an account or changes their account password and is communicated to the client so that it can also be enforced locally.</p>
<p>Astute readers will possibly note that authentication in Matrix will eventually be replaced by OAuth2 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2964">MSC2964</a>). This will move operations like password policy enforcement from the homeserver to a separate authentication service, essentially removing the need to reinvent-the-wheel in a homeserver.</p>
<p>Registration, login and managing passwords and connected third-party IDs is often a complex part of a Matrix homeserver. Moving these out to a separate authentication service will both unlock new features (log in with Matrix!) as well as reduce the resources required to implement a Matrix homeserver.</p>

<p>FluffyChat 1.5.0 goes Material You</p>
<p>FluffyChat 1.5.0 has been released and will soon be in all stores. This release comes with a bunch of bugfixes and introduces the first iteration of a Material You based design. We also try to support Android 12 accent colors (while this does not seem to work yet). On other platforms, our own purple shape will stay the default.</p>
<p>I like the new Material You design while we needed to tweak it at some points. Also the dropdown menu misses some elevation but this is a known issue in the Flutter repo which will be fixed soon.</p>
<p>This is also the first build with Flutter 3 which should improve the performance a little bit. Unfortunately it brings some regressions. We are forced to ship a little bug with it: Sharing on iPads seems to be broken. I'm very unhappy with this situation but otherwise we would have ended up in different releases for different platforms. As there afaik are not that many iPad users out there, we decided to live with this compromise and ship a bugfix release asap.</p>
<p>Yeah... Flutter has a lot of pros but also a lot of cons. Every new release of this framework leads to the fear of new regressions. Shipping a new major release where basic stuff like &quot;Sharing&quot; is just broken, is totally stupid... but that's the decision of Google. :-P</p>
<p>We didn't want to wait to ship the new design and also we needed a new release to come back to F-Droid where FluffyChat wasn't available in the last weeks because of a ProGuard problem, which should be fixed now.</p>

Moreover, we have experimental support for spatial audio rendering. Give it a try ‚Äî you can find it in the settings section. It's a lot of fun to play with and really supports immersion during a video call. This release also introduces a whole new experimental way of communicating: Walkie-talkie mode.

<h2 id="spec-core-team">Spec Core Team</h2>
<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we've been working on getting Matrix 1.3 out the door and generally working towards a better process for handling releases alongside critical proposals for the protocol. The goal is to be able to ship these major features while reducing the risk of a release falling behind. Watch this space for more details as this should result in MSCs getting through the process a little bit quicker.</p>
<p>For Matrix 1.3, we're targeting <strong>Thursday, June 16th, 2022</strong> as our release date, though this comes with a small asterisk: we're looking to land quite a lot of stuff so might have to adjust the date once more as needed. We do feel reasonably confident in the date though - watch for blog posts titled Matrix 1.3 in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>The script has chosen <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2846">MSC2846 - Decentralizing media through CIDs</a> as your random MSC this week. The MSC raises an interesting question about how to make media more akin to events in Matrix. If you're interested in this area, take a read of it and the related MSCs.</p>

<p>Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've had breakthroughs this week on implementing a native Matrix SFU (selective forwarding unit) which speaks <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401">MSC3401</a>, thanks to <a href="https://siobud.com/">Sean DuBois</a> - all round WebRTC superstar, project lead for the <a href="https://github.com/pion/webrtc">Pion</a> WebRTC implementation for Go, and author of <a href="https://webrtcforthecurious.com/">WebRTC for the curious</a>.</p>
<p>Sean generously contributed an initial proof of concept to show how you'd build an MSC3401 SFU using Pion at https://github.com/matrix-org/sfu-to-sfu - which (I think?) is the first time that the first implementation of a major core MSC has been contributed from outside the core team.  Huge thanks to Sean to setting the ball going on this - the current PoC demonstrates not just SFU capability but also the decentralised cascading architecture which makes MSC3401 unique. The initial PoC speaks a 'test jig' version of MSC3401 hooked up to a simple web client for experimentation, but Matthew's now experimenting with adding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sfu-to-sfu/pull/10">genuine Matrix support</a> to it via mautrix-go, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/2423">hooking up Element Call</a> to speak to it.</p>
<p>Adding SFU support to Element Call will mean that we can support more than ~7 simultaneous calls - and with MSC3401-style decentralised cascading, we should be able to support hundreds or even thousands. There's lots of work remaining here, but the ball is now rolling.  For more info about SFUs and MSC3401, check out Matthew's <a href="https://2021.commcon.xyz/talks/extending-matrix-s-e2ee-calls-to-multiparty">CommCon 2021 talk</a> (which was what prompted Sean's implementation work here!)</p>
<p>Separately, we've been running Element Call on staging with E2EE enabled for the last few weeks, and should be releasing the first major Element Call update next week.  And once SFUs land, then Element Call can exit beta - watch out Zoom!</p>

<p>Dart Matrix SDK : Version 0.9.9</p>
<p>This week, the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.9.9">version 0.9.9</a>. In this new version, we added a search function to allow searching for an event in database and on server through several requests to the <code>/messages</code> endpoint.</p>
<p>There was also some work on updating the image size when generating thumbnail, which allow saving a bit of calculation when sending events. If using a custom resizer make sure to update the resize response as <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/company/frontend/famedlysdk/-/snippets/2342277">here</a>.</p>
<p>We also did some refactor with the event sender getter. The getter result is now a future to allow requesting the member event to the server if we cannot find it in memory, to help fix the issue when the user was not found in memory.</p>
<p>Finally, a quick helper function (<code>client.waitForSync</code>) was added. It allows you to wait for a room to appear in (left, join, invited) section of the sync response.</p>

<li>Pipes move all messages from one room to an other.</li>
<li>Adding a filter now uses the room the command was sent from by default if the roomid is not specified.</li>
<li>Ansible role now has tags for start, stop, configs, fix and all.</li>
<li>Ansible role backs up the configuration.toml file to prevent the possibility of data loss.</li>

<ul>
<li>Quentin and Maximilien from Deuxfleurs are creating Garage, a robust and distributed storage backend that can run on old computers. Who can use it? Why? And when should I not use it? Let's find out!</li>
<li>Nathan from the Guardian Project is working with wind, butter, and rasperries to provide applications and messaging to people in low-connectivity areas. A fascinating dive off the grid.</li>

<p>A bite-size MSC which aims to clean up the definition of a widget state event... by moving the &quot;title&quot; field to the root of the state event, alongside the existing &quot;name&quot; field.</p>
<p>This MSC needs someone to write an implementation in at least one homeserver and client to move forwards. Perhaps that someone could be you?</p>

<li>Dendrite can now assist remote users to join restricted rooms via <code>/make_join</code> and <code>/send_join</code></li>
<li>The sync API no longer returns immediately on <code>/sync</code> requests unnecessarily if it can be avoided</li>
<li>A race condition has been fixed in the sync API when updating presence via <code>/sync</code></li>
<li>A race condition has been fixed sending E2EE keys to remote servers over federation when joining rooms</li>
<li>The <code>trusted_private_chat</code> preset should now grant power level 100 to all participant users, which should improve the user experience of direct messages</li>
<li>Invited users are now authed correctly in restricted rooms</li>
<li>The <code>join_authorised_by_users_server</code> key is now correctly stripped in restricted rooms when updating the membership event</li>
<li>Appservices should now receive invite events correctly</li>
<li>Device list updates should no longer contain optional fields with <code>null</code> values</li>
<li>The <code>/deactivate</code> endpoint has been fixed to no longer confuse Element with incorrect completed flows</li>

<blockquote>
<p>We added a way to edit permissions in Nheko now. It is an unconventional drag and drop dialog, where you drag users and permissions between different roles. We are hoping that this will make powerlevels easier to understand. Be careful when trying it, the wrong powerlevels might make your room unusable. Now... the bad part about that is, that powerlevels add around 50-100 new strings to translate... Help is appreciated! &lt;3</p>
<p>Nheko now also supports fallback keys, which should make E2EE more reliable after long periods of being offline and you can send images by pressing enter again. The privacy screen is also now fixed for separate room windows and our flatpak supports more image formats.

<blockquote>
<p>Since our last update from about a month ago, we had two bugfix releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruma 0.6.2 added methods to get the current room powerlevels from a <code>StrippedPowerLevelsEvent</code> and to get a user's membership whether the state event is redacted or not, and added a missing export to track member changes.</li>
<li>Ruma 0.6.3 fixed the serialization and deserialization of events with a dynamic <code>event_type</code> and added convenience constructors for logging in with a <code>UserIdentifier</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also landed a bunch of internal work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvement in our macros, notably to <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1109">support unstable prefixes for event types</a>.</li>
<li>Some cleanup like removing some dead code, removing unnecessary <code>PartialEq</code> implementations, and fixing missing feature flags.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1109/commits/1cae9d253bb43c9ad8699cd3b59b89da23bd0e73">minimum supported rust version is now 1.59</a> and we use the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1137">Rust 2021 Edition</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1114">push rules don't apply to the user's own events</a></li>
<li>Add support for <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1112">MSC3700: Ignore <code>content.sender_key</code></a></li>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Some new MSCs popping up this week around widgets, room types, fixing notifications with threads and room version 11! Though note that the last one currently serves as a means for the Spec Core Team to publicly track what should be included in room version 11, and is by no means is its content considered final.</p>
<p>The Spec Core Team are currently focused on room version 10 and getting Matrix v1.3 out the door soon. There's also been some discussion on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676: Message editing</a> this week, with the intention of finally landing that in the spec. Thanks to richvdh for driving the charge there.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1902">MSC1902: Split the media repo into s2s and c2s parts</a>!</p>
<p>Homeservers currently make use of Client Server Media APIs to pull media from other homeservers over federation. This has worked for a long time, but is a bit of a confusing blur of the lines between client&lt;-&gt;server and server&lt;-&gt;server traffic. It also makes it difficult to require different authentication rules for clients versus servers.</p>
<p>This MSC aims to help clean that up. Take a look if you're interested!

<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week's <code>testing</code> updates are now in <code>master</code>!</p>
<p>Also included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better error handling:</strong> if the backend hits an error that causes your connection to KT chats to be dropped, the bridge should notify you about it (not that it should ever happen in the first place, but you never know!)</li>
<li><strong>Better logging:</strong> the Node module can be configured to print the arguments of RPC commands received from / sent to the Python module.  The example Node config includes a default set that should be helpful for general debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Room metadata bridging:</strong> setting an Open Chat title &amp; topic from Matrix should work now!
<ul>
<li>Setting the title of a Direct Chat should work too, but topics remain unbridged (since KT Direct Chats don't have topics/descriptions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Defensive error handling:</strong> Attempts to add a non-friend user to a DM will be refused by the bridge, since KT only allows Direct Chats between friends
<ul>
<li>KT does allow &quot;1:1 Open Chats&quot; between non-friends, but those aren't bridged yet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, <code>testing</code> adds support for joining KakaoTalk rooms from Matrix, either by joining an existing portal or providing an Open Chat URL to the bot with a <code>join</code> command. ...However, I've been unable to test this, since KT is stingy about whom it allows to join Open Chats!  So please give this a try if you can.</p>
<p>In other news, this bridge is now listed on <a href="https://matrix.org/bridges/#kakaotalk">Matrix.org</a>! ü•≥  Thanks Thib !</p>
<p>Also, for the time being, I will be taking a hiatus from this bridge &amp; the LINE bridge, as I'll be quite occupied for the foreseeable future on account of having joined Element ü§©!!

<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.13.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>Read default port and listen address from config url (@BtbN)</li>
<li>Improvements to pillifying IRC nicks, again</li>
<li>Fixes for AUTOQUERY not always working correctly</li>
<li>Allow anyone to use STATUS command to get their own status</li>
<li>Filter control characters only for plumbs so people can send garbage to IRC if they wish from Matrix</li>
<li>Support for converting IRC color codes to Matrix (@tjaderxyz)</li>
<li>Fixed compose docker Synapse configuration for registration</li>
<li>Improved Python 3.10 compatibliy (@BtbN)</li>
<li>Hidden room to hide joins using restricted rooms join rule (@BtbN)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some cool stuff this time around! Aside from many bug fixes this release has two great new features: IRC message colors and hiding invites from channels.</p>
<p>IRC colors are enabled by default and are rendered how your Matrix client sees fit. They can be disabled per network if needed.</p>
<p>Hiding joins works with room v9 restricted join rules feture to allow IRC ghosts to join rooms without an invite from the bridge bot first. This clears some clutter and may even make joining a bit faster in the long run - we will see. This feature is disabled by default and needs to be enabled by the bridge administrator as it is consiered a &quot;labs&quot; feature for now.</p>
<p>Go and get a Dell from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Post release (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0">we have release 0.5.0 last week</a>) the main focus was on minor fixes and bigger features we had pending but didn't want to merge before. Aside from a few documentation and other minor fixes - among others switching to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/677">resolver v2</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/686">more accurate <code>power_level</code> calculation</a> - the biggest <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/571">merge was around the FFI interface for Apple (iOS and Mac)</a>, which we have initial support for now üéâ.</p>
<p>The main work is currently happening behind the scenes, while we prepare for the upcoming tasks - like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/675">WASM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/699">NodeJS support</a> for the crypto-crate and work on UniFFI. We are also hardening our processes for improved security and risk management around our code base, dependencies and the potential to ship binaries.</p>
<p>üëâÔ∏è We are very happy about the influx of people, who joined our developer community questions since the release. We'd like to take this opportunity again to invite anyone else interested in hacking on matrix in rust to check out our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22"><code>help wanted</code> tagged issues</a> and join our matrix channel at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-rust-sdk:matrix.org">#matrix-rust-sdk:matrix.org</a>.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The Spec Core Team has decided to not include <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> (threading via <code>m.thread</code> relations) specifically in the upcoming Matrix v1.3 release. We previously stated that it would be in v1.3, but there's a few unproven MSCs (namely <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773">MSC3773</a> (notifications for threads)) which make it feel improper to put threads into the spec at this stage. We're aiming for a future (very near) spec release to contain threads, assuming we can get enough of the feature landed. This is a very similar approach to what we did with Spaces: while the core feature existed as FCP-concluded for a while, we wanted to give some other MSCs a chance to land before writing it up formally.</p>
<p>As a follow-on from this, any implementations that are currently assuming &quot;v1.3&quot; spec support translates to threading support should note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients which are pre-emptively checking for v1.3 in <code>/versions</code> should stop doing that. Look for <code>org.matrix.msc3440.stable</code> as an &quot;unstable&quot; feature flag instead.</li>
<li>Servers which offer MSC3440's behaviour should expose it on stable endpoints and expose <code>org.matrix.msc3440.stable</code> for clients to detect.</li>
<li>Optionally, clients and servers can drop support for the <code>org.matrix.msc3440</code> (truly unstable) flag, given clients &amp; servers should have already upgraded.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the spec level, we'll still be writing up MSC3440's dependencies (aggregations and friends), but will notably be missing MSC3440 specifically in v1.3. If folks can update their clients urgently, it would be massively appreciated!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2596">MSC2596: Proposal to always allow rescinding invites</a>!</p>
<p>A simple change to the auth rules to help prevent an edge case where one is able to invite a user, but not disinvite them as the latter requires a separate permission. The MSC attempts to solve this by always allowing the cancellation of invitations you've sent.</p>
<p>A small MSC, but one with some open threads still. Perhaps a good opportunity to go in and clean it up!</p>

<p>Hello everyone. This week the team cut a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.59.0rc1">release candidate for Synapse v1.59</a>, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New module API support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12406">editing push rules</a>.</li>
<li>Experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11507">MSC3266, federated room summary</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12601">MSC3786</a>.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we've actually made two releases ‚Äî <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.4">Dendrite 0.8.4</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.5">Dendrite 0.8.5</a> ‚Äî which are both primarily targeting performance and bug fixes.</p>
<p>We've also released our new living documentation, which is available at https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/, which features new installation instructions and documents that will be helpful to Dendrite server administrators. We will be writing more documentation and expanding this over time.</p>
<p>Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.8.2</li>
<li>Monolith deployments will no longer panic at startup if given a config file that does not include the <code>internal_api</code> and <code>external_api</code> options</li>
<li>State resolution v2 now correctly identifies other events related to power events, which should fix some event auth issues</li>
<li>The latest events updater will no longer implicitly trust the new forward extremities when calculating the current room state, which may help to avoid some state resets</li>
<li>The one-time key count is now correctly returned in <code>/sync</code> even if the request otherwise timed out, which should reduce the chance that unnecessary one-time keys will be uploaded by clients</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool should now work properly when the database is configured using the global connection pool</li>
<li>Fixes a regression introduced in the previous version where appservices, push and phone-home statistics would not work over plain HTTP</li>
<li>Adds missing indexes to the sync API output events table, which should significantly improve <code>/sync</code> performance and reduce database CPU usage</li>
<li>Building Dendrite with the <code>bimg</code> thumbnailer should now work again (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/database64128">database64128</a>)</li>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rust Matrix team is very excited to announce the next major release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0"><strong>Matrix SDK 0.5 &quot;stores and native crypto&quot;</strong></a>, now available for everyone by adding <code>matrix-sdk  = &quot;0.5.0&quot;</code> to their dependencies in their <code>Cargo.toml</code>. This first major release in about 8 months brings significant changes many have been waiting for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better, safer, native-er crypto</strong>: matrix-sdk 0.5 ditches libolm in favor of Vodozemac, the completely fresh rust-native re-implementation of the crypto crate. It has also been audited, the report of which is scheduled to be released soon.</li>
<li><strong>Store revamp</strong>: the entire cache storage infrastructure for crypto and state has been restructured to allow for full plug-ability, with even the two default supported backends, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-sled">sled</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-indexeddb">indexeddb</a> both being separate crates now. And as a matter of fact, a community-driven <a href="https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-sql">sql implementation has already been published as beta</a> (with postgres and sqlite support) by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lotte:chir.rs">charlotte ü¶ù</a>.</li>
<li><strong>WebAssembly</strong>; both of these changes also allow us to finally make WASM a Tier 1 supported target for the SDK. Not only does it build and even use the browser native indexeddb for permanent storage, we also have CI tests ensuring nothing will break this support going forward.</li>
<li><strong>Features, Features and Process</strong>: there's plenty more features and bug fixes in this release, e.g. native thumbnail generation support, as well as changes on our processes going forward.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use Matrix with the Signal bridge (or any bridge) with relay mode
enabled, your guests have probably experienced the confusion where they don't know who else (on Matrix) is in the chat as only Matrix can double-puppet.</p>
<p>When this bot is added to a Matrix room, it will announce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who the room members are when a new Signal user joins;</li>
<li>When a Matrix user joins or leaves, who that Matrix user was.</li>
</ul>
<p>I built it just this afternoon using the excellent <code>matrix-bot-sdk</code>, but it's in Typescript and has plentyful unit tests!</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Wowza, that's a lot of new MSCs!&quot; I hear you say. This is actually a listing of the last 3 weeks, as it was pointed out to me that the last 3 editions of TWIM have not all features an MSC status update - which means some MSCs may not have necessary made it into the limelight.</p>
<p>As such, here's those from this past week, as well as the ones that were missed!</p>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>It's that time of the year again - a new Spec release is on the horizon! Matrix v1.3 is expected to land <em>sometime this month</em>, and will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a> (threads) + related MSCs</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3787">MSC3787</a> (knock+restricted join rules)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3604">MSC3604</a> (room version 10)</li>
<li>Any other MSCs which have so far been accepted, but not yet made it into the spec.</li>
</ul>
<p>MSCs which land between now and v1.3 might get incorporated if easy enough, though chances are they'll slip to v1.4 (expected next quarter).</p>
<p>On top of that, the other bit of news is that the <code>proposal-in-review</code> label has now been removed from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals">matrix-spec-proposals</a> repo and thus all MSCs. This doesn't mean your MSC is no longer in review! We simply found the label redundant along with the other labels in the process (it was attached to all MSCs which hadn't been accepted/merged yet, which means very little) and thus we decided to remove it to reduce noise.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2881">MSC2881: Message Attachments</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC has actually been potentially(?) superseded by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3382">MSC3382</a>. In short, both look to provide a solution to the problem of attaching (multiple!) images to messages, such that clients can display an album of images in a single event in the timeline.</p>
<p>Check it out if you're interested in introducing such a feature!</p>

<ul>
<li>Our Docker images and Debian packages are now built from a dependency lockfile courtesy of Poetry. Props to David for leading the charge on this multi-week epic.</li>
<li>An experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3383">MSC3383</a> has been contributed by @Bubu and @jcgruenhage at Famedly, which will help with proxying federation traffic, amongst other uses.</li>
<li>An experimental implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2815">MSC2815</a> has been merged, which allows room moderators to view redact event content for the purposes of moderation. This was contributed by @tulir at Beeper.</li>
<li>Device list updates are now asynchronous thanks to Erik, leading to much faster login times for accounts in big rooms.</li>
<li>plus many other bug fixes and improvements!</li>
</ul>
<p>We also released a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.1">v1.58.1</a> patch shortly afterwards to address an issue with the Debian packages on some configurations. Server admins not using the Matrix.org Debian packages do not need to install this patch release.</p>
<p>Otherwise, ongoing work from the core team continues with Sean and Rich working on faster room join performance, Olivier pushing forwards on testing Synapse with workers in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/">Complement</a>, while Erik has been tackling general performance work.</p>

<p>This week brings another round of big improvements &amp; new features!</p>
<p>Features &amp; fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes to Docker support &amp; the documentation for setting it up</li>
<li>Changes to the login flow
<ul>
<li>The bridge can now be configured to enforce a login flow that more closely matches the official KakaoTalk desktop client's, and to better warn you when a new login will kick out another one of your KT sessions.  This will hopefully prevent the bridge from getting KT accounts banned!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Backfilling for KT-&gt;Matrix read receipts</li>
<li>Commands for adding/removing KakaoTalk friends</li>
<li>Commands to edit your KakaoTalk ID &amp; mark it as shared or hidden</li>
<li>Matrix-&gt;KT DM creation, i.e. the ability to create a new DM with a KakaoTalk user from within Matrix
<ul>
<li>This might fail on the first attempt at creating a DM.  If it does, try re-inviting the KakaoTalk puppet to the room.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many stability &amp; correctness improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>With the combination of friends list curation &amp; DM creation support, it should now be possible to connect with KT contacts entirely from Matrix!  Simply add some friends, list them, and invite a listed friend to a 1:1 room!</p>

<p>Someone on Twitter complained that no chat client works like MSN anymore, where you could have separate windows for each chat. So for MSN compatibility we added that. (It is a bit experimental still, expect some stuff to not work or crash)</p>
<p>Bulbu also went through a lot of effort to add a second set of emoji shortcodes to Nheko. Those should be more familiar to people coming from other platforms or clients while the old shortcodes are available still as well. We also saw a lot of progress on the Finnish, Chinese, Indonesian and Russian translations, animated images should work properly in the image viewer again, buttons for opening the member list are now clearly marked with a people icon next to them. The memberlist is also now search- and sortable.</p>
<p>Anyway, have a look at how important multiple windows are:

<p>Matrix client for Emacs</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alphapapa:matrix.org">alphapapa</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ement.el has received several updates since the last time it was mentioned in TWIM:</p>
<p><em>Additions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A new room list command, <code>ement-taxy-room-list</code>, shows rooms grouped &quot;smartly&quot; (and programmably).  (It will be made the default soon; until then, call the command to use it.)
<ul>
<li>The new room list shows unread-notification/highlight counts, similar to Element.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basic support for spaces:
<ul>
<li>Rooms (and spaces) can be added to and removed from spaces.</li>
<li>Rooms are listed under their spaces in <code>ement-taxy-room-list</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reactions can now be toggled off (i.e. redacted) by clicking them, like in Element.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-room-send-file</code> allows uploading non-image files to rooms, and file messages are now displayed usefully, so the files can be downloaded or viewed.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-ignore-user</code> ignores and unignores users.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-tag-room</code> adds and removes favourite, low-priority, or custom tags on rooms.</li>
<li>Command <code>ement-room-occur</code> allows searching messages in a room buffer, similar to Emacs's <code>occur</code> command (i.e. it locally searches already-received messages).</li>
<li>Membership events are now coalesced by default, similar to Element (especially helpful in large public rooms, like bridged IRC rooms, where join/part spam can be overwhelming).</li>
<li>&quot;In reply to&quot; links in replies, as well as other <code>matrix.to</code> links, can be activated in a room buffer to go to the linked message.</li>
<li>Mentions in outgoing messages are HTML-linkified (aka &quot;pilled&quot;), like Element.</li>
<li>Generated avatars for rooms that have none, similar to Element.  (Only displayed in <code>ement-taxy-room-list</code> for now.)</li>
<li>Option <code>ement-shr-use-fonts</code> (disabled by default, which prevents HTML messages from being displayed in a different font).</li>
<li>Faces for favourite/low-priority rooms.</li>
<li>Redacted messages that are still known locally are now displayed with a strikethrough (after reconnecting, their content will be unknown).</li>
<li>When images are disabled, image messages are presented as clickable URLs, so they can still be viewed.</li>
<li>Some events, like membership events and images, are displayed alongside a vertical bar to help distinguish them from normal messages.</li>
<li>Even &quot;hotter&quot;-looking timestamps for rooms updated in the last hour.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Changes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Refactored notification system.  Now easier to configure (see <code>M-x customize-group RET ement-notify RET</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fixes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved error handling when looking up homeserver hostnames and <code>.well-known</code> URIs.</li>
<li>Improved error handling when processing malformed events.</li>
<li>&quot;Elemental&quot; display style (not used by many users, apparently).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?=n78tHoCx1es">this months demos</a> (also shown off at the top of the TWIM post), Eric showed off a <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9615#issuecomment-1108992901">proof of concept to anonymize your screenshots</a> so you can easily include more context when submitting logs or bug reports without worrying where the bug occurred. The current concept will color block all of the text on the page to still maintain the structure of the app but completely hide the content itself.</p>
<p>This still has a ways to go before it's integrated in Element under the click of a button so if anyone wants to take over or give feedback, go comment on the issue, https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9615. If you want to use the anonymization now, you can manually run the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9615#issuecomment-1108992901">JavaScript snippet from the issue</a> in the browser devtools.</p>
<p>This mode could even be further extended further to include <code>event_id</code> labels in the corner of each message to easily correlate the logs to the screenshot.</p>
<p>Happy screenshotting!</p>

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de">Benedict</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a few release candidates and weeks later, we released <a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity/">Trixnity</a> 2.0.0 today! It contains many breaking changes due to a large refactoring, which allows us to share a lot code between server and client implementations of the Matrix APIs.
This means, that Trixnity can be used to implement matrix servers in addition to application services and clients!</p>
<p>Trixnity finally has support for Kotlin/JS. You can implement a browser client or even better: multiplatform client. Support for Kotlin/Native will follow soon (e. g. for iOS clients). Right now, there is no <code>trixnity-client-store</code> implementation for JavaScript (e. g. IndexedDB), so you need to stick with <code>InMemoryStore</code> at the moment.</p>
<p>Besides notification support (push rules are evaluated), we introduced helpers to get the complete timeline as Kotlin-Flow (no more complicated loops to get the timeline). You can even subscribe to all timeline events, which is really helpful to implement bots with e2e encryption support. Speaking of e2e encryption: libolm is bundled into <code>trixnity-olm</code> jars, so you don't need to build olm by your own anymore.</p>
<p>These are the most important features. For the complete changelog, have a look at the <a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity/-/releases">release candidates</a>.</p>

Support for the Element recent emoji (<code>io.element.recent_emoji</code>) was added.  A new method to get the last read marker was added.
Lastly, the timeline logic was enhanced, and it's now possible to load the timeline at a specific event. So you can load the room to the last event and then paginate through the new events. When reaching the last event, the timeline will automatically allow new events to be added in the timeline when received.</p>

<p>Hello together. I made a generic bot, named <code>Safed Sundarata</code>, or <code>Sundar</code> in short, that should make it easy to get basic special functionality working. It has a lot of different functionality so you have an example code to work off of. The main motivation for this bot was to provide an <code>!error &lt;code&gt;</code> command for the developers in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#community:reactos.org">ReactOS Matrix Rooms</a>, which translates error codes to human readable text. Then of course i added other useful or fun commands to the bot. You want to read the <a href="https://github.com/BieHDC/sundar/blob/master/README.md">Readme</a> to find out more.
This is the first time i ever wrote a bot, so feedback and corrections to the <a href="https://github.com/BieHDC/sundar">Source Code</a> are highly appreciated. It is written in Go using the mautrix-go framework (thanks tulir and everyone who worked on this making it easy!). Even easier is to run and build it with go, no insane build system with broken dependencies required, which was the reason why i made it from scratch.</p>

You can run it yourself from the Github - https://github.com/luphoria/graim
You can join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#graim:gra.im">matrix space</a>, which is bridged to the <a href="https://discord.gg/MV7fDb4AKy">Discord server</a>

<blockquote>
<p>Taking my GNOME Foundation hat on for this news: the GNOME Foundation is adopting Matrix! Is this TWIM worthy? It probably wouldn't have been if it wasn't for all the great work of Gwmngilfen! We published a joint blog post (though in all fairness Greg did all the heavy lifting) to explain how the decision was taken, and transparently share the data we had at hand.</p>
<p>In practice that means after <em>years</em> of Matrix being around in the GNOME community and being the most popular platform, it's finally moving out of the grey zone of &quot;everyone is using it but some older contributors really like their current set up, so it exists but it's not officially our primary platform&quot;. For now we're keeping both our Matrix instance and the bridge to GIMPnet (the IRC network GNOME people have been using for years). The major change is that IRC is now our legacy, so if tradeoffs have to be made Matrix will keep the premium experience.</p>
<p>Again, huge shout out to Gwmngilfen who gave meaning to the data I handed to him.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Hello again everyone! Your regularly-scheduled TWIM Spec update has returned, along with graph-based media!</p>
<p>Quick news to point out this week is that a new maubot plugin has been written to simply note the details of MSCs after their IDs (&quot;msc1234&quot;) have been posted in a room. The bot supports multiple MSC IDs in a message, message edits, threads and end-to-end encrypted rooms.</p>
<p>A copy of the bot is currently running under <code>@mscbot:matrix.org</code>, so feel free to invite it to a room if you'd find that useful!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3216">MSC3216: Synchronized access control for Spaces</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC serves as an alternative to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2962">MSC2962</a>, and essentially allows for user permissions to be simultaneously enforced across a set of rooms in a Space. This would allow functionality to users of platforms like Discord, where a user can be a moderator in a guild, and thus in all of that guild's channels.</p>

<p>A few operational issues have taken up quite a bit of the team's time this week, but we've still found time to cut a couple of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.0rc2">release candidates of v1.58</a>.  Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locked python dependencies for our Docker images and Debian packages, thanks to David's <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/54">poetry work</a>.</li>
<li>Some big performance fixes, including <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12365">an optimisation to login</a> from Erik and one to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12522">message backfill</a> from yours truly.</li>

<p>We're also excited to see quite a few contributions from outside the core maintenance team: thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dklimpel">Dirk</a>, Beeper, Famedly and everyone else in the community who has made pull requests!</p>
<p>Meanwhile on the core team, Sean has been continuing to lay groundwork for faster room joins, and Olivier has been doing some exciting work so that we will (finally) be able to test Synapse in worker mode under Complement.</p>

<p>This week we announced <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.2">Dendrite 0.8.2</a> with a bunch of usability fixes. As always, join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for more discussion and updates.</p>
<h4 id="features">Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lazy-loading has been added to the <code>/sync</code> endpoint, which should speed up syncs considerably</li>
<li>Filtering has been added to the <code>/messages</code> endpoint</li>
<li>The room summary now contains &quot;heroes&quot; (up to 5 users in the room) for clients to display when no room name is set</li>
<li>The existing lazy-loading caches will now be used by <code>/messages</code> and <code>/context</code> so that member events will not be sent to clients more times than necessary</li>
<li>The account data stream now uses the provided filters</li>
<li>The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.8.0</li>
<li>The <code>/state</code> and <code>/state_ids</code> endpoints will now return <code>M_NOT_FOUND</code> for rejected events</li>
<li>Repeated calls to the <code>/redact</code> endpoint will now be idempotent when a transaction ID is given</li>
<li>Dendrite should now be able to run as a Windows service under Service Control Manager</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fixes">Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fictitious presence updates will no longer be created for users which have not sent us presence updates, which should speed up complete syncs considerably</li>
<li>Uploading cross-signing device signatures should now be more reliable, fixing a number of bugs with cross-signing</li>
<li>All account data should now be sent properly on a complete sync, which should eliminate problems with client settings or key backups appearing to be missing</li>
<li>Account data will now be limited correctly on incremental syncs, returning the stream position of the most recent update rather than the latest stream position</li>
<li>Account data will not be sent for parted rooms, which should reduce the number of left/forgotten rooms reappearing in clients as empty rooms</li>
<li>The TURN username hash has been fixed which should help to resolve some problems when using TURN for voice calls (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/fcwoknhenuxdfiyv">fcwoknhenuxdfiyv</a>)</li>
<li>Push rules can no longer be modified using the account data endpoints</li>
<li>Querying account availability should now work properly in polylith deployments</li>
<li>A number of bugs with sync filters have been fixed</li>
<li>A default sync filter will now be used if the request contains a filter ID that does not exist</li>
<li>The <code>pushkey_ts</code> field is now using seconds instead of milliseconds</li>
<li>A race condition when gracefully shutting down has been fixed, so JetStream should no longer cause the process to exit before other Dendrite components are finished shutting down</li>

<p>Our last update included the words &quot;if things go to plan&quot;, and even though that's usually calling for trouble, not so this time!
We released Ruma 0.6.0 yesterday and apart from a tiny missing feature that was fixed and released as 0.6.1 today, everything went smooth üôÇ</p>
<p>The biggest breaking changes are</p>
<ul>
<li>new owned identifier types ‚Äì calling <code>.to_owned()</code> on <code>&amp;UserId</code> now gives you an <code>OwnedUserId</code> instead of <code>Box&lt;UserId&gt;</code></li>
<li>a new event enum hierarchy, where redacted events are better taken into account</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, with this release we can now claim practically 100% coverage of Matrix v1.2, that is you can send and receive requests for all specified endpoints of the various APIs, as well as send and inspect all specified event types, all with a strongly-typed Rust API.</p>

<p>the Miounne's successor is here - meet Buscarron!</p>
<p>There were no news about miounne for a while because we worked on a new &quot;iteration&quot; that can handle matrix encryption (thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/go">mautrix-go</a>).</p>
<p>So, here is it - Buscarron v1.0.0 with e2e encryption and multiarch (arm32, arm64, amd64) support. It can handle any HTTP POST/HTML form and send it to a (encrypted) matrix room. Of course, Buscarron has small neat features like spam checker and rate limiter.</p>
<p><a href="https://etke.cc/">etke.cc</a> is migrating to Buscarron and deprecating Miounne.</p>

<p>The highly configurable message aggregation and filtering bot for matrix!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Matrix Community Manager has seen some work in the features department over the past week.</p>
<p>With the new Ansible playbook I think it's possible for someone with a bit of Ansible experience to get this bot up and running in under 10 minutes. I did a fresh install in 4 minutes. That is a fresh VPS and creating a new matrix account. Instructions for the Ansible deploy can be found <a href="https://sleuth56.gitlab.io/Matrix-Community-Manager/Installation-With-Ansible/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The major features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Ansible playbook that should simplify the installation process for new users.</li>
<li>Edits to the message that triggered the bot will now be reflected in the bots message. This bot now has a feature Twitter doesn't have :laughing:.</li>
<li>Hashtags are now called filters. Filters are more customizable allowing for custom delimiters and now show the originating room.</li>
<li>The AutoJoin feature has filters to control who or from where invites will be excepted.</li>
<li>Announcements can have more than one output room. Using a comma separated list of room ids.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few bugs were fixed as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some text characters were causing messages to be classed incorrectly thus causing crashes.</li>
<li>Exotic characters specifically in links were causing crashes.</li>

<h3 id="synapse-website">Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello again everyone. This week the team <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/04/19/synapse-1-57-released">released Synapse 1.57.0</a>, followed by a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.57.1">1.57.1 patch release</a> that fixed a problem in the 1.57.0 docker image.</p>
<p>This week was a little on the quieter side again, with some of us away on holiday and others away with illness. Nevertheless, this week <code>develop</code> saw a variety of activity. Some personal highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shay's effort to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/3c758d9808ddc00ee96c5426dda3caea356c8745">document Synapse's numerous config options</a> <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html">landed</a>. This is a huge and comprehensive effort that'll help administrators to understand all the options they have to configure Synapse.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12399">Further progress from Rich on the fast room joins project</a>. In some tests we've seen a 5x speed-up over the status quo!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12496">A subtle bugfix</a> from Erik which corrects incorrect counts in one of the Admin API endpoints.</li>
<li>The remainder of <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/54">the poetry work</a> has landed. There were a few last-minute complications in CI to smooth out, but we've now finished the migration. Synapse's docker images and debian package now come with a fixed set of dependencies (even transitive ones) in a way that lets us support multiple Python versions and interpreters.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're looking forward to shipping these in Synapse 1.58, whose RC is scheduled for Tuesday the 26th of April.</p>
<p>I'm also keen to see how <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12522">PR 12522</a> from Rich and Olivier progresses. It aims to fix a nasty memory bug which can cause Synapse to get stuck in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_memory">OOM loop</a>.</p>
<p>As ever, I'd like to express thanks to our community of users, server operators and contributors. Thanks are also due to @callahad: today is his last day of managing the Synapse team. We're all going to miss him and wish him well: thank you for everything you'd done over the last year and a half.</p>

<p>A Social Annotation Tool Powered by Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gleachkr:matrix.org">gleachkr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've added two major user-facing features to populus viewer:</p>
<ol>
<li>A two-up view in the pdf viewer, allowing you to view and annotate two pages at once on a wider screen</li>
<li>An audio viewer, complete with audio annotation, so that you can annotate temporal segments of an audio recording</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm especially excited about the latter - being able to discuss audio recordings will be a great teaching tool, and I'm hoping it might also be useful for things like people who want to talk about podcasts together (for purposes of editing, or just for fun), and people who want to annotate recordings of public talks of various kinds. The last use case would also be pretty well served by <em>video</em> annotation - so that's now rising on the agenda. I've created an MSC, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3775">here</a> where I'll be filling in the details of a proposed format for interoperable audiovisual media annotations. As always, if you've got questions, want to follow development progress, or just want to talk about the future of social annotation on Matrix, come join us at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opentower:matrix.org">#opentower:matrix.org</a>.

Version 0.1.0 contains several handy features such as searching your rooms, joining new rooms, and starting and switching to direct chats. Furthermore, if a room has unread notifications, nheko-krunner will let you know by tacking on a notification count to the room name (e.g. <code>This Week in Matrix (TWIM) (1)</code>. Currently this feature is not disable-able, but I plan to dive into writing KCMs (KConfig Modules) soon so that I can add a toggle for this.</p>
<p>Hopefully a few people find this handy, and remember that if you don't use KDE, nheko still has a handy D-Bus API that you can use to write integrations with other software.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@henri_carnot:famedly.de">Henri Carnot [famedly]</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We haven't done any regular posts about it in a while, but the SDK sees almost weekly releases. (We did release version 0.8.20 last week) If you forgot about it, the Matrix Dart SDK is the SDK FluffyChat, the Famedly clients and a few others use. Let me summarize some of the changes for those who haven't kept up:</p>
<p>One of the killer features is probably WebRTC support üöÄ. It handles all the signalling for you, which makes integrating call support into your Flutter or Dart Matrix client fairly simple. Currently it supports version 1 of the call protocol, which is still an MSC and implements a few of the other MSCs. Experiments with group calls are still in progress.</p>
<p>We also switched databases a few times and tuned it more (we posted about FluffyBox last year). The database backend should now be a lot more stable and more performant, while also using less memory.</p>
<p>Continuing with stability, we worked a lot on how the timeline is stored and structured, leading to a much more robust experience. The SDK is also now completely nullsafe üéâ, which gets rid of a lot of annoying error modes. There were some fixes to E2EE here and there, but mostly the experience has been really solid and didn't need much work.</p>
<p>Some of the more recent developments include widget support as well as improving the file upload experience. The SDK now inserts a dummy event for a pending upload, images are thumbnailed and resided in a different isolate and uploads are automatically retried after a connection failure. We are also working on improving the push support, making it easier to fetch events from a push.</p>
<p>And I'm currently working on bringing fragmented timeline support. Nico told me it would be pretty (not) easy to do... and I¬†have to say, he was right. Good first issue üôÉ</p>
<p>See you next week ;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've created a NixOS module, nix-matrix-appservices, that can simplify the bootstrap and maintenance of matrix appservices on nixos. With it, appservices can be spun up easily with registration and tokens handled by the module. Most mautrix and mx-puppet bridges have been tested to work and they can be setup in a couple lines of nix code. There are plenty of options you can make use of to configure more complex appservices.
You can find the the code, matrix room(gitlab badge), and usage information here: https://gitlab.com/coffeetables/nix-matrix-appservices</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone. This week the Synapse team cut <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.57.0rc1">a release candidate for Synapse 1.57</a>. It contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12040">Continued work on the faster joins project</a>.</li>
<li>Additional Module API support for working with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12302">3PID associations</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12391">account data changes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12341">making users admins</a>. The first two in particular are vital to to merge the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse-dinsic">DINSIC fork of Synapse</a> into the mainline source tree.</li>
<li>Experimental, partial support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11881">MSC3202, Encrypted Appservices</a>; additional support for threads <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12436">via MSC3666</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12403">via MSC2675</a>.</li>
<li>Plus a number of bugfixes within Synapse and fixes for spec compliance issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>As ever, our warmest thanks to to our contributors for sharing their time, effort and expertise with the project. We look forward to seeing your work in the wild, come the 1.57 release proper on  Tuesday the 19th of April.</p>
<p>On develop, we have been powering through a number of different tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>further work on fast room joins;</li>
<li>efforts to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12368">better document Synapse's config file</a>;</li>
<li>strides towards making Synapse's requests <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12468">internally cancellable</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12365">performance improvements for device list updates</a>; and</li>
<li>another spurt of work to get complement (finally!) testing Synapse in worker mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking personally, my efforts to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11537">manage Synapse's dependencies</a> using poetry are coming to a close. As I write this, I've just submitted <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12478">my last (planned!) PR</a> for <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/54#card-80652082">this project</a>. It's been several months in progress now, and there were many moving parts; some unexpected <a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3ABug+author%3ADMRobertson">bugs in <code>poetry</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9644">even one in <code>pip</code></a>; plus a heck of a lot of CI config to change and understand. My sincere thanks to the broader Synapse team for their help in getting the last batch of changes made, reviewed and merged. Once this is all said and done I hope we'll all reap the benefits of</p>
<ul>
<li>a stabler CI pipeline,</li>

<p>A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.</p>
<p>This week brings many new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>KT&lt;-&gt; Matrix message deletion/redaction
<ul>
<li>Note that KT doesn't allow deleting a message if it's too old, so Matrix-&gt;KT redactions will fail for old messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KT-&gt;Matrix user name/avatar live updates
<ul>
<li>As opposed to only being updated on backfill / manual sync</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KT&lt;-&gt;Matrix read receipts
<ul>
<li>Caveat: KT-&gt;Matrix read receipts are only updated live, not on backfill / manual sync</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KT-&gt;Matrix member join/leave
<ul>
<li>Only joins were tested so far, but leaves should work too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KT&lt;-&gt;Matrix admin status / power levels</li>
<li>KT-&gt;Matrix channel name, description, and cover photo</li>
<li>General stability &amp; usability improvements</li>
<li>systemd setup instructions</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also launched an instance of the bridge &amp; opened a public portal room for testing purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matrix side: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#kakaotalk-bridge-testing:miscworks.net">#kakaotalk-bridge-testing:miscworks.net</a> </li>
<li>KakaoTalk side: https://open.kakao.com/o/gjGQFuae</li>
</ul>
<p>Logging in to my bridge instance is restricted, but Matrix users can still join the room thanks to the magic of relaying!</p>
<p>At this point, I'd say the bridge is now fairly usable.  Please try self-hosting if interested!</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a long and arduous journey, LorenDB's dbus interface for Nheko got finally merged. Currently this allows you to list rooms as well as switch between them. In the future we might add simple messaging support, so that you can automatically send messages into specific rooms using scripts. The API is disabled by default, since it is not authenticated. Enable it at your own risk!</p>
<p>Another long standing PR, that finally got merged, was MTRNord (they/them)'s support for pretty power level formatting. Nheko can now tell you what changed in a power level instead of just telling you that it changed. This should make them much more accessible to users, that don't like looking at the raw event source all the time (weird, eh?).</p>
<p>The image viewer should also be more reliable now and notification counts should be correct after a restart.</p>
<p>We have also been playing around with qt6 support. At this point we have a working Qt6 branch, with a few functional regressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>No voip (gstreamer has no Qt6 support yet)</li>
<li>No drop shadows on buttons</li>
<li>No switchable color schemes</li>
</ul>
<p>So far Qt6 looks pretty great and seems to fix a lot of the minor annoyances.</p>
<p>We are also still looking for some student or interested individuum to take part in the Google Summer of Code and improve the call support in Nheko! Deadline is drawing close, so if you intend to apply, better work on your proposal quickly! If you need any feedback for your proposal, feel free to DM me and ask me to review it/questions. I'm looking forward to someone applying! &lt;3</p>

<ul>
<li>Exciting news this week; the Threads Beta is live on all platforms! If you haven‚Äôt seen Threads yet, head to Settings &gt; Labs and check it out. 
<ul>
<li>Please note; If your homeserver doesn‚Äôt yet support threads functionality you may not see the beta, or your experience will be degraded. If this applies to you, you‚Äôll see a warning message before you activate Threads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The team is continuing to squash bugs and improve performance, we‚Äôve also started working on the next improvements‚Ä¶</li>
<li>Notifications and badges are top of mind for us next. We need to ensure accuracy of badge counters and consistency between platforms (if you use more than one). We‚Äôre looking at this now so keep your eyes peeled for our upcoming MSCs.</li>

<p>A set of Rust library crates for working with the Matrix protocol. Ruma‚Äôs approach to Matrix emphasizes correctness, security, stability and performance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the last two weeks, we have been busy working towards the 0.6.0 crates.io release of Ruma. If things go to plan, it should be published in the coming weeks (but no promises). That means mostly finishing some large refactorings, but we also got some bug fixes in, as well as a number of convenience functions for working with certain events:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1065">Add RoomPowerLevelsEvent::power_levels</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1068">Add convenience methods</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1069">Add transaction_id accessors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/1055">Add convenience constructors for threads</a></li>

<blockquote>
<p>HASSkbot can be used to control an action in Home-Assistant via Matrix reactions.</p>
<p>It's an <a href="https://opsdroid.dev/">Opsdroid</a> bot, which reacts to a home-assistant entity state change (like person leaving a zone) and asks for confirmation in Matrix if it should run additional home-assistant automation.
Matrix reactions are used for confirming or canceling an action.</p>
