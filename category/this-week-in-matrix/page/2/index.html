<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Last week we mentioned that we'd have more to share this week about an easier API for accessing rooms in Matrix, and while it was our intention to have an MSC out by now, our priorities shifted slightly after the MIMI working group session at IETF 116. Some exciting news on that front though: our proposed easier API, called Linearized Matrix (apologies to all the mathematicians), is very much in line with what the working group is thinking about. So much so that we're going through the effort of writing up Matrix as a series of proper Internet-Draft specifications.</p>
<p>We don't currently have an up-to-date document which covers Linearized Matrix completely, but the short version is it allows a server to support individual rooms being linear arrays instead of DAGs. This doesn't prevent a DAG-capable server from joining the room and speaking full-blown DAG either, which is particularly important for compatibility with the existing Matrix network. Currently our efforts on Linearized Matrix are in implementation rather than documentation, though once things are slightly more stable we'll be getting an MSC out there for everyone to review more easily. Watch this space for news.</p>
<p>Following IETF 116, we have an immense amount of work ahead of us to define Matrix as the standard for interoperable chat, but we're well on our way on getting through it all. Namely, we're going around and mapping Matrix's functionality onto MIMI's concepts, defining Matrix as a proper IETF standard along the way. The expected outcome of this for the implementation authors of Matrix is a spec that is significantly easier to follow, finally.</p>
<p>For an idea of what's ahead, here's what the SCT will be looking at over the next several months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linearized Matrix (implementation &amp; MSC)</li>
<li>Extensible Events (at least the core types) - this will serve as the basis for an interoperable messaging format in our IETF drafts</li>
<li>Decentralized MLS &amp; interoperability of crypto</li>
<li>Clarification gaps and bugs in the current spec</li>
<li>Pseudonymous user IDs and account portability</li>
<li>Almost certainly something that was missed when writing this list</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering the above list, the Matrix 2.0 objectives (sliding sync, OIDC, native VoIP conferencing, and faster room joins), and the core team's work around mentions, abuse reporting, and more, the SCT will be a bit busy. That said, if you have MSCs you think we should be looking at, let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> room. We've recently started doing our weekly planning in that room too, which should help give an idea for what the SCT is expecting to look at each week.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2966">[WIP] MSC2966: Usage of OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration in Matrix</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC provides a mechanism for implementing Dynamic Client Registration (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591">RFC 7591</a>) for OAuth 2.0 between Matrix clients and homeservers. Without this, homeserver admins would need to manually configure OAuth metadata (Redirect URIs, application names, client secrets, <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/oauth-parameters/oauth-parameters.xhtml#client-metadata">and more</a>) for every Matrix client that wanted to connect to the homeserver. Since that doesn't really scale in an environment that allows anyone to use any client they like, dynamic registration is critical! Dynamic registration allows clients to communicate this metadata to the homeserver at the login/registration step.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2966">MSC2966</a> is part of a series of MSCs that add first-class OpenID Connect (OIDC) support to Matrix. You can see an overview of the related MSCs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861">here</a>) and https://areweoidcyet.com/ for the latest progress on integrating OIDC into the Matrix spec!</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org">Shay</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's yet another Friday which means it's TWIM day. This week the backend team released Synapse 1.80.0. Notable highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in which the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3roomsroomidreporteventid"><code>POST /_matrix/client/v3/rooms/{roomId}/report/{eventId}</code></a> endpoint would return the wrong error if the user did not have permission to view the event. This aligns Synapse's implementation with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2249">MSC2249</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.75.0rc1 where the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/postgres.html#porting-from-sqlite">SQLite port_db script</a>would fail to open the SQLite database</li>
<li>Stabilized support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3966">MSC3966</a>: <code>event_property_contains</code> push condition</li>
<li>Fixed a long-standing bug in which the user directory would assume any remote membership state events represent a profile change</li>
</ul>
<p>and much more! You can learn more here in the release notes: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been quiet for a while, but mostly because I was busy or I felt like there was nothing worth talking about. But this time I fixed a bug, that I am actually so proud of, that I need to share it!</p>
<p>I regularly ban users in my rooms temporarily, if they are behaving like an asshole and I want to show them, that such a behaviour is not accepted, even if they usually contribute useful stuff. This tactic has in general worked pretty well and led to a noticeable improvement in the conversation culture in those rooms.</p>
<p>HOWEVER one bug has plagued us for ages and made this method way more destructive, than it should be. Everytime you banned someone on a single user homeserver or even just if they were the only user in the room from that server, you couldn't unban them. That is because there is no member in the room anymore to send the unban event to, so the other server never received an unban. Now, you might think, why is that a problem, you can join the room initially as well. And that was my thought as well, but considering that this bug was transferred to Github in 2016 and several people looked at it, I thought it was just way more complicated to fix. But since I hit this a few times a year and sometimes even multiple times a month, I spent a lot of time looking at the issue on Github. And I did see a few times, that there was a Complement test for it and every server passed that test, but only Synapse got blocklisted. So it couldn't be a fundamental problem...</p>
<p>So I thought, okay, this is annoying me regularly now, I will just get my hands dirty this time and fix it. Even if it takes me weeks or months. So I set up Complement, allowed the test to run on Synapse and watched it fail. Sadly, the complement logs were so long, that I couldn't find the actual error, but a few tries (and hours of runtime) later I got useful output, searched for the error message in synapse and looked at the code. It looked more complicated than Dendrite, all of the membership transitions were in 1 function instead of different ones. But apart from that, the obvious thing that jumped out was that Synapse verified against the room state if the user was allowed to join before checking if it was in the room and then attempting a remote join. Now usually it makes sense to verify the state locally, but not if you are not in the room, so I just moved the in room check up a bit and moved the local verification behind that check, so that the local state is only used for verification, if we are in the room. And it worked! So apart from indentation changes, this was a 1 line change in Complement, a 1 line change in Sytest (to make it fail on the right error) and a 3 line change in synapse (+ 50 lines or so of indentation changes...). This bug has been bothering me for ages and that was all it took to fix!</p>
<p>Now, bugs often look easy in hindsight, so don't use this to judge the Synapse devs or anyone. I just had the right motivation and a bit of luck finding the problem quickly (and help from Synapse devs). Possibly that change broke something else deep down in Synapse and we get to deal with demons soon. But I am happy for now!</p>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we focused on build system improvements. First, a huge thank you to Giovanni Bottaro for digging into the Ubuntu docker image
and slimming it down to nearly half its size. It's still not as compact as our Alpine image, which is the smallest of any of the Matrix
servers, but it's the one I would say is the most stable at this time. On the heels of this, I decided to overhaul the docker image matrix.
Construct now offers several dozen combination docker images from Ubuntu 22.04, 22.10, Alpine 3.16, 3.17, gcc-10, 11, 12,
clang 14, 15, and on arm64 with neon, amd64 with avx, avx2, and avx512.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While I was mostly spelunking in CI land, some people did some really cool stuff!</p>
<p>Dtelsing implemented screenshare support on Wayland. This requires a proper pipewire + xdg-desktop-portal ScreenCast interface setup, but it means Nheko will properly ask your OS for a screenshare and your OS then gets to decide, what screen or window you are allowed to share. Especially considering how little documentation there is for this, I am pretty impressed how quickly they got this working and it seems to work quite nicely on the platforms I have tested, but feel free to test it yourself and report issues you find!</p>
<p>LorenDB tweaked the design of our switches, because they bothered him. Now, I have no eye for that, so I can't tell you what changed, but I assume people who can tell if something is pretty will be happy! Ryandesign also fixed the macOS build on case sensitive filesystems, a pseudonymous contributor added querying your own status message to the dbus interface and Nheko now linkifies improperly encoded matrix.to links again.</p>
<p>I think that is all, thank you all for the cool contributions!</p>

<p>The Matrix.org Foundation (mostly Travis) are beavering away preparing for the MIMI meeting at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/116/">IETF 116</a> this weekend! This is part of our continual work to contribute to a IETF standard that can be used for interoperable messaging between gatekeepers (large companies in the chat world) under the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220315IPR25504/deal-on-digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-competition-and-more-choice-for-users">EU's Digital Markets Act</a>. See <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/29/how-do-you-implement-interoperability-in-a-dma-world">our earlier blogpost</a> for more context on this topic.</p>
<p>In terms of our previous proposals on this subject; it turns out that implementing full-scale DAGs is a bit difficult, particularly when aiming to achieve interoperability on a short timeline. So we've been working on building an API surface for Matrix which makes rooms easier to access/implement in chat settings. We unfortunately don't have much to share today, but keep an eye on next week's TWIM for details üëÄ</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3480">MSC3480: Make device names private</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC proposes hiding device names from <em>any</em> other user, while still allowing your own devices to see the names of the others.</p>
<p>You may question why device names being shown to other users was considered a good idea at all in Matrix. Initially these being public was really useful for verifying the devices of other users! Back in the days before <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#cross-signing">cross-signing</a> (where you only need to verify another user once), you had to verify every one of your friend's devices from every one of your own devices. It was an n * m problem, whereas if you had 4 devices, and your friend had 5, you'd need to do 20 verifications! And 4 more if your friend got a new phone!</p>
<p>So having device names back then were handy, but today any justification is moot and they're just a metadata leak. So we should get rid of them!</p>
<p>This MSC is blocked on a proven implementation. I actually <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/anoa/msc3480">wrote one up</a> for Synapse a little while ago, and I plan to polish and merge it soon. Anyone else is free to do so in the meantime as well (just let me know first if you plan to do so in Synapse :).</p>
<p>Here's to improved privacy by default in Matrix!</p>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week Construct introduced Peristalith Mode in an effort to fill the void left by last week's unfortunate demise of Dendrite's Polylith mode. Peristalith allows multiple instances of Construct to scale together in a hub-and-spoke configuration. This is a single-writer/multiple-reader strategy which uses the filesystem to share data between instances. In the long run, we're still working on Construct Cluster which is a homogeneous multiple-reader/multiple-writer design using Matrix itself for communication. For now, this is an improvement over simply not having any solution in case your deployment really needs to shed some load quickly. I'd like to thank Yan Minari for coming up with some Traefik configs for this and we're going to be spending the weekend playing around with it.</p>

<h3 id="nheko-website">Nheko (<a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0xDEADCADE fixed a few dialog windows, that would get a width of 0 on some window managers. Meanwhile tastytea made the scroll down button automatically refocus the message input.</p>
<p>The other work (apart from some cool work in progress stuff, was mostly minor improvements to communities. LcsTen made unjoinable and unpreviewable rooms in a community now hidden by default. This matches what the /hierarchy API does and as such what other clients show and since you have no way to fix it, why bother you with it? Admins of a community can still see those rooms and are suggested to remove them, since nobody will be able to join them. While the upsides generally outweigh them, there are a few downsides to this approach. Some users will never see some rooms in a community now and will have no way of telling you about the room not being joinable. Note that this only affects rooms added using a m.space.child event. The correct way to add a hidden room to a community, is by only setting a parent in that room. But many clients don't do that or rooms just naturally become unjoinable because of membership changes.</p>
<p>The last one is now properly handled in Nheko. Nheko will regularly update the join information for community rooms now. Each space child or parent event usually includes some routing information to figure out, what servers are in the room. If that server list is outdated, you will not be able to join the room, because none of the servers in the list know about the room anymore. Nheko now checks every 20 minutes if any of your space relation events haven't been updated in more than a week and if that is the case (and you have space edit permissions), it verifies that the routing information would still be the same if Nheko updated it. If it isn't, Nheko will write the new routing information into the state event. This is a bit of a compromise, since you might have more member changes in 7 days and the room can still become unroutable, but this is done to prevent to frequent updates if clients come to different results for the routing information. This should improve the long term experience of communities by a lot, since you won't have them randomly break anymore.</p>
<p>I talked a lot about routing information now. The spec actually has a section for how to calculate that: https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/appendices/#routing. Nheko now implements that algorithm slightly more correctly, but we still don't implement everything. This should make room links look more reasonable and prevents some of the problems talked about in the previous section. Some parts I haven't implemented yet though. Nheko does not ignore ip address only servers (for now). And we also decided to ignore the powerlevel &gt;= 50 requirement and changed it to users that have a <code>powerlevel &gt;= max(events_default, state_default)</code>. This is done, because the spec handwaves away concerns, that rooms might have non-default powerlevels, but I am in a lot of those and it would be annoying to me.</p>
<p>I guess this was a bit of a more technical update this time, but maybe it had some interesting bits. I spent a lot of time the last weeks fixing stuff in Qt, profiling memory usage as well as code size and others are working on cool stuff as well, so stay tuned for next week. :3</p>

<h3 id="the-next-generation-of-integration-managers-is-finally-here">The next generation of Integration Managers is finally here!</h3>
<p>(with a familiar bridge backing it!)</p>
<p>I am once again happy to report on our latest integrations work at Element.
<a href="https://youtu.be/HlsMMzTFZ_A">A couple of weeks ago</a> you heard from me and Justin on the new Integration manager
that we've been working away on and we're pleased to announce it's now LIVE
and has replaced our old IM, Scalar.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/20230324-im.png" alt="New integration manager screenshot" /></p>
<p>Alongside the new IM, we've replaced the old Go-NEB powered bots with their
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot</a> equivalents. This means you can now <a href="https://ems-docs.element.io/books/element-cloud-documentation/page/migrate-to-the-new-github-and-feeds-bots#If-you-have-issues">press buttons</a> to migrate yourselves off the old bots.  As an aside, all the changes we've made to hookshot to scale up for the big release are of course landing in the open source project, should you wish to spin up your own bots instead. We're hoping that the ability to now embed our all-powerful config widgets directly into the integration manager will make it easier to add new features to these already-powerful bots.</p>
<p>If you encounter any issues, please post an issue in https://github.com/vector-im/element-integration-manager/issues where we will be happy to assist!</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3980">MSC3980: Dotted Field Consistency</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1796">MSC1796: improved e2e notifications</a> (close)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accepted MSCs:</strong></p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3978">MSC3978: Deprecate room tagging</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The Spec Core Team has started to publish their weekly list of MSCs to focus on reviewing in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">Office of the Spec Core Team</a> room. The list consists of the MSCs that are ready for immediate review, and would most help advance the Matrix protocol on any given week. This used to happen internally (they started out as weekly ping by a bot, and then slowly became curated by our resident human, Travis). But the idea to publish the list both allows people to easily follow along with what they're doing on a weekly basis (much like these posts, but in real time!), as well as helps push subsequent discussion to public channels.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Travis continues to be hard at work integrating Matrix into the IETF process. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3923">MSC3923</a> - initially published in November 2022 - was proposed for FCP this week (and has nearly passed!). Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3977">MSC3977</a> was published this week and talks about how Matrix is a great fit for the goals of the IETF's MIMI working group.</p>
<p>This is all ahead of the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/116/">IETF 116</a> event which starts on March 26th. The Matrix.org Foundation will be attending remotely.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3735">MSC3735: Add device information to m.room_key.withheld message</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC proposes adding a new field, <code>from_device</code>, to <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#mroom_keywithheld"><code>m.room_key.withheld</code></a> messages. This to-device message type is used to inform devices why a megolm session was not sent to them after they requested it.</p>
<p>Devices can request megolm sessions from multiple devices at once, but upon receiving a <code>m.room_key.withheld</code> message from one of them is currently unable to tell <em>which</em> of the devices responded with that message.</p>
<p>The proposed <code>from_device</code> field should not be added to <code>m.room_key.withheld</code> messages that are sent outside of key request flows.</p>

<h3 id="construct-website">Construct (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">website</a>)</h3>
<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct is inching closer toward public-registration safety for its upcoming 1.0 release. This week I'd like to thank tiix for helping me fix a bug in the registration availability checker, and @dynfox for dropping some documentation for how to launch Construct dockers with certbot.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank @qg:schildi.chat and @bgiovanni for helping me hunt down an elusive auth-rules divergence between Synapse and Construct. This bug affects Synapse users who have been kicked from a room before the summer of 2022 by an admin who runs Construct. After Synapse 1.62, those users are not able to rejoin that room -- ever. This was due to a bug which added unnecessary <code>m.room.join_rules</code> to the <code>auth_events</code> which is no longer accepted by Synapse after that version. This is now fixed on our end going forward, but fixing this retroactively is something I'll be working on over the weekend. I'd like to send my regards to Philantrop üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà who first brought this to my attention and is still trying to get back into <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> even at this very moment. Don't worry, we haven't forgotten you! üòÅ</p>
<p>Construct has over five years of battle-tested experience federating at scale from the very first days of Matrix. If you're looking for an alternative to Synapse to run on a cheap host: less than or equal to 100% CPU usage is our guarantee or your money back. I use it every day at</p>

<p>Howdy folks, another big release for you coming up. So you remember how last week Justin and Myself came onto <a href="https://youtu.be/HlsMMzTFZ_A">Matrix Live</a> to talk about the new
bridge widgets and show off how sleek and snappy they are? Well, Hookshot is <strong>also</strong> getting some updates of a similar flavor. The more observant of you may be starting to notice a pattern
of us tarting up our public integrations. Something might well be on the horizon very, very soon :)</p>
<p>In the meantime, here are the latest changes for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/3.0.0">Hookshot 3.0.0</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add support from migrating go-neb services to Hookshot (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/647">#647</a>)</li>
<li>Implement grant system to internally record all approved connections in hookshot. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/655">#655</a>)</li>
<li>Add support for logging into GitHub via OAuth from bridge widgets. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/661">#661</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>and a bunch of other changes too!</p>
<p>You'll notice we're migrating to a grant system for approving connections, which is why this is considered a breaking major release. <strong>Please check the
notes before updating</strong> and give us a quick message if you have any issues or concerns.</p>
<p>And with that, I wish you all a great weekend!</p>

<p>As predicted 3 weeks ago, Fractal 4.4.2 has been released and is available on Flathub.</p>
<p>As a reminder, there are no new features, but it makes Fractal compatible with newer versions of our dependencies. Big thanks to everyone who tested the beta version and feel free to uninstall it.</p>
<p>In another news, let's talk a bit about Fractal 5‚Ä¶</p>
<p>We have finally implemented one of the most annoying missing features: sending read receipts and updating the fully-read marker. What is doubly great about this, is that we are now only one feature away from being regression-free compared to our stable release (and a merge request is opened for the last one)!</p>
<p>This means that a beta release is around the corner, but we also have serious performance issues to resolve first. We hope that switching to the new store backend currently developed in the Matrix Rust SDK will fix some of it, but we still need to investigate properly how we can improve the situation.</p>

<p>The Elm SDK has reached an unofficial alpha version! It can be downloaded and used for testing purposes.
Now that the core has been finished, the exposed modules <code>Matrix</code>, <code>Matrix.Room</code> and <code>Matrix.RoomInvite</code> are available with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated login &amp; sync</li>
<li>Joining / leaving rooms</li>
<li>Accepting / rejecting invites</li>
<li>Receiving the latest events of a room</li>
</ul>
<p>Before publishing a version 1.0.0, I aim to implement the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated login &amp; sync for spec version <code>v1.1</code> and legacy versions <code>r.0.0.0</code> - <code>r0.6.1</code> using sync v1</li>
<li>Room membership manipulation <em>(invite, kick, ban, knock users/rooms)</em></li>
<li>A few QOL functions to explore a room's state</li>

<h1 id="flip-matrix-bot-website-1">flip-matrix-bot (<a href="https://gitlab.com/FriendlyLinuxPlayers/flip-matrix-bot">website</a>)</h1>
<p>In the past two weeks, there have been a bunch of small improvements. The <a href="https://friendlylinuxplayers.org/events">events page</a> of the community website now lists upcoming events, and the event pages themselves have received some polish. As a result, links to event web pages are now included in the output of several commands. This makes it easier to see the event time in your local time and to share the event with people who are not in the Matrix room.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, improving these web pages brings us a step closer to integrating with <a href="https://gitlab.com/FriendlyLinuxPlayers/flip-matrix-bot/-/issues/23">Steam</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/FriendlyLinuxPlayers/flip-matrix-bot/-/issues/16">Mastodon</a>. I've started to investigate these further, but there isn't much to report yet.</p>
<p>Besides website-related improvements, I took some time to add unit tests for the lowest-hanging fruit parts of the code. There are more tests to be added, and further testing improvements may be possible in the future after some refactoring, but this is not a high priority for me right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Searching for people to hand over a business idea of paid bridges for Matrix users to other messengers, for free!</strong></p>
<p>I have a business idea to make a paid service for bridging Matrix (<a href="http://matrix.org/">matrix.org</a>) with other messengers using the Bridges feature (https://matrix.org/bridges/). It's like <a href="http://beeper.com/">beeper.com</a>, but which works with any MXID on any homeserver. And like <a href="http://t2bot.io/">t2bot.io</a>, but commercial one and with more bridges available. Yes, t2bot.io is a great project, but free services usually got occupied by a lot of accounts, especially by spammers, and managing all of them for free sounds not so perspective to me. But <a href="http://bridged.to/">bridged.to</a> could also provide some free services for the community.</p>
<p>For that purposes I‚Äôve bought a <a href="http://bridged.to/">bridged.to</a> domain several years ago, to make cool identifiers of bridges like <code>@telegram:bridged.to</code>, <code>@whatsapp:bridged.to</code>, etc.</p>
<p>But I still can‚Äôt find time to implement this idea at all. So, I‚Äôve decided to stop paying for this domain and want to hand over this domain and the whole idea to someone else, who has the time and energy to implement this project.</p>
<p>The idea was to make the payments flexible, per-bridge, for example, $1 per month for each bridge. So, if a user will use bridges to Telegram + FaceBook + Instagram + WhatsApp, they will pay $4 per month, if they stop using some bridges - they pay less. And give a free trial period of 2 weeks for new users, to give it a try.</p>
<p>From the technical point of view, this should look like a standard Synapse server with a custom python module that just block-unblocks sending of messages by the user‚Äôs account balance, and also can gather some usage statistics (number of bridged messages per user, etc), and bridges instances, connected via appservices. And some admin panel with UI to manage and administrate this.</p>
<p>All this sounds easy to implement, but I have a lot of tasks at my main job, so have no time to accomplish this, and have decided to hand over this idea to someone else, who might be interested in it, for free.</p>
<p>So, if you‚Äôre interested in this idea or want to know more, or even just want to grab the cool <a href="http://bridged.to/">bridged.to</a> domain for free - please feel free to contact me via Matrix - @murz:ru-matrix.org.</p>
<p>The domain annual cost is $41.98, it's on namecheap.com, expires at Mar 28, 2023.</p>

<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3972">MSC3972</a>: Lexicographical strings as an ordering mechanism!</p>
<p>While there already is an MSC for a top-level ordering of Spaces in use across some client implementations today (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3230">MSC3230</a>), the algorithm recommended for clients to implement apparently has some consistency flaws, leading to edge cases. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3972">MSC3972</a> attempts to address this by providing a different algorithm that does not have these flaws. A real-world implementation of the algorithm is also available today in Kotlin at https://github.com/Dominaezzz/MatrixSort.</p>
<p>Neither of these algorithms have been merged to the spec yet, but this new MSC may finally push this conversation forwards! I recommend client developers give it a read and leave their feedback as Pull Request Review comments on the MSC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey everyone, it's been a while since I've posted an update here, but I'm pleased to report that progress on <strong>Telodendria</strong> is still steady. Here's a small glimpse into what's happening with the project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>v0.2.1:</strong> The second major release of <strong>Telodendria</strong> was published earlier this week. <strong>Telodendria</strong> still isn't much yet, but the user authentication section of the client-server specification is just about complete. This means you can register for accounts, log in and get access tokens, and then log out. All the stuff that goes with that, including the static login fallback page, and user interactive authentication is in place.</li>
<li><strong>What's Next:</strong> I'm hoping to start working on the account management endpoints next. I also want to start building out an HTTP client for federation, and I want to move the configuration file into the database, so that <strong>Telodendria</strong> is configured via an admin API endpoint instead of a file. The thinking here is that this enables <strong>Telodendria</strong> to be configured at runtime, without having to restart the process to apply configuration changes.</li>
<li><strong>Help Wanted:</strong> As always, I could use your help. This is a huge project, and I am very busy so I can't dedicate as much time as I'd like to it. If you find <strong>Telodendria</strong> interesting and want it to continue, feel free to join us over in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria-general:bancino.net">#telodendria-general:bancino.net</a>, write some code and documentation, donate to the project, or any and all of the above!</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/farooqkz/chooj">chooj</a>, the Matrix client for KaiOS feature phones, has seen many changes in the last few weeks. Many bugs were fixed and many others are probably added. We now support many other events other than message events which you can view in the rooms plus an experimental image viewer to better investigate the received images. Other than that, by removing the files KaiOS doesn't use, the production bundle size is half now. A big internal change also happened and still is not finished yet. With the assist of Simon Laux, a big portion of chooj is now <a href="https://github.com/farooqkz/KaiUIng">a separate library</a> which makes maintenance easier and also lets other KaiOS apps use them. I have written my plans for chooj in <a href="https://blog.bananahackers.net/farooqkz/chooj-is-back-into-the-game">my last post</a> in the BananaHackers blog. If you like to see Matrix chat on the KaiOS feature phones, you can donate an amount to help with the development of the project. Or you can donate me a debug enabled KaiOS phone with the mentioned features.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lorendb:nheko.im">LorenDB</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've had some fun and useful things happening in the past two weeks!</p>
<ul>
<li>red_sky (nheko.im) worked on automating the release process to automatically create a release when a tag is pushed. This might not sound like much, but it makes life easier for maintainers who would otherwise have to waste time manually creating releases. After all, why would you want to write release notes when you could be writing code?</li>
<li>Nico tweaked styling for HTML tables to increase the padding. Thanks to Cadair for the suggestion!</li>
<li>Nico also fixed a bug that showed avatar changes as somebody joining a room. I seem to recall this also happening when users changed their display names, but I can't reproduce that behavior. Either way, it is nice to have this fix in place!</li>
<li>I worked on closing some of our issues, and I'm happy to report that there are fewer ways to be unpleasantly surprised by the UI. For example, if you have turned on the setting to make emoji-only messages larger, all other emojis will also get a bit of a size boost to make them easier to read.</li>
<li>On that note, I recently went through the issue list and closed a number of outdated issues that had already been fixed, because 260+ issues is obviously too many for any self-respecting project... right? ;)</li>
<li>I also overhauled nheko's behavior when you attempt to use an invalid /command. Originally, nheko would eat any invalid commands (e.g. sending <code>/foo</code> would clear the input box but would not send a message). Now, if you type <code>/foo</code>, you will see a warning informing you that you are about to send a message that says <code>/foo</code> into the chat instead of running a command <code>/foo</code>. If you choose to disregard the warnings and hit Enter, nheko will indeed send a message saying <code>/foo</code>!</li>
</ul>
<p>But that's not all: this week, mtxclient gained the ability to properly handle <code>m.room.message</code> events that have an unknown <code>msgtype</code>. With that in place, I'm working on implementing that on the nheko side. Once this work is done, you will be able to read messages that others send from Element with fireworks! Furthermore, I'm adding a bonus feature to nheko: as a proof-of-concept for fully implementing this unknown message handling, I've got a working implementation of Element's rainfall effect for those of you who like fancy effects! (All the rest of you can just turn those off in the settings, I guess.)</p>
<p>A note for our Mac users: somebody opened <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/1401">an issue</a> last week notifying us that nheko couldn't be installed on OS X 11.1. Nico has fixed this, but you will need to either wait for the next release or install one of our nightly builds (#nheko-nightlies:neko.dev).</p>

<p><em>Additions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Command <code>ement-room-override-name</code> sets a local override for a room's display name. (Especially helpful for 1:1 rooms and bridged rooms.  See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3015#issuecomment-1451017296">MSC3015</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Changes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve display of room tombstones (displayed at top and bottom of buffer, and new room ID is linked to join).</li>
<li>Use descriptive prompts in <code>ement-leave-room</code> and <code>ement-forget-room</code> commands.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fixes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Command <code>ement-view-space</code> when called from a room buffer.  (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MagicRB">Richard Bre≈æ√°k</a> for reporting.)</li>
<li>Don't call <code>display-buffer</code> when reverting room list buffer.  (Fixes <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/121">#121</a>.  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mekeor">mekeor</a> for reporting.)</li>
<li>Retry sync for network timeouts. (Accidentally broken in v0.6.) </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Internal</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Function <code>ement-put-account-data</code> accepts <code>:room</code> argument to put on a room's account data.</li>

<p>It's been some time since <code>synadm</code> last showed up on TWIM, it was around summer 2022. The biggest news is that <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@martin:matrix.ascurius.com">Ascurius</a> and me just welcomed a new member to the team: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jacksonchen666:jacksonchen666.com">jacksonchen666</a>. We reached out since he seemed to care about <code>synadm</code>. He had submitted a feature but we also caught him tidying up &quot;unloved&quot; issues. He has a good sense for concise solutions and accurate documentation. He runs <a href="https://jacksonchen666.com/">a website</a> and <a href="https://jacksonchen666.com/posts/">a blog</a> where he talks about &quot;things&quot;.</p>
<p>Here's more we'd like to spread:</p>
<ul>
<li>A random list of new commands, <a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index_cli_reference.html">read details in the docs to learn what they do</a>: <code>synadm notice send</code>, <code>synadm user 3pid</code>, <code>synadm user auth-provider</code>, <code>synadm room block/unblock</code> <code>synadm room block-status</code>, <code>synadm media unquarantine</code>, <code>synadm user modify --user-type ...</code>, <code>synadm user deactivate-regex</code>.</li>
<li>A new output mode <code>minified</code> was added and the original <code>json</code> mode was improved to now produce nicely human readable json.</li>
<li>We finally have <a href="https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">a contributing documentation</a> and hope it'll make collaboration with our contributors even better.</li>
<li>We introduced an auto-linter based on <code>flake8</code> into our CI pipeline to catch code formatting issues quicker.</li>
<li>The new <a href="https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">Scripting Examples chapter</a>. Please submit your one-liners or other helpful scripting examples via a pull-request or just let us know in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at">#synadm:peek-a-boo.at</a></li>

<p>By the way, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jacksonchen666:jacksonchen666.com">jacksonchen666</a> searched for <code>synadm</code> occurrences in the TWIM history and we found an article &quot;next to us&quot; about the <a href="https://cfp.summit2022.matrixmeetup.de/matrix-summit-conference-2022/">Matrix Community Summit 2022</a> that took place in Berlin last summer.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ben:acter.global">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shortly after releasing <a href="https://effektio.org/whitepaper/">our whitepaper</a> end of last year, Effektio was approached by another organization, who has been building a NGO communication platform for a few years called <a href="https://acter.global">Acter</a>. Acter wanted to move away from their current centralized stack and had found Matrix.org 's Federated Model to be their preferred ideal. Very quickly within the talks that followed it became clear that both organization have the same goals and visions for the future and are perfectly matching in terms of what they already bring and what each lacks: Effektio has the technological stack, expertise and ability to build the product while Acter has existing a network of organizations, partners and even existing users, who are happy to provide feedback. Long story short, we decided to merge both into a newly funded <strong>Acter Association</strong>, which we established Jan 1st, developing the next (third) generation of the Acter Platform (&quot;A3&quot;) on top of the existing effektio tech stack. Since then a major part of our work has been merging all the admin and tech stuff, up to moving the github repo over to <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3">acterglobal/a3</a>, where you will find it from now on.</p>
<p>Next to that, we still have continued working on the product itself. Among other things we have <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/505">merged the first implementation of the Adaptive Layout in A3</a> this week, implemented the next acter object, <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/503">Pins</a>, added <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/522">Rageshake Bug Reporting</a> to the nightly builds, started out with the new <a href="https://docs.acter.global/docs/architecture/templates/">Templates</a> infrastructure and improved our quality assurance by  reactivate rust integration tests, add widget unit tests and a new cucumber desktop tests infrastructure.</p>

<li>Role &amp; permissions view for room settings is now more intuitive.</li>
<li>fine tuned the new feed indexing systems. Should be more stable now.</li>
<li>The settings page got some love and now display all the sessions and their status (verified or not). It is also possible to logout all 90+ days sessions.</li>
<li>new message search view for not encrypted conversations.</li>
<li>fixed notifications count for rooms</li>

<p>Other than spec text fixes in the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc">matrix-spec repo</a>, the Spec Core Team has mainly been focusing on push notifications, push rules and generally improving notifications across Matrix. This includes improving behaviour such as accidentally notifying someone when you mention their name, accidentally notifying people when you reply to a message, accidentally notifying when you edit a message and so on. The relevant MSCs are <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3958">MSC3958</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3873">MSC3873</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3966">MSC3966</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758">MSC3758</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, review of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575">MSC3575</a> (Sliding Sync) and other sliding sync MSCs saw some in-depth review from <a href="https://github.com/deepbluev7">Nico</a>.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3013">MSC3013: Encrypted Push</a>!</p>
<p>When you get a push notification for a new message on your phone, you may wonder how that message travels from your homeserver to you. Typically it isn't done directly - instead, when you receive a message that should notify you, your homeserver will generate a push notification specifically for you, and send this off to a Matrix Push Gateway. That Push Gateway is then configured to send your notification off to a service which knows how to route it to your device. This is usually Apple's Push Notification Service in the case of iOS devices, or Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging service in the case of Android devices (though FCM supports iOS devices too!). Your phone's OS will keep a consistent connection to one of these services if an app has registered for push notifications, and thus you can receive notifications from apps even when your Matrix client is not running.</p>
<p>But doesn't that leak all of your message notifications to Apple or Google? üò± Not quite. While clients can choose to include all contents of a message in a push notification, most instead opt for only including the event's ID. When the push notification containing that event ID reaches your phone, it wakes up a small portion of your Matrix client which goes and fetches the full message content from the homeserver (plus encryption keys if the message needs to be decrypted). This way, you can still get a notification without your Matrix client needing to be open all the time. However, some metadata (such as when you are getting a notification) is still leaked to Apple/Google. Since the third-party service knows the event ID, it can correlate which users are in the same room by cross-referencing event IDs in notifications across multiple users.</p>
<p>It's also a bit of a resource drain that the client needs to go and talk to the homeserver to fetch the full event content. Ideally we'd just include it all in the notification - but then we end up sharing too much information with the push provider!</p>
<p>This MSC proposes a solution; encrypt the message content and send that in the notification! Message contents are encrypted using a public key provided by the client to the homeserver when registering for push notifications. The ciphertext passes through the Push Gateway (which may be run by a separate entity to your homeserver) and the Push Notification service (run by Apple, Google, etc.) and then finally down to your client where it is decrypted without the need for a web request as the private key will just be stored in the client.</p>
<p>And since a separate encryption key is being used per-device, ciphertexts of the same event will differ when encrypted for different users - eliminating the Push Gateway/Push Notification Service from being to correlate notifications across users (timing attacks are still possible, but this can be reduced by introducing a small amount of jitter into when notifications are sent out).</p>
<p>Anyhoo, if you're big on privacy (or security against those running Push Gateway/Notification Services), check out this MSC!</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org">Shay</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to another edition of the Synapse section of TWIM. This week
we've released Synapse v1.78.0, packed with features and bugfixes.</p>
<p>Some notable highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>an update to the command line export data tool</li>
<li>implemented the experimental <code>exact_event_match</code> push rule condition from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758">MSC3758</a></li>
<li>implemented <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3873">MSC3873</a> to disambiguate push rule keys with dots in them.</li>
<li>allow Synapse to use a specific Redis <a href="https://redis.io/commands/select/">logical database</a> in worker-mode deployments.</li>
<li>fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.76 where 5 second delays would occasionally occur in deployments using workers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus much more! You can check out the details <a href="vector://vector/webapp/(https://matrix.org/blog/posts)">here</a> or take a deep dive in the release notes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.78.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, seven additional endpoints from the synapse admin API have been ported to Construct. These include user room listings, account data, devices, pushers, and forward extremities pruning. This week it also became easier for admins to tune database options to meet their needs through the configuration system. To put things into perspective, the server now has 2184 configurable items which can be set by an environment variable. Construct also has 6177 statistical items which can be reported to a Prometheus metrics daemon.</p>
<p>Lastly I would like to share good news on the compatibility front after taking some time to investigate why Construct and Conduit have trouble federating. I reached out with a patchset to the folks over at Ruma and I would like to take this opportunity to commend their hospitality. Their conduct has been nothing short of diplomatic, giving confidence we can now iron out any kinks in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>mautrix-go has had e2ee support for a few years already, but previously the interface was quite difficult to use for making bots and other small programs, as it required implementing parts of the storage and other things manually. That has changed with the upcoming 0.15 release, which adds a crypto helper that can handle everything for you with just a few extra lines of code. The documentation is unfortunately not great yet, but the <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/go/blob/master/example/main.go">example</a> has been updated to use the new helper, so it should be a decent starting point for writing e2ee-capable bots in Go (and if it explodes, you can ask for help in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#:maunium.net">#:maunium.net</a>)</p>

<h2 id="curated-msc-of-the-week">Curated MSC of the week</h2>
<p>This week's <del>random</del> chosen MSC is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575">MSC3575: Sliding Sync</a>! It's one of the largest (or is the largest?) MSCs we've ever had, and dramatically changes how clients actually get updates from the server. It's worth the read if you're a client developer, though the team working on it is ironing out some bugs. Let us know what you think on the MSC :)</p>

<p>Howdy, welcome to another week in Synapse-land. We've released  v1.78.0rc1
with some cool bugfixes and features. Some notable additions in this version are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a long-standing bug where the room aliases returned could be corrupted. </li>
<li>Fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.76.0 where partially-joined rooms could not be deleted using the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#delete-room-api">purge room API</a>. </li>
<li>Fixed a long-standing bug where federated joins would fail if the first server in the list of servers to try is not in the room.</li>
<li>Implement the experimental <code>exact_event_match</code> push rule condition from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758">MSC3758</a>.</li>
<li>Added account data to the command line <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.78/usage/administration/admin_faq.html#how-can-i-export-user-data">user data export tool</a></li>

<h3 id="construct-website">Construct (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">website</a>)</h3>
<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's been progress in several areas for Construct 0.9 this week, cut with 71 new commits. First I'd like to give special thanks for @bgiovanni for continuing to drive the progress this week; they have on several occasions been able to navigate the codebase and the specification to provide concise reports so I can fix anything in mere minutes. I hope we can keep this up.</p>
<p>Construct can now be configured to purge a room from the database after the last local user leaves. This week I also took the plunge on implementing a controversial clause in the specification which requires a server to broadcast a join event on behalf of another server. This is problematic because it's technically an amplification attack, so I've done my best to narrow the conditions for when to actually perform this: only if the counter-party is not already joined, and only if Construct has an alias set for the room being joined.</p>
<p>In other news, I <a href="https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio/pull/1215">fixed a bug</a> in <code>boost::asio</code> but since that won't land for a while and Construct's <code>io_uring(7)</code> might be susceptible on Arch and Gentoo <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/commit/884c2e68b71c92d223d312f60f35b9be81960a8c">I hacked a workaround</a> just for us, especially since the old <code>epoll(7)</code> + <code>aio(7)</code> makes my desktop much less responsive (I can't believe I dealt with that for years!).</p>
<p>Next week Yan Minari might have a deeper look at Sytest and Complement integration and maybe mdad, while I plan on implementing local room policies and user management to make Construct safe for public registration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello all! Fractal 4.4.2-beta2 is available on Flathub Beta.</p>
<p>You read correctly, it's not Fractal 5 yet. This is a maintenance release that fixes the compilation of Fractal 4.4 with recent libraries and allows to build the Flatpak with the latest GNOME runtime. That means no more warning that the GNOME 41 runtime is outdated!</p>
<p>There are no new features, but since we updated a lot of Rust dependencies we preferred to release a beta version before using it to update our stable release to the latest runtime. So please test it and if no major regression is reported, we will release it as stable in two weeks.</p>
<p>To get it, run the following commands:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo
</span><span>flatpak install flathub-beta org.gnome.Fractal
</span><span>flatpak run --branch=beta org.gnome.Fractal
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that if you always want to use this beta version instead of the stable one, and run it from the icon in your launcher, you will need to change its desktop file to use the command in the last line.</p>
<p>See you soon with some news regarding Fractal 5 hopefully!</p>

<p>Entering the <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-meetings"><em>matrix-meetings-widget</em></a>!
The widget allows to plan meetings, invite other users, configure meetings rooms, view your calendar, and perform video conferences.
All data is stored in Matrix, no external service required. As the Widget API is a bit limited for this use-cases, it's a combination of a widget and a bot.</p>
<p>As a small teaser: We are in the progress of building a whiteboard widget that is fully based on Matrix without an external storage.

<p>With the Extensible Events Core (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) being accepted last week, the focus now turns to all the other extensible event MSCs for images, files, etc. How does extensible events relate to IETF/MIMI/DMA, you ask? In our mission for having Matrix be the standard for interoperability, we need a content format that works for everyone. Events prior to MSC1767 <em>could</em> work with enough effort, though MSC1767's system makes things <em>a lot</em> easier when representing arbitrarily complex messaging features.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to TWIM for progress in this area. It's a relatively slow process, but we're working through it.</p>

<p>We released another breaking change this week :p bump to v0.17.0</p>
<p>Introduced a couple of new features like upgrading voice calls to video calls, some neat helper functions for group calls. Fixes include cleaning group call state events, fixing the searchEvent function, a way to get own profile from server and then fallback to room profile and also fixes to the /markasdm command.</p>
<p>Complete changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>fix: ability to upgrade audio calls to video calls (td)</li>
<li>chore: add a fetchOwnProfileFromServer method which tries to get ownProfile from server first, disk then (td)</li>
<li>fix: clean expired member state events in group calls (td)</li>
<li>fix: hasActiveGroup call now checks all group calls (td)</li>
<li>fix: Check if argument is valid mxid in /maskasdm command (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>fix: Fake User object (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>fix: Request key in searchEvent method crashes because of wrong preconditions (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>refactor: Check config at file sending after placing fake event and add error handling (Krille)</li>
<li>chore: bump dart to 2.18 (Nicolas Werner)</li>
<li>fix: setMicrophoneMuted is now async to match setVideoMuted (td)</li>
<li>fix: implement activeGroupCallEvents to get all active group call state events in a room (td)</li>
<li>refactor: (BREAKING CHANGE) move staleCallChecker and expires_Ts stuff to an extension on Room, instead of Voip because it makes much more sense per room rather than on voip, also makes testing easier (td)</li>
<li>fix: populate local groupCalls list on instantiating VOIP() (td)</li>
<li>fix: starting stale call checker is now handled by the sdk itself because clients can forget to do so (td)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>It's been a while since our last update in November, but it just means we have been busier than ever! A lot has happened to follow changes in the Matrix specification as well as fixing bugs in our codebase or making our API easier to use.</p>
<p>We have released Ruma 0.8.0 and 0.8.1 at the beginning of the month. It was long overdue with a lot of improvements, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stabilized support for all the changes and features of Matrix 1.4 and Matrix 1.5</li>
<li>Making our request types use owned instead of borrowed data</li>
<li>Replacing <code>ruma_api!</code> with more flexible macros</li>
<li>Fixing the serialization and deserialization of redacted events</li>
<li>Reorganizing our <code>*EventContent</code> traits to allow event content types to only implement what is really needed</li>
<li>Removing sensitive data from the <code>Debug</code>-format representation of our types </li>
</ul>
<p>And on the 15th we released Ruma 0.8.2 with a few bug fixes but also stabilized support for all the changes and features of Matrix 1.6!</p>
<p>Although it might be less visible in our changelogs, we also regularly add support for MSCs, and try to keep our implementations up-to-date. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sliding sync (MSC3575 and others, currently used by Element X via the matrix-rust-sdk)</li>
<li>Extensible events (MSC1767 and others)</li>
<li>Push rule condition for room version features (MSC3931 and MSC3932)</li>

<p>The biggest change to the bot has been the tweaking of event reminders sent in <code>#flip:flip.earth</code>. We now send a lightweight event notification 24 hours before the scheduled time of the event, and don't send one if the event takes place in 19 minutes or less.</p>
<p>Outside of these tweaks, there is a minimally-working branch that can send updates to Mastodon! See the <a href="https://gitlab.com/FriendlyLinuxPlayers/flip-matrix-bot/-/issues/16">Mastodon issue</a> for details. Before this is completed, several things need to be done, including <a href="https://gitlab.com/FriendlyLinuxPlayers/flip-matrix-bot/-/issues/28">creating events on our website</a>.</p>

<p>It has been a while since I last wrote about my Matrix Wiki. Mostly because not much happened.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp">Whisper.cpp</a> took off and I started to <a href="https://github.com/MTRNord/transcribe-matrix-live">tinker</a> with it.

<p>As a Result, I am trying to better/faster build small pages with Shownotes and a Text Transcription of Matrix Live episodes each week.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>In keeping with our (roughly) quarterly release schedule of the Matrix Spec, v1.6 is due to be released on February 14th. That's only four days from now! The headline features are a new Jump-to-Date Client-Server API (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>) and initial work on speeding up room joins (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706">MSC3706</a>), along with many other fixes and clarifications to the spec text itself.</p>
<p>If you haven't yet seen it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPJ9zFV5IE">Matthew's Matrix 2.0 talk</a> at FOSDEM walks through some of the upcoming features in the spec. Each will land in subsequent, future releases of the spec. Once all have landed, we'll call that Matrix 2.0 (in name and in actual version number).</p>
<p>Extensible events is one such upcoming feature. While the core proposal outlining the feature (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) will land in v1.6, the smattering of MSCs which describe how various event types will work under extensible events will span multiple upcoming spec versions. Watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2974">MSC2974: Widgets: Capabilities re-exchange</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC is relatively simple; proposing a method for widgets to ask the client for additional capabilities after it has already been initialised. Doing so allows for increased security and privacy workflows, as the widget need only ask for access to certain pieces of data at the point that it needs it (rather than all up front).</p>
<p>A similar transition of permission granting happened in mobile devices and apps. Initially mobile apps would ask for all permissions they would need up front - which users would blindly accept. These days, mobile OS's have shifted to a model where individual permissions are requested upon attempting to complete an action in an app. This way, users have better context on the reason for the permissions request. (Oddly, browsers have yet to reach this stage with extensions - those still ask for all permissions up front.)</p>
<p>Do check out the proposal and its technical details if widgets are your thing!</p>

<p>The UK Online Safety Bill is shaping up to be a catastrophic piece of legislation, mandating clientside scanning of end-to-end-encrypted communication to attempt to intercept CSAM (child sexual abuse material). By adding the requirement for a scanner which executes ambiguous rulesets to submit encrypted content to the authorities, it would massively undermine the security of encryption: you simply wouldn't be able to trust whether content stays encrypted, or the rules used to scan it and submit it to the authorities. We wrote about it at https://element.io/blog/the-online-safety-bill-an-attack-on-encryption/ to try to sound the alarm before it's too late.</p>

<p>Although having lost a lot of popularity in the last few years, <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> has a great performance and tiny asset size, which means great Matrix support for tiny browsers like on <a href="https://www.kaiostech.com/">KaiOS</a> or for small-size projects and games that wish to use Matrix as a simple back-end.</p>
<p>I hope to release a version v1.0.0 in the near future, but I wanted to share my first breakthrough as I managed to write a simple program that sends message (and state) events in versions that the homeserver supports. See the image below!</p>
<p>Support will mostly be from spec version v1.2 and on, but some legacy endpoints will remain available. You can find the project on <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk">GitHub</a> for now. Hopefully I'll have more to show you in the next few weeks!

<p>Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org">Ivan, the Language Mangler</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in the Rust SDK team is a bit special. We are making our farewells to Ben, as he is leaving Element. He will continue to hang around as its new gig involves Matrix, feel free to take a glance at <a href="https://effektio.org/">Effektio</a>. Once our tears have dried, we carried on with our current main focus: Sliding Sync, and Crypto.
The Sliding Sync client has seen improvements in terms of documentation, along with some clean ups, and stabilisation patches (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1439">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1440">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1449">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1482">4</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1467">5</a>‚Ä¶). The team has decided it's time to write a small testing framework to improve the safety of this code specifically. Indeed, it's quite challenging to test it, and as it's a fundamental piece of the user experience in ElementX and other Matrix clients, there is no debate to have: the quality requirements are high.
The Crypto part now. The Crypto Store has been refactored a little bit (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1477">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1457">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1462">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1465">4</a>‚Ä¶). There is other patches to handle inconsistencies if they happen, and to always mark our own device as verified (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1452">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1456">2</a>).
Apart from that, they have been many work on setting and exposing OpenTelemetry logs for multiple clients and platforms. It will help the teams to coordinate on bugs when they happen.
Finally, a new release of the <code>matrix-sdk-crypto-js</code> has landed: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1444">v0.1.0-alpha.4</a>.
Outside Matrix itself, we have a merge window for <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">the uniffi-async project</a>, along with more contributions to improve errors (<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1468">1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1467">2</a>). It means that the bindings to Swift and Kotlin will soon support native Rust async functions. More contributions are in the pipe to generate documentations for the foreign languages (Swift, Kotlin etc.) directly from Rust documentations.
I will conclude by saying that we were also quite busy preparing the demos for FOSDEM. It was a huge success and it makes us extremely happy :-).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 2017, <a href="https://t2bot.io/">t2bot.io</a> has provided communities on Matrix bots and bridges to use for free, and while there‚Äôs no plan to charge for access, the cost of running the service is about $12k USD/year just to exist.</p>
<p>Since August 2020, t2bot.io‚Äôs primary source of funding has been from the Matrix.org Foundation, though with the Foundation‚Äôs latest focus on raising funds for itself, it feels like the right thing to do is get t2bot.io independently funded.</p>
<p><strong>If you are able, please donate to t2bot.io <a href="https://t2bot.io/donations/">here</a>.</strong> All donations go towards the cost of operation, with any excess (if t2bot.io is so lucky‚Ä¶) going towards hiring developers to work on/build bridges as well as into the Foundation to thank them for keeping t2bot.io online all these years.</p>
<p>Currently, t2bot.io serves <em>86 thousand</em> Discord and Telegram communities, bridging 325 thousand users <em>each month</em>, and <em>11.3 million</em> users since 2017. There‚Äôs also 962 thousand rooms with a t2bot.io user in them, leaving only about 94 thousand rooms as archived, across 25 thousand different homeservers.</p>
<p>Operating at this scale requires, well, $12k USD per year: if you‚Äôre able, please consider donating. There‚Äôs also a question of whether t2bot.io should even be operating at this scale in the first place: Matrix is all about decentralization and owning your own conversations, which naturally means there should be many smaller bridges for communities or even a discord.com-provided bridge for everyone to use. For the time being though, t2bot.io is offered as a convenience and aims to adapt itself as needed to keep providing value.</p>
<p>Questions, concerns, etc are best discussed in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#help:t2bot.io">#help:t2bot.io</a> on Matrix. Nearly every detail of how t2bot.io works is intended to be shared openly, which includes the financial aspect of running the service, so ask away üôÇ</p>

<h4 id="fosdem23-community-meetup-matrix-org"><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org">#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org</a></h4>
<p>Exactly one week ago, a good chunk of the community gathered in Brussels for the <strong>Matrix Community Meetup/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a></strong> in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/fringe/">fringe</a> of FOSDEM.</p>
<p>While we expected the need for everyone to just meet and exchange their ideas, we still wanted to provide a framework for things to get going.
After a &quot;quick&quot; introductory round of everyone presenting themselves and their connection to Matrix, constantly expanding the circle around the table as more people kept pouring through the <a href="https://hsbxl.be/enter">pink gate</a>, we built a timetable of topics from the introduction using the <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-barcamp/tree/nic/env/fosdem-2023">BarCamp Widget</a> developed and slightly modified for the physical BarCamp use case by Nordeck.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/hFUNxEWMiTLgMXRzZzWKfyRt.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Having this way to find people to discuss a topic was a great way to get started, and the discussions quickly took their own directions from there. Highlights included discussions about topics very dear to some people and finding others who are also interested, deep dives into the protocol, brainstorming, or even meeting random strangers on the (notoriously packed) tram to have technical discussions with. A lot of online friends connected, a lot of new friends were made, and even some old friends got to reconnect. It felt very familiar very quickly and leaving Ananace feeling &quot;I've spoken to more friendly and passionate people this last week than I've done for the last six months, that's for certain.&quot; DMs were opened and master keys were cross signed thanks to IRL QR code scanning. Drinks were drunk, Pizza was eaten, and Swedish candy was appreciated to the fullest extent. The scenery only added to the real REAL hackerspace experience, having to <del>make a call</del> ping on Matrix to have someone open the gate to the &quot;desolated courtyard, surrounded by crumbling buildings with broken windows&quot; and a door literally labeled &quot;A&quot;.</p>

<p>As the organisers, Yan and I (HarHarLinks) want to express our gratitude to the incredibly hospitable people from Hackerspace Brussels (<a href="https://hsbxl.be">HSBXL</a>), especially <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jurgen_g:matrix.org">Jurgen</a> who helped a lot with prep in advance and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@beachy:50m4.eu">BeachyHead</a> who spent the whole day accommodating the sudden wave of arriving Matrix enthusiasts. Further, we would like to thank <a href="https://famedly.com">Famedly</a> and <a href="https://nordeck.net">Nordeck</a> who's generosity enabled us to provide free-as-in-beer food üçï and drinks üçª to everyone at the event through their financial support.</p>
<p>We are overjoyed by the incredible response by the community. Most of the people came there for a reason, and that was Matrix. And then they used the time to have some good time together. It was nice that we could help satisfy the huge demand for a get-together in the meat-space with this event.
We look forward to more physical meetups in the future (watch this space!).
Personally I had the best FOSDEM ever, and not just because it was my first one! üòâ</p>

<p>I managed to find some time to commit <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/develop/contrib/lnav"><code>lnav</code> configuration files for Synapse</a> this week. <code>lnav</code> is a log-viewing tool with too many bells and whistles for its own good. I particularly like it because it can interleave multiple log files by timestamp, and highlight log lines based on their severity. If you spend a lot of time looking at logs, these things can lower your blood pressure. Take a look if you think you'd find it useful.</p>

<p>Hello TWIM! It's another week and here at Synapse we released
v1.76.0. The big news for this release is that faster joins are now 
enabled by default. It has arrived üöÄ! In addition, some other notable 
features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the default room version to v10</li>
<li>Added a <code>set_displayname()</code> method to the module API for setting a user's display name</li>
<li>Implemented support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3890">MSC3890</a>: Remotely silence local notifications</li>
<li>Implemented experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3930">MSC3930</a>: Push rules for (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3381">MSC3381</a>) Polls</li>
<li>Add index to improve performance of the <code>/timestamp_to_event</code> endpoint used for jumping to a specific date in the timeline of a room</li>
</ul>
<p>and much more! You can read all about it <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.76.0">here</a>. Also, please note that the upgrade from 1.75 to 1.76 changes the account data replication streams in a backwards-incompatible manner. Server operators running a multi-worker deployment should consult <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.76/docs/upgrade.md#changes-to-the-account-data-replication-streams">the upgrade notes</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<h1 id="nheko">Nheko</h1>
<p>We did a lot of work on our markdown input this week. mauke finally fixed those pesky links with a closing parenthesis at the end from dropping that when linkified, without breaking links inside parentheses. Yes, it is still a regex and possibly outlawed in many civilized countries for having detrimental side-effects on society, but it works, so who am I to argue! Additionally we changed the newline behaviour (and fixed a bug related to line-breaks as well). A single line-break now corresponds to a line-break. You can find more about that decision <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@deepbluev7/109771668066978726">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/757">here</a>. You can opt out of that behaviour and other changes we do to the default cmark/commonmark behaviour using the new <code>/cmark</code> command. Speaking of other changes, we now support <code>||warning|spoiler||</code> as a way to enter spoilers, with the warning being optional as well as <code>~~text~~</code> for strike-through.</p>
<p>There is also now a workaround for Wayland users, who were bothered by stuck menus. This still needs to be fixed in Qt eventually, but in the meantime you can now close menus by clicking somewhere inside of Nheko thanks to a contribution by enigma9o7. Decodetalkers also made Nheko clean up notifications on exit and the fullscreen image overlay hide, when the save dialog is open. You can create DMs by pasting an mxid again now. Previously you needed to delete and re-enter the last character... The username completer should also now open around twice as fast and clicking notifications now once again restores Nheko from the tray. The last goodie was contributed by Malte. The invite dialog inside a room can now search for users you have a DM open or the server side userdirectory for suggestions.</p>
<p>Also, I am attending FOSDEM, so let's see if you can find me!

<h1 id="matrix-call-multitrack-recorder">Matrix Call Multitrack recorder</h1>
<p>Resulting from some past discussion of how matrix live may be improved, I did open https://github.com/vector-im/element-call/issues/789 to support multitrack recordings of participants.
However, it turns out this can quite easily be solved using a bot:</p>
<p>Therefor https://git.nordgedanken.dev/mtrnord/matrix-call-multitrack-recorder has been created. This is an early alpha bot using matrix-nio which can participate in both legacy WebRTC matrix native calls and Element-Call style calls.
Its purpose is to record each stream of a user to either a WAV or mp4 file.</p>
<p>However, since this is very early, it should be noted there currently exist some UX issues and some features are missing.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I've written a small bot-api in Rust that used (and still uses) Fractals Matrix-implementation. Since that has been abandoned <em>quite</em> a while ago, I wanted to look into porting my crate to the matrix-rust-sdk. As it turns out, there wouldn't really be any point in doing so. The SDK can be used more or less directly. Which I've learned, by writing a small <a href="https://github.com/msirringhaus/matrix_exif_bot">demo-bot</a>.</p>
<p>This rather simple bot parses the exif-data of pictures that are posted, extracts the GPS-data (if available) and replies with a Matrix location-event for the image location. The plan was to do this with threads, but the SDK sadly doesn't support those. So good old replies it is.
As a bonus, which turned out to be uglier than I thought, it'll also remove it's location-posts automatically, if the corresponding image gets removed.
Configurable autojoin on invite and a command to leave are implemented as well.</p>

<p>The last week i worked on getting Dendrite to work on the I2P Network. It makes use of the existing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone">Pinecone</a> infrastructure which gets enabled to dial on I2P with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone/compare/main...BieHDC:pinecone:main">a small patch</a>. This has the main advantage that servers will automatically discover each other if they share a node and you don't have to seek out others in the distributed network. I host a 24/7 Seednode for I2P right now. I have also put the work in to enable a landing page just like a monolith deployment would have and you can just <a href="http://3do33c5purkmidtcdxkqindjplcm3l6uv6qysc5a3pfa7fd7lv6q.b32.i2p/">browse to it</a>. This hopefully increases the visibility too!
However, it can also dial into the Clearnet too. It is hardcoded to the Seednode run by the matrix and dendrite developers themselves and it is disabled by default, but can be enabled with a command line switch. It effectively is making a bridge between the I2P Network and Clearnet. In order to bridge the gap between Pinecone based servers and normal matrix servers as well, I have also made a very simple <a href="https://github.com/BieHDC/go-matrix2matrix-noobbridge">matrix2matrix bridge</a> which just connects to 2 (or more) Homeservers and exchanges the messages between 2 (or more) rooms. It also supports bridging and not-bridging files of any kind.
You could add other networks too as long as you can tie them together with Pinecone. For example, the <a href="https://github.com/eyedeekay/onramp">library</a> i use to connect to I2P also supports Tor and it can be added to function just like the I2P implementation. All you need is something that exposes a HTTP Client and a listener.
My personal goal is to make matrix independent from domain registrars, open ports, static IP addresses and anything that makes self hosting harder than it should be and thankfully all the software we need is already written, it just takes someone to tie it together.</p>

<p>This week, <a href="https://github.com/ahal">ahal</a> contributed the <em>linkify</em> module, which implements a generic way to create substitutions based on regular expressions and their matches in Matrix messages.</p>
<p>For instance, it's possible to create a substitution so that when someone writes &quot;issue #21&quot; in the room, the bot will answer with &quot;https://github.com/bnjbvr/trinity/issues/21&quot;. And since it's configurable at runtime, you can create such substitutions with any format you want, create automated links as you'd like, and configure it per Matrix channel. This opens up a new world of possibilities! Also this generalizes what this bot's predecessor, <em>botzilla</em>, did with 3 different commands for expanding Github / Gitlab / Bugzilla links, so Trinity has now reached feature parity with it!

<p>Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix</p>

<p>Trixnity <a href="https://gitlab.com/trixnity/trixnity/-/releases/v3.2.0">3.2.0</a> is released.</p>
<h3 id="performance-improvements-and-fosdem-23">performance improvements and FOSDEM 23</h3>
<p>The most exciting change regarding more performance are asynchronous database transactions. This means that the cache stores values not only for reading from, but also for writing to the database. So every database transaction is executed asynchronously to the caller who changes values. This allows really fast sync processing even on slow systems like smartphones. This also removes delays in the UI, because changes are immediately applied (on the cache level). This was a problem with databases which don't allow parallel write transactions (like realm). This problem also seems to appear in Element Android and its realm database (at least with my huge account). Despite that, I've made some other improvements regarding the cache and sync processing.</p>
<p>I also added a simple benchmark to see how good the improvements are. The test creates 50 encrypted rooms and sends 10 messages to each room. The database is in-memory, but writing is simulated with a 10ms and reading with 5ms delay. Before the optimizations the sync needed 20s to be processed. After the optimizations it needed 5s. So 400% faster. In practice, with my relatively huge matrix account (200+ rooms) the initial sync took 2.5s (after waiting 30s for the server response) on the desktop. But this is just a teaser. If you want to know more, you'll have to wait another week for my Trixnity talk on FOSDEM 23. Contact me if you have topics that should definitely be included in the talk. 30 min are unfortunately filled quickly.</p>
<h3 id="indexeddb-support">IndexedDB support</h3>
<p>I've added IndexedDB as a new database and media backend for web. Really cool to see Trixnity in the web with a persistent database.</p>
<h3 id="fallback-keys-and-room-key-requests">fallback keys and room key requests</h3>
<p>Fallback keys are now supported by Trixnity. Furthermore room keys requests are answered and room keys are requested (when key backup is disabled) from own verified devices.</p>
<h3 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h3>
<p>features/improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>add async transactions</li>
<li>add IndexedDB as database and media backend</li>
<li>support olm fallback keys</li>
<li>key sharing (room key requests)</li>
<li>add <code>usersTyping</code> to <code>UserService</code></li>
<li>use one large transaction for sync processing</li>
<li>add SSO login type</li>
</ul>
<p>breaking changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove sqldelight as database</li>
<li>API change in <code>Timeline</code> to get more information from <code>loadBefore</code> and <code>loadAfter</code></li>
</ul>
<p>bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>don't calculate room name, when room summary did not change</li>
<li>PBKDF2 salt should not be decoded as base64</li>
</ul>

<p>I created <a href="https://gitlab.com/FriendlyLinuxPlayers/flip-matrix-bot">flip-matrix-bot</a> to allow anyone in my inclusive Linux gaming community (<code>#community:flip.earth</code>) to schedule gaming events through a CLI-like chat interface. This recently reached a minimum viable state, and I'm excited to finally have community driven event hosting! This was made using the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk">matrix-rust-sdk</a>.</p>
<p>While this currently has some hardcoded references to the FLiP community, and so has limited usefulness outside of it at the moment, anyone who is interested in the bot is welcome to join <code>#flip:flip.earth</code> to use it in production, or <code>#bots:flip.earth</code> to see it being tested.</p>

<p>This is a quick reminder about the matrix community meetup/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">barcamp</a> next ~~TWIMday~~Friday February 3 starting 13:00 local time (in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/fringe/">FOSDEM fringe</a>). We meet at HSBXL who are kindly offering their space for us to use (<a href="https://hsbxl.be/contact/">how to get there</a>, <a href="https://hsbxl.be/enter/">how to get in</a>). There will be food and drinks thanks to our sponsors.</p>
<p>A note from HSBXL:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would recommend to dress warm. HSBXL is located in an old industrial building, therefore the location is not especially well isolated.  We will fire up the heaters but warm close are still recommended. </p>
