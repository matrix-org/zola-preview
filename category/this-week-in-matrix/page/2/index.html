<p>Other than spec text fixes in the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc">matrix-spec repo</a>, the Spec Core Team has mainly been focusing on push notifications, push rules and generally improving notifications across Matrix. This includes improving behaviour such as accidentally notifying someone when you mention their name, accidentally notifying people when you reply to a message, accidentally notifying when you edit a message and so on. The relevant MSCs are <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3958">MSC3958</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3873">MSC3873</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3966">MSC3966</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758">MSC3758</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, review of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575">MSC3575</a> (Sliding Sync) and other sliding sync MSCs saw some in-depth review from <a href="https://github.com/deepbluev7">Nico</a>.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3013">MSC3013: Encrypted Push</a>!</p>
<p>When you get a push notification for a new message on your phone, you may wonder how that message travels from your homeserver to you. Typically it isn't done directly - instead, when you receive a message that should notify you, your homeserver will generate a push notification specifically for you, and send this off to a Matrix Push Gateway. That Push Gateway is then configured to send your notification off to a service which knows how to route it to your device. This is usually Apple's Push Notification Service in the case of iOS devices, or Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging service in the case of Android devices (though FCM supports iOS devices too!). Your phone's OS will keep a consistent connection to one of these services if an app has registered for push notifications, and thus you can receive notifications from apps even when your Matrix client is not running.</p>
<p>But doesn't that leak all of your message notifications to Apple or Google? 😱 Not quite. While clients can choose to include all contents of a message in a push notification, most instead opt for only including the event's ID. When the push notification containing that event ID reaches your phone, it wakes up a small portion of your Matrix client which goes and fetches the full message content from the homeserver (plus encryption keys if the message needs to be decrypted). This way, you can still get a notification without your Matrix client needing to be open all the time. However, some metadata (such as when you are getting a notification) is still leaked to Apple/Google. Since the third-party service knows the event ID, it can correlate which users are in the same room by cross-referencing event IDs in notifications across multiple users.</p>
<p>It's also a bit of a resource drain that the client needs to go and talk to the homeserver to fetch the full event content. Ideally we'd just include it all in the notification - but then we end up sharing too much information with the push provider!</p>
<p>This MSC proposes a solution; encrypt the message content and send that in the notification! Message contents are encrypted using a public key provided by the client to the homeserver when registering for push notifications. The ciphertext passes through the Push Gateway (which may be run by a separate entity to your homeserver) and the Push Notification service (run by Apple, Google, etc.) and then finally down to your client where it is decrypted without the need for a web request as the private key will just be stored in the client.</p>
<p>And since a separate encryption key is being used per-device, ciphertexts of the same event will differ when encrypted for different users - eliminating the Push Gateway/Push Notification Service from being to correlate notifications across users (timing attacks are still possible, but this can be reduced by introducing a small amount of jitter into when notifications are sent out).</p>
<p>Anyhoo, if you're big on privacy (or security against those running Push Gateway/Notification Services), check out this MSC!</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org">Shay</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to another edition of the Synapse section of TWIM. This week
we've released Synapse v1.78.0, packed with features and bugfixes.</p>
<p>Some notable highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>an update to the command line export data tool</li>
<li>implemented the experimental <code>exact_event_match</code> push rule condition from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758">MSC3758</a></li>
<li>implemented <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3873">MSC3873</a> to disambiguate push rule keys with dots in them.</li>
<li>allow Synapse to use a specific Redis <a href="https://redis.io/commands/select/">logical database</a> in worker-mode deployments.</li>
<li>fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.76 where 5 second delays would occasionally occur in deployments using workers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus much more! You can check out the details <a href="vector://vector/webapp/(https://matrix.org/blog/posts)">here</a> or take a deep dive in the release notes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.78.0">here</a>.</p>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, seven additional endpoints from the synapse admin API have been ported to Construct. These include user room listings, account data, devices, pushers, and forward extremities pruning. This week it also became easier for admins to tune database options to meet their needs through the configuration system. To put things into perspective, the server now has 2184 configurable items which can be set by an environment variable. Construct also has 6177 statistical items which can be reported to a Prometheus metrics daemon.</p>
<p>Lastly I would like to share good news on the compatibility front after taking some time to investigate why Construct and Conduit have trouble federating. I reached out with a patchset to the folks over at Ruma and I would like to take this opportunity to commend their hospitality. Their conduct has been nothing short of diplomatic, giving confidence we can now iron out any kinks in the coming weeks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>mautrix-go has had e2ee support for a few years already, but previously the interface was quite difficult to use for making bots and other small programs, as it required implementing parts of the storage and other things manually. That has changed with the upcoming 0.15 release, which adds a crypto helper that can handle everything for you with just a few extra lines of code. The documentation is unfortunately not great yet, but the <a href="https://github.com/mautrix/go/blob/master/example/main.go">example</a> has been updated to use the new helper, so it should be a decent starting point for writing e2ee-capable bots in Go (and if it explodes, you can ask for help in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#:maunium.net">#:maunium.net</a>)</p>

<p>I'm excited to share that I've made significant progress on my Elm SDK for Matrix! Last time, I mentioned that a version 1.0.0 release was approaching, and today I have great news - I've got a working MVP! While it's not ready for use yet, it's a significant step forward.</p>

<p>I've built an incredibly basic client that managed to compress to under 36kB (for scale: Hydrogen is around 748kB) of gzipped JavaScript. The final version will be a bit larger, but this SDK might make way for very compact asset sizes.</p>

<p>The Rust rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/rumpelsepp/mnotify">mnotify</a> got some updates and starts to get usable. The broken (password) login flow was fixed and the README received some polishing. I run it now to send E2E encrypted notifications from my servers to my phone. The rust-sdk does a very good job!</p>

<li>Fixed a long-standing bug where the room aliases returned could be corrupted. </li>
<li>Fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.76.0 where partially-joined rooms could not be deleted using the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#delete-room-api">purge room API</a>. </li>
<li>Fixed a long-standing bug where federated joins would fail if the first server in the list of servers to try is not in the room.</li>
<li>Implement the experimental <code>exact_event_match</code> push rule condition from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758">MSC3758</a>.</li>
<li>Added account data to the command line <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.78/usage/administration/admin_faq.html#how-can-i-export-user-data">user data export tool</a></li>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's been progress in several areas for Construct 0.9 this week, cut with 71 new commits. First I'd like to give special thanks for @bgiovanni for continuing to drive the progress this week; they have on several occasions been able to navigate the codebase and the specification to provide concise reports so I can fix anything in mere minutes. I hope we can keep this up.</p>
<p>Construct can now be configured to purge a room from the database after the last local user leaves. This week I also took the plunge on implementing a controversial clause in the specification which requires a server to broadcast a join event on behalf of another server. This is problematic because it's technically an amplification attack, so I've done my best to narrow the conditions for when to actually perform this: only if the counter-party is not already joined, and only if Construct has an alias set for the room being joined.</p>
<p>In other news, I <a href="https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio/pull/1215">fixed a bug</a> in <code>boost::asio</code> but since that won't land for a while and Construct's <code>io_uring(7)</code> might be susceptible on Arch and Gentoo <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/commit/884c2e68b71c92d223d312f60f35b9be81960a8c">I hacked a workaround</a> just for us, especially since the old <code>epoll(7)</code> + <code>aio(7)</code> makes my desktop much less responsive (I can't believe I dealt with that for years!).</p>
<p>Next week Yan Minari might have a deeper look at Sytest and Complement integration and maybe mdad, while I plan on implementing local room policies and user management to make Construct safe for public registration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello all! Fractal 4.4.2-beta2 is available on Flathub Beta.</p>
<p>You read correctly, it's not Fractal 5 yet. This is a maintenance release that fixes the compilation of Fractal 4.4 with recent libraries and allows to build the Flatpak with the latest GNOME runtime. That means no more warning that the GNOME 41 runtime is outdated!</p>
<p>There are no new features, but since we updated a lot of Rust dependencies we preferred to release a beta version before using it to update our stable release to the latest runtime. So please test it and if no major regression is reported, we will release it as stable in two weeks.</p>
<p>To get it, run the following commands:</p>
<pre data-lang="sh" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-sh "><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo
</span><span>flatpak install flathub-beta org.gnome.Fractal
</span><span>flatpak run --branch=beta org.gnome.Fractal
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that if you always want to use this beta version instead of the stable one, and run it from the icon in your launcher, you will need to change its desktop file to use the command in the last line.</p>
<p>See you soon with some news regarding Fractal 5 hopefully!</p>

<p>This week our efforts have been split between Element X and Element Android:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Element X, we're focused on laying the foundations for the app, improving our tools and processes for distributing the updated Rust SDK as an Android module and refining the initial screens of the app, matching the new designs and UX flows.</li>
<li>On Element Android, we've released a new version 1.5.26 with more fixes and improvements for the Rich Text Editor, Polls and Location Sharing features, to name a few of them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy to announce a neat little CLI tool (built with rust, of course) to migrate your matrix rooms from one account to another: <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/matrix-migrate">matrix-migrate</a> is inspired by the <a href="https://ems.element.io/tools/matrix-migration">the EMS migrator</a>, but</p>
<ol>
<li>is a nice little CLI tool, based on <code>matrix-rust-sdk</code></li>
<li>allows for restarts (refreshes at the beginning)</li>
<li>it runs the operations async in parallel and is thus quite a bit faster</li>

<p>I've continued to develop Matrix Wrench, a webapp for techy Matrix admins to manage rooms and room state. It can be hosted on any static web space, supports multiple logins and has just one direct dependency (htm/preact).</p>
<p>Lots of great new features got released in the last two weeks. Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added: Tables of joined rooms and direct contacts</li>
<li>Added: New input for identities: Masquerade As Matrix ID (for AppService tokens)</li>
<li>Fixed: Knocking button didn't work (&quot;Error: Content not JSON.&quot;)</li>

<p>After we had some great time at <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix#fosdem-2023">FOSDEM</a> and where we were able to test our <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-barcamp">Barcamp widget</a> with a broader group, we are thrilled to announce that we finally made the next widget public:</p>
<p>Entering the <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-meetings"><em>matrix-meetings-widget</em></a>!
The widget allows to plan meetings, invite other users, configure meetings rooms, view your calendar, and perform video conferences.
All data is stored in Matrix, no external service required. As the Widget API is a bit limited for this use-cases, it's a combination of a widget and a bot.</p>
<p>As a small teaser: We are in the progress of building a whiteboard widget that is fully based on Matrix without an external storage.
If you have any questions, reach out to us at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nordeck:matrix.org">#nordeck:matrix.org</a>.

<p>With the Extensible Events Core (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) being accepted last week, the focus now turns to all the other extensible event MSCs for images, files, etc. How does extensible events relate to IETF/MIMI/DMA, you ask? In our mission for having Matrix be the standard for interoperability, we need a content format that works for everyone. Events prior to MSC1767 <em>could</em> work with enough effort, though MSC1767's system makes things <em>a lot</em> easier when representing arbitrarily complex messaging features.</p>

<p>We released another breaking change this week :p bump to v0.17.0</p>
<p>Introduced a couple of new features like upgrading voice calls to video calls, some neat helper functions for group calls. Fixes include cleaning group call state events, fixing the searchEvent function, a way to get own profile from server and then fallback to room profile and also fixes to the /markasdm command.</p>
<p>Complete changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>fix: ability to upgrade audio calls to video calls (td)</li>
<li>chore: add a fetchOwnProfileFromServer method which tries to get ownProfile from server first, disk then (td)</li>
<li>fix: clean expired member state events in group calls (td)</li>
<li>fix: hasActiveGroup call now checks all group calls (td)</li>
<li>fix: Check if argument is valid mxid in /maskasdm command (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>fix: Fake User object (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>fix: Request key in searchEvent method crashes because of wrong preconditions (Christian Pauly)</li>
<li>refactor: Check config at file sending after placing fake event and add error handling (Krille)</li>
<li>chore: bump dart to 2.18 (Nicolas Werner)</li>
<li>fix: setMicrophoneMuted is now async to match setVideoMuted (td)</li>
<li>fix: implement activeGroupCallEvents to get all active group call state events in a room (td)</li>
<li>refactor: (BREAKING CHANGE) move staleCallChecker and expires_Ts stuff to an extension on Room, instead of Voip because it makes much more sense per room rather than on voip, also makes testing easier (td)</li>
<li>fix: populate local groupCalls list on instantiating VOIP() (td)</li>
<li>fix: starting stale call checker is now handled by the sdk itself because clients can forget to do so (td)</li>

<h3 id="ruma-website">Ruma (<a href="https://www.ruma.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>A set of Rust library crates for working with the Matrix protocol. Ruma’s approach to Matrix emphasizes correctness, security, stability and performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net">Kévin Commaille</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been a while since our last update in November, but it just means we have been busier than ever! A lot has happened to follow changes in the Matrix specification as well as fixing bugs in our codebase or making our API easier to use.</p>
<p>We have released Ruma 0.8.0 and 0.8.1 at the beginning of the month. It was long overdue with a lot of improvements, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stabilized support for all the changes and features of Matrix 1.4 and Matrix 1.5</li>
<li>Making our request types use owned instead of borrowed data</li>
<li>Replacing <code>ruma_api!</code> with more flexible macros</li>
<li>Fixing the serialization and deserialization of redacted events</li>
<li>Reorganizing our <code>*EventContent</code> traits to allow event content types to only implement what is really needed</li>
<li>Removing sensitive data from the <code>Debug</code>-format representation of our types </li>
</ul>
<p>And on the 15th we released Ruma 0.8.2 with a few bug fixes but also stabilized support for all the changes and features of Matrix 1.6!</p>
<p>Although it might be less visible in our changelogs, we also regularly add support for MSCs, and try to keep our implementations up-to-date. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sliding sync (MSC3575 and others, currently used by Element X via the matrix-rust-sdk)</li>
<li>Extensible events (MSC1767 and others)</li>
<li>Push rule condition for room version features (MSC3931 and MSC3932)</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have a bunch of issues opened if you feel like contributing, so come say hi!</p>

<p>The biggest change to the bot has been the tweaking of event reminders sent in <code>#flip:flip.earth</code>. We now send a lightweight event notification 24 hours before the scheduled time of the event, and don't send one if the event takes place in 19 minutes or less.</p>
<p>Outside of these tweaks, there is a minimally-working branch that can send updates to Mastodon! See the <a href="https://gitlab.com/FriendlyLinuxPlayers/flip-matrix-bot/-/issues/16">Mastodon issue</a> for details.

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>In keeping with our (roughly) quarterly release schedule of the Matrix Spec, v1.6 is due to be released on February 14th. That's only four days from now! The headline features are a new Jump-to-Date Client-Server API (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>) and initial work on speeding up room joins (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706">MSC3706</a>), along with many other fixes and clarifications to the spec text itself.</p>
<p>If you haven't yet seen it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPJ9zFV5IE">Matthew's Matrix 2.0 talk</a> at FOSDEM walks through some of the upcoming features in the spec. Each will land in subsequent, future releases of the spec. Once all have landed, we'll call that Matrix 2.0 (in name and in actual version number).</p>
<p>Extensible events is one such upcoming feature. While the core proposal outlining the feature (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) will land in v1.6, the smattering of MSCs which describe how various event types will work under extensible events will span multiple upcoming spec versions. Watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2974">MSC2974: Widgets: Capabilities re-exchange</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC is relatively simple; proposing a method for widgets to ask the client for additional capabilities after it has already been initialised. Doing so allows for increased security and privacy workflows, as the widget need only ask for access to certain pieces of data at the point that it needs it (rather than all up front).</p>
<p>A similar transition of permission granting happened in mobile devices and apps. Initially mobile apps would ask for all permissions they would need up front - which users would blindly accept. These days, mobile OS's have shifted to a model where individual permissions are requested upon attempting to complete an action in an app. This way, users have better context on the reason for the permissions request. (Oddly, browsers have yet to reach this stage with extensions - those still ask for all permissions up front.)</p>
<p>Do check out the proposal and its technical details if widgets are your thing!</p>

<p>The UK Online Safety Bill is shaping up to be a catastrophic piece of legislation, mandating clientside scanning of end-to-end-encrypted communication to attempt to intercept CSAM (child sexual abuse material). By adding the requirement for a scanner which executes ambiguous rulesets to submit encrypted content to the authorities, it would massively undermine the security of encryption: you simply wouldn't be able to trust whether content stays encrypted, or the rules used to scan it and submit it to the authorities. We wrote about it at https://element.io/blog/the-online-safety-bill-an-attack-on-encryption/ to try to sound the alarm before it's too late.</p>

<li>Element Android 1.5.24 has been released to testers. Will be pushed to production next week.</li>
<li>On Element X Android, the team is working to set up the project properly, as more and more people will work on this fresh new codebase. We have made progress to setup code coverage metrics, which we want to be as high as possible, with a target of 80%. Also we are integrating the latest Rust SDK and we aim to get further dependency upgrades as smooth as possible.</li>

<p>Although having lost a lot of popularity in the last few years, <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> has a great performance and tiny asset size, which means great Matrix support for tiny browsers like on <a href="https://www.kaiostech.com/">KaiOS</a> or for small-size projects and games that wish to use Matrix as a simple back-end.</p>
<p>I hope to release a version v1.0.0 in the near future, but I wanted to share my first breakthrough as I managed to write a simple program that sends message (and state) events in versions that the homeserver supports. See the image below!</p>
<p>Support will mostly be from spec version v1.2 and on, but some legacy endpoints will remain available. You can find the project on <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk">GitHub</a> for now. Hopefully I'll have more to show you in the next few weeks!

<p>Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org">Ivan, the Language Mangler</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in the Rust SDK team is a bit special. We are making our farewells to Ben, as he is leaving Element. He will continue to hang around as its new gig involves Matrix, feel free to take a glance at <a href="https://effektio.org/">Effektio</a>. Once our tears have dried, we carried on with our current main focus: Sliding Sync, and Crypto.
The Sliding Sync client has seen improvements in terms of documentation, along with some clean ups, and stabilisation patches (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1439">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1440">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1449">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1482">4</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1467">5</a>…). The team has decided it's time to write a small testing framework to improve the safety of this code specifically. Indeed, it's quite challenging to test it, and as it's a fundamental piece of the user experience in ElementX and other Matrix clients, there is no debate to have: the quality requirements are high.
The Crypto part now. The Crypto Store has been refactored a little bit (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1477">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1457">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1462">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1465">4</a>…). There is other patches to handle inconsistencies if they happen, and to always mark our own device as verified (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1452">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1456">2</a>).
Apart from that, they have been many work on setting and exposing OpenTelemetry logs for multiple clients and platforms. It will help the teams to coordinate on bugs when they happen.
Finally, a new release of the <code>matrix-sdk-crypto-js</code> has landed: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1444">v0.1.0-alpha.4</a>.
Outside Matrix itself, we have a merge window for <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">the uniffi-async project</a>, along with more contributions to improve errors (<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1468">1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1467">2</a>). It means that the bindings to Swift and Kotlin will soon support native Rust async functions. More contributions are in the pipe to generate documentations for the foreign languages (Swift, Kotlin etc.) directly from Rust documentations.
I will conclude by saying that we were also quite busy preparing the demos for FOSDEM. It was a huge success and it makes us extremely happy :-).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 2017, <a href="https://t2bot.io/">t2bot.io</a> has provided communities on Matrix bots and bridges to use for free, and while there’s no plan to charge for access, the cost of running the service is about $12k USD/year just to exist.</p>
<p>Since August 2020, t2bot.io’s primary source of funding has been from the Matrix.org Foundation, though with the Foundation’s latest focus on raising funds for itself, it feels like the right thing to do is get t2bot.io independently funded.</p>
<p><strong>If you are able, please donate to t2bot.io <a href="https://t2bot.io/donations/">here</a>.</strong> All donations go towards the cost of operation, with any excess (if t2bot.io is so lucky…) going towards hiring developers to work on/build bridges as well as into the Foundation to thank them for keeping t2bot.io online all these years.</p>
<p>Currently, t2bot.io serves <em>86 thousand</em> Discord and Telegram communities, bridging 325 thousand users <em>each month</em>, and <em>11.3 million</em> users since 2017. There’s also 962 thousand rooms with a t2bot.io user in them, leaving only about 94 thousand rooms as archived, across 25 thousand different homeservers.</p>
<p>Operating at this scale requires, well, $12k USD per year: if you’re able, please consider donating. There’s also a question of whether t2bot.io should even be operating at this scale in the first place: Matrix is all about decentralization and owning your own conversations, which naturally means there should be many smaller bridges for communities or even a discord.com-provided bridge for everyone to use. For the time being though, t2bot.io is offered as a convenience and aims to adapt itself as needed to keep providing value.</p>
<p>Questions, concerns, etc are best discussed in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#help:t2bot.io">#help:t2bot.io</a> on Matrix. Nearly every detail of how t2bot.io works is intended to be shared openly, which includes the financial aspect of running the service, so ask away 🙂</p>

<h4 id="fosdem23-community-meetup-matrix-org"><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org">#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org</a></h4>
<p>Exactly one week ago, a good chunk of the community gathered in Brussels for the <strong>Matrix Community Meetup/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a></strong> in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/fringe/">fringe</a> of FOSDEM.</p>
<p>While we expected the need for everyone to just meet and exchange their ideas, we still wanted to provide a framework for things to get going.
After a &quot;quick&quot; introductory round of everyone presenting themselves and their connection to Matrix, constantly expanding the circle around the table as more people kept pouring through the <a href="https://hsbxl.be/enter">pink gate</a>, we built a timetable of topics from the introduction using the <a href="https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-barcamp/tree/nic/env/fosdem-2023">BarCamp Widget</a> developed and slightly modified for the physical BarCamp use case by Nordeck.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/hFUNxEWMiTLgMXRzZzWKfyRt.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Having this way to find people to discuss a topic was a great way to get started, and the discussions quickly took their own directions from there. Highlights included discussions about topics very dear to some people and finding others who are also interested, deep dives into the protocol, brainstorming, or even meeting random strangers on the (notoriously packed) tram to have technical discussions with. A lot of online friends connected, a lot of new friends were made, and even some old friends got to reconnect. It felt very familiar very quickly and leaving Ananace feeling &quot;I've spoken to more friendly and passionate people this last week than I've done for the last six months, that's for certain.&quot; DMs were opened and master keys were cross signed thanks to IRL QR code scanning. Drinks were drunk, Pizza was eaten, and Swedish candy was appreciated to the fullest extent. The scenery only added to the real REAL hackerspace experience, having to <del>make a call</del> ping on Matrix to have someone open the gate to the &quot;desolated courtyard, surrounded by crumbling buildings with broken windows&quot; and a door literally labeled &quot;A&quot;.</p>

<p>As the organisers, Yan and I (HarHarLinks) want to express our gratitude to the incredibly hospitable people from Hackerspace Brussels (<a href="https://hsbxl.be">HSBXL</a>), especially <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jurgen_g:matrix.org">Jurgen</a> who helped a lot with prep in advance and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@beachy:50m4.eu">BeachyHead</a> who spent the whole day accommodating the sudden wave of arriving Matrix enthusiasts. Further, we would like to thank <a href="https://famedly.com">Famedly</a> and <a href="https://nordeck.net">Nordeck</a> who's generosity enabled us to provide free-as-in-beer food 🍕 and drinks 🍻 to everyone at the event through their financial support.</p>
<p>We are overjoyed by the incredible response by the community. Most of the people came there for a reason, and that was Matrix. And then they used the time to have some good time together. It was nice that we could help satisfy the huge demand for a get-together in the meat-space with this event.
We look forward to more physical meetups in the future (watch this space!).
Personally I had the best FOSDEM ever, and not just because it was my first one! 😉</p>

<p>We did a lot of work on our markdown input this week. mauke finally fixed those pesky links with a closing parenthesis at the end from dropping that when linkified, without breaking links inside parentheses. Yes, it is still a regex and possibly outlawed in many civilized countries for having detrimental side-effects on society, but it works, so who am I to argue! Additionally we changed the newline behaviour (and fixed a bug related to line-breaks as well). A single line-break now corresponds to a line-break. You can find more about that decision <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@deepbluev7/109771668066978726">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/757">here</a>. You can opt out of that behaviour and other changes we do to the default cmark/commonmark behaviour using the new <code>/cmark</code> command. Speaking of other changes, we now support <code>||warning|spoiler||</code> as a way to enter spoilers, with the warning being optional as well as <code>~~text~~</code> for strike-through.</p>
<p>There is also now a workaround for Wayland users, who were bothered by stuck menus. This still needs to be fixed in Qt eventually, but in the meantime you can now close menus by clicking somewhere inside of Nheko thanks to a contribution by enigma9o7. Decodetalkers also made Nheko clean up notifications on exit and the fullscreen image overlay hide, when the save dialog is open. You can create DMs by pasting an mxid again now. Previously you needed to delete and re-enter the last character... The username completer should also now open around twice as fast and clicking notifications now once again restores Nheko from the tray. The last goodie was contributed by Malte. The invite dialog inside a room can now search for users you have a DM open or the server side userdirectory for suggestions.</p>
<p>Also, I am attending FOSDEM, so let's see if you can find me!

<p>Resulting from some past discussion of how matrix live may be improved, I did open https://github.com/vector-im/element-call/issues/789 to support multitrack recordings of participants.
However, it turns out this can quite easily be solved using a bot:</p>
<p>Therefor https://git.nordgedanken.dev/mtrnord/matrix-call-multitrack-recorder has been created. This is an early alpha bot using matrix-nio which can participate in both legacy WebRTC matrix native calls and Element-Call style calls.
Its purpose is to record each stream of a user to either a WAV or mp4 file.</p>
<p>However, since this is very early, it should be noted there currently exist some UX issues and some features are missing.</p>

<p>Most profoundly sliding sync has been upgraded to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1399">latest JSON schema with named views</a> giving the team time to test that before shipping it to a wider audience post FOSDEM. In spirit of that, a first version of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1390">sqlite-based crypto-store has also been merged</a>.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I've written a small bot-api in Rust that used (and still uses) Fractals Matrix-implementation. Since that has been abandoned <em>quite</em> a while ago, I wanted to look into porting my crate to the matrix-rust-sdk. As it turns out, there wouldn't really be any point in doing so. The SDK can be used more or less directly. Which I've learned, by writing a small <a href="https://github.com/msirringhaus/matrix_exif_bot">demo-bot</a>.</p>
<p>This rather simple bot parses the exif-data of pictures that are posted, extracts the GPS-data (if available) and replies with a Matrix location-event for the image location. The plan was to do this with threads, but the SDK sadly doesn't support those. So good old replies it is.
As a bonus, which turned out to be uglier than I thought, it'll also remove it's location-posts automatically, if the corresponding image gets removed.
Configurable autojoin on invite and a command to leave are implemented as well.</p>

<p>The last week i worked on getting Dendrite to work on the I2P Network. It makes use of the existing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone">Pinecone</a> infrastructure which gets enabled to dial on I2P with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone/compare/main...BieHDC:pinecone:main">a small patch</a>. This has the main advantage that servers will automatically discover each other if they share a node and you don't have to seek out others in the distributed network. I host a 24/7 Seednode for I2P right now. I have also put the work in to enable a landing page just like a monolith deployment would have and you can just <a href="http://3do33c5purkmidtcdxkqindjplcm3l6uv6qysc5a3pfa7fd7lv6q.b32.i2p/">browse to it</a>. This hopefully increases the visibility too!
However, it can also dial into the Clearnet too. It is hardcoded to the Seednode run by the matrix and dendrite developers themselves and it is disabled by default, but can be enabled with a command line switch. It effectively is making a bridge between the I2P Network and Clearnet. In order to bridge the gap between Pinecone based servers and normal matrix servers as well, I have also made a very simple <a href="https://github.com/BieHDC/go-matrix2matrix-noobbridge">matrix2matrix bridge</a> which just connects to 2 (or more) Homeservers and exchanges the messages between 2 (or more) rooms. It also supports bridging and not-bridging files of any kind.
You could add other networks too as long as you can tie them together with Pinecone. For example, the <a href="https://github.com/eyedeekay/onramp">library</a> i use to connect to I2P also supports Tor and it can be added to function just like the I2P implementation. All you need is something that exposes a HTTP Client and a listener.
My personal goal is to make matrix independent from domain registrars, open ports, static IP addresses and anything that makes self hosting harder than it should be and thankfully all the software we need is already written, it just takes someone to tie it together.</p>

<p>main differences:</p>

<p>nheko-krunner has had a new release! 0.2.0 brings support for the latest version of nheko, but it also adds a new feature: the KRunner plugin can be configured from KDE's System Settings app! Currently, the only configuration option is to change whether you are shown unread counts for rooms in the search results, but I can see this expanding in the future to add other useful configurations</p>

<p>This week, <a href="https://github.com/ahal">ahal</a> contributed the <em>linkify</em> module, which implements a generic way to create substitutions based on regular expressions and their matches in Matrix messages.</p>
<p>For instance, it's possible to create a substitution so that when someone writes &quot;issue #21&quot; in the room, the bot will answer with &quot;https://github.com/bnjbvr/trinity/issues/21&quot;. And since it's configurable at runtime, you can create such substitutions with any format you want, create automated links as you'd like, and configure it per Matrix channel. This opens up a new world of possibilities! Also this generalizes what this bot's predecessor, <em>botzilla</em>, did with 3 different commands for expanding Github / Gitlab / Bugzilla links, so Trinity has now reached feature parity with it! Woohoo 🥳</p>

<h3 id="performance-improvements-and-fosdem-23">performance improvements and FOSDEM 23</h3>
<p>The most exciting change regarding more performance are asynchronous database transactions. This means that the cache stores values not only for reading from, but also for writing to the database. So every database transaction is executed asynchronously to the caller who changes values. This allows really fast sync processing even on slow systems like smartphones. This also removes delays in the UI, because changes are immediately applied (on the cache level). This was a problem with databases which don't allow parallel write transactions (like realm). This problem also seems to appear in Element Android and its realm database (at least with my huge account). Despite that, I've made some other improvements regarding the cache and sync processing.</p>
<p>I also added a simple benchmark to see how good the improvements are. The test creates 50 encrypted rooms and sends 10 messages to each room. The database is in-memory, but writing is simulated with a 10ms and reading with 5ms delay. Before the optimizations the sync needed 20s to be processed. After the optimizations it needed 5s. So 400% faster. In practice, with my relatively huge matrix account (200+ rooms) the initial sync took 2.5s (after waiting 30s for the server response) on the desktop. But this is just a teaser. If you want to know more, you'll have to wait another week for my Trixnity talk on FOSDEM 23. Contact me if you have topics that should definitely be included in the talk. 30 min are unfortunately filled quickly.</p>
<h3 id="indexeddb-support">IndexedDB support</h3>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week the Synapse team has been finishing a sprint on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3902">faster joins</a> project.
As a reminder, this is a year-long project to make Synapse quickly join a new room by lazily loading some of its state history in the background.
It is particularly needed when joining large rooms with lots of members: joining such rooms is bottlenecked on fetching, serialising, deserialising and validating a <em>huge</em> list of <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#mroommember">room member events</a>.
While the core logic and machinery has been in place for some time now, this sprint has concentrated on two pain points:</p>
<ul>
<li>making faster joins to work on Synapse installations <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/workers.html">using workers</a>, and</li>
<li>remaining edge cases needed for a good client UX.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="call-for-testers">Call for testers</h2>
<p>We hope to ship the first iteration of faster joins support in Synapse 1.76.0.
The release candidate <code>1.76.0rc1</code> will be released on Tuesday 24th Jan.
<strong>We'd like to encourage homeserver administrators to try it out</strong> before the release proper.
Once you've upgraded, try joining rooms which no-one else on your server is joined to.
We graciously welcome any bug reports---please file <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=BUG_REPORT.yml">GitHub issues</a> if you find anything out of the ordinary after joining a room.</p>

<p>If you have a Dendrite homeserver, staying up-to-date is highly recommended so please upgrade when you can. Otherwise, if you want to play with Dendrite without having to set up your own infrastructure, the dendrite.matrix.org homeserver is open for registration (upon completion of a CAPTCHA, so you may need to register using Element Web).</p>
<p>As always, please feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for related discussion.</p>

<p>Howdy! This release features one change, but an important change: We've finally fixed the poor UX around adding new connections in rooms via widgets. Up until today, the project selector input was quite poor and flaked out a lot. Missing search results, clipping dropdowns or duplicated entries were a common occurrence.</p>
<p>The new input field features a much improved look, so now you see the project name, description and avatar when searching across GitHub, GitLab and JIRA. The search time and accuracy should be much improved too.</p>
<p>If you've updated to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/2.6.1">previous releases, 2.6.0,1</a>, then now is a good time to do so because those releases contained a whole range of cool new stuff!</p>

<p>First and foremost: <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1409">UniFFI async is all done and submitted for review</a> 🎉 and first responses are pretty positive. Discussion has revealed some unlikely but possible undefined behavior that needs to be addressed and more review is needed. But overall, we are pretty confident that this will land soon. 🚀</p>
<p>Where there is light, there is shadow: When trying to integrate the community sqlite db backend we ran into a terrible bug in the underlying library that led to eventually having to abandon that port and go with a fresh implementation based on a different library - we are confident to show something, at least for crypto-db, fairly soon. Talking about crypto, aside from a few <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1348">smaller</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1365">improvements</a> the JS bindings on top have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1303">gotten some typing improvements</a> this week, too. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1347">Timeline has support for state events now</a>, too.</p>
<p>On Sliding sync we are looking at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1359">stabilization (tracking issue)</a> and optimizing for time-to-first-usage ahead of FOSDEM and getting a first iteration into the hands of people out there as part of Element-X. It’s a painstaking process with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1372">plenty of small fixes</a> and improvements on all parts. Through that and debugging on the interaction with the higher layers we were already able to shave off 900ms at cold-start-display-time, with more to come and other fixes, like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1358">logging improvements</a>, done along the way.</p>

<p>Greetings, fellow music lovers (and matrix enjoyers)! I had a brilliant idea whilst lounging on my couch, stuffing my face with pizza, and realized that I was too darn lazy to keep opening Spotify every time I want to skip a song. And lo and behold, I discovered that there was no way to command my Spotify account from the comfort of my Matrix room. So, I decided to create a bot to do the job for me (how convenient, right?). </p>
<p>It's currently in its alpha state, but any contributions are welcome, especially if you're a coding wizard.</p>
<p>To use it, all you need is a bot account on your favorite homeserver and a bit of setup magic. Check out the GitHub link for more information: https://github.com/VaiTon/matrixfy</p>

As a reminder, v10 brings the ability to have a room that's both <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#knocking-on-rooms">knockable</a> and <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms">restricted</a> at once, as well as more strictly enforces the types of power level values.</p>
<p>Otherwise we've seen lots of movement in other areas of the spec. Expect to see some work done around push rules (which have historically been rather complicated and fiddly...) and notifications in the days to come.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3779">MSC3779: &quot;Owned&quot; State Events</a>!</p>
<p>I remember this MSC fondly. It was originally born out of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3489">MSC3489</a>'s need to allow any user in the room to send <code>m.beacon_info</code> state events. This can easily be achieved today by lowering the required power level of <code>m.beacon_info</code> to the default user level. However, you then run into the issue of any user being able to edit any other user's <code>m.beacon_info</code> event!</p>
<p>Thus this MSC attempts to modify the state events permission model so that users can &quot;own&quot; certain state events that they send. We already somewhat have this functionality - if you put your Matrix ID as the state ID for any state event, only you or users with a power level higher than you can edit it.</p>
<p>Sadly this little trick (which we use for <code>m.room.member</code> events) doesn't work in the case of live location sharing, as the feature demands the ability to share location from multiple devices at once. Hence, trying to send two <code>m.beacon_info</code> events with the same state key would overwrite each other.</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to expand the functionality by modifying the definition so that a user &quot;owns&quot; a state event if the state key <em>starts</em> with their Matrix ID. Problem solved... for the most part!</p>
<p>Do check out the MSC if you have some use cases in mind that would benefit from something like this.</p>

<h3 id="hookshot-2-6-0">Hookshot 2.6.0</h3>
<p>Evenings greetings! It's been a while since we've done a Hookshot release, so this one is pretty large. We've got two major features this time around, <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/encryption.html"><strong>Encrypted Room Support</strong></a> and <strong>Service Bots</strong>. The former now allows you to invite the hookshot bot to encrypted rooms and issue commands to it as normal, it should work entirely transparently. It currently requires a homeserver with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3202">MSC3202</a> support, such as Synapse. One final note is that it's extremely experimental and beta-y, so please do not run this on your production instances or it might format your cats. However, plaese do report all your findings to us. We love fan mail 📧</p>
<p>Service bots is another great feature that now allows you to split hookshot into several different bots, so you can have a GitHub bot, a GitLab bot, a JIRA bot and so on. It's <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/service_bots.html">extremely flexible</a>, so please have a go and let us know what you think.</p>
<p>You can find this release at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/2.6.0, or by doing <code>docker pull halfshot/matrix-hookshot:2.6.0</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, the highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add support for end-to-bridge encryption via MSC3202. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/299">#299</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add support for additional bot users called &quot;service bots&quot; which handle a particular connection type, so that different services can be used through different bot users. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/573">#573</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add new GitHubRepo connection config setting <code>workflowRun.workflows</code> to filter run reports by workflow name. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/588">#588</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parent projects are now taken into account when calculating a user's access level to a GitLab project. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/539">#539</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure bridge treats published and drafted GitHub releases as different events. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/582">#582</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove support for Pantalaimon-based encryption. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/299">#299</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase maximum size of incoming webhook payload from <code>100kb</code> to <code>10mb</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/606">#606</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even though the end of the year is usually a quiet time, big steps forward have been made in the last couple of weeks on many important areas of the rust SDK.</p>
<p>With Sliding Sync being tried out in Element-X a few more bugs and edge-case scenarios have been uncovered, where it doesn’t play well yet. For example resending the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1307">correct extension settings on session restart</a> including <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1321">to-device-tokens</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1333">invalidation indexes</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1340">incorrectly skipping to-device processing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1335">various other smaller fixes</a>. The latter PR also contains a first set of integration-tests running testing the SDK against synapse and the sliding-sync-proxy. We intend to expand on that and include it in the CI as soon as github actions are unblocked for it.</p>
<p>Similar has been done on the Timeline feature, with a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1327">better more flexible timeline pagination implementation</a>, a new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1324">virtual loading indicator item</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1344">improved logging</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1287">date dividers and read markers</a>. All good stuff, making it easier to implement a useful chat UI on top of it.</p>
<p>On async UniFFI we see the same picture: with Swift, Kotlin and Python now executing rust futures as well as handling their error results properly. And time couldn’t be any better as we can hear the creaking of the blocking-runtime we currently have under the hood in Element-X and it is starting to show the limits of what we can implement in a useful manner. We are confident we can start experimenting with it in live apps fairly soon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the last few official Matrix holiday updates didn't mention as many of the cool community projects as I would have liked, I tried to work with the community to publish a community side review of 2022 as well as possibly some small teasers of what 2023 will bring. There are a lot of very varied updates, since everyone seems to have tackled the challenge differently, but I hope you you enjoy the result as much as I did: https://blog.neko.dev/posts/matrix-year-in-review-2022.html</p>
<p>A few days later we also published the same blog post on matrix.org, with a few typo fixes and cleanups: https://matrix.org/blog/2023/01/03/matrix-community-year-in-review-2022</p>
<p>This was a bit shot notice, so I would like to extend my gratitude to everyone who contributed and took some time in probably one of the busiest periods in a year! For the same reason, I hope you can excuse if one of your favourite projects is missing. If you have anything that is sorely missing, feel free to reach out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#year-in-2022:neko.dev">#year-in-2022:neko.dev</a> and maybe I can amend the blog post.</p>
<p>Have a great 2023 everyone!</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>After a lull from the holiday period, work has continued on different parts of the spec. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706">MSC3706</a> has merged, which furthers the spec side of the work to make joining rooms faster in Matrix (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3902">MSC3902</a> for the overview).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3938">MSC3938</a> has also been merged to the spec. The proposal removes a deprecated <code>keyId</code> field and cleans up the endpoint by disallowing trailing slashes.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3885">MSC3885: Sliding Sync Extension: To-Device messages</a>!</p>
<p>Sliding Sync (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575">MSC3575</a>) is the next generation of sync - how Matrix clients receive new data from their homeserver. The spec side of the feature has been designed to be modular, with different extensions of spec provided different functionality. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3885">MSC3885</a> is one of those extensions, and defines how <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#send-to-device-messaging">To-Device Messages</a> (how different user devices talk directly to each other) would be requested by a Matrix client from the homeserver.</p>

<p>Element-web client on IPFS</p>
<p>It has been a while since last time anyone announced their effort to host (and keep up to date) Element-web on IPFS.
Since Element-web is a client-side static web application, it works just fine when accessed through local IPFS gateway (like kubo/go-ipfs, ipfs-companion browser addon makes it almost seamless).</p>
<p>Latest version (updated within 2 days of the release):
/ipns/element.sibnsk.net  (/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dj43aqkofq4ggbd7nnpvg8j1ia79deab41bfe4zrp86xoht5w2j)</p>

/ipns/elements.sibnsk.net (/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dmc2sqzfh36v85ucddrw3vbd21erk77wc1pot16j5mqqjmwjyc3)</p>
<p>Note: those are unpacked release archives from github with <code>config.json</code> being a copy of <code>config.sample.json</code>.</p>
<p>Files stored on IPFS benefit greatly from more people accessing, storing and sharing them, so everyone is invited to use and pin (periodically, as new versions are released).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week, we merged the core API for <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/413">Tasks / ToDoList and Todos</a> using matrix events into <code>main</code>. <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/issues/424">While connecting the flutter UI</a> is ongoing (which has reverently been <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/418">revamped to be more streamline and intuitive to use</a>) this marks a major milestone in getting the proof of concept done. It shows that using stateful objects inside matrix spaces that can be collaborated upon with simple matrix events is feasible for regular end-user-style applications. The <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/413">PR</a> also brings with it integration tests and a TUI app show-casing live-updating tasks lists and tasks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile many issues have been fixed around chat, the code has been updated to latest matrix-sdk and <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/419">we are working hard on reactivating the integration test suite</a> for better quality assurance. Which is increasingly important as we are sketching out the other generic stateful objects - like the <a href="https://github.com/effektio/effektio/pull/428">comments system</a>, news, pins and reactions.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have received a lot of positive feedback about <a href="https://effektio.org/whitepaper/">the whitepaper we launched last month</a> outlining what we are after when building this and how we intend this all to move forward. If you haven't read it yet, we are still curious to know what you think of it.</p>

<p>There is a large interest in FOSDEM from the Matrix community, and we are very excited to see not just a stand, not just an online track, but the first ever in person Matrix devroom happening this year! The officially allotted time <a href="https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/matrix/">for the Matrix devroom</a> at FOSDEM however is only half a day.
Some friends and matrix enthusiasts who met at the first Matrix Community Summit Berlin in 2022 feel there is more to discuss and want more time to meet more of this amazing community we are part of, without taking away from the FOSDEM experience itself.</p>
<p><strong>We are happy to announce the FOSDEM23 Matrix Community Meetup at <a href="https://hsbxl.be/">Hackerspace Brussels</a> (HSBXL)!</strong>
The meetup is set to begin on Friday 03 February around 13:00 local time (CET) and will go into the evening. See https://hsbxl.be/contact/ for multiple well documented ways how to find us. Thank you HSBXL for providing a location for this!
There is no definite schedule, instead we want to give the space for discussions to develop organically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a> style. If you have a certain interest to learn about something or you want to present something in particular, we want to hear about it!
Furthermore, be aware that HSBXL is hosting more events in the FOSDEM &quot;fringe&quot;, such as a <a href="https://hsbxl.be/events/byteweek/2023/hsbxl-beer-event/">beer tasting</a> on Friday right after our Matrix Meetup, and also the <a href="https://hsbxl.be/events/byteweek/2023/bytenight/">bytenight</a> party on Saturday.

<p>Yes, you are reading correct. This is about Matrix Art ^^</p>
<p>After quite some while, I started to work on it again. I merged the new design into main, updated the UI, and it is available at https://art.midnightthoughts.space/ again.</p>
<p>Current goals are to add the User and Post pages again and implement of the new storage system. The new system uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/travis/msc/trees/proposals/3089-file-tree-structures.md">Spaces as FS</a> at its core for the timeline.</p>
<p>Specifically, Matrix Art is basically a big Space containing a Folder for each User, similar to a Room Directory. In that, there are Timeline spaces which act as the Public Feed. This allows Matrix Art to provide a way of having invite only feeds as well, using normal room permissions.</p>
<p>In practice, the tree is like this (thanks to Travis for designing this many months ago): </p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>+ 📂 Matrix Art User Dir (public, m.space)
</span><span>    + 📂 User A (public, m.space)
</span><span>        + 📂 Timeline (m.space)
</span><span>            - 📄 Image A
</span><span>            = Room A (invite protected, &lt;no type&gt;)
</span><span>                - 📄 Image B (counted as under the timeline)
</span><span>    + 📂 User B (public, m.space)

<p>Quick update on the <a href="https://matrix.directory/">matrix.directory</a> website: we've added the custom event type <code>io.element.functional_members</code>. As you may know, many projects within Matrix don't use any custom event types at all. This can make it difficult to find custom event types, which is (ironically) why I created the matrix.directory website in the first place.</p>
<p>You can find the source code for the website on <a href="https://github.com/BramvdnHeuvel/Matrix-Events-Directory">GitHub</a>.

</ul>
<p>Conduit is getting a lot more usable with this release, the main missing feature is backfill over federation (loading room messages from before your server joined a room).
To update conduit, simply stop it, replace the binary and start it again.

<p>Ho ho ho Matrix fans!</p>
<p>It's that time of year again, and we have a special gift for all of you just in time for the holidays: Neochat now supports end-to-end encryption! This is made possible thanks to the release of libQuotient 0.7.</p>
<p>While this feature is still somewhat experimental, it's a big step forward in ensuring the privacy and security of your conversations. Just keep in mind that if your only logged-in client is Neochat and something goes wrong, you might lose your messages.</p>
<p>If you're feeling adventurous and want to try out the new end-to-end encryption feature, you can already get it from Flathub and some distros. We're also working on supporting it in our Windows, Android, and macOS builds, so stay tuned for updates.</p>
<p>And in the spirit of the season, here's a Christmas joke: Why was the JavaScript developer's house cold? Because he left his closure open!</p>

<p>Happy Holidays from us at Element! This is our last update for 2022, and it’s a good ‘un.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’re still working on Notifications, reviewing how they work across platforms for new users, and planning the improvements we’re looking to make in the new year. While we look at this user experience holistically, we’re making some subtle changes to the product including removing the bold dot and ordering rooms by activity by default for new users.</li>
<li>We’re also continuing to improve the password reset flow so that user’s who can’t remember their passwords have a smoother experience regaining access to their account.</li>
<li>And, thanks to a contribution we now have the ability to multi-select members when changing users’ permissions in a room! Head to Room Settings &gt; Roles &amp; Permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In labs (you can enable labs features in settings on develop.element.io or on Nightly):</p>
<ul>
<li>Rich text editor improvements are still coming so be sure to check them out, including updates to emoji handling and  inline code formatting.</li>
<li>Threads! Threads notifications and performance improvements are landing thick and fast. We’re nearly ready to enable the feature by default and we’ll be excited to do that in the new year.
<ul>
<li>Be sure to check that you’re still in the threads beta for this release as in fixing some bugs your setting may have been changed.</li>

<blockquote>
<h1 id="libquotient-0-7">libQuotient 0.7</h1>
<p>It took us (yes, us - there's more than one person actively working on the project!) a very long time but libQuotient 0.7.0 is out, with a <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.7.0">huge wall of release notes</a>. Big, big, BIG thanks to Carl Schwan and Tobias Fella for their contributions and early adoption of this release in NeoChat (NeoChat maintained compatibility with libQuotient's development branch, along with the stable branch, for quite some time by now). A short summary of most significant things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements: C++20, Qt 5.15 or 6.x</li>
<li>E2EE code is now in beta quality, features:
<ul>
<li>sending/receiving new messages</li>
<li>getting historical messages where Megolm keys are already loaded</li>
<li>encrypting/decrypting attachments</li>
<li>device verification (to-device flow only, no in-room verification yet)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Individual APIs for <code>m.fully_read</code> and <code>m.read</code> markers</li>
<li>Client-Server API backend uses Matrix 1.5 API definitions</li>
<li>A complete rewrite of the event types framework to make it truly extensible; you can now add both base classes and specific event types on the client side without touching the library code (the library still provides standard ones)</li>
<li>Account registry for multi-account usage; account access tokens and pickling keys are stored with Qt Keychain</li>
<li>Sticker events support</li>
<li>Pinned messages support</li>
<li>First-class support in Network Access Manager for <code>mxc:</code> URLs, to enable showing inline images in messages</li>
<li>A lot of code tightening, bug fixing, performance improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to those who observe those - and hopefully I'll get to my senses and release 0.8 sooner than in another year 🙂</p>

<blockquote>
<h1 id="matrix-spam-ml">Matrix Spam ML</h1>
<p>As part of the efforts for working on detecting spam using ML I started to write a moderation bot.</p>
<p>This bot is written from scratch with some design decisions that hopefully will improve usability for both newcomers and seasoned admins.</p>
<p>These decisions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an action can be done using a reaction, then it will be done using a reaction.</li>
<li>There is a private admin room and a public room for warnings, where admins issue actions. This is meant to serve as a human-readable ban list if admins want to provide this to their users.</li>
<li>The bot will at a later point be able to issue reports to server admins via email and matrix easily by allowing admins to just react after doing a ban. The bot will initially ask how to contact a server if it didn't issue a report to the server before. The bot will remember the setting supplied last time for a server and allows updating the settings if they change. These reports will contain a warning that it was issued from the bot and that replies are necessary for it to be properly relayed back to the admins for further questions. These replies will end up as threads in the admin room. Also, as part of the report, the event JSON for the report will be sent with the report to allow server admins to review the case themselves. (This is still WIP)</li>
</ul>
<p>The warnings also contain a &quot;false positive&quot; action. This is meant to be used to feed back into the used model for further training and improving it.</p>
<p>All in all, I hope to simplify the process of moderation based on what I experienced as an admin. Feel free to chime in at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spam-ml:midnightthoughts.space">#matrix-spam-ml:midnightthoughts.space</a> to suggest ideas for the bot. At the time of writing, it is still very much a prototype/demo.</p>
<p>The code can be found at https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-spam-ml/tree/main/bot</p>
<p>Documentation can be found at: https://mtrnord.github.io/matrix-spam-ml/bot</p>
