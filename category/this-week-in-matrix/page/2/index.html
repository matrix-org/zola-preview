<p>A bundle of small quality-of-life changes to the .well-known server and client endpoints. Removing some ambiguities, replacing old and deprecated endpoints as well as a potential size cap suggestion.</p>
<p>Looks like a good contender for one to push over the line given a bit of review and response!</p>

<p>We've started work on our HG HomeServer written in pure TypeScript, compilable as a single JS file, with no dependencies except NodeJS. It's intended for a special use cases when Matrix is used as a backbone for custom apps. It's lightweight, minimal and for the moment isn't even planned to support full Matrix spec. We might make it possible to run it on browser later. https://github.com/heusalagroup/hghs</p>

<h3 id="dendrite-website">Dendrite (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Second generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.0">Dendrite 0.9.0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.1">Dendrite 0.9.1</a>. There are quite a few big changes, including an all-new caching model and several optimisations. This release also moves our baseline supported Go version up to Go 1.18.</p>
<p>The following changes are included across both releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite now uses Ristretto for managing in-memory caches
<ul>
<li>Should improve cache utilisation considerably over time by more intelligently selecting and managing cache entries compared to the previous LRU-based cache</li>
<li>Defaults to a 1GB cache size if not configured otherwise</li>
<li>The estimated cache size in memory and maximum age can now be configured with new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/e94ef84aaba30e12baf7f524c4e7a36d2fdeb189/dendrite-sample.monolith.yaml#L44-L61">configuration options</a> to prevent unbounded cache growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for serving the <code>/.well-known/matrix/client</code> hint directly from Dendrite
<ul>
<li>Configurable with the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/blob/e94ef84aaba30e12baf7f524c4e7a36d2fdeb189/dendrite-sample.monolith.yaml#L67-L69">configuration option</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refactored membership updater, which should eliminate some bugs caused by the membership table getting out of sync with the room state</li>
<li>The User API is now responsible for sending account data updates to other components, which may fix some races and duplicate account data events</li>
<li>Optimised database query for checking whether a remote server is allowed to request an event over federation without using anywhere near as much CPU time (PostgreSQL only)</li>
<li>Database migrations have been refactored to eliminate some problems that were present with <code>goose</code> and upgrading from older Dendrite versions</li>
<li>Media fetching will now use the <code>/v3</code> endpoints for downloading media from remote homeservers</li>
<li>HTTP 404 and HTTP 405 errors from the client-facing APIs should now be returned with CORS headers so that web-based clients do not produce incorrect access control warnings for unknown endpoints</li>
<li>Some preparation work for full history visibility support</li>
<li>Upgrades a dependency which caused issues building Dendrite with Go 1.19</li>
<li>The roomserver will no longer give up prematurely after failing to call <code>/state_ids</code></li>
<li>Removes the faulty room info cache, which caused of a number of race conditions and occasional bugs (including when creating and joining rooms)</li>
<li>The media endpoint now sets the <code>Cache-Control</code> header correctly to prevent web-based clients from hitting media endpoints excessively</li>
<li>The sync API will now advance the PDU stream position correctly in all cases (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/sergekh2">sergekh2</a>)</li>
<li>The sync API will now delete the correct range of send-to-device messages when advancing the stream position</li>
<li>The device list <code>changed</code> key in the <code>/sync</code> response should now return the correct users</li>
<li>A data race when looking up missing state has been fixed</li>
<li>The <code>/send_join</code> API is now applying stronger validation to the received membership event</li>
<li>Fixes a crash that could occur during event redaction</li>
<li>The <code>/members</code> endpoint will no longer incorrectly return HTTP 500 as a result of some invite events</li>
<li>Send-to-device messages should now be ordered more reliably and the last position in the stream updated correctly</li>
<li>Parsing of appservice configuration files is now less strict (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/Kab1r">Kab1r</a>)</li>
<li>The sync API should now identify shared users correctly when waking up for E2EE key changes</li>
<li>The federation <code>/state</code> endpoint will now return a HTTP 403 when the state before an event isn't known instead of a HTTP 500</li>
<li>Presence timestamps should now be calculated with the correct precision</li>
<li>A race condition in the roomserver's room info has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition in the sync API has been fixed</li>
</ul>

<p>This bridge connects users on Matrix and Discord ‚Äì or other platforms, if combined with other bridges.
Earlier this year the community bridge has been adopted by the Matrix.org bridge team to give it some attention.
Its most recent update dated back to December 2020 and some fixes waited for a new release.</p>
<p>Well, here it is! v2.0.0
Its breaking changes are the requirement of NodeJS 14 or newer and the usage of <code>yarn</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>.
Furthermore, the update introduces a changelog and rolls out the guidelines we use for developing other matrix.org bridges.</p>

<p>A Social Annotation Tool Powered by Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gleachkr:matrix.org">gleachkr</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a short vacation, I've done some new work on populus-viewer. Most of this has been UX and bugfixes, but I've added one new feature that I wanted to share. <a href="https://github.com/opentower/matrix-doc/blob/audio-markup/proposals/3775-markup-locations-for-audiovisual-media.md">MSC3775: Markup Locations for Audiovisual Media</a> gives a spec for annotating audio and video on matrix, but it also allows you to annotate images. So, for completeness sake, I've added support for annotating image files in Populus! This might be useful for discussing publication layouts, product designs, or for teaching art history. So populus can now annotate: video, audio, images and pdfs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api/">matrix-widget-api</a> v1.0.0 was released yesterday, reflecting the fact that we're not expecting any big changes to the library's architecture for the foreseeable future, and that it's more or less ready for wider use.</p>
<p>It also comes with a couple of new features ‚ú® for widget authors: Sending and receiving to-device messages with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3819">MSC3819</a>, and getting TURN servers from the client with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3846/">MSC3846</a>. Together, these features enable some new complex use-cases, such as doing VoIP from inside a widget. See Matrix Live for a preview of what that looks like with Element Call! üìπÔ∏è</p>
<p>This is as good a time as any to mention that matrix-widget-api doesn't have to just be for web-based apps. If you're building mobile apps with Matrix and want to make use of widgets, running matrix-widget-api inside a web view to liaison with the actual widget can make it a lot simpler to start supporting widget API features. If you're curious, watch Element iOS+Android for upcoming examples of this.</p>

<li>This week we've been building on the initial work on the pion call server (SFU) from Sean, and have made our very first call through it with Element Call! It's still very early and there's still lots of work to do, but this will allow Element Call to scale up to much higher numbers of people.</li>
<li>The VoIP team are also looking after widgets now, and in our quest to embed Element Call into the Element apps, we've hit the milestone of releasing matrix-widget-api 1.0.0. We're also making great progress towards embedding into Element Web.

<blockquote>
<p>This week saw a few major improvements on the dev-ex of the Rust SDK (among others): <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/892">support for refresh tokens</a> landed; we have a setup for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/855">integration tests against an actual synapse instance now</a> (and started writing tests); our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/897">docs for <code>main</code> now contain the js bindings, too</a>; <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/889">event handlers can now be unregistered</a> and we've added an API for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/899">room specific event handlers</a>. Further more, we've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/903">refactored the examples</a> (now to be found in <code>/examples</code> rather than some sub-sub-directory no one finds) and created two more: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/dfec17e6afbf6c1ea35e9ee968c7668eb4a46a04/examples/getting_started/src/main.rs"><code>getting-started</code></a> combines the autojoin and command-example with a lot more additional inline comment to explain what is going on and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/dfec17e6afbf6c1ea35e9ee968c7668eb4a46a04/examples/custom_events/src/main.rs"><code>custom-events</code></a> showcases how to use the sdk and ruma types to send any custom events (in that case a ping-ack example) over matrix!</p>
<p>This was also a week of fighting the ci. After the integration tests landed, coverage reporting broke and an investigation was kicked off to check whether llvm-cov is in a usable state for us by now (it is not), but a fix was found. We've also started regretting adding <code>npm</code>-based workflows in our repo, as we've found ourselves at the end of an upgrade bug and the saw CI failing without us changing anything :shakes_fist_at_sky: . A fix was found quickly by pinning a sub-dependency. On a similar note, we've postponed merging the kotlin bindings until the android team is back on it and available to answer some questions we have, and the wasm-js bindings showed build failures on CI, which the original author will have to take a look at after coming back from vacation - thus delaying <code>crypto-js</code> a bit further.</p>

<p>This week I'm showing off an early look at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive">Matrix public archive</a>. As the name suggests, it acts as an archive of history for your world-readable Matrix rooms. This allows you to view historical content day-by-day and jump back years ago to see what your Matrix room was up to.</p>
<p>More importantly, it also allows Google to do the same thing so you‚Äôll probably start finding Matrix content from your favorite search engine and be able to harness the massive knowledge base stored in Matrix. Imagine seeing Matrix logs instead of Stack Overflow answers when googling questions! The new portal into the Matrix ecosystem üåå</p>
<p>You can also see this demoed in <a href="https://youtu.be/6KHQSeJTXm0?t=583">this week's Matrix Live video</a> (at the top of the page).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/zFISGvYfCIhdqunsrPZMhOF.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Under the hood, we use the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3030">MSC3030 <code>/timestamp_to_event</code></a> endpoint to fetch the messages for a given day and then we sever-side render the events with the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web">Hydrogen SDK</a>. Re-using Hydrogen gets us pretty and native(to Element) looking UI and keeps the maintenance burden of supporting new event types in Hydrogen.</p>

It was a &quot;for fun&quot; type of thing. But I can see it being useful for people who do not have access to a raspberry pi (such as myself at the moment) to use as a small homeserver. It can hold up in 1 to 1 Direct Messages and in small rooms.

<p>This MSC covers an Extensible Events (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) schema definition for translatable text! This would allow a client to send a message in multiple languages, with the receiver able to choose which language they're prefer to see the message in (ideally falling back to a default or machine translation if their preferred language was not available).</p>
<p>Like other MSCs that rely on Extensible Events, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767">MSC1767</a> will need to land before this MSC can. But until then, it's great to see all of the wonderful things this feature will allow Matrix to do!

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been a week of quite, constant progress on many fronts, most not that visible to the outside observer. For once, the progress on integration sliding sync into element-x for iOS has taken up speed, with many smaller bug fixes and additional features exposed through the FFI being added and performance optimisations. After the internal jack-in testing tool, this is the first actual trial of sliding sync for rust (and after the js-implementation, only the second client to actually use sliding sync overall)‚Äîand it has been tremendous. Latest tests put the loading time to first view on the first 20-ish rooms at a 150ms range üéâ.</p>
<p>More visible to the keen observers of the repository has been that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/874">we've updated the <code>event_handler</code> API</a> to allow removing existing handlers, an important step towards implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/868">completion guaranteeing API calls</a>, and that we've <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/882">support for custom encrypted events</a> now.</p>

<p>In addition to that, <a href="https://matrix.org/open-tech-will-save-us/">Open Tech Will Save Us will be back on Wednesday 27 at 16:00 UTC</a>! The topic will be &quot;what makes a platform&quot;, or more specifically: &quot;are Linux or the web platforms&quot;. There are many fascinating topics to discuss, such as &quot;is it possible to create an app for Linux&quot; (it's not as simple as it sounds), &quot;why are some people against theming?&quot;, or &quot;why do developers want to use platforms&quot;.</p>
<p>And to answer that, who other than the Linux desktop most advanced projects GNOME and KDE, and people working on Matrix, the protocol that wants to become as unmissable as the web itself, and more specifically on a deeper integration of widgets with Matrix clients?</p>
<p>You can join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#otwsu:matrix.org">#otwsu:matrix.org</a> to ask your questions on July 27 during the live show, and bookmark either https://stream.matrix.org or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGE2KEasjbc">YouTube stream</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of MSCs moving through the pipeline in the last couple weeks! As always, be sure to take a look at those in Final Comment Period above - only a few days left to comment on them before they merge/close!</p>
<p>Otherwise the Spec Core Team is looking to try and get a handle on the current MSC backlog - this means taking a look at all of the open MSCs, triaging them and organising them into a loose priority queue. This is likely to take quite a while to do and may not ever be complete - but should give us and everyone else an idea of what's expected to land in upcoming Matrix spec versions.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3217">MSC3217: Soft kicks</a>!</p>
<p>The idea this MSC proposes is to add a possible <code>m.softkick</code> field to room membership events of type &quot;leave&quot;, which if present will inform clients that the user has only been kicked temporarily, and they are welcome to rejoin.</p>
<p>This helps with the IRC bridging use case laid out in the MSC.</p>

<h3 id="construct-server">Construct Server</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct server has been refurbished to support the Ubuntu 22.04+ platform. I am happy to
report that Construct performs faster and more reliably than ever before. It's been
a long time since the last update due to COVID-related health problems, but development
has picked up again. I'd like to thank @manu_kamath:matrix.org and @uis246 for their
contributions, and of course Yan Minari for keeping things together over the past year.
Additional work implementing the latest MSC's will continue in the coming weeks so I
encourage everyone to show support in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> and contribute if possible.</p>
<p>Several enhancements have taken place this release, so I'd just like to highlight one
here: The media database has been eliminated and has been integrated into the main
events database. Construct did always store media in rooms by splitting files
into blocks, but it offloaded the content block to separate storage leaving just a
hash of the content in the matrix event. Construct now stores blocks directly in event
content via hardware-accelerated base64 encoding. The result performs better because 
there's only one database query instead of two, and the room can be shared between
servers in a Construct Cluster.</p>
<p>Construct is a performant and robust Matrix Server and Natural Language Processor.
Please be mindful of any laws in your country which require registering your instance
for commercial use.</p>

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io">Brendan Abolivier</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we've released Synapse 1.63! This release includes a few features such as better rate limiting for invites, as well as experimental support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">MSC3827</a> which allows filtering public room search results by room type. The latter will, once stabilised, allow for better discoverability of public spaces since it will allow clients to specifically look for them. Read all about this new release on the matrix.org blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/07/20/synapse-1-63-released</p>
<p>We've also spent some time clarifying documentation and prompts about the usage statistics Synapse automatically reports if configured with <code>report_stats</code> set to <code>true</code>. The <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.63/usage/administration/monitoring/reporting_homeserver_usage_statistics.html">new documentation page</a> lists exactly what is reported and how this reporting works. This clarification work included removing the use of &quot;anonymised&quot; when referring to this feature to make it clearer that, even though Synapse does not report identifiable information about users and rooms, it does report the homeserver's name (i.e. the value of the <code>server_name</code> configuration setting).</p>

<p>Say hello to a new bridge in Matrix universe (or rather fediverse): <strong>Threematrix</strong>. As you might've guessed from the name: It's a bridge between the Threema messenger and Matrix. Threema is a very popular messenger in europe, especially in German speaking countries (it's a swiss company). We've just released our very first alpha version ‚Äì it's a very simple bot bridge for now, but we have quite a lot of improvements on our todo list. Currently, it only works with the (paid) Threema Gateway API product, but we're trying to talk to Threema to come up with a more affordable hobbyist pricing model for bridge use. Feel free to follow our releases in the <a href="https://github.com/bitbetterde/Threematrix">GitHub repo</a>, follow our <a href="https://mastodon.social/web/@threematrix">Mastodon account</a> and join our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#threema-bridge:matrix.org">Matrix room</a> to stay up to date or ask any questions.</p>

<p>Hookshot 1.8.1</p>
<p>Hello all -- since our last TWIM announcement, Hookshot has been updated from 1.7.2 to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.8.1">1.8.1</a>. Aside from usability fixes and documentation improvements, there have been some notable changes to generic webhook support:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>XML webhook payloads are now decoded</strong> instead of being treated as blobs of text. This means they render more nicely as room messages, and more importantly, it allows them to work with custom <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/setup/webhooks.html#javascript-transformations">JavaScript transformations</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/410">#410</a>)</li>
<li><strong><code>GET</code> requests for generic webhooks are no longer supported by default.</strong> For details, refer to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/setup/webhooks.html#get-requests">the documentation</a>.

<p>I got a fantastic release for you to day and it won't fit inside a normal sized update so without further ado, here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notification counts üíØ (LorenDB, d42)
<ul>
<li>You can now see notification counts in more spaces, like your task bar or in
the community sidebar.</li>
<li>For better work-life balance you can hide the notification counts on a per
space basis.</li>
<li>For notification counts in the task bar your desktop environment needs to
support the Unity protocol.</li>
<li>Notifications are also preserved across restarts now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moderation üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
<ul>
<li>You can now change the permissions and aliases of a room.</li>
<li>Permissions are shown in the Memberlist</li>
<li>A new <code>/redact</code> command to redact an event or all messages by a user.</li>
<li>You can now provide a reason when inviting, knocking, kicking and banning
users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Faster startup ‚ö°
<ul>
<li>On at least some systems startup should now be instant even with thousands
of rooms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Encryption improvements üõ°Ô∏è
<ul>
<li>Support for the most recent changes to Matrix E2EE including fallback keys,
no longer relying on the sender_key.</li>
<li>Compatibility and stability improvements when dealing with different base64
encodings and when verifying users and devices.</li>
<li>Fetch the whole online key backup at the click of a button.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integration with external apps üó∫Ô∏è (LorenDB)
<ul>
<li>Nheko now has a D-Bus API, which you can enable in the settings menu.</li>
<li>This allows applications like KRunner or Rofi to list and switch between
rooms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are reading this a bit early, the release builds might still be cooking, but they should be available in the next few hours. There about 40 more features and at least 30 bugfixes waiting for you, so checkout the release here: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases/tag/v0.10.0 . I'd like to thank as always everyone who contributed to this release, it has been a pleasure to work with you folks and I hope I will see a few of you in the next release as well.</p>
<p>As you might be able to tell, moderation features were a big topic this release. But they are clearly not done yet and I expect more of those to land in the future now that Nheko is fairly mature. There are also a few other cool features planned, so while this release is exciting, there will always be more! Same bad client, same bad... wait, this is not my outro!</p>

<li>We have started to work on using the new Realm Kotlin SDK (we are using the legacy Java SDK at the moment): it should improve the stability of the app (and so the crash free session) and improve devX. Nearly all the possible blocking points have been handled. This will force us to use suspend methods, which will be useful for ElementX.</li>
<li>Latest tweaks on FTUE have been merged on develop. We will iterate on a few things, but we are close to releasing the feature! New wordings for FTUE are waiting for translations on Weblate. Thanks to all the contributors!</li>

<p>New project! <code>open-super-dapp-android</code> is a fully open source, open standard, decentralized &quot;super app&quot; including a secure, encrypted Matrix compatible messenger based off of the Element Messenger, and an Ethereum crypto wallet and web3 browser based off of Alpha Wallet. Our mission is to foster, and provide access to, a decentralized and secure digital commons for all. Github repo: https://github.com/2gatherproject/open-super-dapp-android</p>
<p>OSD is a downstream project of Element, aiming to provide the functionalities of a &quot;super app&quot; like WeChat, just as an open, distributed and not-for-profit app instead of a proprietary, closed and for-profit one.</p>
<p>This software is pre-alpha, actively seeking contributors, donors and maintainers/leaders. Get in on the ground floor and help build something amazing!</p>
<p>Currently, Open Super dApp builds and runs with full functionality of the Element messenger and Alpha Wallet in the same Android app, with all existing tests passing. Efforts to further integrate their functionalities are just beginning.</p>
<p>Next steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate easy to use person to person Ethereum payment functionality between Matrix users.</li>
<li>Provide a powerful and easy to use messaging and payment javascript API for use by web3 applications accessed through the Open Super dApp. Produce sample web dApps using this API.</li>
<li>Centralize cryptographic secrets between the wallet and the messenger.</li>
<li>Build a parallel iOS version for iPhones using Element iOS and Alpha Wallet iOS.</li>

<p>This week has seen an merges of many minor, partially longer-pending PRs into the mainline code base: among them a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/851">fix for a longer pending CI problem with Apply builds</a>, an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/854">update to latest ruma</a> and many minor fixes and style improvements. We've also gotten the Crypto-bindings for the JS in web using WASM a lot further, the only thing remaining for a release are some last minute PRs and fixes in the release infrastructure. But the most changes to the code base this week have been coming from the appservice department, who've submitted, reviewed and merged a whopping seven PRs this week, fixing various problems and adding a bunch of appservice specific features.</p>
<p>Beyond purely code changes this week has seen a lot of project starts, too: For ones, with the help of the rust team, the iOS Team has started integrating the Sliding-Sync/Sync V3 into the upcoming Element-X-Series;  the team has put up the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/855">first PR to add integration tests against an actual synapse server</a> (some issues pending); a workshop set out the first ideas for the new upcoming timeline API; and a very <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/868">interesting draft PR</a> was brought in from community member <a href="https://github.com/docweirdo">docweirdo</a> proposing a new API on top of the existing SDK to have futures wait for actual completion - no more sending a message and observing sync for the appropriate response yourself.</p>

When I'm back, I just need to tell the bot and it will automatically turn off the auto-responder and give me a summary of the DMs in which I've missed messages while I was away.</p>

<p>This week Matthew gives us a general update on everything Matrix and Element. What is going on with Sliding Sync, OpenID Connect or P2P Matrix? Let's find out!</p>
<p>We're also pleased to announce the next episode of Open Tech Will Save Us has been scheduled. We will be talking live and interacting with you on July 27, 16:00 UTC (18:00 CEST) on the subject of platforms with people from GNOME, KDE and Element.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3847">MSC3847: Ignoring invites with policy rooms</a></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3786">MSC3786: Add a default push rule to ignore <code>m.room.server_acl</code> events</a> (merge)</li>

<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The Spec Core Team took a concentrated effort to work through our priority backlog of MSCs, resulting in the decent amount of MSCs hitting FCP this week!</p>
<p>Thankfully the community has nearly matched this number by adding quite a few more MSCs into the fray. But we're still up by 1!</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most exciting MSCs to move forwards is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676: Message editing</a>, which allows users to edit events (including messages) that they've previously sent. Part of the aggregations work, this functionality has been used extensively throughout the ecosystem. But only now is it making its way into the spec proper. I'm also personally excited about <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2285">MSC2285: Private read receipts</a>, which allows users to read a room's contents without advertising it.</p>
<p>Of course the above MSCs are still in Final Comment Period; a 5 day period where anyone can raise their concerns about an MSC before it is accepted. So if you have any last-minute comments, be sure to get them in now!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2666">MSC2666: Get rooms in common with another user</a>!</p>
<p>Another MSC I'm personally excited about! This MSC provides an endpoint on the homeserver to request the rooms (or spaces) you have in common with another user. I would find this useful for incoming DMs from users I may or may not know. Note that the client may not already have this information if it is making use of <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#lazy-loading-room-members">lazy loading room members</a>, so it needs a way to ask the server for this information.</p>
<p>Looks like the MSC is currently sitting in the Spec Core Team's review backlog. We'll get to it soon!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Synapse team has been hard at work! This week we published <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.63.0rc1">Synapse 1.63.0rc1</a>. Among the notable features are support for MSC3827: filtering <code>/publicRooms</code> by room type, allowing for better discovery of Spaces. You can read more about that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827">here</a>. In addition, the release contains a number of bugfixes, updates to the documentation, and internal changes focused on reducing memory usage and increasing performance, as well as supporting the long-standing goal of faster room joins. More on these next week in the official release announcement!</p>

<p>Good news, as you might have noticed, conduit.rs is back online and better than ever! Matrix.org is so kind and donates this Linux server to me. I already host a discord appservice and handle 23k messages per day and, most importantly, now I'm at the top of both #ping rooms ;)</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can now edit aliases in Nheko! This means you can publish your own aliases in the room directory as well as in the room. If an alias can't be used by people (because it isn't listed in the room directory), that alias is highlighted in red with an easy option to fix it (if you have permissions to do so). You can also easily switch the primary (canonical) alias of the room.</p>
<p>With this the feature set I wanted to have for the next release is complete. I wanted to focus on improving moderation and room management capabilities in Nheko and it does now have a very basic sets of capabilities to do so. I do already have plans to expand on them though!</p>
<p>So instead of working on new features, I will be focusing on bug fixes. For a start if someone has the username <code>room</code>, Nheko will now omit the reply fallback to prevent pinging the whole room. The verification window now also should always be big enough to show its contents and we now properly explain to users, why emojis might look different on different devices fixing an issue reported via Twitter... There is also a new icon for the room directory (it is now a building, very punny, huh?).</p>

<li>Nvrwhere has improved NeoChat's Timeline layout: On a wide window, the bubbles will now be centered in the window, in order to better use the space while not stretching the timeline out too far</li>
<li>He's also fixed several papercut issues around the UI, for example editing and replying using the keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>The browser will now properly open when clicking on a link when using wayland</li>
<li>The first part of Snehit's GSoC project is almost ready to land: The room list is gaining a list of spaces, which can be used to filter for the rooms included in that space</li>
<li>We're also moving forward on the E2EE support, with NeoChat now allowing a user to send an encrypted message into a matrix room - provided libQuotient supports it üôÇ</li>
<li>Tobias is also working on improved Reaction &amp; Emoji pickers, which will allow users to select different variants like skin tones and which will behave better on mobile devices</li>

I explain what Matrix is, and show how to use curl to send and receive messages, and why it's &quot;interesting&quot; to write a server, and, as the title hints, I introduce the idea that Matrix can be for a lot more than messaging.</p>

Showcase yourself and your relation to the Matrix world. Let's get to know each other!
We aim to compile a versatile program. We are open to contributions of any length, from 5 minutes (lightning talks) to presentations and talks to workshops and hacksessions up to 5 hours. We‚Äôll come together to discover, celebrate and enjoy the world of matrix. Also, if you have any arty, cultural or playful contribution in mind, please offer it.</p>

<p>The Spec Core Team did some shuffling of our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/31">backlog board</a> this week in order to ensure that all in-flight and in-focus items are reflected on it.</p>
<p>Outside of that was the usual rounds of MSC review by team members.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2199">MSC2199: Canonical DMs</a>!</p>
<p>While the name may not make much sense to the layperson, the idea of a &quot;canonical&quot; Direct Messaging room (DM) is one that would always be referenced whenever a DM between two people is requested. That is, instead of potentially having a few different DM rooms with someone, both you and the other person would always know which room to use when DM'ing each other.</p>
<p>We don't really have this today. DM rooms are just group rooms with only you and someone else in them. If you attempt to DM another user, your client will try to guess the best room to use for this through some clever heuristics. What's lacking is a defined way to always arrive at the same room for this action.</p>
<p>This MSC attempts to define one, and would allow other functionality to be built on top of it, such as definitively knowing which room to send user-to-user data into, and to read from.</p>

<p>This week the Synapse team released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.62.0">Synapse 1.62</a>!

Read all about it on the Matrix.org blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/07/06/synapse-1-62-released</p>
<p>Apart from this, we've been working on refining and fine-tuning our processes as a team over the past few weeks, which, among other things, resulted in the creation of <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/development/reviews.html">this documentation</a> that gives contributors some insight on how we review pull requests on Synapse. Olivier has also landed his work on running <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/">Complement</a> (our next-gen integration test suite) against instances of Synapse using workers, which is a massive improvement for our CI.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can now edit aliases in Nheko! This means you can publish your own aliases in the room directory as well as in the room. If an alias can't be used by people (because it isn't listed in the room directory), that alias is highlighted in red with an easy option to fix it (if you have permissions to do so). You can also easily switch the primary (canonical) alias of the room.</p>
<p>With this the feature set I wanted to have for the next release is complete. I wanted to focus on improving moderation and room management capabilities in Nheko and it does now have a very basic sets of capabilities to do so. I do already have plans to expand on them though!</p>
<p>So instead of working on new features, I will be focusing on bug fixes. For a start if someone has the username <code>room</code>, Nheko will now omit the reply fallback to prevent pinging the whole room. The verification window now also should always be big enough to show its contents and we now properly explain to users, why emojis might look different on different devices fixing an issue reported via Twitter... There is also a new icon for the room directory (it is now a building, very punny, huh?).</p>

<p>While that has still occupied most of the teams' time, the community hasn't been idling either, and implement the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/811">API for permalinks to events</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/820">exposes the authentication service over FFI</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/810">API to get invite details for Invited Rooms</a>.

<p>A custom html element, web component, to display the latest messages from a matrix room</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ugp:matrix.org">@ugp:matrix.org</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>matrix-room-element</code> -&gt; <code>npm@v0.0.58</code> (GPLv3)</p>
<p><code>&lt;matrix-room-element/&gt;</code> is a web component (vanilla JS/HTML/CSS &amp; distributed un-minified) that can be imported and inserted in any web page, to display the content of a (public, soon with authentication, and private room support) matrix room.</p>
<ul>
<li>preview: https://sctlib.gitlab.io/matrix-room-element/</li>
<li>gitlab: https://gitlab.com/sctlib/matrix-room-element</li>
<li>npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sctlib/matrix-room-element/</li>
</ul>
<p>Development is continuing, some new web-components have now prototypes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;matrix-login/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;matrix-logout/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;matrix-auth/&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;matrix-create-room/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;matrix-edit-room/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;matrix-join-room/&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;matrix-send-event/&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;matrix-event/&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It is still heavy in development, and still looking for the right patterns (web components, and matrix).</p>
<p>We're trying to make composable components that can be inserted in any web page, and maybe help users use Matrix as a CMS, embedable anywhere (web). Our first use case is on https://libli.org (that now comes with a <code>/login</code> endpoint - alpha) (this event in libli, loading a <code>matrix-room-element</code> with correct room-id/event-id, https://libli.org/thisweekinmatrix:matrix.org/$KsbQ0JsqAXN9g-57M-aXyVohZYM3SZkKKkuUb9dW928).</p>
<p>Looking forward for use-cases, feedback, attribute naming discussion, simple patterns to make to code readable. (topics:  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-room-element:matrix.org">#matrix-room-element:matrix.org</a> <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libli:matrix.org">#libli:matrix.org</a>  )</p>

<p>I had the chance to have Ryan with me for a special edition of Open Tech Will Save Us on Thunderbird to celebrate their 102 release, which includes Matrix support for the first time in a stable release.</p>
<p>We covered many interesting topics, such as the importance of specifying the expected behaviour of clients and servers in a protocol to deliver the best experience to end users (wink, wink, reminds you of something?), why Thunderbird was more dormant and is now vibrant as ever, what they plan for the future.

<p>This MSC is a relatively simple it. Currently widgets are only allowed to specify their capabilities (what the widget is allowed to do, like reading the logged-in user's display name) when the widget is loaded. This MSC attempts to allow that model to be extended to let widgets ask for additional (or fewer) permissions over time.</p>
<p>I can't help but be reminded of the shift in permissions on iOS and Android here in how they shifted from &quot;ask all permissions up front&quot; to &quot;ask for permission for each thing when it's used in the app&quot; :)</p>

<li>The <code>/messages</code> endpoint will no longer return <code>&quot;end&quot;</code> when there are no more messages remaining</li>
<li>Deactivated user accounts will now leave all rooms automatically</li>
<li>New admin endpoint <code>/_dendrite/admin/evacuateUser/{userID}</code> has been added for forcing a local user to leave all joined rooms</li>
<li>Dendrite will now automatically attempt to raise the file descriptor limit at startup if it is too low</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>A rare crash when retrieving remote device lists has been fixed</li>
<li>Fixes a bug where events were not redacted properly over federation</li>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever noticed that some people are just plain @*%&amp;!¬ß%&quot;+? Well, to quickly deal with what they wrote, Nheko now has a <code>/redact @userid:server.name</code> command, so you can redact everything they wrote (as long as it is in the currently cached section of the timeline). Note that you will run into rate limits when using that and Nheko is not yet applying an appropriate backoff in that case.</p>
<p>Similarly, q234rty fixed a lot of cases where icons in Nheko were either blurry or the wrong size. We fixed a few crashes, the room list should now not sometimes store the wrong order of rooms, brausepulver made large avatars cropped locally (since servers don't guarantee any size over 96x96 when cropped and synapse doesn't properly save the full image size in that case) and added a menu entry to copy a roomlink. You can also now define new powerlevels for users instead of using the existing levels in the room and Jason fixed some compiler warnings when a private member struct doesn't have an explicit constructor on some compilers. Nheko also now downloads the full online key backup when you explicitly toggle the switch.</p>
<p>A more noticeable topic might be, that Nheko now requires servers which support the v1.1 API or later and will not allow you to login or register otherwise. At the same time we also enabled support for the shiny and new knock_restricted rule and all remaining groups code was removed (you know, the feature from before spaces were cool).</p>
<p>I also updated Nheko on my work laptop now and since I was quite surprised by how fast it starts now (while my room count is over 900 !), I attached a video of that below for your pleasure.</p>

<p>Because sometimes you just have to do something else and it might be interesting to some people:</p>
<ul>
<li>I fixed calls not working when trying to use Element Web with a Conduit server: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/8931</li>
<li>I fixed Element Android still using the unstable endpoint (i.e. the one from the MSC, that proposed it) to list aliases: https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/6288</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes fixing something that annoys you isn't even that hard, and since it annoys you, you have some motivation to fix it. I call this Anger Driven Development (ADD). If you have some things that annoy you, I encourage to try fixing them for a bit. It might help out some other people too. If that makes you want to contribute to Nheko, don't hesitate to join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> and ask me to help you out with whatever fix you are trying to contribute.</p>
<p>This time I just decided to clean out some issues, that came up in the Conduit development channel and that weren't fixed yet. Turns out it was just a few lines to change and it hopefully makes the Matrix experience better for everyone in  the long run. The changes were also quickly reviewed and are merged now. Do you have any such little fixes that no one hears about, but you are proud of them? Please post about them, I'd love to see them!</p>

<p>Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org">ben</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last few weeks, a significant push on rust-crypto-support for Nodejs has taken place, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/803">this PR</a>. Major parts are available, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/763">infrastructure to create releases ready</a>, however, a pretty rare huge memory allocation that causes a crash in Nodejs on the CI has blocked progress of the team recently. Debugging this <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/804">costs a lot of time and it is yet unclear</a>, how much of a problem this really is (as the cause stays mysterious), however it has also been seen in the wild on Windows now-- a concerning development.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean, there isn't any development going on. Thanks to the active community around the project, we now have a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/560">fix to prevent us from processing the same transaction twice</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/785">a method to create permalinks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/771">you can now verify sessions through FFI</a> as well as use the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/739">Client Builder via FFI</a>.

<p>Dart Matrix SDK: Version 0.10.2</p>
<p>This week, the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.10.2">version 0.10.2</a>. In this version, we added experimental support for native group call signaling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401">MSC3401</a>. We have been playing with it in our internal clients, and we have to say that we are pretty happy with the result! There are still some bugs, as sometimes a new call is creating instead of joining the existing one. But it's looking great!</p>
<p>We also took the opportunity to fix some bugs in call handling. Now the ringtone is properly properly when rejecting a call. Also, when opening the client, we don't trigger a call event anymore if the call end event is in the sync response.</p>
<p>We also did some refactoring for the sync handler, reducing the usage of JSON objects and adding some try catch to handle issues when handling event room updates. We switched to custom CachedStreamController so even if the stream has already been listened to, you can still access the last sent value.</p>
<p>Finally, when sending messages when under unreliable connection, messages could be sent out of order. This is now fixed thanks to the implementation of a message sending queue.</p>

<li>The room state API is now supported, try <code>synadm room state</code></li>
<li>And with the help of that API we created a command to easily generate a list of rooms and corresponding admins and mods: <code>synadm room power-levels</code></li>

<p>The big news from the spec <del>this</del> last week is the release of Matrix v1.3 üéâ (read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release">blog post</a> if you haven't already)! Roughly three months since the release of Matrix v1.2, this release brings improvements such as knocking on rooms, room version 10, reduced metadata in encrypted messages and the first pieces of aggregations finally landing in the spec proper. And more! See the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release">blog post</a> for the full changelog.</p>
<p>Most of the Spec Core Team has been away this week, thus there has not been much moving forwards. But we do have two new MSCs from <a href="https://github.com/duxovni">@duxovni</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Johennes">@Johennes</a>, which you can view above.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3077">MSC3077: Support for multi-stream VoIP</a> by <a href="https://github.com/SimonBrandner">@SimonBrandner</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC allows for differentiating between different incoming streams of media coming from a single user by adding a <code>sdp_stream_metadata</code> dictionary to Voice over IP (VoIP)-related events. This is a relatively simply addition with useful functionality, such as allowing a single user to share both their camera feed and screen share at the same time!</p>
<p>Check it out if that kind of stuff interests you!</p>

<p>This week the team released Synapse 1.61, which main new feature is media retention. That's right, you can now control how long Synapse keeps media files around, which should help server admins manage Synapse's disk space usage more efficiently. On a different note, this release of Synapse removes support for groups/communities (which was deprecated back in Synapse 1.56), as it has now been replaced by Spaces. Farewell groups, you have served your users well.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I skipped the last update, this one is a bit longer :3</p>
<p>First of all there have been lots and lots of updates to the translations! Finnish is now at 100% thanks to the tireless work of Aminda and Lurkki.</p>
<p>Nheko now also shows a nice badge on Unity compatible desktops (like KDE) for unread messages (although that doesn't work properly for multiple profiles being open at the same time due to limitations in that desktop protocol. Thank you d42 for contributing this, may you role a natural 42 every dice throw!</p>
<p>Syldra fixed up the paste behaviour (which didn't properly tie into undo in some edge cases), cleaned up how we find some of our dependencies and made cusor movement more consistent across systems.</p>
<p>Finally we fixed our glare resolution when verifying other sessions, which will be especially noticeable when verifying Cinny, since that responds to verification requests in a different way than I tested before! This should get rid of a whole range of verification issues people might have experienced. As part of our stabilization for the next release, we also fixed a crash on logout because I fatfingered and deleted a return statement, we now send an Element Android compatible height attribute on emotes, properly compile when the C++ version is set to 20, we once again support the current version of the hidden read receipts MSC (so that others can't tell what you read), edits now properly update in replies again, you can close the image overlay again by clicking outside, cancelled uploads properly get removed again, logging out and back in now doesn't mess up your configuration anymore and pinned messages now properly refresh once the events are loaded.</p>
<p>Phew, that was a mouthful. And we are not even done yet!</p>
<p>I spent some time on making Nheko compilation a bit faster again as well as improve startup speed. This might order your room list a bit weirdly for a few days after updating, but should normalize when receiving a few messages in some rooms. With this we now don't need to load the last message in all rooms on startup. This makes Nheko startup now only take 7 seconds on my old laptop (when not doing something CPU heavy at the same time). The remaining startup time is 40% building up the font database and 40% loading the powerlevels for each room. So we do have the chance to speedup startup by probably another 60%. It is unlikely that is necessary though.</p>
<p>When I discovered Matrix, Element was still called Riot. At the time some of the big design changes started happening to make it the Element you know today. One of the sideeffects was that the roomlist was consistently taking up 20% of my CPU on my Laptop, which I used at the time (and am forced to use now again, since I broke my newer laptop). It also used a lot more RAM than it does today. So for that reason I started shopping around for what other clients there are and I found Nheko. Clearly because it isn't a webclient, it had to be faster and use less RAM. Well, it did maybe a bit, but frankly the difference wasn't that much. Especially since at the time it loaded and rendered ALL your messages on startup (kinda). It never removed messages from memory, so it would just continuously render more and more parts of your timeline, which clearly increased RAM usage. It did however never resort the full roomlist, which made it not use a lot of CPU.</p>
<p>Since I didn't know any web development at the time, but I knew some C++, I started contributing to Nheko. At some point I made the roomlist constantly resort, which used quite some amount of CPU, but I quickly fixed that. At the time the most noticeable difference was that my fans didn't spin when using Nheko, but Element did (because of the roomlist sorting, iirc). RAM usage was pretty bad though. So that was one of the next projects, removing all events from RAM and only pulling them from the database as needed. While this means some additional load when switching rooms, it did decrease RAM requirements by quite a bit. Some new features made us still require loading data for every room from the database on startup, which causes quite some noticeable startup delay. The latest changes however got rid of most of that. We now don't need to load the messages from the database anymore. The only thing we still load is a small info object with roomname, notification and member count as well as the power levels of the room.</p>
<p>Since I recently broke my new and fast laptop, I decided to checkout how things changed on my old and slow laptop. Nowadays I am not in 15 rooms anymore, but I am in 900 rooms, but Matrix, servers as well as clients, has also gotten a lot more performant. So in the end I decided to do a little benchmark of where things stand. <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This is completely unscientific and unfair, so please take those numbers with a grain of salt. Almost no one runs such a slow laptop as I do, so likely your measurements will completely different. Even more, I was video recording the benchmark, which makes both clients a lot slower. Nonetheless it does somewhat mirror my personal experience.</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion that with 900 rooms, Nheko takes about 10-20 seconds to load and be ready for use on my system, while Element takes about 3 to 4 minutes. So basically Element handles 60 times as many rooms about 2x slower than it did back in the day, while Nheko got a bit faster or about the same speed on the same hardware (but still 60x as many rooms). I've attached a sped up video to this post, so that you can compare it for yourself. But since a lot of people ask, I guess the reason is that I wanted to see how fast you can make a Matrix client. I think I somewhat achieved that in the startup time department, but switching rooms still has a loooooong way to go. Also it is just fun to implement whatever you want in a client, since you are the maintainer and none can tell you how bad of an idea it is. That's probably the reason a lot of people start their own clients? (Although I didn't start Nheko, I just wrote too much code and people didn't want to review it anymore.)</p>
<p>That's it, I hope your eyes didn't glaze over with me babbling on about things. See you next time! :3

<p>On other major news, the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/pull/1259">first UniFFI macro PR</a>, submitted by our very own Jonas, was merged by Mozilla earlier this week üéâ. This is an important milestone as this PR is the opening gate for getting more and more macro-support into UniFFI, eventually replacing the enitre UDL-in-between-action. Congrats for this major step forward</p>

<p>Four days of Barcamp sessions, presentations, meeting others and Berlin culture!
The Matrix Summit 2022 brings people together who work with Matrix.
Thu, 25th to Sun, 28th August at the iconic hacker space c-base in Berlin.
This event is organised by the local Matrix Meetup community.
While people of every skill level are welcome on all days, we're going to highlight real world use cases of Matrix on Sunday. We're inviting newcomers and other communities to learn about decentralised communication software. In return we're learning how Matrix is already used by the German education and health sectors.</p>
<p>Our Call for Presentations starts next week. The event is going to be bilingual: English and German.</p>

<p>This is achieved with the libp2p library which provides decentralized node discovery, NAT traversal and gossip-based communication capabilities.</p>
<p>The server implements the Matrix API specifications (with many advanced features still missing, like client-side end-to-end encryption), but did little modification on federation side so that it doesn't rely on the centralized domain name system to setup and authenticate other nodes. On the other hand, this means it cannot federate with existing home servers yet, because of the different trust model (domain name/HTTPS vs self-owned cryptographic keys).</p>

<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2000">MSC2000: Server-side password policies</a>!</p>
<p>This is a proposal that adds a mechanism for homeserver administrators to define a password policy for users. This policy can decide rules such as a minimum password length, whether a digit is required, etc. This policy can be enforced by the homeserver when a user registers an account or changes their account password and is communicated to the client so that it can also be enforced locally.</p>
<p>Astute readers will possibly note that authentication in Matrix will eventually be replaced by OAuth2 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2964">MSC2964</a>). This will move operations like password policy enforcement from the homeserver to a separate authentication service, essentially removing the need to reinvent-the-wheel in a homeserver.</p>
<p>Registration, login and managing passwords and connected third-party IDs is often a complex part of a Matrix homeserver. Moving these out to a separate authentication service will both unlock new features (log in with Matrix!) as well as reduce the resources required to implement a Matrix homeserver.</p>

<p>FluffyChat 1.5.0 goes Material You</p>
<p>FluffyChat 1.5.0 has been released and will soon be in all stores. This release comes with a bunch of bugfixes and introduces the first iteration of a Material You based design. We also try to support Android 12 accent colors (while this does not seem to work yet). On other platforms, our own purple shape will stay the default.</p>
<p>I like the new Material You design while we needed to tweak it at some points. Also the dropdown menu misses some elevation but this is a known issue in the Flutter repo which will be fixed soon.</p>
<p>This is also the first build with Flutter 3 which should improve the performance a little bit. Unfortunately it brings some regressions. We are forced to ship a little bug with it: Sharing on iPads seems to be broken. I'm very unhappy with this situation but otherwise we would have ended up in different releases for different platforms. As there afaik are not that many iPad users out there, we decided to live with this compromise and ship a bugfix release asap.</p>
<p>Yeah... Flutter has a lot of pros but also a lot of cons. Every new release of this framework leads to the fear of new regressions. Shipping a new major release where basic stuff like &quot;Sharing&quot; is just broken, is totally stupid... but that's the decision of Google. :-P</p>
<p>We didn't want to wait to ship the new design and also we needed a new release to come back to F-Droid where FluffyChat wasn't available in the last weeks because of a ProGuard problem, which should be fixed now.</p>

Moreover, we have experimental support for spatial audio rendering. Give it a try ‚Äî you can find it in the settings section. It's a lot of fun to play with and really supports immersion during a video call. This release also introduces a whole new experimental way of communicating: Walkie-talkie mode. In that mode, videos are disabled, and everyone is muted by default. To speak, press the ‚Äòpush-to-talk‚Äô (PTT) button ‚Äî takes me back to my childhood üôÇ</p>

<p>Version 0.9.12</p>
<p>This week, the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.9.12">version 0.9.12</a>. In this version, we updated our Matrix API Lite package, in which we fixed the issue with the room hierarchy endpoint with some improper parsing and wrong type coming from the generation of the spec Open API documentation.</p>
<p>We also did some housekeeping and renamed some methods and getter to make them explicit. For example, the <code>futureSender</code> getter is now an asynchronous method called <code>fetchEventSender()</code> to make it clear that calling this function may trigger an API call.</p>
<p>Possibility to override the  supported Matrix spec version but we don't really recommend using it for production.</p>

<p>Here's a fun Matrix-based project for you, sponsored by yours truly and my employer <a href="https://futo.org/">FUTO</a>.</p>
<p>The &quot;Golden Tiger&quot; senior capstone project team at Portland State University just delivered the results of two quarters's design and implementation work on a secure/private, self-hostable, end-to-end encrypted cloud security camera using Raspberry Pi's and Matrix.  The idea of this prototype project was to provide similar functionality to commercial services like Ring or Nest, but without letting any nosy third party see inside (or around) your home.</p>

<p>In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we've been working on getting Matrix 1.3 out the door and generally working towards a better process for handling releases alongside critical proposals for the protocol. The goal is to be able to ship these major features while reducing the risk of a release falling behind. Watch this space for more details as this should result in MSCs getting through the process a little bit quicker.</p>
<p>For Matrix 1.3, we're targeting <strong>Thursday, June 16th, 2022</strong> as our release date, though this comes with a small asterisk: we're looking to land quite a lot of stuff so might have to adjust the date once more as needed. We do feel reasonably confident in the date though - watch for blog posts titled Matrix 1.3 in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've had breakthroughs this week on implementing a native Matrix SFU (selective forwarding unit) which speaks <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401">MSC3401</a>, thanks to <a href="https://siobud.com/">Sean DuBois</a> - all round WebRTC superstar, project lead for the <a href="https://github.com/pion/webrtc">Pion</a> WebRTC implementation for Go, and author of <a href="https://webrtcforthecurious.com/">WebRTC for the curious</a>.</p>
<p>Sean generously contributed an initial proof of concept to show how you'd build an MSC3401 SFU using Pion at https://github.com/matrix-org/sfu-to-sfu - which (I think?) is the first time that the first implementation of a major core MSC has been contributed from outside the core team.  Huge thanks to Sean to setting the ball going on this - the current PoC demonstrates not just SFU capability but also the decentralised cascading architecture which makes MSC3401 unique. The initial PoC speaks a 'test jig' version of MSC3401 hooked up to a simple web client for experimentation, but Matthew's now experimenting with adding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sfu-to-sfu/pull/10">genuine Matrix support</a> to it via mautrix-go, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/2423">hooking up Element Call</a> to speak to it.</p>
<p>Adding SFU support to Element Call will mean that we can support more than ~7 simultaneous calls - and with MSC3401-style decentralised cascading, we should be able to support hundreds or even thousands. There's lots of work remaining here, but the ball is now rolling.  For more info about SFUs and MSC3401, check out Matthew's <a href="https://2021.commcon.xyz/talks/extending-matrix-s-e2ee-calls-to-multiparty">CommCon 2021 talk</a> (which was what prompted Sean's implementation work here!)</p>
<p>Separately, we've been running Element Call on staging with E2EE enabled for the last few weeks, and should be releasing the first major Element Call update next week.  And once SFUs land, then Element Call can exit beta - watch out Zoom!</p>

Furthermore this week has seen a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/716">cleanups</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/717">simplifications</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/712">clarifications</a> around the OlmMachine and crypto types, and we're <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/729">fixing a bug in the state store</a>, where not all data has been properly encrypted in the past.</p>

<p>Dart Matrix SDK : Version 0.9.9</p>
<p>This week, the team released <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.9.9">version 0.9.9</a>. In this new version, we added a search function to allow searching for an event in database and on server through several requests to the <code>/messages</code> endpoint.</p>
<p>There was also some work on updating the image size when generating thumbnail, which allow saving a bit of calculation when sending events. If using a custom resizer make sure to update the resize response as <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/company/frontend/famedlysdk/-/snippets/2342277">here</a>.</p>
<p>We also did some refactor with the event sender getter. The getter result is now a future to allow requesting the member event to the server if we cannot find it in memory, to help fix the issue when the user was not found in memory.</p>
<p>Finally, a quick helper function (<code>client.waitForSync</code>) was added. It allows you to wait for a room to appear in (left, join, invited) section of the sync response.</p>
<p>See you next time ;)</p>

<p>Only a small update this week. One new feature and some much needed Ansible improvements.</p>
<p>Pipes move messages from one room to an other. Useful if you are in important rooms but only want to monitor a single room. 
The Ansible role can now manage more aspects of MCM. Mainly in the post setup phase. The major one being if you run into encryption errors for any reason you can run the playbook with the fix tag and it will generate you a new device ID and encryption store.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pipes move all messages from one room to an other.</li>
<li>Adding a filter now uses the room the command was sent from by default if the roomid is not specified.</li>
<li>Ansible role now has tags for start, stop, configs, fix and all.</li>
<li>Ansible role backs up the configuration.toml file to prevent the possibility of data loss.</li>
