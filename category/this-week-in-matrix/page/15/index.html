<h3 id="p2p-dendrite">P2P/Dendrite</h3>
<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite has seen a number of improvements this week, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Backfill will now backfill more messages than before, resulting in a snappier experience when scrolling back in a room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite is now compliant with Synapse on backfill behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inline CS API filters will now honour the timeline <code>limit</code> value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making more Sytests pass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modifications to how Dendrite tracks memberships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Addition of an <code>-api</code> flag to expose internal HTTP APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clearer separation of internal/external HTTP APIs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This has culminated in the following values for Are We Synapse Yet:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>Client-Server APIs: 34% (227/672 tests) - up from 33%
</span><span>Federation APIs: 34% (35/103 tests) - up from 27%
</span></code></pre>
<p>As for P2P....</p>
<h4 id="p2p-riot-im-v0-1-0-released">p2p.riot.im v0.1.0 released!</h4>
<p>This is a significant milestone because we now persist Dendrite databases to IndexedDB, greatly improving UX and giving users a consistent identity on the P2P network. In addition to this, the following changes have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We now bake in the Dendrite commit SHA into the logs on startup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite will now restart itself in case of panics/segfaults.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues with this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Databases are only flushed to IndexedDB every 30 seconds, making it possible to lose the most recent messages. This has a variety of effects on the Dendrite instance, but in testing it has been able to mostly gracefully recover. Messages that you have sent will be backfilled but will be redacted. Rooms you have joined will be forgotten, and you need to be kicked/re-invited/re-join for communication to be re-established. We're looking into a better flushing mechanism going forwards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have previously visited p2p.riot.im, you <strong>MUST</strong> manually clear your service worker via <code>chrome:serviceworker-internals</code> or <code>about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox</code> or else you might get errors such as &quot;LinkError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): memory import 37 has no maximum limit, expected at most 4294967295&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please <strong>do not rely</strong> on p2p.riot.im to have any form of stability. Patch version bumps (0.1.0 -&gt; 0.1.1) will not remove databases but minor version bumps will (0.1.1 -&gt; 0.2.0) so we can continue to progress with Dendrite development at speed.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lkito has been contributing this week to Nheko as part of his homework for university or so? Anyway, he added an option to highlight whatever message you are currently hovering over, so that you have an easier time locating the proper timestamps and buttons for that specific message. He's now working through a few other issues to improve his coding skills, like optionally having big emojis in the timeline or showing tooltips to explain the settings Nheko has.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now set a /roomnick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now tag rooms using the room context menu. You can assign multiple tags and create new tags as you like. This helps organizing your rooms, since Nheko supported filtering you room list using tags for a few years already, but until now you couldn't assign them.</p>

<li>
<p>red_sky has been tying up the loose ends for reaction support. Once that is done, we'll release 0.7.2</p>

<p>Just released version 2.1.0 of the <a href="https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk">Ruby SDK</a>, headlines changes are the addition of request IDs (and timing) to the debug output to make request/response tracking easier, as well as finalized support for extending both the low-level and higher-level clients with MSCs - along with a much improved implementation for MSC2108 (Sync over SSE). Also included are some bug fixes, as usual, as well as many improvements to the provided example bot.</p>

<p>I got really bored in lockdown, as we all have. I stared at my TV, and it stared back at me. While it's definitely a privacy nightmare to start developing apps for these things, I couldn't help myself. I got stuck in, and secured myself a LG Developer Account.</p>
<p>The LG set of smart TVs use WebOS, as like the name suggests, runs apps in it's special variant of Chromium. I was lucky to be running a recent OS and had access to Chromium 53! And NodeJS 0.12!! Sarcasm aside, there are some very troubling versions of WebOS with much older versions of the browser, so I was happy to be developing against something with strong ES6 support. Despite the absolutely <a href="https://twitter.com/Half_Shot/status/1259471146308775943">awful</a> onboarding experience, the WebOS SDK itself was pretty good. <code>matrix-tv</code> was written to be a general large screen matrix client, so it talks to the TV's own libraries through an abstraction layer :)</p>
<p>Anyway, this client is the culmination of a lazy Sunday afternoon's work. It features very basic support for viewing a room, but I hope to expand it at some point. It  supports running in a web browser and the aforementioned OS, but support for more variants is easy to add. I'm looking into how to design for the large screen beyond making fonts bigger, because the unique constraints on memory and UI are fun challenge.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Add the ability to defer all processing to a different isolate</p>
<p>When you use <code>isolated: true</code> on <code>Homeserver.login</code> or <code>MyUser.fromStore</code>, everything will be handled for you and the SDK works the same.</p>
<p>This only works on platforms with the Dart VM (not web).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Updater</code>s are now globally registered per <code>MyUser</code> <code>id</code>.</p>
<p>This means for now only one <code>Updater</code> per <code>MyUser</code> is allowed. <code>Updater</code>s are created when a <code>MyUser</code> instance is retrieved via <code>Homeserver.login</code> or <code>MyUser.fromStore</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add ability to specify what rooms to load from store when retrieving user</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>previousBatch</code> param from <code>Room.copyWith</code> is removed (wasn't used)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add ability to override context in <code>MyUser.copyWith</code> and <code>MyUser.merge</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Updater</code> and <code>Homeserver</code> are less coupled now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a <code>Context</code> is changed with <code>copyWith</code>, all child objects' <code>context</code>s are also changed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix bug in read receipt parsing (thanks to MatMaul!)</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@rdi:matrix.alkemata.com">rdi</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="what-is-jupybot">What is JupyBot</h4>
<p>The purpose of the bot is to provide a link with Jupyter kernels running either on your local computer or somewhere else on a server. You can access your kernels through the bot with the chat interface. The kernels will answer to your commands through the same interface.</p>
<p>Since this is still a proof of concepts, the number of features is limited (command line text, string and pictures are the only output formats supported. No widget, no funny javascript) and they are few safeguards against infinite loops and other entertaining bugs.</p>
<h4 id="todo">TODO</h4>
<p>This is right now just a proof of concept. We want to see if such a bot can be useful for people and how. What features would be interesting, what can be integrated in the present clients,... Therefore, in the short term, we want to focus on the possibility of easy testing for users and easy contributions for people who want to add their ideas. On the mid- and long term, a lot of ideas can be realized; it will depend on the feedback. These are just some examples. Short term:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>proper error catching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fallback for non supported Jupyter formats on riot.im (i.e. a lot)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>testing on termux on a tablet or smartphone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>solve the problem with nio-matrix and upload in chunks of images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dockerized version</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Middle term:</p>
<ul>
<li>use of opsdroid as a framework</li>
</ul>
<p>Longer term:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>local server integrated to locally command the bot service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make full use of jupyter capabilities with a client suited for it (for instance a Jupyterlab plugin)</p>

it's main highlight is anybody can add new commands to it in chat using its scripting language<br />
any any existing bot command can be used as a function in new scripts you write<br />
The scripting language to add new commands can be found here <a href="https://github.com/midoricorp/script">https://github.com/midoricorp/script</a><br />
you can do things like<br />
<code>!script print &quot;HELLO world&quot;;</code><br />
or make a new command<br />
<code>!script sub hello { print &quot;HELLO World&quot;; }</code><br />
that would result in a new command !hello being made<br />
print also has 2 output stream, one for rich format and one for basic formatting<br />
<code>!script print &quot;Hello World!&quot;; print HTML &quot;Hello &lt;b&gt;World&lt;/b&gt;&quot;</code>;</p>

<p>The goal is to improve cohesion and collaboration for all things design (UI, UX, interaction...)
Over time, it should become a place for people to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ask design-specific questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>share cool stuff and be praised for all the good work you're doing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and document a common understanding of the semantics of matrix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make sure the user experience is amazing, even as we all figure out how to federate.
Probably most designers work on single clients right now, but there are important UX questions that can only be answered ecosystem-wide. Maybe we'll end up with a design guide for people to use alongside the spec.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.</a></p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some of the work for <code>/get_missing_events</code> has been done now for filling gaps in the room DAG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation sender performance and parallelisation have been dramatically improved, which helps a lot in big rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retries, backoff and blacklisting have also been implemented in the federation sender to handle cases where remote homeservers are unavailable much more gracefully</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retrieving missing state when receiving incoming events over federation is a bit more robust now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating direct chats now works</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invites are mostly working now overall, both locally and over federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>RespState</code> and <code>RespStateJoin</code> have been fixed in gomatrixserverlib</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room joins and leaves are now handled by new code across the roomserver and federation server perform APIs, which reduces complexity significantly</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Redis live in production for m.org! We did not expect this to translate into a significant improvement in performance directly, but it means that we can add new workers without any extra overhead on the master process which has been <em>very</em> useful in supporting cross signing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing bugs leading to messages getting stuck at the bottom of the timeline as well as messages not making it to sync at all. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of improvements to deal with the extra load generated by cross signing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these changes will be available in v1.13.0 which should have a release candidate ready rsn.</p>
<p>Next week, we continue to work on sharding changes, further SSO support and ensuring that cross signing adoption is as smooth as possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@gnu_ponut:matrix.org">Gnuxie</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/cal-coop/architect">Architect</a> is a homeserver project written in <a href="https://common-lisp.net">Common Lisp</a>. We intend to create a high performance homeserver using the meta-programming features of Common Lisp to reduce the amount of redundant and timely code that needs to be written and maintained.</p>
<h4 id="architect-events">architect events</h4>
<p>I created a <a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/json-schema2">json-schema</a> library, to generate class definitions directly from the Matrix specification. These classes also have information attached to them to allow for serialisation, using a metaclass from <a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/json-clos">json-clos</a>.</p>
<p>This is done entirely dynamically without writing to source files. <a href="https://gitlab.com/cal-coop/architect/architect.events">The invocation</a> of json-schema that creates classes for the <code>client-server</code>, <code>server-server</code> and <code>application-service</code> protocols is only about 20 lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I definitely approve of separating out the event library and generating it from the spec - Ruma also has this approach.</p>
<h3 id="conduit">Conduit</h3>
<p>Conduit is a Matrix homeserver written in Rust <a href="https://conduit.rs">https://conduit.rs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I refactored most of the data handling code to make it both more efficient and easier to read. I started by splitting a file called &quot;data.rs&quot; into multiple smaller files that handle just one part of the database, like &quot;users.rs&quot;, &quot;rooms.rs&quot; or &quot;edus.rs&quot;. I continued improving the code by making methods return iterators instead of vectors and propagating errors instead of crashing directly. Lastly, I added a few comments here and there and made sure everything works.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, @Valkum experimented with CI and @MTRNord is working on FluffyChat Flutter support.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank my supporters on <a href="https://liberapay.com/timokoesters">Liberapay</a>.</p>

<p>gomuks's e2ee support is now on the master branch. The basic olm/megolm things like key distribution work fine, but no advanced stuff like key import/export or device verification yet.</p>
<p>I'll probably add e2be to mautrix-whatsapp next and then add some of the advanced e2ee stuff to gomuks. I'll also make a v0.1.0 release in gomuks after I figure out some bugs in message history loading.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apart from some further speedups, we've been working on reactions. Nheko can now display them and sending them should be done soon too. We also fixed a few bugs, when people reported them and you can now select, who you want to reply to by using a keyboard shortcut (Alt+Arrow keys for now). We will probably release a new version once reactions are done.</p>

<p>We also released MatrixSDK 0.16.4 with the last version of AFNetworking. That means apps using the MatrixSDK should be able to publish to the App Store again. There is no more usage of <code>UIWebView</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over 3 million people from Telegram and Discord have now been brought into the Matrix universe through t2bot.io. Of those people, around 230 thousand are active each month and 15 thousand are dedicated users of the bridges daily.</p>
<p>While this is a huge milestone for t2bot.io,it underlines the importance of self-hosting: having a couple giant bridges is great for accessibility, though where possible it‚Äôs heavily encouraged that people self-host. Hosting the bridges yourself on your own homeserver gives you better control of what passes through your server, reduces your dependence on third parties like t2bot.io, and gives you better performance.</p>
<p>During peak periods, t2bot.io sees about 10 messages per second passing through it. Half of those messages are generated by the Telegram bridge alone. The other half is dealing with federation and the various other bridges and bots on t2bot.io. In terms of media, a new image is uploaded every 2 seconds, leading to 5.8 TB of media being stored. The database is 3 TB and holds 236 Million events - roughly 131 Million of which are sent by t2bot.io.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has used t2bot.io in the past 3 years - it‚Äôs been more successful than ever imagined. Here‚Äôs to another year and a bunch of self-hosting. :)</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôve spent time this week working with the Riot teams to tweak matrix.org performance for cross signing. We‚Äôve also fixed a few performance regressions ahead of next week's 1.13.0 release (which will be a big one, more details when it lands).</p>
<p>With any luck we‚Äôll have Redis in production on matrix.org next week, we don‚Äôt think this will give us a huge performance win, but there is certainly overhead in having so many workers using the previous replication streaming method.</p>
<p>Our sharding project continues, and Erik has been trying to move the event stream entirely away from the master process which in itself could be significant for overall perf once ready for production.</p>
<p>Aside from that we continue to improve SSO support and we have a really great community PR from <a href="https://github.com/sandhose">sandhose</a> that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7256">implements OpenID Connect support</a>. We are really looking forward to getting that merged. The admin API is also getting plenty of community love with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6881">awesome-manual</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pulls/dklimpel">dklimpel</a> leading the charge.</p>

<p>The user has a stream of <code>Update</code>s, <code>user.updates</code>. An <code>Update</code> contains the latest 'snapshot' of data associated with the user. It also contains a <code>delta</code> <code>MyUser</code>, where all properties are <code>null</code>, except those that are changed. For example, if a user started typing in a certain room, and we're syncing, there will be an <code>Update</code> in <code>user.updates</code>, where <code>delta</code> has 1 <code>Room</code> in <code>delta.rooms</code>, with only the room where the user started typing, reflected in <code>room.typingUserIds</code>. All other properties of the <code>Room</code> will be null. This is all assuming that this is the only change in the sync. If more happened, it will be reflected in <code>delta</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Opsdroid has released v0.18 this week, which contains <a href="https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/releases/tag/v0.18.0">a load of stuff</a>. The main matrix related changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A generic event type for all unsupported matrix events, so you can now react to and send any custom events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of the join room event in the matrix connector so you can react to users joining a matrix room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fix for mxc urls in messages, so inline images etc work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fix for the opsdroid memory to allow per-room matrix room state databases. This will hopefully be merged into core for the next release.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Related to this release the <a href="https://github.com/SolarDrew/skill-picard">picard</a> skill for bridged slack/matrix community management has been updated, and now (for the first time) works with a release version of opsdroid rather than some random branch ü§£. This involved adding support for lots of different events to the slack connector in opsdroid.</p>

<h3 id="new-bot-to-share-jitsi-call-urls">New bot to share Jitsi call URLs</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a bot to share Jitsi call URLs. The main objective is to allow people on the other side of bridges to get the URL for a jitsi call. When a jitsi widget is added to a room (v2 widget from riot-web) it will post a message with the plain jitsi URL. It also provides a !jitsi command which allows people to create a jitsi call with a custom URL, and if the bot has permission it will be added as a widget in the matrix room. It has a bunch of other config options you can tweak it with. The main thing you might find it useful for if you are not in a bridged room is you can use it to quickly add a jitsi widget for any conference URL. The bot can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/skill-jitsi/">https://github.com/Cadair/skill-jitsi/</a> and it uses the opsdroid framework. I have also hosted a version @jitsibot:cadair.com</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Shipped <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/23/synapse-1-12-4-released">1.12.4</a> a patch release to fix some cross signing related bugs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redis support to replace our existing cross replication system, merged to develop. This is a precursor to the sharding project. We have a PR to support cache invalidation across workers which, once merged should make it relatively easy to pull off event persistence from the master process. Just removing event persistence could give some decent perf wins, but the prize is then splitting persistence to run across across multiple workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A final PR to support SSO for user interactive auth will merge imminently, thereby freeing up full cross signing support for worker installs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aside from that we‚Äôve been working on fixing a weird bug where rooms can end up with zero forward extremities and generally showing Sygnal some love. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upcoming</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Put Redis into production</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ship 1.13.0 which will contain Redis support as well as a host of SSO bug fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge our new caching config logic to give finer granularity on cache settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge cache invalidation and try to get events persistence running in its own worker.</p>

Guests such as Paul Cornell (writer), Charles Palmer (director) &amp; Lor Wilson (Lucy Cartwright aka Daughter of Mine) will also be discussing the episode along for even more fun and behind the scenes!</p>
<p>This means that if you're reading this when this edition of TWIM goes out, and you fancy watching some Doctor Who this evening, join the fun at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#doctor-who-watchalong:abolivier.bzh">#doctor-who-watchalong:abolivier.bzh</a> üòÄ</p>

<p>A Matrix homeserver written in Rust <a href="https://conduit.rs">https://conduit.rs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I spent some time improving Riot support. Now there should be a lot less warnings and some new features: typing events, read receipts, better room directory, invites, user search.</p>
<p>The only bigger bug that exists currently is that the message history is not automatically loaded when you join a room.  Sometimes reloading the page helps, but not always. The reason for that is that Riot calls the deprecated /initialSync endpoint, which I do not support (I hope someone works on Riot to fix that).</p>
<p>In the next few weeks I plan to improve the single-homeserver experience further and add permission management, while also working on federation.</p>
<p>Check out the repository on <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit">https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit</a> and our Matrix room on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:koesters.xyz">#conduit:koesters.xyz</a>.

<p>I tested the performance of Conduit yesterday by running a ruma client that sends a /send request in a for loop 10k times, which took ~46.8 seconds (all locally on my pc). This means the server can handle ~210 /sends per second under these circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We continue to focus on performance and spent a good chunk of time improving worker replication test coverage to build confidence that our upcoming changes will work as expected. Erik has been working on how to how to factor out cache invalidation which is now starting to take good shape. Once we have that, factoring out things like event persistence are next on the horizon. </p>
<p>Aside from that we‚Äôve been working with the Riot client teams as they near release for cross signing, fixing bugs and improving performance on key actions.</p>
<p>SSO support continues to improve, and more fixes for user inactive auth for worker'd installs will land next week. Poor old Rich has been banging his head against a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7206">sync bug</a> blocking develop, but hopefully he has broken its back now, and we'll get that merged asap.</p>

<p><strong>Update from Jason:</strong></p>
<p>The Construct server made significant progress this week with end-to-end encryption, client compatibility, application services support, and build-related enhancements. I'd like to thank <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@yan:yetanothernerd.xyz">Yan Minari</a> for contributing spec-compliant code paths for application services in the user registration system. Special thanks this week to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@qy:cs.xa0.uk">Tony O.</a> for continued work on the NixOS (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nix:matrix.org">#nix:matrix.org</a>) derivation for reproducible builds, in addition to contributing fixes to Nio for optimal compatibility with Construct. I'd also like to thank <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@weebl:matrix.weebl.me">Wessel</a> for contributing a much needed reorganization of the Dockerfiles in preparation for Construct operating on many more platforms. Many thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> for working with the team this week in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net">#test:zemos.net</a> on various compatibility fixes to mtxclient and Nheko; the responsiveness when using Nheko with Construct is mind-blowing. I'd also like to thank <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@david:vovo.id.au">David Vo (a.k.a. auscompgeek)</a> for also contributing to Nio toward Construct compatibility.</p>
<p>Finally, I owe much appreciation to tulir, jochen, qy and others for setting up brand new installations this week and providing feedback in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net">#test:zemos.net</a>. Construct is the first and only federating alternative to Synapse. It is written in C++ for maximum performance, the lowest possible TCO, and designed for horizontal scaling with Construct Cluster.

<p>Hello, this week has been busy for us over in bridge corner. We've released:</p>

<p>Which includes a bunch of small fixes, including a performance improvement to <code>StateLookup</code> hits. Apparently it's bad to hit the homeserver with 1000s of concurrent /state requests on startup. <strong>Most importantly</strong> it also includes a critical fix to the <code>addAppServicePath</code> function, which previously did not authenticate requests, see the CHANGELOG for more information on that.</p>

<p>We're still working on the RCs for this release, having discovered and fixed a bunch of failures that can happen around getting connected to IRC. Be aware that the above security fix is applied in this release, which means provisioning requests will now be authenticated.</p>
<h4 id="matrix-appservice-slack-1-2-0-rc1"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/1.2.0-rc1">matrix-appservice-slack 1.2.0-rc1</a></h4>
<p>This is another big load of bug fixes, with many thanks to our new bridge crew member, Christian!. This release includes the above security fixes, as well as some metrics improvements to track activity on the bridge.</p>

<p>WIP Command line Matrix client using matrix-rust-sdk</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@devinr528:matrix.org">devinr528</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A clickable command-line client Matrix written in Rust. Although, still in the early stages, enough has been implemented to show a working demo. <code>rumatui</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs">tui</a> to power the UI and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk">matrix-rust-sdk</a> for all communication with the server. So far the message formatting has been the most visually satisfying feature, although implementing it was not much fun. The goal of the project is to have a UI driven command-line client, useable from either keyboard and/or mouse.</p>
<p>Big thanks to @poljar for allowing me to work on matrix-rust-sdk, @jplatte for the opportunity to work with the <a href="https://github.com/ruma">ruma</a> crates and everyone in the Matrix community for being so helpful!</p>

<p>0.7.0 will contain a lot of work, including replies, e2ee attachments and a completely rewritten timeline (the full changelog is too big for TWIM, but you can find it in the github releases). It also fixes a lot of issues. We should probably released it a lot earlier, but we always had one more feature we wanted to finish... For the future we plan to do smaller, more regular releases!</p>

<p>We've been doing Matrix editions of <a href="https://twitter.com/Emily_Rosina">Emily Cook</a>'s Doctor Who watchalongs since confinement started around Europe.

<h2 id="final-thoughts-thought-balloon">Final Thoughts üí≠</h2>
<p>While discussing the use of QML in Nheko, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aa13q:matrix.org">aa13q</a> became extremely energised, so I'm including this piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Qt/QML fanboy here, feel free to skip, just a love letter to the framework :D</p>
<p>Qt/QML is super-awesome, it's hard to describe how pretty declarative syntax is and how beautiful MVC approach with native Qt C++ side integration %) It is very hard to contribute to HTML/CSS/JS projects when you have seen QML once.</p>
<p>Talking about resources, there are even projects for very low-level embedded boards with arm cortex m7 core [1,2]</p>
<p>I'm actually thinking Qt is the bright future of very wide development areas. I'm both frightened and intrigued looking at relatively low popularity of the project. Since I want it to live and prosper even more but afraid of the possible mistakes for even harder tasks. The better popularity of the project will be harder to coordinate and the future tasks will be even harder. Similar to other cool projects (like matrix! :) I guess it's very challenging to balance between running as hard as you can and not to &quot;die&quot; from exhaustion %)</p>
<p>I don't even know is there something similar comparing to the Qt project, that's also why I'm worried about the future of the project %) </p>
<p>So-called software crisis (the late 60s ‚Äì mid-80s [3,4]) was successfully overcome by introducing Object-Oriented Programming (it's always funny to see some people who are more into functional programming hates OOP in that context [5]) And notably Alan Kay is not only OOP pioneer (Smalltalk language) but also a first GUI applications developer. While the current OOP languages like Java and C++ are quite imperative, OOP is not only about the objects but also about the messages between them (Smalltalk is probably a nice example here too).</p>
<p>Qt in that context restores interesting balance to quite imperative C++ introducing the so-called meta-object system (for the messaging between objects). After that in ~Qt5, the declarative QML approach was introduced to develop these ideas even more. Not only GUI subject matter could be expressed with QML (like Qt Quick), but the others too (for example, QBS build system).</p>
<p>Sorry for typos and poor style, not a native speaker :) And I could be wrong in my views.</p>

<p>This week we held the first in a series of <em>virtual meetup</em> events, <strong>Open Tech Will Save Us</strong>.</p>
<p>We were really excited to make this event <em>feel</em> like a real meetup - with a live chat, and interactivity from the chance to ask questions of the speakers. There was a great response, with participants in a 100+ user room chatting about the talks and generally adding to the atmosphere.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week was really successful for the homeserver project. Not only does event sending and syncing work properly, but creating/joining rooms, state events and the public room directory works as well.  But the biggest archievement I made this week is Riot support.</p>
<p>Big thanks to MTRNord for fixing bugs in Riot web and deploying an instance of Riot with all patches applied and to jplatte and @iinuwa for improving the ruma libraries.</p>
<p>Today we did the first actual test of the new homeserver. We had ~5 people sending and syncing messages in a room and all of them were able to send messages almost instantly. We'll see how well that scales when we implement federation in the future.</p>
<p>Check out the repository on <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit">https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit</a> and our Matrix room on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:koesters.xyz">#conduit:koesters.xyz</a>.

<p>The main focus continues to be performance and we are starting to make good progress in figuring out how to split out and shard the event streams. This is a project where most of the bang will come all at once, rather than there being multiple small incremental improvements. </p>
<p>Aside from that we continue to improve the SSO experience, landing UIA support for CAS providers. We also made a small change to the default behaviour so that only room admins can enable e2ee (applies to new rooms only).</p>
<p>Next week, is more of the same. Expect a few short term performance improvements (specifically to help with cross signing UX) and more SSO support.</p>

<p>Update from Jason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>End-to-end encryption support has landed in Construct. The server now supports cross-signing, secret storage, and key backups for clients. I'm pleased with how this all came together on schedule for the upcoming transition to e2ee by default for Matrix. If you haven't been paying attention in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> last week full support for push-rules including efficient highlight-counting also landed. Next week Application Service support is scheduled.</p>
<p>Construct is quickly nearing complete coverage over the full breadth of the Matrix protocol, and the transition into release packaging is fast approaching. Construct is the C++ homeserver built for maximum performance with the lowest possible cost of ownership. If you're in need of a faster homeserver please show your support in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> and tell all your friends to lend a hand today!</p>

<h3 id="new-rust-homeserver">New Rust Homeserver</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! This week I worked on a Matrix homeserver written in Rust. Registering and logging in works already and I am currently adding support for sending events and inserting them into the event graph. I spent most of my time reading the Matrix specification to understand how this process works, because with federation (which I plan to add to my homeserver in the future) servers might disagree on which event was created first and there are strictly defined rules to resolve this. The Matrix homeserver uses the Ruma libraries as it's base and handles requests and responses using the Rocket crate. I use sled to store information as (key, value) pairs in a database. Most of these libraries are still experimental and I take this attitude myself by straying off from the reference implementations and changing algorithms in hopes of better performance.

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-asmux">mautrix-asmux</a> wasn't made this week, but I haven't mentioned it on TWIM before. Basically, it acts as a proxy between appservices and the homeserver. The primary point is to make it possible to dynamically provision appservices.</p>
<p>The dynamically provisioned appservices connect to mautrix-asmux with individual access tokens, which asmux checks and then proxies the requests to Synapse with its own global access token. Synapse is only aware of one appservice, which will have a large user ID and alias namespace (e.g. everything starting with <code>_</code>). In the other direction, mautrix-asmux maintains a room ID -&gt; appservice mapping, which it uses to send incoming events to the correct appservice. As a side effect, mautrix-asmux implements <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2190">MSC2190</a>, which is needed for end-to-bridge encryption.</p>

<p>mautrix-telegram now has experimental support for end-to-bridge encryption. It's intended for cases where you don't want the homeserver to have access to messages, e.g. user-hostable appservices.

<p>I got annoyed by how difficult plumbing IRC rooms is and wrote a simple Python script to do it more easily from command line.

It's still in infancy but more features are already planned such as more IRC management stuff and creating tombstone events to point rooms to other rooms. The tool uses Python and matrix-nio library.

<p>Hey folks! I've not posted a proper bridge update in a while, so let's go into another project that isn't a bridge. I've started working on a new project called <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/node-jitsi">node-jitsi</a>, which will allow people to connect their services to Jitsi Meet conferences. It's designed to allow bridges to start bridging across actual calls into Matrix via Jitsi, but could really be used by any project which is Node.JS based and wants Jitsi call functionality. The goal is to keep the interface clean and simple, and do all of the heavy lifting (WebRTC negotiations, XMPP handling) itself.</p>

<li>creating users with on the servers where registration is disabled;</li>
<li>changing users passwords (by users themselves or by admins);</li>
<li>logging in to the server using <code>m.login.password</code> method;</li>

<li>A lot of edge cases, where avatars didn't show up correctly were fixed. One issue with dynamic thumbnailing and synapse is still waiting for a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7124">synapse pr</a> to be merged.</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/maubot/reminder/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0</a> of the reminder plugin for maubot was released recently. The primary change was a new custom date parser, which should have less weird results than before.</p>
<p>It also has a locale system. You can set locales with <code>!reminder locale &lt;list of locales&gt;</code>. The system is fairly simple: it just tries to parse the input with each locale in the order specified and uses the first match. It doesn't have many locales so far, so contributions are welcome if you're not afraid of regexes (contributions for reducing the number of regexes are also welcome :D)</p>

<li>more tests</li>
<li>unified namespaces!</li>
</ul>
<p>Unified namespaces is a big update! This means that, if the remote protocol has globally unique IDs (e.g. as discord has the case) it will only create one room on matrix for any amount of puppets. Combining this with the advanced relay option, this means that protocol implementations (e.g. discord) now can act like a normal relay bridge only with super awesome puppeting! As in, the for the puppets, the DMs work and channels&amp;guilds that the relay bot is not in. All this is possible without any changes to the protocol implementation, should the protocol have unique global IDs.</p>
