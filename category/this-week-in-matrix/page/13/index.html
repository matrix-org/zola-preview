<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nico:beerfactory.org">Nico</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/mascarene/mascarene">Mascarene</a> is a quite new homeserver implementation project started a few months ago. Now it's time to introduce it.</p>
<p>Mascarene is written in <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, runs on JVM and relies on <a href="https://akka.io/">Akka</a> actor model. Out of the box it provides features like efficient streaming I/O, clustering and live data distribution. Data are backed in a PostgreSQL database.</p>
<p>The project is in early stage but already provides a few endpoints which make Mascarene able to talk to Riot. </p>
<p>You can test it at <a href="https://snapshot.mascarene.org">https://snapshot.mascarene.org</a>. You should be able to register, login, create a room and talk to yourself.</p>
<p>Current work is focused on client API implementation; federation or e2ee will come later. </p>
<p>Contributions are welcome, join us on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#mascarene:beerfactory.org">#mascarene:beerfactory.org</a></p>

<h3 id="conduit">Conduit</h3>
<p>Conduit is a Matrix homeserver written in Rust <a href="https://conduit.rs">https://conduit.rs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome back! This week I went through the whole Client-Server API and wrote down everything that is still missing from Conduit. You can find issues for all of them in the <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit/milestones">milestone for Conduit 1.0</a>. This should make it more easy for contributors to find something to work on and gives a lot more structure to the repo (maybe I also did it, because it's so satisfying to close issues and see the milestone percentage go up üòõ).</p>
<p>Some of the issues I could already close this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implement redaction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement loading the message someone replied to (/context)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix bugs with notifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't send typing events when nothing happened</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bundle typing events into one EDU</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't send notification counts every /sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement heroes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can tell, a lot of work is starting to go into smaller improvements, which is a good thing, because it means most of the core work is already done!</p>
<p>Thanks to my supporters on <a href="https://liberapay.com/timokoesters">Liberapay</a> (Take a look, I improved it üôÇ).</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week in Synapse land we have been focusing on bug fixes especially SSO and soft logout. </p>
<p>We also spent some time thinking about how to further improve performance for large scale deployments (like matrix.org). In short this will mean sharding contested workers such as the media repo worker, the federation sender and the federation reader. We also want to remove some more functionality from the master process because it is still sitting at about 80% and we‚Äôd like some more head room. We'd also like to fix up the state compressor so it can easily be run as a background progress to save on disk space, this will benefit all installations big and small. Finally we want to speed up joins over federation. Exciting times.</p>
<p>Next week, more of the same and we should start on some of the perf items. Also look out for changes to notification defaults.</p>

<h3 id="dendrite-gomatrixserverlib">Dendrite / gomatrixserverlib</h3>
<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Room version 6 support has been added</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server signing keys which have passed their validity period are now re-requested and updated properly, increasing reliability of federation substantially</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federated room joins have been significantly sped up by requesting missing auth events inline when verifying room state, rather than repeating the entire verification for each missing event</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local send-to-device support has been added (federated send-to-device coming soon)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of code clean-up has taken place (with more to come), including cleaning up the internal APIs and the component bases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decoding of room version 3 event IDs in request URLs has been improved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inbound federation requests now interrupt backoff intervals on outbound sends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new internal API exists now for interrupting backoff intervals on the federation sender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federated <code>/devices</code> endpoint now returns in the correct format</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public rooms are now sorted by their member count</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only our own aliases are stored in the public rooms directory now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gomatrixserverlib is now responsible for marking room versions as supported/stable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spec-compliant transactions are now sent to the appservice component</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File URIs for SQLite databases are now set up using common functions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling registration for a user that already exists has been fixed (thanks <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/1076">S7evinK</a>!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite can now be configured to use a HTTP proxy server for outbound HTTP (thanks <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/1055">dr-bonez</a>!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sytest compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 36%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 35%</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I had apparently forgotten to implement bridge information in the whatsapp bridge when I implemented it in my other bridges, but that mistake is now corrected. I also fixed a bug with encryption where it would generate too many one-time keys and cause messages to be undecryptable. Finally, mautrix-whatsapp had its first release this week since it's working reasonably well now.</p>

<p>This week, we finalised our work around the iOS13 SDK. The coming public TestFlight (0.12.2) is the result of this work. It comes with a lot of changes including a full rewrite of the push handling codebase, trying to find solutions to make matrix e2ee compatible with iOS Notification Service Extension. Most of these changes are unfortunately invisible for end users. Please report any issues. Note this is safe to switch between this TF and 0.11.5.</p>
<p>In parallel, we started to implement the cross-signing bootstrap and the recovery management. The UX of this is going to be refined on Riot-Web and RiotX-Android. Riot-iOS will implement the refined UX directly.</p>

<p>Says TravisR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been a little while since we've done a round of spec releases, so we have a bunch of spec releases to share. If you're implementing something from the spec, please have a look at the news: https://matrix.org/blog/2020/05/27/room-version-6-client-server-r-0-6-1-and-federation-r-0-1-4-spec-releases/</p>
<p>As always, any questions about the spec itself can be answered in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev:matrix.org</a>, or in the various area-specific rooms floating around the federation.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello again! This week I worked on access control, which means that private rooms are private and invite-only rooms are invite-only. The public room directory only shows rooms marked as such now.</p>
<p>I also made <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit/milestones">a milestone to track progress on Conduit 1.0</a>. This release marks the point where Conduit is fully usable as a non-federating homeserver. All features of the client server specification should be implemented, unless they can be seen as optional extensions (e.g. alternative registrations methods like email). Conduit should also be free of all known bugs with those features.</p>
<p>Adding federation on top of the 1.0 release will very likely require breaking changes. This means that the release which brings federation will be 2.0 or later and will require a partial or full database deletion.</p>
<p>@TravisR wrote a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/1304">fix for Riot Web</a>, so you should be able to create accounts on Conduit from &lt;<a href="https://riot.im/app">https://riot.im/app</a>&gt; soon.</p>

<li>
<p>A number of the internal HTTP APIs are now tested fully and have been fixed as a result, which will also improve running a full polylith component deployment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server keys are now managed by a separate server key API component</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Batched sends in the federation sender are now working properly, improving send performance significantly</p>

<p>Error handling in the federation <code>/send</code> endpoint has been tweaked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/get_missing_events</code> now returns events that don't fail signature checks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federated room joins by room alias now attempt the server specified in the alias much more reliably</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The correct room ID is now returned from the PerformJoin API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much of the room server storage code has been deduplicated</p>

<li>
<p>Fixed some bugs in the device database storage code</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>We no longer incorrectly default to federated joins in response to local invites</p>

<p>Spec compliance:</p>
<ul>

<p>The main news this week is that we switched event persistence away from the matrix.org master process which has made a big difference to overall performance. The impact is best demonstrated by graphing message send times.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I made a TARDIS (Time Agnostic Room DAG Inspection Service) - a simple time-travelling debugger for Room DAGs which plugs into Dendrite's internal APIs to visualise room DAGs.  The intention is to provide it as a widget which Riot can use to visualise DAGs for debugging, particularly for P2P Matrix.  The time-travel bit is simply that it could let you filter out the newer events to show how the DAG has evolved over time, although that isn't hooked up yet. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/tardis">https://github.com/matrix-org/tardis</a></p>

<h3 id="p2p-dendrite">P2P/Dendrite</h3>
<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dendrite has seen a number of improvements this week, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Backfill will now backfill more messages than before, resulting in a snappier experience when scrolling back in a room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite is now compliant with Synapse on backfill behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inline CS API filters will now honour the timeline <code>limit</code> value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making more Sytests pass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modifications to how Dendrite tracks memberships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Addition of an <code>-api</code> flag to expose internal HTTP APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clearer separation of internal/external HTTP APIs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This has culminated in the following values for Are We Synapse Yet:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>Client-Server APIs: 34% (227/672 tests) - up from 33%
</span><span>Federation APIs: 34% (35/103 tests) - up from 27%
</span></code></pre>
<p>As for P2P....</p>
<h4 id="p2p-riot-im-v0-1-0-released">p2p.riot.im v0.1.0 released!</h4>
<p>This is a significant milestone because we now persist Dendrite databases to IndexedDB, greatly improving UX and giving users a consistent identity on the P2P network. In addition to this, the following changes have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We now bake in the Dendrite commit SHA into the logs on startup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dendrite will now restart itself in case of panics/segfaults.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues with this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Databases are only flushed to IndexedDB every 30 seconds, making it possible to lose the most recent messages. This has a variety of effects on the Dendrite instance, but in testing it has been able to mostly gracefully recover. Messages that you have sent will be backfilled but will be redacted. Rooms you have joined will be forgotten, and you need to be kicked/re-invited/re-join for communication to be re-established. We're looking into a better flushing mechanism going forwards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have previously visited p2p.riot.im, you <strong>MUST</strong> manually clear your service worker via <code>chrome:serviceworker-internals</code> or <code>about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox</code> or else you might get errors such as &quot;LinkError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): memory import 37 has no maximum limit, expected at most 4294967295&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please <strong>do not rely</strong> on p2p.riot.im to have any form of stability. Patch version bumps (0.1.0 -&gt; 0.1.1) will not remove databases but minor version bumps will (0.1.1 -&gt; 0.2.0) so we can continue to progress with Dendrite development at speed.</p>

<p>lkito has been contributing this week to Nheko as part of his homework for university or so? Anyway, he added an option to highlight whatever message you are currently hovering over, so that you have an easier time locating the proper timestamps and buttons for that specific message. He's now working through a few other issues to improve his coding skills, like optionally having big emojis in the timeline or showing tooltips to explain the settings Nheko has.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now set a /roomnick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now tag rooms using the room context menu. You can assign multiple tags and create new tags as you like. This helps organizing your rooms, since Nheko supported filtering you room list using tags for a few years already, but until now you couldn't assign them.</p>

<p>Link: <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-tv">https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-tv</a></p>
<p>I got really bored in lockdown, as we all have. I stared at my TV, and it stared back at me. While it's definitely a privacy nightmare to start developing apps for these things, I couldn't help myself. I got stuck in, and secured myself a LG Developer Account.</p>
<p>The LG set of smart TVs use WebOS, as like the name suggests, runs apps in it's special variant of Chromium. I was lucky to be running a recent OS and had access to Chromium 53! And NodeJS 0.12!! Sarcasm aside, there are some very troubling versions of WebOS with much older versions of the browser, so I was happy to be developing against something with strong ES6 support. Despite the absolutely <a href="https://twitter.com/Half_Shot/status/1259471146308775943">awful</a> onboarding experience, the WebOS SDK itself was pretty good. <code>matrix-tv</code> was written to be a general large screen matrix client, so it talks to the TV's own libraries through an abstraction layer :)</p>
<p>Anyway, this client is the culmination of a lazy Sunday afternoon's work. It features very basic support for viewing a room, but I hope to expand it at some point. It  supports running in a web browser and the aforementioned OS, but support for more variants is easy to add. I'm looking into how to design for the large screen beyond making fonts bigger, because the unique constraints on memory and UI are fun challenge.</p>

<p>When you use <code>isolated: true</code> on <code>Homeserver.login</code> or <code>MyUser.fromStore</code>, everything will be handled for you and the SDK works the same.</p>
<p>This only works on platforms with the Dart VM (not web).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Updater</code>s are now globally registered per <code>MyUser</code> <code>id</code>.</p>
<p>This means for now only one <code>Updater</code> per <code>MyUser</code> is allowed. <code>Updater</code>s are created when a <code>MyUser</code> instance is retrieved via <code>Homeserver.login</code> or <code>MyUser.fromStore</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add ability to specify what rooms to load from store when retrieving user</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>previousBatch</code> param from <code>Room.copyWith</code> is removed (wasn't used)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add ability to override context in <code>MyUser.copyWith</code> and <code>MyUser.merge</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Updater</code> and <code>Homeserver</code> are less coupled now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a <code>Context</code> is changed with <code>copyWith</code>, all child objects' <code>context</code>s are also changed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix bug in read receipt parsing (thanks to MatMaul!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync errors are now pushed to the <code>updates</code> stream</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix access token not being passed to logout API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <code>type</code> to <code>RequestUpdate</code>, so you can see which type of call</p>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="what-is-jupybot">What is JupyBot</h4>
<p>The purpose of the bot is to provide a link with Jupyter kernels running either on your local computer or somewhere else on a server. You can access your kernels through the bot with the chat interface. The kernels will answer to your commands through the same interface.</p>
<p>Since this is still a proof of concepts, the number of features is limited (command line text, string and pictures are the only output formats supported. No widget, no funny javascript) and they are few safeguards against infinite loops and other entertaining bugs.</p>
<h4 id="todo">TODO</h4>
<p>This is right now just a proof of concept. We want to see if such a bot can be useful for people and how. What features would be interesting, what can be integrated in the present clients,... Therefore, in the short term, we want to focus on the possibility of easy testing for users and easy contributions for people who want to add their ideas. On the mid- and long term, a lot of ideas can be realized; it will depend on the feedback. These are just some examples. Short term:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>proper error catching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fallback for non supported Jupyter formats on riot.im (i.e. a lot)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>testing on termux on a tablet or smartphone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>solve the problem with nio-matrix and upload in chunks of images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dockerized version</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Middle term:</p>
<ul>
<li>use of opsdroid as a framework</li>
</ul>
<p>Longer term:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>local server integrated to locally command the bot service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make full use of jupyter capabilities with a client suited for it (for instance a Jupyterlab plugin)</p>
</li>

<p>I made a little bot that scrapes <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us">https://news.blizzard.com/en-us</a> , because they've disabled their RSS feeds for some time now. It regularly scrapes all posts of a configured category and sends messages for new articles to all rooms the bot is a member of. It works like a RSS bot, except the source is a website instead of a RSS feed.</p>
<p>In the readme there are also some public instances, which you can just invite instead of hosting your own bot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've added matrix support into a chat bot, you can see the chat bot in action at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#midori-dev:hackerspaces.be">#midori-dev:hackerspaces.be</a> and it's project page is here <a href="https://github.com/midoricorp/jabbot">https://github.com/midoricorp/jabbot</a>.<br />
it's main highlight is anybody can add new commands to it in chat using its scripting language<br />
any any existing bot command can be used as a function in new scripts you write<br />
The scripting language to add new commands can be found here <a href="https://github.com/midoricorp/script">https://github.com/midoricorp/script</a><br />
you can do things like<br />
<code>!script print &quot;HELLO world&quot;;</code><br />
or make a new command<br />
<code>!script sub hello { print &quot;HELLO World&quot;; }</code><br />
that would result in a new command !hello being made<br />
print also has 2 output stream, one for rich format and one for basic formatting<br />
<code>!script print &quot;Hello World!&quot;; print HTML &quot;Hello &lt;b&gt;World&lt;/b&gt;&quot;</code>;</p>

<p>Hey, I have created a room for designers workin on matrix stuff to join: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-design:disko.media">#matrix-design:disko.media</a></p>
<p>The goal is to improve cohesion and collaboration for all things design (UI, UX, interaction...)
Over time, it should become a place for people to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ask design-specific questions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>share cool stuff and be praised for all the good work you're doing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and document a common understanding of the semantics of matrix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make sure the user experience is amazing, even as we all figure out how to federate.
Probably most designers work on single clients right now, but there are important UX questions that can only be answered ecosystem-wide. Maybe we'll end up with a design guide for people to use alongside the spec.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some of the work for <code>/get_missing_events</code> has been done now for filling gaps in the room DAG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation sender performance and parallelisation have been dramatically improved, which helps a lot in big rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retries, backoff and blacklisting have also been implemented in the federation sender to handle cases where remote homeservers are unavailable much more gracefully</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retrieving missing state when receiving incoming events over federation is a bit more robust now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating direct chats now works</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invites are mostly working now overall, both locally and over federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>RespState</code> and <code>RespStateJoin</code> have been fixed in gomatrixserverlib</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room joins and leaves are now handled by new code across the roomserver and federation server perform APIs, which reduces complexity significantly</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Redis live in production for m.org! We did not expect this to translate into a significant improvement in performance directly, but it means that we can add new workers without any extra overhead on the master process which has been <em>very</em> useful in supporting cross signing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixing bugs leading to messages getting stuck at the bottom of the timeline as well as messages not making it to sync at all. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of improvements to deal with the extra load generated by cross signing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these changes will be available in v1.13.0 which should have a release candidate ready rsn.</p>
<p>Next week, we continue to work on sharding changes, further SSO support and ensuring that cross signing adoption is as smooth as possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/cal-coop/architect">Architect</a> is a homeserver project written in <a href="https://common-lisp.net">Common Lisp</a>. We intend to create a high performance homeserver using the meta-programming features of Common Lisp to reduce the amount of redundant and timely code that needs to be written and maintained.</p>
<h4 id="architect-events">architect events</h4>
<p>I created a <a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/json-schema2">json-schema</a> library, to generate class definitions directly from the Matrix specification. These classes also have information attached to them to allow for serialisation, using a metaclass from <a href="https://gitlab.com/Gnuxie/json-clos">json-clos</a>.</p>
<p>This is done entirely dynamically without writing to source files. <a href="https://gitlab.com/cal-coop/architect/architect.events">The invocation</a> of json-schema that creates classes for the <code>client-server</code>, <code>server-server</code> and <code>application-service</code> protocols is only about 20 lines.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I refactored most of the data handling code to make it both more efficient and easier to read. I started by splitting a file called &quot;data.rs&quot; into multiple smaller files that handle just one part of the database, like &quot;users.rs&quot;, &quot;rooms.rs&quot; or &quot;edus.rs&quot;. I continued improving the code by making methods return iterators instead of vectors and propagating errors instead of crashing directly. Lastly, I added a few comments here and there and made sure everything works.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, @Valkum experimented with CI and @MTRNord is working on FluffyChat Flutter support.</p>

<p>Easybridge is a multi-user bridge for small Matrix servers, with the idea of making it easy for non-technical users to bridge their external accounts into Matrix. Once configured next to a server, users can just go to a dedicated web page and add their accounts with a simple form. Currently supported protocols include IRC (buggy), XMPP (basic feature only), Mattermost (quite in good shape) and Facebook Messenger (has issues with disconnections).

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over 3 million people from Telegram and Discord have now been brought into the Matrix universe through t2bot.io. Of those people, around 230 thousand are active each month and 15 thousand are dedicated users of the bridges daily.</p>
<p>While this is a huge milestone for t2bot.io,it underlines the importance of self-hosting: having a couple giant bridges is great for accessibility, though where possible it‚Äôs heavily encouraged that people self-host. Hosting the bridges yourself on your own homeserver gives you better control of what passes through your server, reduces your dependence on third parties like t2bot.io, and gives you better performance.</p>
<p>During peak periods, t2bot.io sees about 10 messages per second passing through it. Half of those messages are generated by the Telegram bridge alone. The other half is dealing with federation and the various other bridges and bots on t2bot.io. In terms of media, a new image is uploaded every 2 seconds, leading to 5.8 TB of media being stored. The database is 3 TB and holds 236 Million events - roughly 131 Million of which are sent by t2bot.io.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has used t2bot.io in the past 3 years - it‚Äôs been more successful than ever imagined. Here‚Äôs to another year and a bunch of self-hosting. :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôve spent time this week working with the Riot teams to tweak matrix.org performance for cross signing. We‚Äôve also fixed a few performance regressions ahead of next week's 1.13.0 release (which will be a big one, more details when it lands).</p>
<p>With any luck we‚Äôll have Redis in production on matrix.org next week, we don‚Äôt think this will give us a huge performance win, but there is certainly overhead in having so many workers using the previous replication streaming method.</p>
<p>Our sharding project continues, and Erik has been trying to move the event stream entirely away from the master process which in itself could be significant for overall perf once ready for production.</p>
<p>Aside from that we continue to improve SSO support and we have a really great community PR from <a href="https://github.com/sandhose">sandhose</a> that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7256">implements OpenID Connect support</a>.

<p>Hey all, the IRC bridge has reached another milestone, 0.17.0. This is a medium sized release, containing a few nice to have features like predicting nickname conflicts and some work around user deactivation. Importantly, this release <strong>authenticates</strong> the provisioning endpoint so if you run an integration manager or script that makes use of it, ensure that it handles requests appropriately. You can see the changelog in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.17.0">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.17.0</a></p>

<p>RiotX will finally be an update of Riot-Android on the PlayStore and RiotX beta will then be removed from the PlayStore. We will implement everything to let users upgrade their application without being forced to log in again.</p>
<p>While we are finalizing cross-signing, quadS, bootstrap, etc. on RiotX, we have started studying and implementing the main missing features: identity server and related functionality (terms of service consent, invite by email, search in contact list, bind emails and phone numbers, etc.), integration manager (terms of service consent,widgets, send stickers), WebRTC audio and video calls, Jitsi conference integration, and other important missing features like UI and UX to invite people to a room, etc. We are also fighting an annoying bug related to the navigation inside a timeline.</p>
<p>It's also now possible to deactivate your account using RiotX.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that people can contribute to translate RiotX by using new dedicated <a href="https://translate.riot.im/projects/riot-android/">Weblate projects</a>. Thanks!</p>

<li>
<p>We fixed a bug, where nheko would pin a core to 100% CPU on highdpi screens, because it tried to resize avatars all the time...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also reduced CPU usage by a lot. Nheko now only uses 0.7% CPU on my system again and that's just the presence updates I get every 100ms or so...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There will probably be a release in the near future to get those fixes to people not running master.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reduced CPU usage is mostly not resorting the whole room list all the time, but keeping the partially sorted room list around and not storing pending read receipts in the database but just applying them all the time without checking, if we are waiting on a receipt :D</p>

<p>The whole SDK has been refactored!</p>

<li>
<p>All data objects such as <code>MyUser</code>, <code>Room</code>, etc. are now immutable</p>

<p><code>LocalUser</code> has been renamed to <code>MyUser</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And a <em>lot</em> of other changes!</p>
<h4 id="how-it-works">How it works</h4>
<p>The user has a stream of <code>Update</code>s, <code>user.updates</code>. An <code>Update</code> contains the latest 'snapshot' of data associated with the user. It also contains a <code>delta</code> <code>MyUser</code>, where all properties are <code>null</code>, except those that are changed. For example, if a user started typing in a certain room, and we're syncing, there will be an <code>Update</code> in <code>user.updates</code>, where <code>delta</code> has 1 <code>Room</code> in <code>delta.rooms</code>, with only the room where the user started typing, reflected in <code>room.typingUserIds</code>. All other properties of the <code>Room</code> will be null. This is all assuming that this is the only change in the sync. If more happened, it will be reflected in <code>delta</code>.</p>
<p>For more info, see the <a href="https://git.pattle.im/pattle/library/matrix-dart-sdk/-/blob/master/README.md">README</a></p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a bot to share Jitsi call URLs. The main objective is to allow people on the other side of bridges to get the URL for a jitsi call. When a jitsi widget is added to a room (v2 widget from riot-web) it will post a message with the plain jitsi URL. It also provides a !jitsi command which allows people to create a jitsi call with a custom URL, and if the bot has permission it will be added as a widget in the matrix room. It has a bunch of other config options you can tweak it with. The main thing you might find it useful for if you are not in a bridged room is you can use it to quickly add a jitsi widget for any conference URL. The bot can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Cadair/skill-jitsi/">https://github.com/Cadair/skill-jitsi/</a> and it uses the opsdroid framework. I have also hosted a version @jitsibot:cadair.com</p>

<p>Last week</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shipped <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/23/synapse-1-12-4-released">1.12.4</a> a patch release to fix some cross signing related bugs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redis support to replace our existing cross replication system, merged to develop. This is a precursor to the sharding project. We have a PR to support cache invalidation across workers which, once merged should make it relatively easy to pull off event persistence from the master process. Just removing event persistence could give some decent perf wins, but the prize is then splitting persistence to run across across multiple workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A final PR to support SSO for user interactive auth will merge imminently, thereby freeing up full cross signing support for worker installs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aside from that we‚Äôve been working on fixing a weird bug where rooms can end up with zero forward extremities and generally showing Sygnal some love. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upcoming</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Put Redis into production</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ship 1.13.0 which will contain Redis support as well as a host of SSO bug fixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge our new caching config logic to give finer granularity on cache settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge cache invalidation and try to get events persistence running in its own worker.</p>

<p>This week I worked a lot on getting the first bit of federation working. My goal was to query the public room list of another server and forward it to a client.</p>
<p>This involved setting up a keypair to sign the json I send to the server and putting authorization headers into my requests. Most of the work is already done and <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/">https://federationtester.matrix.org/</a> reports it's all good.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I spent some time improving Riot support. Now there should be a lot less warnings and some new features: typing events, read receipts, better room directory, invites, user search.</p>
<p>The only bigger bug that exists currently is that the message history is not automatically loaded when you join a room.  Sometimes reloading the page helps, but not always. The reason for that is that Riot calls the deprecated /initialSync endpoint, which I do not support (I hope someone works on Riot to fix that).</p>
<p>In the next few weeks I plan to improve the single-homeserver experience further and add permission management, while also working on federation.</p>
<p>Check out the repository on <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit">https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit</a> and our Matrix room on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:koesters.xyz">#conduit:koesters.xyz</a>. If you want to try out the server yourself, you can try to connect to it using <a href="https://riot.nordgedanken.de/#/register">https://riot.nordgedanken.de/#/register</a> (though it might be offline when you read this).</p>
<p>I also want to thank my supporters on <a href="https://liberapay.com/timokoesters">Liberapay</a> for their kindness üòä.</p>

<p>I tested the performance of Conduit yesterday by running a ruma client that sends a /send request in a for loop 10k times, which took ~46.8 seconds (all locally on my pc). This means the server can handle ~210 /sends per second under these circumstances.</p>

<p>The flamegraph shows what the cpu is spending most of its time doing. Plateaus are things that take time. You can see most of the time is used for a function in sled::io (I spoke with one of the devs and they said this is expected, but will be improved in the next release)</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We continue to focus on performance and spent a good chunk of time improving worker replication test coverage to build confidence that our upcoming changes will work as expected. Erik has been working on how to how to factor out cache invalidation which is now starting to take good shape. Once we have that, factoring out things like event persistence are next on the horizon. </p>
<p>Aside from that we‚Äôve been working with the Riot client teams as they near release for cross signing, fixing bugs and improving performance on key actions.</p>
<p>SSO support continues to improve, and more fixes for user inactive auth for worker'd installs will land next week. Poor old Rich has been banging his head against a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7206">sync bug</a> blocking develop, but hopefully he has broken its back now, and we'll get that merged asap.</p>
<p>Finally we experienced some operational issues with push over the weekend, so we spent some time cleaning up and figuring out how to make things more resilient. </p>
<p>Coming up, performance, cross signing support, SSO improvements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update from Jason:</strong></p>
<p>The Construct server made significant progress this week with end-to-end encryption, client compatibility, application services support, and build-related enhancements. I'd like to thank <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@yan:yetanothernerd.xyz">Yan Minari</a> for contributing spec-compliant code paths for application services in the user registration system. Special thanks this week to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@qy:cs.xa0.uk">Tony O.</a> for continued work on the NixOS (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nix:matrix.org">#nix:matrix.org</a>) derivation for reproducible builds, in addition to contributing fixes to Nio for optimal compatibility with Construct. I'd also like to thank <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@weebl:matrix.weebl.me">Wessel</a> for contributing a much needed reorganization of the Dockerfiles in preparation for Construct operating on many more platforms. Many thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> for working with the team this week in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net">#test:zemos.net</a> on various compatibility fixes to mtxclient and Nheko; the responsiveness when using Nheko with Construct is mind-blowing. I'd also like to thank <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@david:vovo.id.au">David Vo (a.k.a. auscompgeek)</a> for also contributing to Nio toward Construct compatibility.</p>
<p>Finally, I owe much appreciation to tulir, jochen, qy and others for setting up brand new installations this week and providing feedback in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test:zemos.net">#test:zemos.net</a>. Construct is the first and only federating alternative to Synapse. It is written in C++ for maximum performance, the lowest possible TCO, and designed for horizontal scaling with Construct Cluster.

<p>Hello, this week has been busy for us over in bridge corner. We've released:</p>

<p>Which includes a bunch of small fixes, including a performance improvement to <code>StateLookup</code> hits. Apparently it's bad to hit the homeserver with 1000s of concurrent /state requests on startup. <strong>Most importantly</strong> it also includes a critical fix to the <code>addAppServicePath</code> function, which previously did not authenticate requests, see the CHANGELOG for more information on that.</p>

<p>We're still working on the RCs for this release, having discovered and fixed a bunch of failures that can happen around getting connected to IRC. Be aware that the above security fix is applied in this release, which means provisioning requests will now be authenticated.</p>
<h4 id="matrix-appservice-slack-1-2-0-rc1"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/1.2.0-rc1">matrix-appservice-slack 1.2.0-rc1</a></h4>
<p>This is another big load of bug fixes, with many thanks to our new bridge crew member, Christian!. This release includes the above security fixes, as well as some metrics improvements to track activity on the bridge.</p>

<p>WIP Command line Matrix client using matrix-rust-sdk</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@devinr528:matrix.org">devinr528</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A clickable command-line client Matrix written in Rust. Although, still in the early stages, enough has been implemented to show a working demo. <code>rumatui</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs">tui</a> to power the UI and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk">matrix-rust-sdk</a> for all communication with the server. So far the message formatting has been the most visually satisfying feature, although implementing it was not much fun. The goal of the project is to have a UI driven command-line client, useable from either keyboard and/or mouse.</p>
<p>Big thanks to @poljar for allowing me to work on matrix-rust-sdk, @jplatte for the opportunity to work with the <a href="https://github.com/ruma">ruma</a> crates and everyone in the Matrix community for being so helpful!</p>

<p>0.7.0 will contain a lot of work, including replies, e2ee attachments and a completely rewritten timeline (the full changelog is too big for TWIM, but you can find it in the github releases). It also fixes a lot of issues. We should probably released it a lot earlier, but we always had one more feature we wanted to finish... For the future we plan to do smaller, more regular releases!</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts-thought-balloon">Final Thoughts üí≠</h2>
<p>While discussing the use of QML in Nheko, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aa13q:matrix.org">aa13q</a> became extremely energised, so I'm including this piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Qt/QML fanboy here, feel free to skip, just a love letter to the framework :D</p>
<p>Qt/QML is super-awesome, it's hard to describe how pretty declarative syntax is and how beautiful MVC approach with native Qt C++ side integration %) It is very hard to contribute to HTML/CSS/JS projects when you have seen QML once.</p>
<p>Talking about resources, there are even projects for very low-level embedded boards with arm cortex m7 core [1,2]</p>
<p>I'm actually thinking Qt is the bright future of very wide development areas. I'm both frightened and intrigued looking at relatively low popularity of the project. Since I want it to live and prosper even more but afraid of the possible mistakes for even harder tasks. The better popularity of the project will be harder to coordinate and the future tasks will be even harder. Similar to other cool projects (like matrix! :) I guess it's very challenging to balance between running as hard as you can and not to &quot;die&quot; from exhaustion %)</p>
<p>I don't even know is there something similar comparing to the Qt project, that's also why I'm worried about the future of the project %) </p>
<p>So-called software crisis (the late 60s ‚Äì mid-80s [3,4]) was successfully overcome by introducing Object-Oriented Programming (it's always funny to see some people who are more into functional programming hates OOP in that context [5]) And notably Alan Kay is not only OOP pioneer (Smalltalk language) but also a first GUI applications developer. While the current OOP languages like Java and C++ are quite imperative, OOP is not only about the objects but also about the messages between them (Smalltalk is probably a nice example here too).</p>
<p>Qt in that context restores interesting balance to quite imperative C++ introducing the so-called meta-object system (for the messaging between objects). After that in ~Qt5, the declarative QML approach was introduced to develop these ideas even more. Not only GUI subject matter could be expressed with QML (like Qt Quick), but the others too (for example, QBS build system).</p>
<p>Sorry for typos and poor style, not a native speaker :) And I could be wrong in my views.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week was really successful for the homeserver project. Not only does event sending and syncing work properly, but creating/joining rooms, state events and the public room directory works as well.  But the biggest archievement I made this week is Riot support.</p>
<p>Big thanks to MTRNord for fixing bugs in Riot web and deploying an instance of Riot with all patches applied and to jplatte and @iinuwa for improving the ruma libraries.</p>
<p>Today we did the first actual test of the new homeserver. We had ~5 people sending and syncing messages in a room and all of them were able to send messages almost instantly. We'll see how well that scales when we implement federation in the future.</p>
<p>Check out the repository on <a href="https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit">https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit</a> and our Matrix room on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:koesters.xyz">#conduit:koesters.xyz</a>.

<p>The main focus continues to be performance and we are starting to make good progress in figuring out how to split out and shard the event streams. This is a project where most of the bang will come all at once, rather than there being multiple small incremental improvements. </p>
<p>Aside from that we continue to improve the SSO experience, landing UIA support for CAS providers. We also made a small change to the default behaviour so that only room admins can enable e2ee (applies to new rooms only).</p>
<p>Next week, is more of the same. Expect a few short term performance improvements (specifically to help with cross signing UX) and more SSO support.</p>

<h3 id="construct">Construct</h3>
<p>Update from Jason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>End-to-end encryption support has landed in Construct. The server now supports cross-signing, secret storage, and key backups for clients. I'm pleased with how this all came together on schedule for the upcoming transition to e2ee by default for Matrix. If you haven't been paying attention in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> last week full support for push-rules including efficient highlight-counting also landed. Next week Application Service support is scheduled.</p>
<p>Construct is quickly nearing complete coverage over the full breadth of the Matrix protocol, and the transition into release packaging is fast approaching. Construct is the C++ homeserver built for maximum performance with the lowest possible cost of ownership. If you're in need of a faster homeserver please show your support in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> and tell all your friends to lend a hand today!</p>

<h3 id="new-rust-homeserver">New Rust Homeserver</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz">timo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! This week I worked on a Matrix homeserver written in Rust. Registering and logging in works already and I am currently adding support for sending events and inserting them into the event graph. I spent most of my time reading the Matrix specification to understand how this process works, because with federation (which I plan to add to my homeserver in the future) servers might disagree on which event was created first and there are strictly defined rules to resolve this. The Matrix homeserver uses the Ruma libraries as it's base and handles requests and responses using the Rocket crate. I use sled to store information as (key, value) pairs in a database. Most of these libraries are still experimental and I take this attitude myself by straying off from the reference implementations and changing algorithms in hopes of better performance.

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-asmux">mautrix-asmux</a> wasn't made this week, but I haven't mentioned it on TWIM before. Basically, it acts as a proxy between appservices and the homeserver. The primary point is to make it possible to dynamically provision appservices.</p>
<p>The dynamically provisioned appservices connect to mautrix-asmux with individual access tokens, which asmux checks and then proxies the requests to Synapse with its own global access token. Synapse is only aware of one appservice, which will have a large user ID and alias namespace (e.g. everything starting with <code>_</code>). In the other direction, mautrix-asmux maintains a room ID -&gt; appservice mapping, which it uses to send incoming events to the correct appservice. As a side effect, mautrix-asmux implements <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2190">MSC2190</a>, which is needed for end-to-bridge encryption.</p>
