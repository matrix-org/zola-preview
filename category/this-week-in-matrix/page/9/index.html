<p>Conduit is a Matrix homeserver written in Rust https://conduit.rs</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@timokoesters:fachschaften.org">timokoesters</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone! I'm excited to announce that Conduit has been accepted by <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/">Prototype Fund</a> and will be funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research over the next 6 months: https://prototypefund.de/project/conduit/</p>
<p>The focus lies on federation support and overall improvement and stability, maybe we will even land version 1.0 at the end.</p>
<p>I am surprised how Conduit went from a small hobby project to a very promising Matrix server in just a year. Thank you all for accompanying me on this journey, I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Now what did we actually do in the last two weeks?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Query signing keys through other servers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many state resolution updates</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implement /get_missing_events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement /state_ids</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many bugfixes</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Push notifications on mobile</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix joining via alias with appservices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable zstd for database compression (3.3GB -&gt; 1.6GB on old db!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rework state storage to be much more optimized (store a few bytes instead of long strings)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send proper HOST headers in federation requests (thanks Gabriel!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Conduit is beginning to run fairly well on the state resolution branch, we will probably merge it after fixing the last few bugs.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a> is a highly customizable multi-domain media repository for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/releases/tag/v1.2.5">v1.2.5</a> is out now with several bug fixes and other improvements. The most notable things being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Optional support for <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a> (error reporting). This is the same error reporting structure that Synapse uses, so it should fit right in üôÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several oEmbed URL previews have been fixed, making them useful again. Rejoice once again with a preview of Tweets, Giphys, and other rich content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug where after uploading media to a datastore the media repo would then download it again before returning it. This made remote media downloads inefficient (it'd download from the remote server, upload to S3, then download from S3, then return it to the user), sorry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes a wobbly database could cause some issues with future requests. While I recommend a not-wobbly database, the media repo should be more resilient to this sort of problem now.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/03/12/this-week-in-matrix-2021-03-12#synapse">last week</a>, we've been focusing on nailing down some inefficiencies in federation performance. Well, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.30.0rc1">Synapse 1.30.0rc1 is out</a>, and I'm very excited to share one result of that work:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-03-19-vEb-4-synapse-1.30rc1-state_ids-cpu.png" alt="2021-03-19-vEb-4-synapse-1.30rc1-state_ids-cpu.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you look closely, you'll note <em>an order of magnitude improvement</em> in our handling of the <code>/_matrix/federation/v1/state_ids/{roomId}</code> endpoint. On matrix.org, we've seen that endpoint go from averaging a few seconds of CPU time to well under 100ms. Database usage is similarly reduced.</p>
<p>This improvement by <a href="https://github.com/clokep">@clokep</a> builds on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/auth_chain_difference_algorithm.md">chain cover index</a> that <a href="https://github.com/erikjohnston">@erikjohnston</a> implemented in Synapse 1.26.0 to speed up the calculation of auth chain differences during state resolution.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.30 will be released early next week.</p>
<p>We also shipped <a href="https://develop.element.io/">Sygnal 0.9.0</a> today, which has a few minor bug fixes as well an initial prototype of Web Push support, per the Hydrogen update in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/03/12/this-week-in-matrix-2021-03-12#hydrogen">last week's TWiM</a>.</p>

<p>I ported the native https://nio.chat iPhone client to macOS Big Sur, and call that &quot;Mio&quot;. Nio and Mio share the same SwiftUI code base, with the Mio changes being merged into the Nio upstream repository. Like Nio, Mio is still in very early stages but looks quite nice already.</p>

<p>Some time ago we featured Nio running on an <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/04/this-week-in-matrix-2020-12-04">M1 Mac via Catalyst</a>, this is being compiled natively for Mac.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to LorenDB, notifications now omit the reply fallback and show that that message is a reply instead. They also should not break on encrypted rooms anymore (they show that the message was encrypted for now, but they will be decrypted in the future, if that is enabled in the settings). Emotes should now also show up in them properly and if someone sends an unencrypted image, this should show up with a preview in the notification as well.</p>

<p>Jedi18 ported the room switcher, which can be accessed with Ctrl+K to Qml, which fixes a lot of readability issues and should improve how the rooms get filtered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jedi18 also fixed a few issues with playing video on Windows. Salahmak made sending media easier by allowing you to send the image by just pressing enter.</p>
<p>Nheko now also stores images outside of the database, which should decrease database size in the future and make it easier to clean out that part of the cache. We also now use native menus where possible and fixed a few crypto and sync issues as well as formatting of mentions sent by Nheko. Nheko should now not randomely fail to /sync anymore, if your network connection dropped out in between. Also the flatpak should now be able to use your webcam in more cases, but this means we also use less sandboxing now. If you don't like that, you can disable access to all devices, but that sadly also includes the webcam.</p>

<p>On Monday we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/03/08/synapse-1-29-0-released">released Synapse 1.29.0</a>! The most visible highlights are new configuration settings which can limit disclosure of user profile information and optionally rank local users higher when searching the user directory. However, we've also made quite a few tweaks under the hood, including some initial improvements to presence performance and allowing the media repository to regenerate missing thumbnails on demand.</p>
<p>The next release of Synapse will focus on mitigating several known inefficiencies and problematic behaviors around federation performance; I look forward to telling you more about that when it reaches release.</p>
<p>We're also excited to announce that we've secured funding to participate in the next round of <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> internships. Outreachy encourages people from underrepresented or nontraditional backgrounds to participate in F/OSS. We have funding for one intern and are proposing <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/apply/project-selection/#matrix">two possible projects</a> focused on either modernizing Sygnal/Sydent, or extending Complement so it can replace more of SyTest.</p>
<p>While applications for this round have closed, we also expect to also participate in the end-of-year internship round, applications for which will open in September.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was the week of internal changes. If you are building from source, the following changes may affect you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After some distros now ship a newer fork of lmdbxx under the lmdbxx package name, we migrated to that version. While we wanted to do that for some time, if you have been using your distro package and builds now fail for you, you may want to use the bundled version of lmdbxx. Similarly, if there are new database issues, that you experience, please report them!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, we dropped our dependency on tweeny, since we only used that in one location and the same thing can be done natively, so you can remove that from your package builds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore we are now stricter with how we validate tls certificates and bumped the minimum version to tls 1.2. If that causes issues for you, please report them as well. There is a known issue, that if you are using the bundled OpenSSL, it may not load your system certificate chain, so you will get TLS errors. We are still trying to find a proper solution for that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also disabled the epoll backend on all ARM builds instead of just our flatpak, since that one just crashes on ARM and until that is fixed in the library we are using, this would lead to a much worse experience on those platforms (and we didn't notice that before, because we disabled it a long time ago in our flatpak while debugging a related issue).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from that, we did also have some cool stuff happening. One thing I want to especially highlight is the push work from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@vurpo:hacklab.fi">tilde</a>. It is one direction that I never thought of Nheko moving in and I think UnifiedPush is a really cool project!</p>
<p>We also switched from inline buttons to a hover overlay for message actions. Please try it out and give us feedback, if that is an improvement or makes the experience worse! It does at least make it clearer, which button belongs to which message, make the interface less messy and scrolling faster.</p>
<p>We also try to suppress the notifications caused by @‚Å†room mentions, when you reply to such a mention now by inserting a zero width joiner. This seems to work fine for all clients and servers but Element Web... So at least for everyone not using Element Web, if someone replies to an @‚Å†room as a mod on Nheko, they should not get a notification anymore.

<h3 id="unifiedpush-what-is-it-what-happened-this-week-and-why-should-you-care">UnifiedPush, what is it, what happened this week, and why should you care?</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@vurpo:hacklab.fi">vurpo</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://unifiedpush.org/">UnifiedPush</a> is an interface that apps can use to receive push notifications without caring about which service transported those push notifications to the device, and it's an interface that you can implement to deliver push notifications to people's apps, if you've come up with a great new way to transport push notifications from the internet to a device (did someone say push over Matrix?).</p>
<p>UnifiedPush has been specified for Android with some apps implementing it for a few months now, but now I've been working on specifying and implementing it for D-Bus platforms. (This is mostly intended for mobile Linux OSes such as postmarketOS, but any platform with D-Bus will work!) This means I've implemented a Gotify-based distributor that runs on Linux, and also implemented UnifiedPush in nheko to give it the capability to receive push notifications. I've yet to iron out all the details, so push in nheko isn't exactly ready to be released yet, but I can demonstrate with a video!</p>
<p>To <em>you</em>, Matrix client developers who desperately want to receive push notifications and get your app woken up while it is not running (on Linux or Android), this means that you should simply implement UnifiedPush in your app to receive pushes from the user's choice of distributor. (note: D-Bus API is not yet in the spec, but under discussion) How? See https://unifiedpush.org and join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#unifiedpush:matrix.org">#unifiedpush:matrix.org</a> to discuss it further!</p>

<h3 id="discord-bridging-guide">Discord bridging guide</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cos:hacklab.fi">Cos</a> shared a nice guide to configuring <a href="https://github.com/matrix-discord/mx-puppet-discord">mx-puppet-discord</a>: https://boilingsteam.com/how-to-bridge-discord-in-matrix/.</p>
<p>Soru, the author of mx-puppet-discord, wanted to add some clarifications for the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The section on having to set up your <code>.well-known</code> is slightly incorrect: mx-puppet-discord does normal C-S API discovery, so if your C-S API is not on any subdomain it will already just work, <code>.well-known</code> is just needed in case that differs. Additionally, you can set up a manual mapping in your <code>config.yaml</code> (also helpful if you need http for e.g. local development). This is totally unrelated to <code>setmatrixtoken</code>.</p>
<p>While the guide mentions bridges, it does not mention <code>setispublic &lt;puppetId&gt; 1/0</code> to make the bridge public / private. If you want your relay to just be usable by anyone, you should do <code>setispublic &lt;puppetId&gt; 1</code>, as then the rooms it creates aren't invite-only.</p>

<p>Earlier this week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.11">Dendrite 0.3.11</a>, and since then we have merged a significant number of appservice fixes to <code>master</code> which will go into the next release. With these, bridges should stand a much better chance of working with Dendrite.</p>
<p>Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Events are now properly sent to interested appservices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appservice namespace exclusivity is now respected properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users starting with <code>_</code> can now be registered by appservices correctly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room alias queries for appservices have been improved and should work now</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also upgraded a number of dependencies.</p>
<p>Spec compliance has improved slightly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 60%, up from 56% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 82%, up from 80% last week</p>

<p>We've heard some feedback that Synapse's release cadence‚Äîan RC every other week, with releases in between‚Äîcan feel a bit overwhelming.

<p>On non-release weeks I'll try to spend a little more time focusing on the behind-the-scenes aspects of developing Synapse in our TWiM updates. If there's anything in particular you'd like hear about, let me know!</p>
<p>Speaking of, we're experimenting with using GitHub Discussions for... discussions.</p>
<p>We don't want to go full-on mailing list, but it might be nice to have a place to for slower, asynchronous conversations that don't quite fit into the more rapid pace of a typical Matrix room.</p>

<p>A PSA this time around. Please test this release and update as soon as you can when we go to release on Monday next week. We've included a change to correct how users are registered against the homeserver to comply with the spec (Synapse accepts a /register call without a <code>type=m.login.application</code>, and versions 2.5.0 and below of the matrix-appservice-bridge sent these invalid requests). I'm hoping to eventually retire this behaviour from Synapse, so the more people that upgrade the better!</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9548">this PR</a> is the Synapse-side change to remove this behaviour. If your appservice implementation uses this behaviour, <strong>please</strong> chime in.</p>

<p>Since then, I unfortunately had to change its DNSLink domain, so I decided to post about it again, with the new addresses and some minor updates. Here are the former:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ipns://element-web.0x1a8510f2.space/</code> (Main DNSLink address)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ipns://k2k4r8mx8muu913j5oy3e4zvt77xtks8xgxuamlv0ltzwx95lcgk2glw</code> (IPNS hash which the above address points to)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ipfs://bafybeievxs6qzzbfbn6xcbz3xwxhjzxkffjbpwbcc3gikrac6ytqkkutva</code> (IPFS hash of the current snapshot of the above)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other news, I've updated Element on IPFS to v1.7.22 and made a tiny script to easily update it in future. In case it's of use to anyone, it's right here:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>
</span><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span>
</span><span>if [ &quot;$#&quot; -ne 2 ]; then
</span><span>
</span><span>        echo -e &quot;Invalid number of arguments (got $# but 2 required)!\nUsage: $0 &lt;element web folder&gt; &lt;release tag to download&gt;&quot; &gt;&amp;2
</span><span>        exit 1
</span><span>
</span><span>fi
</span><span>
</span><span>wget -c &quot;https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/releases/download/$2/element-$2.tar.gz&quot; -O - | tar --overwrite --strip-components=1 -xzv -C $1 element-$2
</span><span>
</span><span>ipfs add -r -p $1
</span><span>
</span><span>echo &quot;Now use: &#39;ipfs name publish -key=&lt;publish key&gt; &lt;folder ID&gt;&#39; to publish on IPFS&quot;

<p>I am very excited to launch Cactus Comments (https://cactus.chat) today together with @asbjorn:olli.ng!</p>
<p>Cactus Comments is a federated, web-embeddable comment system. And of course, we federate by building on Matrix!</p>
<p>On the frontend - your website - we embed a Matrix client written in Elm that renders Matrix rooms as comment sections. The client is designed to be especially easy to embed on static sites. Once you log in to the client, it will only communicate directly with your Matrix server of choice.</p>
<p>On the backend, an application service is used to create rooms on-demand and help with moderation. It is built with Python and is completely stateless. It does this by modelling all state in native Matrix objects without any custom events!</p>
<p>The entire thing is free and open source software and we would love it if you were to contribute. We really hope some of you will give it a try!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With things on the Internet vanishing, I've been wanting to start saving copies of interesting web pages and videos to my server-at-home.</p>
<p>This really doesn't involve much more than just running <code>youtube-dl</code> or <code>archivebox</code> on the relevant URLs, but I needed a better way than having to e-mail myself reminders to download things‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I decided to make <a href="https://bics.ga/reivilibre/matrix_queue_proc">Matrix Queue Processor</a>.</p>
<p>You can run it occasionally (or set it up to run in a cron job!) and it will then read all outstanding messages and feed the text to a given command, such as <code>youtube-dl</code>.</p>
<p>You can choose for it to delete processed messages, or tick them off (‚úÖ). If the command wasn't successful, it will instead reply with the exit code.</p>
<p>It's not particularly sophisticated but it might at least be a small starting point for anyone who wanted to make something similar, and it is end-to-end encryption capable because it uses the Python <code>matrix-nio</code> SDK.</p>
<p>See this example of use with <code>youtube-dl</code>; it fails on the second message because it's not a video page URL:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In layman's terms, we showed that the Event Graph provides a strong form of eventual consistency even when new events are applied in arbitrary order. In addition, this consistency guarantee can still be povided even if all other servers in a room are malicious, which is unexpected compared to the honest majority required for the usual Distributed Ledger Technology. We also looked at the problem of ‚ÄúIf servers randomly select at which parents at the bottom of the Event Graph they append new events, and the number of parents for an event is limited, how can you be sure that the Event Graph does not grow arbitrarily wide?‚Äú, which is something that puzzled me since the beginning of my Ph.D. two years ago. It is easy simulate a given setup and see that the width shrinks really fast, but it is also easy to see that arbitrary growth has a likelihood larger than zero. As this was astonishingly hard to grasp mathematically, we were very happy that we could recruit <a href="https://www.math.kit.edu/stoch/~henze/">Prof. Dr. Norbert Henze from the Institute of Stochastics</a> as co-author to provide evidence that you can expect the Event Graph to shrink to a normal width quite quickly.</p>
<p>Let me quote parts of the abstract for some more technical details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[‚Ä¶] By comparison with traditional decentralized communication systems, Matrix replaces pure message passing with a replicated data structure. This data structure, which we extract and call the Matrix Event Graph (MEG), depicts the causal history of messages. We show that this MEG represents an interesting and important replicated data type for decentralized applications that are based on causal histories of publish-subscribe events: First, we prove that the MEG is a Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type for causal histories and, thus, provides Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC). With SEC being among the best known achievable trade-offs in the scope of the well-known CAP theorem, the MEG provides a powerful consistency guarantee while being available during network partition. Second, we discuss the implications of byzantine attackers on the data type‚Äôs properties. We note that the MEG, as it does not strive for consensus or strong consistency, can cope with n &gt; f environments with n participants, of which f are byzantine. Furthermore, we analyze scalability: Using Markov chains, we study the number of forward extremities of the MEG over time and observe an almost optimal evolution. [‚Ä¶] With the properties shown, a MEG represents a promising element in the set of data structures for decentralized applications, but with distinct trade-offs compared to traditional blockchains and distributed ledger technologies.</p>

<p>As seen from the image, you can now share your screen. This currently only works on X11, since there are no cross platform APIs for that, so look out for that, if you run into issues.</p>
<p>Jedi18 also polished the UX a bit more and fixed bugs, so registration should now work properly again and leaving or joining rooms should place you in the right rooms after that. We also fixed some inconsistencies, where text could be misaligned, when writing long messages.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/erdnaxeli/caridina">Caridina</a>, a <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a> library for Matrix, got some new releases, which bring it to v0.10.2.

Thanks to Ruma actually for giving me inspiration about implementing events using macros.</p>

<p>So I had a minute to release my open q&amp;a bot taavi. </p>
<p>I always wanted to write a chatbot that does cool things, so checkmark for that one on the list. In addition to that I recently failed a job interview. For their technical skill test (I did not fail this :P), I got a task for which I learned how to use <code>puppeteer</code>, then saw a post on reddit about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/lk1il3/no_need_of_alexa_siri_cortana_i_am_happy_with_my/">Tuxi</a> and together with my previous project that included Matrix (<a href="https://github.com/select/audius">Audius</a>), I knew what I had to do: create Taavi.</p>
<p>I have created this bot as a &quot;weekend project&quot;, litteraly one day for the code and one day for documentation. Surely it's far from perfect but I don't have any big plans with it so far‚Ä¶ If you think I should add some features, <a href="https://gitlab.com/s3lect/taavi-chat-bot/-/issues">create an issue</a> and let me know. I could imagine adding other websites / services to it like last.fm, do you have any ideas?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soru has been working on experimenting with / designing a way to improve push systems within the matrix ecosystem, so that ideally clients can display full event contents in a notification and dispose of specific push notifications without the need for any extra HTTP calls. This lead her to making <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3013">MSC3013</a> (encrypted push), so that no gateway is able to read event contents pushed down to the client and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3014">MSC3014</a>, so that the client can know which rooms have been read on other devices, allowing them to dispose push notifications.</p>
<p>This is more than just MSCs already, soru already got encrypted push in a patched synapse and a patched fluffychat working locally, and it is working super great!</p>

<p>Let's talk more about Hedwig: This is a push gateway for matrix and an alternative to Sygnal. Hedwig is completely written from scratch in Rust (Yes! Rust!) and offers the basic functionality to forward matrix push notifications to Firebase Cloud Messaging. That's it. Nothing more. It is intended to be as lightweight as possible and so it is very fast and stable. Just change a simple config.toml file and run the binary. There are docs for how you can configure a proxy in Apache2 and an example systemD service file. Currently it only supports event_id_only formatted notifications but maybe, in the future, we expand this functionality.</p>

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse</h3>
<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synapse 1.27 is out, and you can <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/18/synapse-1-27-0-released">read all about it</a> on the Matrix Blog! This is the version that powered FOSDEM, and we're super proud of it. Especially the much improved support for multiple social login providers, which debuted at FOSDEM and is now enabled on matrix.org.</p>
<p>In addition to all the performance, stability, and social login improvements, there are two important things to note:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you use SSO, you will need update your configuration before upgrading; please see the link above for details.</li>
<li>We were unable to build Docker images for ARM platforms in time for this release, and will not build images for ARMv7 in future releases.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To avoid unexpected breakage, we have not updated the  <code>latest</code> tag on Docker Hub for this release; if you want Synapse 1.27, you'll need to specifically reference the <code>v1.27.0</code> tag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Images for ARM64 (and an updated <code>latest</code> tag) will return with the next Synapse release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It took us a bit longer than usual to get 1.27 out the door, so we're also pleased to announce that <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.28.0rc1">1.28.0rc1</a> is also now available, and we expect to release it early next week. Keep your eyes peeled for more on that next week!</p>

<p>The rejiggering to allow arbitrary images for the Kubernetes chart got delayed due to lack of time, but 1.27.0 should hopefully be the last version with that limitation.</p>

<p>FluffyChat 0.27.0 is out. Not with the new design but with some minor design improvements like the return of the presence list top bar (or whatever you would name it!). Also this release brings a lot of bug fixes, working bootstrapping and the switch to our new Push Gateway (in Rust) we have invented inside of Famedly.

<p>FluffyChat runs on the PinePhone (Flutter Linux ARM64). I've built it with flutter master on the PinePhone itself, because cross-compiling is not yet supported. Currently, Flutter Linux on the PinePhone only works with X11. It crashes with Wayland.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had a fun week this time. Today I tested trilenes screen sharing code, which seems to work pretty well on X11, although it only shares the full screen atm. I expect window sharing to land next week though. We also ran into some issues with matrix.org enabling optional SSO login, which locked some people out of their accounts, since Nheko preferred SSO login in that case... This is now fixed and in such cases you will be offered both login flows.</p>
<p>Jedi18 also added a room name completer, which means you can finally complete aliases when typing them! The room settings were also ported to Qml and now actually show the room topic. Apart from that there were various UX fixes here ad there, like hovering actually working properly now, emote messages formatting correctly in notifications and more. We also adapted the matrix: uri support to the latest changes, although the MSC is a bit volatile atm, so it may need some more adaptions over time.</p>
<p>I think that's all, have a nice weekend everyone!</p>

<h3 id="hydrogen">Hydrogen</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm back working on Hydrogen, and started to tackle logging to be able to diagnose problems better. I've opted for a structured log format in JSON that gives a tree of log nodes for an entire operation (e.g. sync, or sending a message, ...) which will be more compact and should also be easier to find patterns in than a pure line based format. I had hoped to get that out in a release by today but didn't get as far as I hoped, so should get released early next week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-02-19-VTLG5-image.png" alt="2021-02-19-VTLG5-image.png" /></p>

<p>Have a look at the latest release notes for a complete list of new features and fixes: https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/releases</p>
<p>Thanks a lot to contributors @hpd, @kaiyou, @schwindp, @aaronraimist and @rht! Keep those PR's and ideas coming! You have been a great help!</p>
<p>Next features on the roadmap are &quot;Purge History API&quot;, regular matrix client calls support and login as a user. Help me prioritise features by raising an issue: https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm</p>
<p>Still, I am basically a one man show, and certainly any contributions are warmly welcomed! Even as a non-programmer you can help by keeping the implementation-status list up to date. If you find an admin API missing, please take a minute and use the integrated edit functionality github provides and add it to the list:  https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#implementation-status--commands-list. It helps contributors to quickly find out what feature they could code!</p>

<li>
<p>They used the word &quot;Anti-Datenkrake&quot; to describe how data is handled in the application, which basically is a metaphor for Famedly being the opposite of the usual corporations trying to pry their tentacles into everyones personal data.

<blockquote>
<p>This week in Matrix Construct added Application Services support. I've been using the Mautrix Telegram bridge on a daily basis, and it's been a pleasure to develop with. Expect more bridges to be tested in the coming weeks. I'll also be working on completing the documentation for how to setup a bridge in Construct. Just to give some insight: The server has the ability to manage all of your bridges as sub-processes. In any client, just create a room for your bridge and enter its configuration there. Voila! The bridge's console appears right in that room and can even highlight you about errors!</p>
<p>Join us at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> to learn more about bridges and lend a hand.</p>

<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We survived FOSDEM! Last week was relatively slower in Synapse land as we paused to catch our breath, but we do have news!</p>
<p>First, releases. Synapse 1.27.0rc2 is out now (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.27.0rc2/CHANGES.md#synapse-1270rc2-2021-02-11">changelog</a>), and we anticipate a full 1.27 release early next week. This is basically the branch that FOSDEM ran, so we think it's a good one.</p>
<p>Second, keeping with our biweekly development cadence, the first 1.28 release candidate is due out midweek next week, so keep your eyes peeled for that. Given FOSDEM, most of our recent focus has been on stability, bug fixes, and social login. We hope to <em>knock</em> your socks off with more ambitious features soon. üòâ</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We just landed basic support for edits. Which means edits are now applied to the original message instead of showing the fallback and you can edit your messages. You can also change a text message to a video (or the other way around) or change, who you replied to, but the latter fails to render in some clients properly, so be aware of that. Edits also send a secondary relation format, which makes handling edits easier, but I still haven't written up the MSC for that... The UI is not final yet and you can't show edit history yet, but apart from that it may or may not work fine.</p>
<p>There were also a lot of bugfixes like broken kerning in some cases, improved focus handling when clicking buttons in the timeline, Duplex devices should now work in calls, notifications now work on Haiku and a few more.</p>
<p>Now please stop asking for edits! :D</p>

<p>Earlier this week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.27.0rc1">Synapse 1.27.0rc1</a>, though the final release is currently blocked on resolving a regression in Synapse 1.26 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9264">#9264</a>) which could cause logins to fail if your <code>public_baseurl</code> was unset in your Synapse configuration. The workaround is to ensure that value is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/docs/sample_config.yaml#L70-L81">correctly set</a> for your deployment.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we're quite excited to get 1.27 out the door, as it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solves an issue (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9172">#9172</a>) where federation senders could take many minutes to catch up after restarts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contains countless improvements to our support for social login methods, many of which will be live for FOSDEM users this weekend.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also included the usual host of bug fixes and Admin API additions, but more on those when the actual release happens. You can preview the release notes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.27.0rc1">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My iMessage bridge is starting to be usable now. Text and files work in both directions and tapbacks and replies work iMessage-&gt;Matrix. Currently it only supports running on a Mac, the iOS option will come later. The bridge doesn't require opening ports to the Mac, it uses a simple proxy that turns the usual HTTP appservice transactions into a websocket instead.</p>
<p>The bridge itself can be found at https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-imessage and the websocket proxy is at https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-wsproxy. The Matrix room is <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#imessage:maunium.net">#imessage:maunium.net</a></p>

<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/">FOSDEM</a> is happening this weekend! Come see <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/matrix_gitter/">our FOSDEM talk</a> in the Real Time Communications track on Saturday around how we made Gitter speak Matrix and how you can add Matrix support to your own app: https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/matrix_gitter/</p>
<p>*--</p>
<p>We're also working on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> to support backfilling the massive archive of historical messages on Gitter over on Matrix. We're prototyping the MSC on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9247">Synapse</a> and have a suite of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement/pull/68">Complement tests</a> to verify that the homeserver implementation is working according to the specification.</p>
<p>The DAG visualization (made with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/tardis/pull/1">TARDIS</a>) shows that we're inserting messages <code>1</code>-<code>3</code> between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>:</p>

<p>Another release! Wow. We're also testing 0.24.0-rc1 which has quite a few big ticket items this week. Off the top of the list is a new command to <code>!plumb</code> rooms dynamically in admin rooms, provided you have permissions in the bridge (happy days self hosters!). We've also added the feature to warn if your messages don't get through in your admin room. Finally, there are a bunch of small bug fixes and one large one that should make the bridge <strong>much</strong> more resistant to netsplits, so that it should recover in a much safer way should it get hit by a ton of traffic. Please test, and if all goes well the formal release will be out next week!</p>

<p>I have been learning about matrix the last few months. The result of that is <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~f4814n/frost">frost</a> a very basic GUI matrix client written in Go using <a href="https://gioui.org">Gio</a> and a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~f4814n/matrix">CS library</a>. Highlights of the project so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Works on Linux, Windows, macOS and Android (although I only test on Linux and often break the other platforms)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should work on WASM and iOS with not too much effort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very, very limited E2EE support. (If the session is manually verified by other clients, events can be encrypted and decrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Library that handles storage, encryption and some other things with a opinionated but simple to use (I hope) interface.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We're also excited to <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/01/28/synapse-1-26-0-released">announce Synapse 1.26.0's release</a>! As mentioned last week, the two biggest new features are a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/docs/auth_chain_difference_algorithm.md">faster algorithm</a> for state resolution and initial support for enabling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9110">multiple OpenID Connect providers</a>. Additionally, we've sped up redaction in large rooms and made it possible to run more APIs on workers. See the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.26.0/CHANGES.md">full changelog</a> for details.</p>
<p>We expect to publish a release candidate for 1.27.0 early next week, but we're trying to be conservative about large changes ahead of FOSDEM, so knocking ‚Äî which <em>is</em> coming! ‚Äî will have to wait until 1.28.0... üö™</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks! It's been a while since we've had an update but things are always manic at bridge HQ. This release is a bit of a whopper containing quite a few bugfixes (including improvements to the experimental encrypted bridge support). We've also updated to Typescript 4.1 which is a bit stricter on those promise return types. Finally, you can now create intents on the bridge and use it's components without starting the HTTP listener which has been a longstanding issue for as long as I've been maintaining.</p>
<p>So go out there and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/v2.5.0-rc1">test this release</a>, all going well we should üö¢ early next week!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Then, later...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apart from the current releases, we have a few things cooking right now:</p>
<h4 id="edits">Edits</h4>
<p>Yes, I have tried to avoid them for long, but <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/pull/420">I am finally working on it</a>. It's a bit different to how Element and others do it, but it also generates a fallback to be compatible with the current MSCs where possible. I've grown a bit tired of having to explain myself everytime, why I did not want to support edits (yet), so I'm experimenting with a few solutions now. Expect a blog post summarizing those experiments in the future and maybe an MSC.</p>
<h4 id="polish">Polish</h4>
<p>Jedi18 and LorenDB are both busy polishing up the rough corners in Nheko, like finally being able to set your username and avatar in the UI as well as being able to copy text via right click, jdenticons and other fancy stuff. We also had a few contributions in the last release, which should improve the UX a lot.</p>
<h4 id="gsoc">GSoC</h4>
<p>Furthermore we will be participating in GSoC (if matrix.org gets accepted) and will probably mentor a student, that implements a few of the smaller features, which users may be missing after using Element for long.</p>
<p>I think that is all I wanted to share. I hope you enjoy the release and if you have any issues or feature requests, tell us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> or open an issue on Github!</p>

<h3 id="quaternion">Quaternion</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the project is already fairly rich in features, I decided that it's timely (some would say - way overdue) to bump up the version a bit. In that light, the next Quaternion beta is numbered 0.0.95 beta 3 (no four-number version any more) and it's out now! <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.95-beta3">Release notes</a> list notable changes since (0.0.9.5) beta 2, with two most significant being ability to enter messages in Markdown and the overhauled timeline that allows you to easily discern between already read and yet unread messages and also quickly scroll to the read marker.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Social Login</p>

<li>Final polishing and bug hunting across all platforms. We are targeting 5 options to begin with (Gitlab, Github, Facebook, Google and Apple) and will hopefully be ready to start setting these up on homeservers next week. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spaces</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of polishing on Element web, you can get all the latest in the matrix live demo session next week!</li>

<p><strong>VoIP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added some debugging to web to help debug call connectivity failures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a compatibility regression in web with voip v0 clients (ie. element android / ios) - d‚Äôoh!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Android: work on getting call audio routing correct on various different devices</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Off cycle 1.7.18 release for VoIP compat bug</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various tweaks to prepare for FOSDEM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Element Web 1.7.19-rc.1 is now available at https://staging.element.io, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allowed guest users to see widgets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standardised security terminology to reduce confusion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added ability to pin widgets for everyone in the room</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We made several iterations since the last App Store release (1.1.3) but Element-iOS <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/releases">1.1.6</a> is now in the store. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We made some improvements to use less RAM in the background sync module that manages push notifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We continued to improve performance in E2EE to speed up message sending using pre-sharing keys and re-sharing keys methods. Element-iOS now automatically rejects share requests from not verified devices. It does not send anymore such requests if it is not verified.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are working on improving the initial /sync management. The first objective is to reduce RAM usage. Then, we will improve the time to display the room list.</li>

<p>Google Summer of Code has come around again! Last year was really successful for Matrix: six projects, with members of the community coming forward to mentor students for their project. This year there is a slight tweak to the formula: <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/10/google-summer-of-code-2021-is-bringing.html">the projects will now be 175 hours, rather than the traditional 350, over the summer</a>.</p>
<p>Since we need to <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline">submit an application to Google within the next few weeks</a>, I have a request: if you admin a Matrix-related Open Source project and would like to have a student work with you over the summer, get involved!</p>
<p>How to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources">Google's own documentation</a> on the setup. This is fairly thorough, and should get you most of the way there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about a task, that you consider a student should be able to contribute to your project over a 10-week/175-hour period. Try to come up with 2-3 of these.</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be a well-defined feature that genuinely contributes to the progress of your project, but maybe doesn't block other work on the critical path.</li>
<li>This is a very important step, and one that may need some time and discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>DM me (@benpa:bpulse.org) and we'll talk about next steps.</p>

<p>Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of this week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.6">Dendrite 0.3.6</a>, which included a number of refactors in the sync API and a selection of fixes. It is also the first version to be released with multi-arch Docker images with ARMv7/ARM64 targets.</p>
<p>Since then, the following changes have been merged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sync filtering support for event types, senders as well as better-supported limits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation support for MSC2946 (Spaces Summary)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug where large well-known files could consume a lot of memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for in-process DNS caching for federation traffic (although it is disabled by default)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some preparatory work for tracking the most recent membership states in the sync API for future history visibility work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 60%, up from 58% last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>

<p>Otherwise, once 1.26.0 is released you can look forward to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.26.0/docs/auth_chain_difference_algorithm.md">a new algorithm</a> for calculating auth chain difference in v2 State Resolution which should significantly speed up some of the most expensive state resolution calculations (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622">#8622</a>).</p>
<p>We've also dramatically improved the performance of redactions in large rooms, helping Synapse's moderation tools scale to communities of any size (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9022">#9022</a>). And speaking of scaling, Synapse 1.26 makes it possible to offload many different APIs to worker processes, including read receipts and account data persistence.</p>
<p>Lastly, Synapse 1.26 will include support for multiple Single Sign-On Identity providers, though we expect further fit-and-finish for that feature to land in 1.27.</p>

<p>It is a <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a> library.

For writing it provides methods to send messages, edit them, and send receipts and typing notifications.</p>

<h4 id="opsdroid-1">opsdroid</h4>
<p><a href="https://opsdroid.dev/">opsdroid</a> is an easy to use chat-ops framework with excellent Matrix support.</p>
<h4 id="0-20-release">0.20 Release</h4>
<p>This week opsdroid released version 0.20. This is a <em>massive</em> release that's been a long time coming because of a <strong>complete rewrite of the internals of the matrix connector to use <a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a></strong>---thanks to <a href="https://github.com/awesome-michael">@awesome-michael</a> for the initial work on this.</p>
<p>Having ported the connector to nio, our GSOC student <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tyagdit:matrix.org">@Tyagdit</a> got to work polishing the nio port and reimplementing the <strong>matrix database</strong> module in the core opsdroid library. Opsdroid has a concept of memory which is a key-value store which can be backed my many different kinds of <a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/">databases</a>. The <a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/matrix.html">matrix database</a> stores the opsdroid memory in room state, meaning your bot's database and messages are all stored in the same place.</p>
<p>Finally, the other big feature added to the matrix support in this release is <strong>End to End Encryption</strong> support. Thanks to using matrix-nio as our matrix library it was possible to implement support for encrypted matrix rooms. This also includes support in the matrix database for encrypted memory which works by referencing event ids in room state (<a href="https://docs.opsdroid.dev/en/stable/databases/matrix.html#encryption">see here</a> for more info). As this is the first release to support E2EE I would still consider it &quot;beta&quot;; please open issues if you have any trouble using it.</p>
<h4 id="highlights-1">Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>End to End Encryption support in the Matrix connector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matrix database now included in core, with e2ee support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of Python's install &quot;extras&quot; to allow for installations with fewer packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved documentation of the matrix connector and database (at least a little).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for Python 3.9 (and dropped support for 3.6).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>device-free login</strong> is now used when impersonating users (thanks to a new API introduced by Synapse v1.24.0) - this is both faster and more resilient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for <strong>Interactive Authentication</strong> (and thus, <strong>End-to-End-Encryption</strong>) has been added. Users can now set up E2EE keys, manage devices, etc. (actions that require Interactive Authentication and were previously broken). Requires cooperation between <code>matrix-corporal</code> and the <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-synapse-rest-password-provider">REST auth password provider module</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>End-to-End-Encryption control</strong>. matrix-corporal can enforce whether rooms that users create are encrypted or unencrypted. You can force-disable or force-enable encryption for locally-created rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fixes user-creation regression</strong> that happened with Synapse v1.24.0. matrix-corporal v1.12.0 is also out, with a backport of this fix (for users who don't want to jump to 2.0 yet).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It's not dead! yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's been some code refactoring on the <a href="https://github.com/anchor-logoot">algorithm</a>. Mainly, the search tree used has been split into a different package</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm working on porting the Notepad to the new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api">widget API</a>. Ongoing work is on the <a href="https://github.com/KB1RD/matrix-notepad/tree/nextgen">nextgen branch</a> and is tracked by <a href="https://github.com/KB1RD/matrix-notepad/projects/3">this</a> project. The widget is currently blocked on some stuff in the widget API, so I probably won't be releasing soon. The code in there needs a <em>ton</em> refactoring, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that the old notepad client will disappear on the next release and you'll need to add a widget for the Notepad for any documents that you want to edit. Currently, this means you would have to use Element, but I heard Ditto just might be doing some widget work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The widget API is planned to do everything and more that my &quot;mxapps&quot; project was supposed to do, so that project will be deprecated in favor of using the widget API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's also a little demo/teaser video showing the old notepad talking to the new one. You can see the rate limiting issues that the Notepad hits there, which is on my todo list.</p>

<h3 id="dendrite-gomatrixserverlib">Dendrite / gomatrixserverlib</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil Alexander</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week we released Dendrite 0.3.5, our first release of 2021, which includes a fairly significant refactor of parts of the sync API, along with other fixes. More work has since been merged into <code>master</code> too.</p>
<p>Changes in the last two weeks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sync streams are now logically separate, with a lot of behaviour fixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forward extremities are now deep-checked properly, which should significantly reduce the peaks of CPU and RAM when handling the current room state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pagination tokens in <code>/messages</code> have been fixed, which should improve the reliability of scrolling back in the timeline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of fixes have been made to the <code>/sync</code> response, largely avoiding <code>null</code>s, which should make some clients happier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send-to-device messaging has been refactored, which should improve E2EE stability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well-known/DNS records for federated servers are now cached rather than performing lots of lookups, speeding up outbound federation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Device list requests to remote servers now time out quicker, so as to not block <code>/send</code> transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental support for MSC2946 has been merged (gated behind the <code>mscs</code> configuration)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request context is no longer reused for <code>/send</code>, which should help in cases where the remote sending server gives up waiting or the connection breaks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, feel free to join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org">#dendrite:matrix.org</a> for general Dendrite chat or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite-dev:matrix.org">#dendrite-dev:matrix.org</a> for development discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you explain something: Dendrite federation is basically working fine, AIUI, what does it mean that <code>Server-server APIs</code> is &lt;100%?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">Neil</a> helpfully replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are still some edge-case tests that we haven't got passing yet, but I think that's only ~20 tests or so.<br />
There are also a few tests which are quite sensitive to exactly what Synapse does/returns, even though Dendrite is probably doing the right thing but maybe taking a different amount of time to do it or returning something slightly different, so there'll be some tests we need to fix too</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org">Eric Eastwood</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few improvements to the Gitter bridge this week so that when a room updates and the avatar or topic changes, it now propagates across to Matrix automatically. We also handle updating the name whenever we have to rename a room or a group.</p>
<p>We're also thinking about how best to tackle self-service plumbing so you can pipe a Gitter room into your existing Matrix room. And the bigger idea of connecting various bridged portal rooms together. So you can connect your community on Gitter &lt;-&gt; Matrix &lt;-&gt; IRC seamlessly for example. The current thinking is introducing this as a native Matrix concept so you can easily connect any Matrix room to another Matrix room. We'd love to hear your thoughts in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2923">MSC2923</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Version 2 of mx-puppet-groupme is here! This week I did some reverse engineering of the GroupMe Android app with mitmproxy so that I could work out the remaining undocumented features of GroupMe's API. As a result, typing notifications, read receipts, and videos are now working! Though note that due to limitations of the platform, read receipts are a DMs-only feature.</p>
<p>We also now have a Dockerfile (thanks, Trey B.!), double puppeting support was added, the code was ported to Typescript, and it should now work with older versions of Node. So at this point the bridge is basically feature-complete! As usual, send any questions, bugs, or feature requests to <a href="https://gitlab.com/robintown/mx-puppet-groupme">GitLab</a> or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#mx-puppet-groupme:townsendandsmith.ml">Matrix</a>. üíú</p>

<p>It's currently in the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook/tree/mobile">mobile</a> branch.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bugfixing for the next release is in progress, fixing various issues and instabilities introduced with the new features, but some smaller features also still made it in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is now a call invite screen more fitting for mobile devices, when you enable the &quot;Touchscreen mode&quot; in the settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various clickable elements now have a ripple effect again to give feedback, when a click was registered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nheko now handles the Matrix URI scheme. This means opening a link starting with <code>matrix:</code> should open Nheko (at least on Linux) and redirect to the appropriate room and matrix URIs inside of Nheko are also handled. This currently does not support navigating to a specific event, but opening user profiles, starting chats with specific users and opening or joining rooms should work. Nheko also does not automatically linkify links starting with <code>matrix:</code>, so you need to do that manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verification dialogs were cleaned up a bit and hopefully are easier to understand now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flatpak nightlies now support VOIP calls, but as a result are now a few MB more to download.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.6.4">Version 0.6.4 is out</a>, with a few fixes around homeserver resolution (particularly when a <code>.well-known</code> record is not there). These has been made in tight collaboration with the folks behind <a href="https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat">Neochat</a> - thanks a lot! 0.6.4 is also the best version to build the just-released Neochat 1.0.1 with.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, work on the next version (0.7) is proceeding in the unstable branch (not in the least pushed by Neochat activity) - expect more news in the next weeks.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@p-e-w:matrix.org">p-e-w</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PingPong measures transport latencies on Matrix networks. It connects to two Matrix accounts simultaneously, and bounces messages back and forth between them. It aggregates all information in an intuitive terminal user interface, and automatically computes statistics. Source code and more information are available at https://github.com/p-e-w/pingpong.</p>
<p>I have been working on this for a while now and I believe it is ready for others to use at this point. No binary releases yet, the program must be built from source. I only have a Linux development system currently, so feedback on whether it works on macOS and especially Windows is very welcome.</p>

<p>Very interesting new project! I'm thinking of setting this up as I'd planned to write something similar to track perf on bpulse.org.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A small update on what is happening after a long time of nothing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bot has first part of the registration process (essentially the required automated tests) implemented. Next is the manual verification half.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Domains are bought and the web page is deployed (No servers listed yet)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code of Conduct writing will start soonish.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you will see there are only empty categories. This is due to the registration bot still being in work as well as missing documentation for it.</p>
<p>For the progress you can also take a look at https://github.com/keymaker-mx/keymaker/projects/1</p>
