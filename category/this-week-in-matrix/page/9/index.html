<p>This week my guest is Element's Kat who conducted various Community Testing Sessions. If you want to learn more about it, why Kat is conducting them, and how you can help, have a look at it!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@denise.a:vector.modular.im">Denise</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: Europe is close to officially regulating big corporations and forcing them to open their silos via the Digital Markets Act. Element joined forces with other companies to make sure that the members of the European Commission about to vote on the regulation knew how important it is.</p>
<p>Matrix was created to break the silos, as an interoperable layer for all communications. We wanted to ensure people had the ability to choose where their data is stored, and had the choice of interface to access them. This was also a good way to enable better competition and innovation in the communication space, forcing the players to compete on value add. But whilst Matrix is already a 39M users open network in itself, it could be even better if the bigger silos decided to open up and participate into it.</p>
<p>In December last year, as part of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the European Commission proposed to update the competition law for digital markets with rules mandating ‚Äògatekeeping‚Äô platforms to open up, in order to enable innovation and data sovereignty. </p>
<p>This move is so aligned with Matrix and Element‚Äôs mission, that Element joined over twenty other organisations to launch the Coalition for Competitive Digital Markets on Tuesday the 26th. The coalition supports stronger rules for large online platforms in the DMA, calling for amendments to it to make sure that major services offer a public API to interact with their core services and to ban the pre-installation and default setting of core platform apps.</p>
<p>Matrix is a perfect example of how technology can thrive through openness and collaboration. We will bring our experiences of using federated and decentralised technologies to MEPs and Council members, in the hope for a regulatory framework which supports European innovation, competition and interoperability. </p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Matrix 1.1 is just around the corner! The team continues to work hard on getting the infrastructure surrounding the new release process set up, as well as reviewing MSCs, including the ones you can see above!</p>
<p>The current speculative release date is in <strong>about a week or two</strong>. Keep your eyes peeled!</p>
<h2 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h2>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3192">MSC3192: Batch state endpoint</a>!</p>
<p>This is one of those MSCs that will likely be sorely needed at some point in time, but currently hasn't gotten a lot of attention. I can think of all sorts of usecases for this (on top of the many that the MSC puts forwards). Go ahead and give it a read!

<h3 id="synapse">Synapse <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">‚Üó</a></h3>
<p>Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the weekend, one of the servers backing matrix.org suffered a hardware failure, leading to around half an hour of downtime as we failed over to another system. Remediating and monitoring that has been the focus of much of the Synapse team over the past week.</p>
<p>We also <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.46.0rc1">shipped a release candidate</a> for Synapse 1.46, due for formal release next week. Notably, we believe this solves a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11049">performance regression</a> which was introduced in Synapse 1.44. If you've been experiencing long hangs or other periods of unresponsiveness, please try upgrading to <code>1.46.0rc1</code> and let us know if it resolves your issues.</p>
<p>The Synapse team has also decided to aim for building a rough prototype of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775: Lazy loading over federation</a> by the end of the year, in hopes that this will pave the way to extremely fast joins of large rooms.</p>
<p>We're also continuing to work on static type checking in our projects: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/448">As of today</a>, Sydent passes <code>mypy --strict</code>! We hope to write about what we've learned in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's an addendum about Sydent. We can see the results of our efforts visually, thanks to mypy's reporting options. Two different metrics show increasing coverage since our typing efforts began in the summer. The grey strip shows the last fortnight's sprint in particular.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca">uhoreg</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the shortfalls facing XMPP users of the Bifr√∂st Matrix bridge is the lack of support for <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html">Message Archive Management (MAM)</a>, which allows XMPP users to retrieve messages sent when they are offline, when they come online next time. Sunday Nkwuda and Olatunji Ajayi, with help from Pirate Praveen, are planning on writing support for MAM in XMPP.js (the XMPP library that Bifrost uses), and then adding MAM support to Bifr√∂st. Since this requires some dedicated full-time effort, they are fundraising to support this project at https://opencollective.com/mam-plugin-for-xmppjs. Many thanks to the XMPP Standards Foundation for serving as fiscal host for the fundraising.</p>

<p>Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi">hifi</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Release v1.4.0 ü•≥</p>
<ul>
<li>Free form AUTOCMD after joining a channel, per channel</li>
<li>Automatic rejoin on invite or kick (invite enabled by default)</li>
<li>AVATAR network room command to set avatars for IRC users (admin only)</li>
<li>WHOIS room command for PMs, PART for channels</li>
<li>Add ROOM command in network room to run channel room commands safely</li>
<li>Move PLUMBCFG stuff under ROOM command</li>
</ul>
<p>A smaller release this time around which consists mostly of QoL stuff to make things a little easier. <a href="https://idlerpg.lolhosting.net/">IdleRPG</a> users can now rejoice and login to your character automatically with channel AUTOCMD when joining on reconnect as what's more important: running a bridge to engage in deep conversations or sit in a channel doing nothing?</p>
<p>Plumb users need to use the new generic ROOM command in network rooms to configure plumbs now that PLUMBCFG has been removed.</p>
<p>Go grab your fix from <a href="https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/">PyPI</a> or <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>!</p>

The talk will be at 15:30 CET/CDT (once for EMEA/APAC and once for Americas), Platform track. Advance registration is necessary. In fact, the talks are pre-recorded but both of us will be online during the session and shortly after so please come around to make sure The Qt Company gets the message and considers adding Quotient as another module to Qt (ok, that's just a dream for now but who knows...)</p>

<p>I work on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collabs/collabs">Collabs</a>, a library for making decentralized collaborative apps, and we have some demos that run on Matrix!  E.g., in a widget-capable client like Element, send the message:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>/addwidget https://compoventuals-tests.herokuapp.com/host.html?network=matrix&amp;container=demos/rich-text/dist/rich_text.html
</span></code></pre>
<p>to add a collaborative text editor widget.  (Fair warning: loading and saving is flaky, so don't type anything you can't afford to lose.)</p>
<p>All collaboration happens using messages sent to the Matrix room.  So, you're not dependent on any external service provider, and the document is end-to-end encrypted if your room is.</p>
<p>We have more demos <a href="https://compoventuals-tests.herokuapp.com/">here</a>, with instructions on how to use them in a widget.  You can follow those same instructions to run your own Collabs apps (<a href="https://github.com/composablesys/collabs/blob/master/collabs/docs/getting_started_guide.md">Getting Started Guide</a>), without needing to host any servers yourself!</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Collabs and see an app running on Matrix, check out my Strange Loop talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exr0iY_D-vw&amp;t=3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exr0iY_D-vw&amp;t=3s</a>.  The library is in an alpha state and not yet ready for production use, but we'll be improving it steadily over the next year.

<p>In FediJam feedback we were asked to explore federated gaming.
So, for my <a href="https://itch.io/jam/fedijam-3">third FediJam</a> I made a dead-simple prototype of a game using Matrix not for chat, but for multiplayer.</p>
<p>Behold, the <a href="https://houkime.itch.io/federated-triangle-of-doom">Federated Triangle of Doom</a>.
Game creates a chat. Any message with 'boom' posted into there spawns the Red Triangle of malice.
Yes, literally just it.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, it uses <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a>, with <a href="https://github.com/touilleMan/godot-python">godot-python</a> to make it python-capable.
To connect via Matrix, it leverages <a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a> python module.<br />
As a server, any Matrix server without captcha/email for registration will do!<br />

<h3 id="sync-v3">Sync v3</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org">kegan</a> shared very exciting news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on a brand new <code>/sync</code> mechanism, dubbed sync v3, for the past few months. This is a complete overhaul of how clients live-stream sync data from homeservers, and fixes numerous pain points with <code>/sync</code> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syncs taking minutes to complete.</li>
<li>Syncs sending back vast quantities of data (e.g read receipts for every room you're in).</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, this new API is designed around the idea of having dynamic sliding windows around a sorted room list for a user's account. The room list can be sorted in different ways and <em>only rooms in the window are returned to the client</em>. The room list can also be filtered down based on various criteria (e.g only rooms in these spaces, with events newer than this timestamp, etc) and a subset of current room state can be requested with each returned room.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>
</span><span>         All joined rooms on user&#39;s account
</span><span>Q W E R T Y U I O P L K J H G F D S A Z X C V B N M
</span><span>
</span><span>\                                                 /
</span><span> \                                               /
</span><span>
</span><span>  \      Subset of rooms matched by filters     /
</span><span>   Q W E R T Y U I O P L K J H G F D S A Z X C V
</span><span>
</span><span>                       |
</span><span>   A C D E F G H I J K L O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z     Rooms sorted by_name (or by_recency, etc)
</span><span>
</span><span>   |_______|
</span><span>       |
</span><span>
</span><span>   A C D E F                                         first 5 rooms requested
</span></code></pre>
<p>This list is kept sorted on the server and deltas are communicated to the client as a series of delta operations (e.g INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE). Multiple non-overlapping windows can be requested and the windows can also change their size dynamically.</p>
<p>This work is still currently in the pre-MSC stage as it's a huge undertaking, but an early, runnable, implementation lives at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sync-v3">sync-v3</a> repo. This works by setting up a proxy sync server which will make <code>/sync</code> requests to a target homeserver, and storing the data in a useful form for sync v3 queries. It then exposes the sync v3 API which can then actually show you real data from your account.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span> +---------+                     +--------------+                                 +----------------+
</span><span>
</span><span> | sync v3 | &lt;-- sync v3 API --&gt; |   sync v3    | &lt;--- normal /sync requests ---&gt; | Any Homeserver |
</span><span> | client  |                     | proxy server |                                 |      Impl      |
</span><span>
</span><span> +---------+                     +--------------+                                 +----------------+
</span></code></pre>
<p>The proxy server also hosts a barebones web client which talks sync v3 at http://localhost:8008/client/ - to get started just point the proxy server to any HS and then paste in your access token to the web client. The web client is <strong>just a test jig</strong> so only has a <em>read-only</em> view of your account and lacks any scrollback, only showing live data. IMPORTANT: generate a new access token before using this client. Do NOT use the token from an existing client (e.g Element web) or else you risk being unable to decrypt E2EE messages.</p>
<p>Intrepid people are encouraged to run a server and see how fast sync on their own account could possibly be in the future. Note that the <em>first</em> sync will be slow as it has to fetch all the user's data via v2 <code>/sync</code>.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/20/synapse-1-45-1-released">released Synapse 1.45</a> this week!</p>
<p>This is the first release to support oEmbed autodiscovery, leading to richer link previews for many sites. See the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/20/synapse-1-45-1-released">release announcement</a> for an example.</p>
<p>We also believe that we've <em>finally</em> fixed stuck messages! A <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9424">race condition</a> would occasionally prevent your sent events from syncing back  down to all of your clients. This caused messages to look like they were stuck at the bottom of the room, waiting to finish sending, even though other users would receive and see them normally.</p>
<p>Please shout loudly in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9424">this GitHub issue</a> if you see a stuck message on a server running 1.45 or later. üòâ</p>
<p>We've merged a further 9 pull requests to Sydent, making even more modules pass mypy --strict. We're not quite <em>all</em> the way there, but we're close! Most of the &quot;leaf&quot; modules are done, with the bulk of the remaining work to be done is on <code>sydent.http</code>. This is trickier because it's more exposed to the machinery of Twisted, but we'll get there.</p>
<p>We're already much more confident working in Sydent, and hope to apply these lessons to Synapse soon.</p>
<p>(Well, one lesson that won't apply is that type hints are <em>especially</em> valuable in codebases you don't touch as often... but we have no intention of slowing down on Synapse any time soon!)</p>

<p>Big ticket items this time around for privacy concerned users are connectivity improvements when using Tor/VPN with built-in SOCKS proxy support and CertFP authentication. Some WHOIS and CTCP has also been thrown in the mix for good measure!</p>
<p>Lately there has been quite a lot of people who are testing Dendrite or Conduit which has led to recurring support issues around some limitations they currently have with appservices. Heisenbridge now supports using and generating a &quot;compatible&quot; registration file (<code>--generate-compat</code>) for them that shouldn't be needed in the long run. I hope to drop this feature as soon as possible! üçª</p>
<p>While Heisenbridge somewhat intentionally has very little documentation due to not having a refined UX yet the README has been updated with some frequently asked questions about installing and configuring it to the point you can talk with the appservice bot. A self-contained docker-compose setup has also been added to the repository to help testing it without installing anything on your system.</p>

<p>Last Saturday we had an improvised NeoChat mini development sprint in a small hotel room in Berlin in the occasion of the 25th anniversary of KDE. In a good KDE tradition, Carl spent this time on improving NeoChat settings. He ported both the NeoChat general settings and the specific room settings to the new Kirigami.CategorizedSetting component. Tobias fixed a lot of papercuts and now the power level should be fetched correctly, we show the number of joined users instead of joined+invited users in the room information pane, the user search is now case insensitive. Nicolas focused on fixing our Android build by making the spellchecking feature compile on Android.</p>
<p>Aside from the mini-sprint, we also made a few more improvements during the week. Tobias fixed the flicking of the timeline on mobile and Carl made it possible for the user to resize the room information drawer.</p>

<p>Thulinma added device management to Nheko. You can now also view your devices, that don't support encryption, delete devices, rename them and see their ip address. Additionally there were a few refactorings and code improvements. Most notably blurhashes should now decode twice as fast. Additionally there were a few small fixes to displaying hidden space rooms (we were checking the wrong power level, so in some cases fewer rooms got shown in a space, if they only had a parent set). That's all, was a busy week with lots of lasers!</p>

<p>a small, weird tool that just works.</p>
<p>Hey, TWIM. Did you ever face a situation where you need to run any command prefixed with <code>time command-name</code> and get a ping in matrix room when it's done? No? Well, doesn't matter, now you can do that with one small command!</p>
<p>That thing called <a href="https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/ttm">time-to-matrix (binary name: ttm)</a> it works like <code>time command-name</code> and sends results to matrix room. Yes, pretty simple. Now you can use it üòÄ</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Element One is here! We‚Äôre giving TWIM a sneak preview of the new Matrix hosting service from Element in advance of the official launch next week. Element One* is a consumer-focused hosting option which gives you an individual Matrix account on our shiny new one.ems.host homeserver (with a matching Element Web at one.element.io). However, in addition to being a fast, snappy Matrix account, it also comes with unlimited personal bridging to Whatsapp, Signal and Telegram thanks to mautrix-whatsapp/signal/telegram!</p>
<p>Hopefully this is good news for those of you who have chats with friends and family on these other platforms, as you can now chat with them in one place from Element without having to mess around having to run your own bridge - and accounts cost just $5 per month.</p>
<p>Right now this is a (relatively) private / limited beta intended for the TWIM and EMS inner circle, and we'll be announcing more generally in the next few days / weeks. So, if you are interested, please check it out and sign up at https://ems.element.io/element-one :)</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>The actual spec changes for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2844">MSC2844: Global version number for the whole spec</a> have now been merged [<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3420">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3421">two</a>]. You can take a look at <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/#specification-versions">this section</a> of the unstable spec to now see an explanation of the Matrix spec version numbering scheme.</p>
<p>Additionally, take a look at the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/client-server-api/#rooms-1">Client-Server API</a>, where all current APIs have been bumped from <code>/r0/...</code> to <code>/v3/...</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/old_master/proposals/2844-global-versioning.md#endpoint-versioning">this bit of MSC2844</a> for the rationale behind this change.</p>
<p>The pieces are starting to fall into place for the upcoming Matrix 1.1 spec release!</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1840">MSC1840: Typed rooms</a>!</p>
<p>This is a concept that was used in the Spaces MSCs to allow servers and clients to denote a room as a Space vs. a typical Matrix room (and set up their UI appropriately). Only the type for a Space has been specified so far, but there are many different applications room types could serve; for example profile rooms!</p>
<p>This MSC aims to create a general concept for a typed room, whereas future MSCs would identify those types and their meaning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy Friday! The Synapse team has been sorting out what we hope to accomplish before the end of the year, and it's looking like our main focus will remain research and experimentation towards making large room joins go very fast. We don't yet see an incremental path from where we are now to where we want to end up, so progress will likely come as a few discrete milestones, rather than a gradual acceleration over time.</p>
<p>Aside from room joins, we expect to spend a good bit of time time on bug fixes and preventative maintenance. For example, we hope to get Sydent passing <code>mypy --strict</code> by this time next week. Doing so would have prevented recent production issues, including one which caused phone number verification to silently fail.</p>
<p>Preparations for releasing 1.45.0 continue apace; I'm loking forward to telling you about it next week!</p>

<p>Making steps towards stable E2EE, we have now implemented bootstrapping cross-signing on a new account. This allowed me to finally enable cross-signing on my Nico (nheko.im) account (which I intended to only use with Nheko). Thulinma also added a way to refresh the current device list as well as highlighting your current device in the device list, which should make it easier to recover, if a misscommunitcation with the server lead to an outdated device list. Meanwhile LorenDB has been plugging away on converting more dialogs to Qml and we merged like 3 converted dialogs!</p>

<li>On iOS, we‚Äôve been implementing support for pagination of the Space Summary API, to support larger spaces, as well as improving performance. We‚Äôve also started implementing support for creating Spaces.</li>
<li>We‚Äôre also exploring larger changes to make to the layouts of Element on all platforms to surface simpler and more intuitive navigation all round and tackle some of the feedback we couldn‚Äôt get to during the Spaces beta. Watch this space!</li>

<p>Can you believe we didn‚Äôt have a dept. of Widgets yet? We do now!</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks! This week I took a bit of time out of my day to create a new widget for Matrix. We have the concept of &quot;Spanners&quot; at Matrix where one person wants to take control of a resource, and they will say &quot;I am taking the spanner&quot;. This prevents other people (verbally at least) from trying to use the resource at the same time.</p>
<p>For years we have been getting by with sending messages into Matrix, but no more! For now anyone can use the Spanner widget to set up a similar system in their room.</p>
<p>You can try this out now with <code>/addwidget https://half-shot.uk/spanner?spannerName=YourSpannerName</code> (although no promises about the uptime of half-shot.uk)</p>
<p>The repo can be found https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-spanner-widget.</p>
<p>You will need to ensure that all users who plan to use it must be able to send state events of type <code>uk.half-shot.spanner</code>. Otherwise, it should be ready to go!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rager is a CLI tool for matrix client developers to easily view and parse rageshake logs. It handles syncing (with many parameters to sync only the logs you want), searching through downloaded logs, and paging through any log on your device (with peudo-syntax highlighting to make it easier to understand), right from the comfort of your terminal. It has been in development for a few months (being used/tested by devs at <a href="https://www.beeper.com">beeper.com</a>) but I feel like it's now in a good enough state to release for everyone else to use. If it's something that may help you, try it out and let me know if it works for you!</p>

<p>This week, I had the great pleasure of chatting with a lovely bunch from Element about Spaces. <a href="https://element.io/blog/spaces-blast-out-of-beta/">This feature just got out of beta</a> and they tell us all about it.</p>
<h2 id="dept-of-spec-scroll">Dept of Spec üìú</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello TWIM, it's me, not-anoa, again with your weekly spec update. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to figure out how to run the tooling which generates fancy graphs, but it looks like you'll have a more qualified person next week üòá</p>
<p>This week we saw a couple new MSCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419">MSC3419</a> - Letting guests do more things (which is needed for things like full mesh conference calling)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3429">MSC3429</a> - A room preview API. Turns out this is more or less a duplicate of another MSC, but has a different approach. Be sure to check both out üôÇ</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We've also been making progress on trying to get the spec release out by formally specifying all the new global version numbering and new endpoint versioning (see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3420">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3421">this</a>), and have been <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3432">experimenting</a> with how room versions are represented by the spec.</p>
<p>From page 6 of the open MSCs there's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2723">MSC2723</a>. The MSC is relatively small, but solves a fairly important problem with forwarded messages in Matrix: where were they forwarded from? From a glance, it has minor technical feedback and could do with an implementation (psst: client authors, this should be easy and fit well into a North American Long Weekend project üòá).</p>
<p>That's all I have for you today, but if I've missed something: sorry, and you should be in capable hands next week.</p>

<p>This week I have completely rewritten the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone">Pinecone</a> router with the aim of improving code quality and boosting performance. It now uses significantly less resources, making it much easier to simulate larger networks and using less battery power on mobile devices.</p>
<p>While there is still some work to be done to ensure the Pinecone network gracefully handles large-scale mobility events, protocol development is slowly progressing and we will soon be looking at how Matrix federation can be made more efficient by using routing intelligence from the overlay network.</p>
<p>If you have a passion for routing protocols and/or peer-to-peer systems, we're looking to hire engineers to work in the P2P Matrix space ‚Äî get in touch by <a href="mailto:elementio@jobs.workablemail.com">emailing your resume to us</a>!</p>

<p>We <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/10/05/synapse-1-44-0-released">released Synapse 1.44</a> this week! The release was mainly focused on bug fixes and internal cleanups. In particular, we've made significant strides toward enforcing static type annotations across several more Synapse modules, we continue to remove &quot;magic&quot; code from our configuration handler, and we've landed significant refactors to both the user directory and federated event authentication. These changes pay off significant technical debt, reduce Synapse's maintenance cost, and ease future bug fixes.</p>
<p>But that's not all. This release also includes performance improvements around JSON serialization, new capabilities for extension modules, and better metrics around cache evictions.

<p>Both the Web/Desktop and the Android variant have received a couple of new features during the last weeks, so it's time again to share some of the highlights with you!</p>
<h4 id="web-desktop">Web/Desktop</h4>
<p>The Web/Desktop variant has received plenty of love for the last few weeks, so best to list some of the bigger changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added a setting for the room list style: you can now choose between &quot;roomy&quot; with big avatars and two-line previews, &quot;intermediate&quot; for a smaller avatar and a single line preview, or &quot;compact&quot; to get a tiny avatar and the room preview in the same line of the room name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a setting how to color usernames in the chat: either uniform, based on the MXID, or based on the user's power level (Android has this feature for some time already, too!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a setting to not open automatically the most recent chat when switching spaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved theme settings: you can now choose custom themes independently for both light and dark mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workaround for switching between light and dark mode together with the system on Linux</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>macOS builds are now signed</p>

<li>
<p>... and many more (read the release announcements on <a href="https://github.com/SchildiChat/schildichat-desktop/releases">GitHub</a> or join our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#schildichat-web-announcements:matrix.org">announcement room (#schildichat-web-announcements:matrix.org)</a> to stay informed)</p>

<p>This week has seen two maintenance releases of libQuotient - just after 0.6.10 went out, fixing an issue with invites not showing up, another issue with URLs that have unescaped double-hashes (coincidentally, matrix.to URLs to some IRC channels are exactly those). Those URLs are not quite following the RFC but are accepted widely enough to warrant a fix, and a new release. Get 0.6.11 from <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.6.11">here</a> (or better, just checkout the respective Git tag).</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I posted about the <a href="https://sr.ht/~sumner/standupbot">standupbot</a> that I wrote to help assist with creating and sending standup posts to a room. I'm excited to announce today that you can choose to interact with the standupbot using threads! Instead of asking you about each part of the standup post individually, it creates threads for each of the parts that you can fill in. Your replies get added to the standup post like before, but it's a bit more interactive of a process. Here's a picture of how it looks (ignore all the display bugs due to Element).</p>

<h4 id="an-unofficial-matrix-server-for-the-newgrounds-community">An (unofficial) Matrix server for the Newgrounds community.</h4>
<p>Since I was pressed for time last week, I didn't go much in depth on how this server works. Here is a brief overview of its components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>https://app.ngmvs.one: A self-hosted Element Web with some theming tweaks, and the easiest way to visit the server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>https://matrix.ngmvs.one: the homeserver itself (Synapse). It has open registration, but only for <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/supporter">Newgrounds Supporters</a> (ie. patrons) via SSO logins with Newgrounds accounts. But Newgrounds doesn't have its own &quot;Log in with Newgrounds&quot; capability, so that leads me to the next component:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs/ng-saml-idp">ng-saml-idp</a>: middleware built on <a href="https://pysaml2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PySAML2</a> for using Newgrounds logins as a SAML2 Identity Provider. The code is tailored for my Synapse installation, but it can easily be tweaked to allow Newgrounds SSO logins to any SAML2-compatible service!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs/wbot">W-Bot</a>: a Matrix appservice/bot built on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-python">mautrix-python</a> that serves two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Creates Matrix rooms for Newgrounds movie/game submission pages (ie. maps <code>#portal_view_&lt;ID&gt;:ngmvs.one</code> to <code>https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/&lt;ID&gt;</code>), and adds a widget containing the submission itself to these rooms (but only if it's a movie--widgets for games will only have a link)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restricts membership of any room it moderates to logged-in Newgrounds Supporters. Users without a :ngmvs.one account can authenticate to the bot via the &quot;login&quot; bot command, which lets them log into their Newgrounds account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Point 2 also means that anyone on the Matrix network can make a room that's restricted to Newgrounds Supporters. Just make sure the bot has a high enough power level to kick users!</p>
<p>Public (and federation-accessible) instance is at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@w-bot:ngmvs.one">@w-bot:ngmvs.one</a>.</p>
<p>(PS: The &quot;W&quot; stands for &quot;double&quot;--because of its job of &quot;copying&quot; rooms into Matrix.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/newgrounds-mvsx/">MVSX</a>: a Firefox extension that, when visiting a Newgrounds movie/game submission page, puts a button in the URL bar that sends you to the Matrix room created for that submission by W-Bot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This week's updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>W-Bot now has the <code>inviteme</code> command to invite the issuing user to the invite-only space room for logged-in Newgrounds Supporters. (Users should be invited there automatically, but this command is for people who leave / reject invites to that space &amp; want to re-join it later.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MVSX extension has been updated to allow joining rooms with Matrix clients other than <a href="https://app.ngmvs.one/">app.ngmvs.one</a>. Right-clicking the URL bar icon now shows a drop-down list of alternative clients, and lets you set which one to use by default (on left-clicks of the icon).</p>

<p>Hi everyone! Did you ever feel lost in the Matrix world? The room directory is big, but it's still hard to find something you like. Or are you a room moderator, but there is not much activity in your room because it doesn't have enough users?</p>
<p>This is why I want to share rooms (or spaces) I find interesting.</p>

So, I created a Matrix Space for all things retro computing and gaming, hoping there might be enough like-minded people on Matrix to build a community. There should hopefully be rooms for everything now, although a few are still missing room icons - that will come over the next days.

<h3 id="the-spec">The Spec</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! It is not-anoa here with the spec update this week, which unfortunately means no pretty graph of MSCs (sorry). I do however have some curated updates to the spec for you:</p>
<p>This week we saw a couple new MSCs get opened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3417">WIP: MSC3417: Call room room type</a> from SimonBrandner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3414">WIP: MSC3414: Encrypted state events</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Though WIP, both are exciting steps towards much larger goals - looking forward to see how they progress! We also saw FCP finish on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC3231: Token authenticated registration</a>, part of Callum's <a href="https://calcuode.com/matrix-gsoc/">GSOC project</a> this summer - congratulations! <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a> also finished FCP this week, making it a good time for clients to consider that access tokens might expire or appear in a different format in upcoming versions of the spec. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2582">MSC2582: Remove mimetype from EncryptedFile object</a> was also merged to the spec - thanks Sorunome for finding the duplicated field which was duplicated!</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the Spec Core Team (SCT) has been thinking about how we can release the spec as we've been talking about doing so for months. We're declaring a bit of a freeze on new things entering the spec for the time being, but that doesn't stop MSCs from completing FCP or being opened - they just might miss the v1.1 cut (sorry). Most of the work needed to release is deployment stuff rather than Matrix stuff, so the hope is is we can get it all worked out soon.</p>
<p>I don't have the random MSC script on hand, but I do have access to the MSC list and found <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">WIP: MSC3030: Jump to date API endpoint</a>. It's listed as work in progress, but is one of the MSCs I personally look forward to being accepted in time!</p>
<p>That's all for spec this week. I'm not sure about next week, but you might be stuck with me again. Maybe I can find those fancy graph tools in time...</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey folks, it's been a while since we released changes to the Slack bridge but here we are on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases/tag/1.9.0-rc1">our next RC</a>. This one includes a few new things, most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The bridge now automatically invites users to private rooms if there is a message and they are not joined. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/613">#613</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update bridge to matrix-appservice-bridge 3.1.0 (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/614">#614</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, a PSA: If you were struggling to bridge your rooms to matrix while using the matrix.org bridge, this should now be fixed. An update made to the Slack APIs silently broke the oauth flow, which has since been fixed. This was a misconfiguration-gone-unnoticed in our Slack app configuration, so self hosters don't need to upgrade. The details are in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues/617#issuecomment-932047990</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I am a bit busy at the moment, Nheko is getting a lot of valuable smaller contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Updated the emoji pickers to Unicode 14, so that you can properly troll people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pasting images should now work properly again on Windows and macOS, including pasting SVGs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The help and version command line parameters now work properly, even if an instance of Nheko is already running.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There has also been a lot of progress on the translations! We just cracked 50% translated, but since that includes a lot of languages with only a few percent, this is actually much more than it sounds! We actually have 8 languages with over 90% translations now. If you speak one of the languages at 70% or so, any help translating the remaining bits is very much appreciated. You can easily translate without an account here: https://weblate.nheko.im/projects/nheko/nheko-master/#translations If you want to translate without having to rely on the upvote mechanism, feel free to ask for translation permissions directly in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a>. That is also the right room to ask questions about the translation process or translations themselves.</p>
<p>Nheko is also participating at Hacktoberfest this year. Translations done using the webinterface won't get counted for that though, you would need to submit a pull request manually for that. If you always felt like contributing to Nheko would be fun, but you had no reason to, now you can do it to let someone plant a tree for you (or get a T-shirt)!</p>
<p>That's all, I need to get back on my train!</p>

<h3 id="hydrogen">Hydrogen</h3>
<p>A minimal Matrix chat client, focused on performance, offline functionality, and broad browser support. https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org">Bruno</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hydrogen saw a few bug fixes (<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.14">0.2.14</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.15">0.2.15</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.16">0.2.16</a>) this week again, and also gained the possibility to recover from low-storage scenarios where the browser would clear indexedDB.</p>
<p>One of the bugs fixed might have caused a timeline corruption, so when you get the 0.2.16 update the history cache will be cleared and you'll notice a bit of delay as you do an initial sync again.</p>
<p>Aside from working on Hydrogen as a standalone app, I'm also making it easier to embedded in other projects. More info to come on that!</p>
<p>We've also had a priority planning this week, which spawned an updated backlog. <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/projects/1">Have a look</a> if you're interested what can be expected next (although be aware that the backlog has proven volatile in the past üôÇ).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After 4 years, <a href="https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-email-bot">matrix-email-bot</a> finally got an update. Now at v2, the bot has been rewritten using TypeScript and matrix-bot-sdk (farewell, js-sdk from 2017). It still requires manual setup and the behaviour overall should be the same as before, though the amount of testing is somewhat minimal - please complain in #email:t2bot.io if something goes wrong. </p>
<p>The bot also now supports encrypted rooms out of the box, including on the t2bot.io instance. Check out <a href="https://t2bot.io/emailbot/">t2bot.io/emailbot</a> for information on how to get the bot set up in your room.</p>
<p>The full changelog is available on the repo: https://github.com/t2bot/matrix-email-bot/releases/tag/v2.0.0</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An (unofficial) Matrix server by and for the <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a> community.</p>
<p>This is a Matrix server with membership restricted to <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/supporter">Newgrounds Supporters</a>. Newgrounds is an independent arts &amp; entertainment site that has been around for over 20 years, and I felt that its spirit of independence is a perfect match with the openness of Matrix!</p>
<p>The most notable feature of the server is <em>comment rooms for Newgrounds submissions</em>. Unlike other content-sharing sites, Newgrounds submissions don't have comment sections, but <em>review</em> sections, which let you post a single comment (and optional rating) for a submission. This encourages reviews to be focused on providing constructive feedback instead of being a place for off-topic discussions. With that said, open comment systems are nice too, so this Matrix server provides it! Simply visit <code>#portal_view_SUBMISSION_ID:ngmvs.one</code> to view!</p>
<p>These comment rooms are world-visible, but (at least for the time being) only Newgrounds Supporters may join these rooms &amp; post comments in them.</p>
<p>To help along with this, I made a Firefox extension to make joining these rooms a breeze: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/newgrounds-mvsx/">NG MVSX</a>. Simply view a Newgrounds submission page, and click on the icon that appears in your URL bar!</p>
<p>Code for all components is open-sourced on <a href="https://gitlab.com/ngmvs">GitLab</a>.</p>
<p>This is all very new, so things might break! If they do, tell me in <code>#ngmvs-public-discussion:ngmvs.one</code></p>

<h3 id="the-latest-in-appservice-proposals-synthetic-events">The latest in appservice proposals: Synthetic events</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, I've been let loose on more spec things: This time I'm looking at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">synthetic events</a>. The goal with this proposal is to give appservices more visibility over the innards and actions of a homeserver. When a user registers, we want an appservice to know (perhaps to send them a little greeting, or to provision some resources) or perhaps you want to clear up bridge resources when the user deactivates their account.</p>
<p>The hope with this proposal is that it's going to set the foundations for services to be able to hook into and provide richer functionality based upon user actions outside of rooms. It might sound a little dry right now, but eventually I'm hoping this can be extended in lots of ways and potentially do away with per-implementation modules, instead writing services that work with all homeservers.</p>
<p>Please give the proposal some love/feedback :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When asked if that was a specification change he drafted because of limitations faced when trying to implement a bridge, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, so it's something I've been plotting for a while, but internally we wanted the ability to &quot;act&quot; based upon signups to a homeserver i.e. sending a welcome. In the past this has been implemented client-side in Element, but that has obvious caveats.</p>
<p>The traditional response has usually been to write a Synapse module, but I wanted to do something that could be used on other homeserver implementations and also not have to have it co-located with the homeserver, so the natural home for this kind of logic was appservices. </p>
<p>There are other things there too like logouts / deactivations which are good for erasing data on a service too. Generally I'm hoping it can be extended further once it's stable, for other use cases too</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3401">MSC3401</a> (Native Group Voip Signalling) has been receiving positive feedback over the course of the week. The MSC spells out how one would go about implementing native, decentralised group voice and video calls over Matrix without the need for a third-party service. This is the next step forward after the full-mesh group signalling work, as demoed in previous editions of TWIM, lands. Quite exciting stuff!</p>
<p>Otherwise there was another Spec Core Team retro this week. Discussion focused mainly on how to handle event types that not every implementation using Matrix may need (think pinned messages and how that might not be very useful for IoT networks...). Watch this space!</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2666">MSC2666: Get rooms in common with another user</a>!</p>
<p>This is actually already implemented and enabled by default in Synapse, believe it or not. But no clients have support for it yet (there is an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/4897">outstanding matrix-react-sdk PR</a>...).</p>
<p>This is a pretty cool feature in my opinion, any client want to be the first?</p>

<p>This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/09/21/synapse-1-43-0-released">released Synapse 1.43</a>! This mainly contains internal changes, including those in preparation for Spaces leaving beta, but it's worth calling out that this version of Synapse now uses the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244">MSC3244: room version capabilities</a> API to ask clients to prefer <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">room version 9</a> when creating restricted rooms.</p>
<p>Support for room version 9 was introduced in Synapse 1.42, so we'd strongly encourage administrators to upgrade.</p>
<p>Perhaps more notably for Synapse developers, we've spent quite a lot of time over the past few weeks improving the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest/">SyTest</a> suite of integration tests. Several of the tests had race conditions which would cause them to occasionally fail when testing a multi-worker deployment of Synapse. These flakey tests have plagued our continuous integration pipelines, and are finally being fixed.</p>
<p>The long term plan is still to transition to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a> (written in Go) and away from SyTest (written in Perl), but we still need to ensure that SyTest is reliable in the meantime.</p>

Didn't post updates about the etke.cc service for a while.

AND!!!! Provide hosting, yes. So, starting today that's available for everyone (we offer it for some time in &quot;well, you know, we don't provide hosting, but if you want it so hard...&quot; way and it works good)</p>
<p>Even with that update (literally the most requested thing, was in every third order we got), provided hosting considered as your own server, the only difference that you don't pay hosting provider directly, but through us. So, you get root access to the server and we treat it as any other customer's infrastructure</p>

<p>What improvements did hifi bring to the formatting you may ask? I asked, and hifi answered:</p>

<p>the fallbacks are inconsistent and usually are markdown which is a lie üòÖ
replies and mentions are completely all over the place in the fallback in addition to being markdown 
the unformatted html is now something in between and doesn't do code blocks at all because those ticks are just noise on irc 
it tries to look like more that you pasted long text rather than sending markdown </p>

<h3 id="spec">Spec</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3395">MSC3395: Synthetic appservice events</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3394">MSC3394: New auth rule that only allows someone to post a message in relation to another message</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918: Refresh tokens</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs are in FCP.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were merged this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>If MSC2918 above is giving you feelings of d√©j√† vu, don't worry. It already had FCP proposed, but due to a resolved concern being incorrectly processed by mscbot on github, a new FCP proposal was carried out.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> (Polls - mk II) receive a fair amount of attention this week. It implements inline polls via a new <code>m.poll</code> type and makes use of the concept of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">extensible events</a>. Do check it out if you're interested in voting through means other than message reactions!</p>
<p>Otherwise Alexandre Franke and myself will be looking at cleaning up the CI of the matrix-org/matrix-doc repo next week, as well as continue to move the infrastructure for the new spec release forwards.</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1235">MSC1235: Proposal for Calendar Events</a>.</p>
<p>This one is entirely new to me, and has some slight overlap with some work for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2762">MSC2762: Allowing widgets to send/receive events</a>, where we were thinking about how a widget could act as a calendar using Matrix rooms and events as a calendar backend.</p>

<p>The Synapse team is busy gearing up for 1.43.0 next week, which will make room version 9 the default for newly created <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">restricted rooms</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>We've also been doing quite a lot of work on Sydent. Notably, last week's 2.4.0 release introduced a few regressions which have been resolved in subsequent point releases. The one-shot <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/v2.4.3/docs/casefold_migration.md">case folding migration script</a> for Sydent is still performing unexpectedly slowly; look for that to be resolved soon.</p>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, now is a good time to ensure you're ready for the deprecation of PostgreSQL 9.6 (November) and Python 3.6 (December). Do you have plans to upgrade to Pg 10 and Py 3.7 or newer? If not, there's no time like the present! üóì</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest 2021</a> is less than two weeks away! Many Matrix projects intend to participate, including Synapse.</p>

<p>Beeper is a unified chat app built on top of Matrix. We've created 10+ open source Matrix bridges and integrated them into an easy to use all-in-one service which does not require setting up your own homeserver. You can learn more at <a href="http://beeper.com/">beeper.com</a>.</p>
<p>We've been hard at work for the last few weeks and have a number of updates we'd like to share across all our clients and bridges.</p>

<p>Added the ability to view your rooms using our Smart Inbox that places the most important messages at the top, or with Classic which leaves the room in a reverse chronological order.</p>

<li>
<p>You can now select network by network which messages should appear in your inbox using our Inbox Filtering feature</p>

<p>Integrated Android SMS bridge: Our previous Android Messages bridge was built on a shakey puppeteer foundation, so we rewrote it. Our new Android SMS uses native APIs to send/receive SMS. RCS remains elusively out of our grasp for now. We open sourced our bridge at https://gitlab.com/beeper/android-sms</p>

You may have seen something similar on Github and other platforms. Currently this needs the <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/qt-jdenticon">qt-jdenticon</a> plugin, which is a bit troublesome to install correctly, but we should improve that in the near future.</p>
<p>Prezu added a homeserver entry field to the room directory, making it much more useful (no history yet though). Thulinma added a /goto command to navigate to specific events or room and fixed scrolling to a specific event (in the past it only approximately scrolled to the right location). Symphorien added the Alt+A shortcut to navigate between rooms with active mentions and notifications. Additionally Priit completed the Estonian translation.</p>
<p>Additionally we released a security fix on Monday (together with a few other clients). We only released a fix for the master branch in Nheko instead of also the latest stable release. This confused a few people, but I hope my explanations made sense. The gist of it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the master branch the local homeserver admin could force Nheko to forget which identity keys it saw for a user and as such insert a new device with the same device id, but attacker controlled identity keys and request old encryption keys from Nheko. In Nheko's case we had some protections against that, but if the server sent a device_list.left event for that user, Nheko would delete those protections. From our understanding this could not be abused over federation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 0.8.2 this can also be abused, but 0.8.2 does not implement key sharing completely. It can only forward the currently in use encryption key, not historical ones. As such the impact in our opinion was too limited to release a security fix. 0.8.2 does not allow you to send encrypted messages only to verified devices as such the homeserver admin could always insert just a different device to get access to new encrypted messages. Because of that we have a big warning in the README and when enabling encryption in 0.8.2, that one should not rely on the security of the E2EE implementation in it. We are aiming to have stable and secure E2EE in the next release (and so far it is looking good), but if you are using 0.8.2 I can only repeat, that it won't protect you from an attacker even without the disclosed security issue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this clears up some of the confusion. Feel free to visit us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a> and tell me, that I am wrong.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca">uhoreg</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week saw two releases of libolm, a library that implements olm, megolm, and some other Matrix-related encryption functions.  The main changes in version 3.2.5 are new functions for getting error codes rather than error strings so that implementations don't need to rely on string parsing to decode errors, and added support for fallback keys in the Android and iOS bindings.  There were also improvements in error handling in the  unpickling functions, and the shared library no longer exports certain private symbols, which caused problems when those same symbols were exported by other libraries.  The initial implementation of this last change caused build failures in some environments, so version 3.2.6 was released to fix this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am super happy to finally give you another update on TheBoard, due to holidays during the last weeks I had less time to work on TheBoard. But now there still accumulated enough changes for a little Update:</p>
<p>I experimented what technologies I could use for the still required GUI elements. A new User List was implemented using Vue.js. Vue seemed to be a little overkill for the kind of GUI required in the case of TheBoard. So I re-implemented the user list with react-no-js.
I am happy with <strong>react-no-js</strong> and it is used for a <strong>user list plus a tool settings menu</strong> on the right hand side of the canvas.</p>
<p>The tool panel in particular opens up a lot of possibilities. The eraser already makes use of it by giving the option to only delete specific item types (Image, stroke or text). This can be very handy if you want to delete strokes drawn on top of an image without deleting the image as well. What can be deleted is highlighted by a new <strong>filter system</strong> which allows to make any modification to objects selected by a filter function (see the attached image)</p>
<p>Other small changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Animated camera movement (for a upcoming &quot;follow other user&quot; feature) currently used for the Go Home Button</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opening a board now loads at the last edited location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The touchscreen navigation (zoom/pan) was re-implemented and should now work much better</p>

<p>The Board is very exciting! I could see in <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard#planned-use-cases">the planned use cases</a> that Timo already intends to make a widget out of it. It would be very useful for real-time collaboration, but that's not all! When asked if a standalone app will come, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org">Timo</a> confirmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed. I wasn't thinking about a builtin home-server yet. But a standalone app is still planned because I want the app to be able to manage different boards. Therefore I need to be able to control room creation and listing rooms. It should basically feel like onenote if you intend to use it like that.</p>

The game is a text-based sandbox multiplayer browser game that I (Maze) have been building for the past 3 years. Built from nothing, no game engine. It generates an infinite procedural terrain to venture in. The integrated chatbox is nothing special but it's really nice to have it bridged to Matrix now, it's less lonely when playing alone. The appservice bridge creates users matching player name and color. Display names from Matrix are presented in the same color as in Element.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension">Dimension</a>, an integration manager alternative for Element, got a refresh from @TimeWalker to bring the project up to modern day standards. Please give it a go if you've been running Dimension, and report bugs if there's problems! While I haven't personally had time to maintain it as much as I'd like, it's great to see people taking on 3 year old bad code and fixing it üòÑ</p>
<p>For TWIM readers, Dimension is an &quot;integration manager&quot; that replaces the default one shipped with Element. It's not entirely mobile-ready yet, but does give a user interface for managing various bots, bridges, and widgets. In practice, an integration manager isn't needed as most bots and bridges (and even widgets) can be set up without an integrations manager, like all of https://t2bot.io/ (ironically, given Dimension was originally targeted at t2bot.io). People do still use it though to configure self-hosted platforms with their very own Element, Synapse, bridges, and bots. </p>
<p>While I still probably won't have much time personally to maintain it, PRs are certainly accepted. Dimension is a bit complex to work within and test, but people in #dimension:t2bot.io should be able to help out.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/09/07/synapse-1-42-0-released">Synapse 1.42.0</a> is out now! This release includes support for Room Version 9, which fixes an issue with Version 8's support for restricted rooms. We also implement a bunch of new MSCs (including <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">MSC3231: Token authenticated registration</a> by Callum Brown as part of his Google Summer of Code project), improve efficiency, and sidestep a longstanding issue with users getting stuck in unsupported room versions. Read the announcement for details!</p>
<h4 id="sydent">Sydent</h4>
<p>This week saw the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/v2.4.1/CHANGELOG.md">release of Sydent 2.4</a> which finally implements <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2265">MSC2265: mandating case folding when processing e-mail address local parts</a>. After upgrading, Sydent administrators <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/v2.4.1/docs/casefold_migration.md">must manually run a script</a> to retroactively case-fold existing email addresses in the Sydent database.</p>
<p>This Sydent release also includes support for Jinja2 templating, a complete overhaul of our CI/CD pipeline, and a comprehensive update to the codebase to follow modern Python practices including the addition of mypy type hints throughout.</p>
<p>Lastly, we'd like to welcome Shay to the Backend Team at Element. Her work as an <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> intern paved the way for the recent improvements to Sygnal and Sydent. Thanks, Shay, and welcome aboard!</p>

<h3 id="matrix-appservice-bridge-reaches-3-0-0">matrix-appservice-bridge reaches 3.0.0!</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, we're massively pleased to announce the third major release of the TS/JS bridging library <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/3.0.0">matrix-appservice-bridge</a>. This release contains several large breaking changes to the previous way of life, most notably we have stopped using the matrix-js-sdk for most of our code, instead using the matrix-bot-sdk (Hi TravisR , we see you up there!).</p>
<p>There are several reasons why we went this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notably, this library focuses work on simply implementing APIs and bridge/bot logic. There is no additional cruft to support client use-cases or browsers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's historically had a brilliant coverage of the CS and AS APIs, and has been extremely flexible to add new stable and unstable APIs to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the start of this project, it was the only library with a complete Typescript coverage. Typescript types continue to be extremely useful to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're hoping to make use of the upcoming encrypted appservices support, to replace the slightly janky pantalaimon support the bridge library currently uses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to Travis and the matrix.org bridge team for working through these changes!</p>
<p>There are a bunch of common sense improvements that break API compatibility in this release also, so please be sure to check them out and update. We don't anticipate supporting 2.X except for extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll be updating the matrix-org suite of bridges over the coming weeks so please watch for bugs and let us know how we're doing!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might remember my short story from last TWIM about the race between different translators? Seems like that one was good enough to motivate a few people to contribute translations. While those don't seem to be 100% complete yet, we saw a significant jump in translation percentages (especially Portuguese), so thank you to everyone who contributed to that!</p>
<p>Thulinma also made the whole userprofile scrollable, which improves the experience on small screens a lot. He also implemented message deduplication by event id, which is required by the spec to be done on the client side. This fixes a lot of duplicates when using conduit and your join event appearing 2~3 times on synapse.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue with how different homeservers update one time key counts and added some additional code to remove old one time keys, if we ever uploaded to many (which might have happened in the past in a few edge cases). We also now escape img tags in usernames correctly in more places, redundant date separators when paginating back in a room should not appear anymore and tastytea decreased the margins on blockquotes, so that they look less jarring and take up less space.</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>You may be wondering: what's up with all of these abandoned MSCs?? The answer is that the matrix-org/matrix-doc repo <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3367">changed its base branch</a> to <code>main</code> to help preserve the git history since the spec website rewrite. In doing so, all PRs were automatically updated to the new base branch by github... except those that were coming from deleted users and repos. Those ones were simply closed!</p>
<p>But as they seemed to be have been effectively abandoned by their authors, it was more of a cleanup than an accident. However, if your MSC was affected by this change and you would like to continue it, please contact someone in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-office:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-office:matrix.org</a> and we'll help you out.</p>
<h4 id="random-spec-of-the-week">Random Spec of the Week</h4>
<p>The random spec of this week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2448">MSC2448: Using BlurHash as a Placeholder for Matrix Media</a>!</p>
<p>MSC2448 defines a way for clients to include a &quot;blurhash&quot;, or a short, textual representation of a blurred version of an image, inside events which other clients can show while waiting for thumbnails to download from media servers. This replaces the potentially blank space while an image's thumbnail is loading with a (IMO) beautiful alternative!</p>
<p>Yes I wrote this MSC... but I swear it's what <a href="https://github.com/anoadragon453/pick-a-spec">the script</a> picked! We do not question the script!!</p>

<p>Two big notes this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/08/31/synapse-1-41-1-released">Synapse 1.41.1 is out</a> and it contains patches for <strong>two security vulnerabilities</strong> which could inappropriately disclose private room metadata to unauthorized users on a participating homeserver. Please upgrade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3375">Room Version 9</a> is coming in Synapse 1.42 next week. This version fixes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3373">an oversight</a> in which event fields are protected from redaction in room version 8, making it possible for restricted rooms to break if a join event is redacted. Because event IDs are based on the redaction algorithm, we can't fix this without creating a new room version.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility across the federation, Synapse 1.42 will still instruct clients to create restricted rooms using room version 8. Synapse 1.43, scheduled for release on 21 September, will begin instructing clients to use room version 9 instead.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had a race between 3 Translators this week. All 3 of them were trying really hard, so in my opinion every placement is a first place, buuuuuut Thulinma actually came first by bringing the Dutch translation from 5% to 100%. A few hours later Priit came in as a close second updating the Estonian translation to 100%. ISSOtm noticed that and tried to catch up which resulted in a 3rd place finish for the French translation. Now I understand the excitement people feel watching others compete in sports without having to do anything themselves!</p>
<p>red_sky (nheko.im) meanwhile fought a much more difficult enemy, Apple documentation and code signing! To be honest, I expected him to be beaten, but Nheko's DMGs are now actually properly signed and notarized. So if you are on macOS, you should now see less ugly warnings when installing Nheko. All nightlies building of the master branch are signed as well as our future releases.</p>
<p>In more community contributions, resolritter fixed the right click menu not working on replies. So you can copy a link from a reply now by right-clicking it without having to scroll up. Thulinma fixed window alerts not working when using conduit, because Conduit does not implement the /notifications endpoint Nheko uses and he helped me debug and fix device lists not showing up when using Conduit as well as sessions always getting rotated in &quot;Send encrypted messages to verified devices only&quot; mode.</p>
<p>In our work to stabilize E2EE we also now require a proper secrets daemon running on Linux (and other platforms, but there it is always provided by the OS). This is used to store the pickle key as well as the cross-signing secrets, so that an attacker can't read the from the config file. We already used such a daemon before, but we failed silently and we didn't use it for the pickle key until now. So if this prevents you from running Nheko, please open an issue so that we can work on a solution. Those APIs can be really fickle so additional testing and feedback would help us out a lot!</p>
<p>Also exciting is that Nheko now supports playing encrypted audio and video files without storing a temporary unencrypted copy on disk as well as animated images like WebP and GIF! It took us a while to figure out a proper solution, but now you can send animated stickers and you will finally be able to understand why other people were lauging at still images. (We also had to fix some bugs in our sticker editor, where we didn't add the mimetype to the sticker info for that.)</p>
<p>Some more embarrassing news, I didn't know I was a moderator in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:fachschaften.org">#conduit:fachschaften.org</a>, so I happily pinged everyone in the room while discussing room mentions. To prevent that from happening in the future, Nheko now shows a red warning above the message input if you will be pinging the whole room to give you time to reconsider. If that is not enough to stop me from doing that, we might require confirmation before sending such messages in the future, but so far this seems to work. Pinging everyone by accident can really scare you and composing a message in Matrix shouldn't be scary!</p>
<p>I hope I didn't forget anything and please make sure you check out Conduit, since they are doing a great job in revealing bugs in Nheko!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/circles-ios">Circles</a> is a project to build a secure, end-to-end encrypted social network, using Matrix as the foundation.</p>
<h4 id="news">News</h4>
<p>We're getting very close to a real App Store launch.  The latest beta release this week is <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/cWuDwqpG">0.98</a>  This version might be The One!  So please, if you haven't tried Circles in a while, give this one a shot.  Also please share the link with any friends and family who you think might be interested.  The current signup token has plenty of slots for everyone.</p>
<p>If you want to see some activity in your circles, invite me to follow your Community circle and I'll invite you to follow back.  I'm @cvwright:kombucha.social.</p>
<h4 id="warning">WARNING</h4>
<p>If you've been using Circles with your own (non-Kombucha) server, you probably DO NOT WANT this version.  Support for bring-your-own-server will return very soon after our App Store launch.</p>
<h4 id="latest-updates">Latest updates</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Broke and then re-enabled new account signup.  Thanks to everyone who helped diagnose this one, and sorry if you were unable to sign up using a recent build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a weeks-old bug where posting a message into a circle would then send you back to your list of all your social circles.  Big thanks to Yosef for bringing this to my attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a bug in recent 0.9x builds where the Matrix rooms underlying circles and groups were being created with invalid encryption parameters.  If you've been unable to post anything, this is the likely culprit.  The fix is to update to the latest build, then delete your old circles/groups and create new ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have a new icon.  It's blue!  I was worried that Apple might think the old icon looked too much like the Apple Photos icon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New and improved interface for managing your account information.  Added support for changing your password and for deactivating your account.  I hope you never want this last one, but Apple requires it for apps that allow you to create accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed support for Markdown formatting in posts and image captions.  This is a sad one, but unfortunately the performance of the open source library that we were using for Markdown just wasn't up to the task.  On the bright side, our timelines load much more quickly now, and the scrolling should be much smoother.  Look for Markdown support to return with the release of iOS 15 later this year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another update to the Recent Activity list.  Now it should refresh itself automatically if/when it initially comes up empty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved layout and usability on iPad.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tobi_fh:matrix.org">tobi</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CoMatrix project enables the usage of the Matrix protocol (more precisely Matrix Client-Server API) for constrained IoT devices via CoAP and CBOR in a constrained network (e.g. a 802.15.4/6LoWPAN network).</p>
<p>CoMatrix provides a gateway, which ports Matrix to CoAP/CBOR/(DTLS). This gateway communicates with constrained IoT devices on one side via CoAP+CBOR and translates to the Matrix protocol on the other side (i.e. HTTP+JSON). CoMatrix also provides a client library (for RIOT-OS) which is a starting point to implement CoMatrix clients (for constrained devices) which are able to interact with Matrix homeservers via the gateway.</p>
<p>Currently CoMatrix supports the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sending of messages to a Matrix room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receiving the last message of a Matrix room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User registration at a Matrix Synapse HS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joining a Matrix room upon invitation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Login of a user at a Matrix Synapse HS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have made a small 120k pipeline-agent software (including all dependencies except NodeJS v8)  which can run on multiple platforms (including OpenWRT) and takes pipeline work over the Matrix protocol. In the end it's going to be used to setup things like VPN connections between gateways. </p>
<p>We also have a commercial web portal almost published where one can create web apps and configure pipelines to process the results. And yes, the portal also uses Matrix as its persistent storage -- it was implemented using my Matrix CRUD Repository from last week :)</p>
<p>The agent software (pipeline-runner) is open source  and has zero (0) runtime dependencies except NodeJS, and available from here: https://github.com/sendanor/pipeline-runner -- It's still in early development, though.</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2582">MSC2582</a> (Removing mimetype from EncryptedFile object) was one of those MSCs that were relatively small, but had been languishing for <em>ages</em>. Partly because it required client implementations to update, but also partly because one needed to go in after a while and actually confirm that all known clients had updated. @uhoreg took up the mantle on his own to do so, and as a result this MSC has hit FCP and is soon to be merged. Thank you!</p>
<h4 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h4>
<p>The random MSC of the week is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3262">MSC3262: aPAKE authentication</a>!</p>
<p>Alongside <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2957">MSC2957</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3265">MSC3265</a>, this MSC is requesting a better way of communicating one's password to the homeserver without sending it in plaintext (over TLS, hopefully).</p>
<p>Remember that this is only done in exchange for an access token, which is then used for all subsequent requests. Still though, I can see the merit!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el">Ement.el</a>, a Matrix client for Emacs, gained some more improvements this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multi-account support was merged, so you can now use multiple accounts at the same time.  You can even be in the same room in two different accounts, at the same time, in side-by-side windows (which is useful for testing).  (Note that existing users will need to log in again, because the format of the saved-session file changed.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rooms you have been invited to now show up in the rooms list, and you can join them by clicking a button in the room's buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypted rooms now display a warning in the header and suggest that users consider using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon/">Pantalaimon</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Membership events are now formatted more usefully, similar to Element's style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completion for room and user names and IDs is implemented using standard Emacs commands and bindings (i.e. <code>C-M-i</code> by default).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last-read marker may be jumped to, even if it's at an earlier event that has not yet been retrieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emotes (i.e. <code>/me</code>-style messages) can be sent by pressing <code>e</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timestamps in the room list are shaded according to how &quot;hot&quot; (i.e. recently updated) the room is (see screenshot).</p>

<li>
<p>Various small fixes and enhancements.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now supports uploading to online key backup and warns you before enabling it, that we don't recommend using the asymmetric version. If you update to one of the current builds (and or the next version), you will also experience a bit longer load times on first startup. That is because we force-cleared the cache to be able to handle the new goodies like spaces and sticker/emote-packs. In the best case, everything is seamless.</p>
<p>We also had contributions by various people:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>resolritter cleaned up that while tab moved you down most popup lists, it didn't move up when shift was pressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harmathy extended the FAQ to answer commonly asked questions like &quot;Does Nheko support E2EE&quot; or &quot;What commands are supported&quot;. Don't worry, we know most of you won't read that and will still answer that question when you undoubtedly come asking it again. We just can now be even more passive aggressive than just pointing at the right wiki page. Instead we will point at the FAQ now, which will point at the wiki!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thombles made the emoji completer behave more nicely. Instead of jumping to the bottom left corner before closing, it will now just close. It should also now behave correctly when selecting text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alfasi updated the install instructions for Gentoo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure we have ever seen that many new faces contributing to Nheko in a week, I'm pretty happy to see that!</p>

<h3 id="ruma">Ruma</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ruma.io/">Ruma</a> is a set of Rust library crates around Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org">jplatte</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been so long since our last update that I couldn't possibly list all of the individual changes, but here's a rough overview of the work since then (three months ago):</p>
<p>There's been loads of bug fixes, many compatibility improvements and at least one large refactoring. We've been much faster about releasing changes to crates.io after ruma 0.1.0, now we're already at ruma 0.4.0 (!);  the changes needed to upgrade are really not that significant though. Notable areas of improvement are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UIAA: No more stringly-typed auth type + map of properties. The <code>AuthData</code> enum that holds the authentication information clients send to servers now has one variant for every auth type defined in the spec.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event relations: These used to be serialized wrongly for encrypted events and were only (de)serializable as part of a larger event (making using them in custom ways impossible). Both of these issues were fixed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the GSoC coding period is over and our students have both written a blog post summarizing their work: <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/gsoc-coverage/">API Coverage project (Adam Blanchet)</a>, <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/gsoc-tools/">Tooling project (Devin Ragotzy)</a></p>
<p>If you want more detailed updates about Ruma, please watch <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">our repository</a>'s GitHub releases, since nobody in the project currently wants to write regular blog posts or TWIM updates (if you are interested in changing that, get in touch over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone! Did you ever feel lost in the Matrix world? The room directory is big, but it's still hard to find something you like. Or are you a room moderator, but there is not much activity in your room because it doesn't have enough users?</p>
<p>This is why I want to share rooms (or spaces) I find interesting.</p>
<hr />
<p>This week's room is: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#terminal-gaming:matrix.org">#terminal-gaming:matrix.org</a></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Channel dedicated to games running in terminal environment (or one that looks like terminal) As long as the game could be easily ported to terminal, it belongs here :) Telegram: t.me/cligaming&quot;</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>If you want to suggest a room for this section, tell me in #roomoftheweek</p>
