<p>As you may have seen, Matrix Live this week features Neil and Matthew <a href="/blog/2019/02/15/publishing-the-backend-roadmap/">discussing the newly announced backend roadmap</a>.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LfyQ6cNGbLk" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p>We also have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.1.1">Synapse v0.99.1.1</a> available, as the race to Synapse v1.0 gets closer and closer and closer!</p>
<p>Brendan also said, regarding low-bandwidth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of the week has been spent finalising the components used in <a href="https://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/matrix.webm">the low-bandwidth demo we did at FOSDEM</a>. This required polishing some internal developments, which are now almost ready to be published to the wide world! This should happen in the next few days so stay tuned :)</p>

<h2 id="riot-1-0-0-and-hotfix-1-0-1">Riot 1.0.0, and hotfix 1.0.1</h2>
<p>If you're following Matrix much at all, you will surely have seen it by now: Riot, the most popular client, has <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/the-big-1-0-68fa7c6050be">announced the v1.0 milestone</a>. I won't reiterate the features and improvements here, but do check out the blog post, or just head over to <a href="https://riot.im/app">https://riot.im/app</a> and see for yourself!</p>
<p>Particularly exciting is the new encryption verification process, involving sharing a list of emojis out-of-band:</p>

<p>. . .which seems to me not boring at all - we can expect, in the next few months, another Matrix Client with E2EE support, and on mobile!</p>
<p>In my role as editor of this particular blog post, I enjoy certain luxuries that others might envy. For example, today, I tried a new preview build of FluffyChat. This I installed on my barely-repaired OnePlus One running Ubuntu Touch 16.04.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-archive-keyring">matrix-archive-keyring</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been working on new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've paused porting Synapse to OpenBSD this week, while I attempt to both fix and <em>revert</em> some security issues caused by <code>sudo apt-key add</code> for Matrix.org and Riot.im packages for Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution users.<br /><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4609">matrix-org/synapse PR #4609</a> was my first attempt to fix the problem, however I fell short this time in ease-of-use and my implementation had other issues. (Read: The <code>repo-key.asc</code> downloaded from Matrix.org Debian repository should go to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>, and must not be added by <code>apt-key add</code> or added to <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d</code> directly. I attempted the latter with my first PR; but that would've allowed the Matrix.org signing key to also be used to verify packages from Debian's main repositories. Yikes!)<br />As my second attempt, I'm now creating a new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>. There's multiple things this package intends to do:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>A post-install script to remove any previously added Matrix.org package signing keys from <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg</code>. (This is the file <code>apt-key add</code> most commonly uses, and the most commonly found bad advice on the Internet.)</li>
 	<li>Convert <code>repo-key.asc</code> to a de-armorized <code>.gpg</code> format, understood better by apt(8). (Essentially, <code>gpg --dearmor</code>.)</li>
 	<li>Install the converted <code>.gpg</code> key to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>.</li>
 	<li>Make sure <code>apt(8)</code> uses the newly added key for Matrix.org repository only?</li>
 	<li>Deliver any updates to <code>repo-key.asc</code> directly to you via <code>apt upgrade</code>. Your operating system might then also do it automatically for you if <code>unattended-upgrades(8)</code> is installed on your system. ?</li>
 	<li>Make sure everything goes away when this keyring package is uninstalled. No more <code>sudo sh -c 'apt-key del C35EB17E1EAE708E6603A9B3AD0592FE47F0DF61; rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> to get rid of the repository.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I have one more interesting enhancement to disclose.<br />We can ask you with <code>debconf</code> if you want to install <code>deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian $(lsb_release -cs) main</code> to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> while you're installing the new keyring with <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code>.<br />You'll most likely notice the difference in install instructions, as a result of this package. Before and after:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># Before
sudo apt install -y lsb-release curl apt-transport-https
echo "deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian `lsb_release -cs` main" |
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list
curl "https://matrix.org/packages/debian/repo-key.asc" |
    sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
<pre><code># After
sudo apt install matrix-archive-keyring
sudo sh -c 'apt update && apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are a Debian or Ubuntu user and Synapse homeserver operator using Matrix.org repositories, I'll be towncrying when this package becomes available as much as I can. All you should need to do then is <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code> and it should patch the security holes in your operating system if you've formerly installed packages from Matrix.org or Riot.im! (The command may change a bit, because next Debian operating system release &quot;Buster&quot; has entered soft-freeze just today (2019-02-12) and not accepting new packages into that release.)<br />PS: I'm at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#debian-matrix:matrix.org">#debian-matrix:matrix.org</a>, please come talk to us if Debian packaging interests you!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the eager early testers not afraid of building from source, <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code> version <code>2015.12.09+debian0.10</code> is available for early testing (attached).</p>
<pre><code># Something like this!
sudo apt install devscripts
tar -xfvJ matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10.tar.xz
cd matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10

<p>Please follow <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=922155">Debian Bug#922155</a> for updates. Debian binary packages will be available later sometime this/next week from Debian's <code>unstable</code> distribution (<code>contrib</code>), if all goes well and there are no remaining Debian policy violations or serious bugs.</p>

<p>FOSDEM happened.</p>
<ul>
 	<li>two Matrix-themed packed-room talks</li>
 	<li>lots of people coming to chat at the stall to say things like "hi" or "I like Matrix" or "what is Matrix? … wow that sounds amazing, how can I get involved?"</li>
 	<li>1000s of stickers decentralised out of my bag onto people's laptops</li>

<h2 id="synapse-0-99-0">Synapse 0.99.0</h2>
<p>With the release of <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.0.html">Server to Server Spec r0.1</a>, Synapse 0.99.0 is shipping now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synapse 1.0.0 will be compliant with r0.1 and the goal of Synapse 0.99.0 is to act as a stepping stone to Synapse 1.0. Synapse 0.99.0 supports the r0.1 release of the server to server specification, but is compatible with both the legacy Matrix federation behaviour (pre-r0.1) as well as post-r0.1 behaviour, in order to allow for a smooth upgrade across the federation.<br />It is critical that all admins upgrade to 0.99.0 and configure a valid TLS certificate. Admins will have 1 month to do so, after which 1.0.0 will be released and those servers without a valid certificate will no longer be able to federate with &gt;= 1.0.0 servers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Please</em> <a href="/blog/2019/02/05/synapse-0-99-0/">read the announcement post</a> and be sure to come and chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a> if you need help!</p>

<h2 id="tchap-android-client">Tchap Android client</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@willem:canarymod.net">Willem</a> reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After seeing a demo at FOSDEM of <a href="https://github.com/dinsic-pim/tchap-android">Tchap</a>, the app the French government uses to access their Matrix network, I decided to try to get it to work as a general-purpose Matrix client. The app uses email and password to log in, and infers the homeserver address from the homeserver name. So to get it to work, I had to patch the app and write a little proxy so it gets the proper homeserver (and optionally identity server) from an email address.<br />A patched version of Tchap can be found at <a href="https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android">https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android</a>, code for the proxy at <a href="https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-proxy">https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-proxy</a>. At the moment it's very crude, and images/files don't work since the virus scan API is unimplemented, but at least it can be used outside the French government. ?</p>

<h2 id="preparing-for-synapse-on-openbsd">Preparing for Synapse on OpenBSD</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been making progress on a project to get Synapse running on OpenBSD, and to that end has been preparing and improving the dependencies that we take for granted on Linux. To summarise the current status:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I've been porting Synapse's dependencies to OpenBSD <code>-current</code> distribution. There is no port yet for Synapse in OpenBSD.
Ports missing from OpenBSD <code>6.4</code> for Synapse's dependencies were:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li><code>py-frozendict</code>: ok'd, waiting…</li>
 	<li><code>py-unpaddedbase64</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-canonicaljson</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-signedjson</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-treq</code>: WIP (this will take a while, lots of dependencies)</li>
 	<li><code>py-daemonize</code>: ok'd, waiting…</li>
 	<li><code>py-pymacaroons</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-phonenumbers</code>: <code>8.10.4</code> done, waiting to be imported…</li>
 	<li><code>py-prometheus_client</code> done, needs to be tested/imported…</li>
 	<li><code>coturn</code>: TBD, maybe?</li>
</ul>
waiting = usually waiting for an OpenBSD developer to "ok" and import
<blockquote>
<p>Of those, <code>py-phonenumbers</code> was added to OpenBSD<br /><code>-snapshots</code> (<code>-current</code>) distribution. <code>py-phonenumbers</code> (?) and <code>py-service_identity</code> received updates to ports. <code>py-prometheus_client</code>, <code>py-daemonize</code> and <code>py-frozendict</code> are ported ready and waiting to be given &quot;ok&quot; at OpenBSD's <code>ports@</code> mailing list.<br />There is <a href="https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip/tree/master/net/synapse">an unofficial up-to-date Synapse port exists at GitHub</a> maintained by someone else, which I've not yet tested. (At glance, I can take a guess the <code>devel/tz</code> port may not be required.)<br />(<code>coturn</code> doesn't have a port yet, may have to look at it later.)</p>

<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Neil and the team have been working frantically on getting a new Synapse release out this week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week has been all about gearing up for v0.99.0 and if you would like to help us test it, our latest release candidate lives <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.0rc4">here</a><br />We've taken the decision to bump up to v0.99.0 because it is very much a precursor to v1.0. When v1.0 lands it will contain a breaking change that means all homeservers will need a valid certificate for their server to server endpoint, self signing will no longer be possible.<br />v0.99.0 contains support to help you do this, but once it lands all admins will need to upgrade, failure to do so will mean losing the ability to federate with &gt; v1.0 servers.<br />We'll have detailed docs ready to go alongside the full v0.99.0 release, and we plan to leave at least 1 month between v0.99.0 and v1.0, but for now please be aware that the change is coming.<br />Huge thanks to Rich, Erik, Hawkowl and Anoa for all their work in getting us to rc stage.</p>

<p>I've posted another blog on <a href="https://github.com/lukebarnard1/journal">journal</a> about the next steps for the project, including my thoughts on verifying blog content.</p>
<p><a href="https://journal.lukebarnard.co.uk/journal/26-jan-2019">https://journal.lukebarnard.co.uk/journal/26-jan-2019</a></p>
<p>I'm planning to start work on the component that will scrape blog content from a matrix room. This will most likely involve a dedicated bot that syncs new journal blog events, verifies the blog signature and then writes the blog content to a file on the blog server.</p>
<p>I'll probably ramble about the details of that at some point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bridge is being re-written. I excluded the jabber server (still need to setup SRV records) and implementing the xmpp s2s api in the bridge.
Done:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>rfc6120 in s2s part;</li>
 	<li>almost server dialback (XEP-0220);</li>
</ul>
Remaining:
<ul>
 	<li>MUC (XEP-0045);</li>
 	<li>stabilize.</li>
</ul>
New version will allow:
<ul>
 	<li>1:1 conversations between matrix and jabber users;</li>
 	<li>group chats by double-puppet mapping rooms to conferences;</li>
 	<li>additionally xmpp users can join directly to rooms via double-puppet bots.</li>
</ul>
Also I started breaking the bridge to modules. And the next module will be ActivityPub S2S module which allows communicate matrix servers with other fedivers.

 	<li>Since <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1711">MSC1711</a> is a breaking change, we will initially ship our next release (v0.35.0) with ACME support to make it easy to provision and renew certificates. The give everyone a month to upgrade and install a cert before we ship Synapse v1.0 which will require that servers have certificates in order to federate. Don't worry, there will be plenty of details on the steps necessary for admins when v0.35.0 lands - watch this space.</li>

<ul>
 	<li>The bridge could not create new Matrix rooms on versions of Synapse after a certain change, because it did not reserve the room alias prefix it used. That's been fixed, but anyone currently running matrix-puppet-slack will need to edit their slack_registration.yaml and restart Synapse. See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack/releases/tag/1.10.1">the Release</a> for instructions on doing so.</li>
 	<li>The bridge will no longer send "Edit: " events when Slack sends it a "message_changed" message, if the message text has not actually changed (Slack sends these events for URL previews, for example, but this just causes duplicate bridged messages). This fix has been a long time coming.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>From the notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reconciliation is now much faster, due to the way we retrieve account data from the Matrix server (no longer doing <code>/sync</code>).<br />From now on, the minimum requirement for running matrix-corporal is Synapse v0.34.1, as it's the first Synapse release which contains the new API we require (<code>GET /user/{'{'}user_id{'}'}/account_data/{'{'}account_dataType{'}'}</code>).</p>

  ("rooms" room-id "send" event-type txn-id))

<p>It's a New Year and there have been a lot of improvements to the <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> playbook:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>there's now support for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/docs/importing-postgres.md">importing an existing Postgres database</a>, which should make it easier for people with another setup to migrate over.</li>
 	<li>there's now support for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/docs/configuring-playbook-ssl-certificates.md">manually-managed and self-signed certificates</a>, in addition to the Let's Encrypt support we've always had</li>
 	<li>the playbook now uses a much better (20x smaller, faster) riot-web Docker image (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/avhost/docker-matrix-riot/">avhost/docker-matrix-riot</a> -&gt; <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bubuntux/riot-web/">bubuntux/riot-web</a>). At least until <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/7771">vector-im/riot-web#7771</a> gets merged and official images become available.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#bc-break-mxisd-configuration-changes">completely redone</a> way of generating mxisd configuration, letting people unleash the full power of mxisd without us having to explicitly add support for new features</li>
 	<li>mxisd 1.3.0-ready. We default to a stable mxisd release still (1.2.2), but people can try the much-improved 1.3.0 alpha releases even now (e.g. <code>matrix_mxisd_docker_image: "kamax/mxisd:1.3.0-alpha.2"</code>).</li>
 	<li>we now utilize <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/blob/4185b644b7b69af36bb1fdc81976a36590b1b97f/docs/features/directory.md">mxisd's User Directory Search feature</a> to augment the results coming from Synapse</li>
 	<li>the playbook has been <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#splitting-the-playbook-into-multiple-roles">split into multiple roles</a> (one role per component) and the <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#bc-break-making-the-playbooks-roles-more-independent-of-one-another">roles have been made independent of one another</a>. People who want to re-use our roles in their own playbooks can now more-easily do so.</li>
 	<li>even more components have become optional and can now be turned off completely (coturn, mailer)</li>
</ul>
Lots of thanks go to Maximus, jcgruenhage and Cadair for helping out!

<p>libQMatrixClient 0.4.2 has been released, fixing a security issue (the library could be tricked into altering the local room state by fake state events - those without state_key). The master branch of the library is updated as well - it is strongly recommended to update to either 0.4.2 or master, depending on which branch you live on.</p>

<p>The version bump is also the project's 100th commit, and I've updated the supported feature checklist in the README to paint a more comprehensive picture of what is and isn't supported, and link out to the GitHub Issues for some of the unsupported features, in hopes of making life easier for users and encouraging contributions.</p>

Migration is performed by uploading an exported copy of an existing HipChat workspace so that the tool can automatically re-create all of the users and rooms (including messages and attachments) on your new Matrix homeserver. Once the migration is complete all of the migrated users will be emailed with login instructions, so that they can seamlessly continue chatting where they left off in HipChat. If your organisation (or if you know of an organisation that) has not yet decided what to do when Stride &amp; HipChat is discontinued next month, come and try Modular!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Dendrite audit is over! A bunch of issues have been created on the Dendrite GitHub repository, as well as a project board in order to keep track of everything: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/projects/2">https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/projects/2
</a>There's a fair amount of issues that have been labeled as “good first issue”, so feel free to pick them up and open pull requests if you're looking into hacking on Dendrite! :)</p>

This is a big step as TAs play a key role in Informo's trust/reputation system!</p>
<p>In the meantime, we've also opened <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCS #19</a>, which proposes a rework of the specs' introduction with the idea to give newcomers a more accessible and immediate way to figure out what Informo is about, and give them some starting points so they can dive deeper into it if interested. It's a rather small one and we'd love people to give it a look so we can aim for the most newcomer-friendly version possible</p>

<p>We've also just opened <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCS #21</a> which specifies a way for a source to change the Matrix user it uses to publish articles (e.g. if it was previously using a server managed by non trustworthy people). As with all of our proposals introducing changes in behaviour, it's open for people to share their comments on it for the next 7 days.</p>

<p>matrix-client.el gained more room sorting options and a /priority command to set room priority. It also includes a workaround for a Google Chrome drag-and-drop bug on Linux, so now Chrome users can drag-and-drop URLs, files, and images directly into room buffers to upload them.</p>
<p>matrix-client.el gained a new notifications-buffer feature that shows notifications from multiple rooms in a single list, allowing you to easily monitor multiple rooms at once and jump to events in them.<br />e.g. I can see messages from #matrix and #twim in the same window, and reply to messages in both rooms from the same prompt</p>

All that's left to do now is some triaging in the data (<a href="https://cloud.abolivier.bzh/index.php/s/qXi2KFjCQk2c6eG">which is available here</a>, by the way), into order to have a clear view on what's left to do in the audit.

<h2 id="informo-news">Informo news</h2>
<p>Informo is a project intended to enable information sharing, especially for vulnerable activists. It is enabled by Matrix. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@vabd:weu.informo.network">vabd</a>, the mystery individual behind the project announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs-bot">specs bot</a>, which shouts in Matrix rooms when the state of a proposal to a specs project changes, got an upgrade: it now handles concurrency better, and can now send multiple messages if multiple matching labels are added to the proposal in the same action (before, it just wouldn't know what to do in such an event and would fail silently).</p>

<h2 id="msc-chatbot">msc-chatbot</h2>
<p>The MSC process is <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">the formal process by which changes are submitted</a> to become part of the Matrix specification. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> has been working on a bot to help with the process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/msc-chatbot">msc-chatbot</a> now exists. It has commands that let you view the status of current MSCs, as well as a daily summary of MSCs to keep people up to date.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-minecraft-bridge">Matrix-Minecraft bridge</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>, as if he has time to be working on such things, has announced the revival of his Matrix-Minecraft bridge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've brought my Matrix&lt;--&gt;Minecraft bridge back to life in the form of a Bukkit plugin. It's still in the very early stages of development and requires you to compile it yourself to get it, but it is a thing. Check it out on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-minecraft">https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-minecraft</a><br />It'll be designed to work as a public hosted bridge, so someone could use t2bot.io to bridge their minecraft server (for example)</p>

<h2 id="xmpp-as-jabber-turns-20">XMPP (as Jabber) turns 20</h2>
<p>As noted in <a href="https://xmpp.org/2019/01/the-xmpp-newsletter-4-january-2019/">The XMPP Newsletter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today is Jabber's 20th anniversary! Jabber would later be standardized and renamed to XMPP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this subject, it's always worth thinking about the importance of openness and interoperability in messaging. This <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/lessons-vendor-lock-messaging">recent article in Linux Journal</a> is a reminder of the need to avoid proprietary vendor lock in, and mentions both XMPP and Matrix.</p>

<p>It's the 28th of December as I write this, and I hope you had a good year. Long as it is, I recommend reading <a href="/blog/2018/12/25/the-2018-matrix-holiday-special/">Matthew's write-up of the year</a>, as it covers a lot of ground!</p>
<p>Many of the core team have been out of the office this week, but there are still plenty of updates to share from the Matrix ecosystem!</p>
<h2 id="mxisd-v1-2-2">mxisd v1.2.2</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> released mxisd v1.2.2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a> had a Holiday-special release: <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.2.2">v1.2.2</a> before v1.3.0.</p>
<p>This release introduces two new big features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Username login rewriting via 3PID to allow advanced flows, like bypassing the synapse restriction of having numerical usernames for non-guest users</li>
 	<li>Support for multiple Base DNs for LDAP backends</li>
</ul>
Work has started on v1.3.0 so this is definitely the last release before a non-backward compatible release.

<p><a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma-desktop">koma-desktop</a> is updated to JavaFx 11 and installation is simplified. Dependencies, including native modules can be packaged into one single file, which only needs to be downloaded and run. Java Runtime 11 is the only runtime dependency. Now it's just cross-compilation that needs to be set up before packaged releases can be provided for Mac, Windows, and Linux users.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:feneas.org">Jason Robinson</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started work on a Prometheus Alertmanager bot for Matrix. The basic idea is that Alertmanager can send webhook alert events to the bot which will then send the formatted events to configured rooms based on the alert receiver. It works, but is still early work in progress. See code and info here: <a href="https://git.feneas.org/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager">https://git.feneas.org/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager</a>.</p>

<p><a href="@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre Franke</a>:</p>

<p>As expected the Fractal team released 4.0 and is already hard at work on the next micro version. We recommend <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Fractal">getting it from Flathub</a> like we usually do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Enhanced history view with adaptive layout, day divider</li>
 	<li>Reorganised headerbar, app menu merged with user menu</li>
 	<li>Larger display of emoji-only messages</li>
 	<li>Some performance improvements</li>
 	<li>Opening a room jumps to first unread message</li>
</ul>
Bugfixes:

<blockquote>
<p>The new command handling system in maubot is ready. The new system should be much nicer to use when developing plugins.</p>
<p>Previously <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a> had a system that was designed after the improved bot support spec proposal, but it wasn't very nice or pythonic. If/when the proposal or something similar goes through, I'll probably add support for it in the new command handling system.</p>
<p>Next I'll make some developer docs so that other people could actually make their own plugins.</p>
<p>The code is at <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">https://github.com/maubot/maubot</a> and you can ask about maubot in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#maubot:maunium.net">#maubot:maunium.net</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/apps/matrix-to">https://github.com/apps/matrix-to</a> is a Github App which makes use of their shiny and new Content Attachments API/Webhook. When a <code>matrix.to</code> or <code>view.matrix.org</code> URL is used this app is activated. It adds a little snippet with the Room Title and Topic (if the room is peekable from matrix.org). In future it'll work for event permalinks, but currently there is no support for peeking context/event in Matrix API.</p>

<p>You may have seen that <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> been working fearlessly and tirelessly on bridges for many, many months. In this episode of Matrix Live Half-Shot chats with Matthew about his work, progress and achievements, with a focus on recent <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a> and XMPP work. Audio is not amazing, but worth listening to get acquainted with recent work.</p>

<p>As a note from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a> bridge gained a XMPP specific backend for better performance when you want to do just xmpp bridging. It's rather quick right now, and needs dogfooding.</p>

<p>Developers and creators of <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a>, the GNOME Matrix client, have been holding a <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/FractalDecember2018">Hackfest this week in Seville</a>. Matthew and I caught up with them on video for Matrix Live this week, and discussed the product improvements they've been making and their plans for the next release (due next week!)</p>

<h2 id="this-week-in-ruma">This Week in Ruma</h2>
<p>We don't often get to feature news from <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">Ruma</a>, but this week there is an updated <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/this-week-in-ruma-2018-12-09/">This Week in Ruma</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ruma is not dead, however, and small improvements have continued over the last year. The Matrix spec has advanced quite a bit and many of the blocking issues for Ruma have been resolved. Rust's maturity is another story. async/await is still under development and this is the most significant blocking issue to progress on Ruma.</p>

<h2 id="maubot-new-tooling">maubot new tooling</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been working on tooling for <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>maubot got a command-line tool for building plugins and managing maubot instances. I also added some server-side stuff for easy registration of accounts in the management interface using synapse shared secrets, but the UI for that isn't ready.
Also, I'm planning on adding some kind of small Matrix client in the management interface for manually managing the added bot clients. That might lead to a separate library that could be used in other projects or embedded in websites.</p>

<h2 id="mxisd-v1-2-1-released-updating-recommended">mxisd v1.2.1 released, updating recommended</h2>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> with a new release of <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a> hits <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.2.1">v1.2.1</a> with a new maintenance release, fixing bugs and regressions from v1.2.0. Updating to v1.2.1 is strongly encouraged as v1.3.x will contain breaking changes and will not be a straight-forward update like v1.x has been until now.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has reported that lazy-loading, a Matrix feature that entails only loading room member details as needed, is now in <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> master.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>reference implementation in Quaternion will follow up</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> has been testing the feature in <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a>, which uses the library, and says there is a 30%-50% reduction in RAM usage at startup.</p>
