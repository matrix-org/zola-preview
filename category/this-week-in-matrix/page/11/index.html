<p>Hi everyone! Did you ever feel lost in the Matrix world? The room directory is big, but it's still hard to find something you like. Or are you a room
moderator, but there is not much activity in your room because it doesn't have enough users?</p>
<p>This is why I want to share rooms (or spaces) I find interesting.</p>
<hr />
<p>This week's room is: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#art:matrix.org">#art:matrix.org</a></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Share your artwork and drawings and chat about it. You don't have to be good!&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I have spent quite a bit of time lately working on Pinecone network convergence for P2P Matrix. There's still quite a bit to do in order to call Pinecone &quot;complete&quot;, but a network of 50 nodes now bootstraps entirely from cold much more quickly and converges on full end-to-end reachability in roughly 6 seconds. This is a significant improvement to before! Keep an eye out for future P2P Matrix demo builds using these new protocol changes.</p>

<p>This week I implemented the remaining API route for URL previewing. Already has some nicer url preview results like showing images with Twitter posts and proper YouTube previews instead of the cookie wall text :)</p>
<p>With this, synapse-media-proxy <em>should</em> be a drop-in overlay for all Synapse's /_matrix/media routes.
I don't really recommend using it in prod yet however, but I have a test instance that could use some responsible disclosure pentesting at https://media.pixie.town, please DM me <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:pixie.town">@f0x:pixie.town</a> if you find anything :) </p>

<p>üö™ Knock, knock... It's Friday!</p>
<p>After over a year of work and over a hundred commits, we're now one <em>major</em> step closer to supporting <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC 2403: Add &quot;Knock&quot; feature</a>, which allows users to request admission to rooms which would otherwise be invite-only. Specifically, last Wednesday we merged (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6739">#6739</a>) which is an experimental implementation of the MSC, under an unstable prefix. Knocking is not available in any current room versions ‚Äî we need to implement room version 7 for that ‚Äî but the remaining work is minimal¬π compared to what it took to get to this point. üôÇ Major kudos to Sorunome, Anoa, and Clokep for their work on both the spec and implementation.</p>
<p>Otherwise we're looking forward to releasing Synapse 1.36 early next week, and we have some great things in store... but I'll not spoil them today! ü§´</p>
<p>From everyone on the Synapse team, have a great weekend!</p>

<p>Hi folks. Some time ago I asked here about any projects that provided a local Matrix &quot;node&quot; through docker, and it seemed not much existed in that space, so I went ahead and created the following repo:</p>

<li>element: a web-based Matrix client</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks, just a quick update on the Libera.chat bridge situation. We're still rapidly working on the bridge, the milestone highlights for this week are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nearly 6k Matrix users are now connected to IRC and growing by the minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're midway though our #matrix* Freenode to Libera channel/bridge migrations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FOSDEM has been migrated over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're still working through our backlog of migration requests from users, a lot of you phoned in!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We're still continuing to rapidly work on the bridge, with a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases">release expected</a> on Monday ü§û. For any of you who aren't in the know yet, you can start bridging to libera.chat by simply joining a channel like <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libera-matrix:libera.chat">#libera-matrix:libera.chat</a> or by searching the <code>libera.chat</code> room directory.</p>
<p>I'm hoping we'll be nearing the end of our journey on this bridge, and it will settle into a natural stable state over the coming days! Anyway, thanks everyone for your patience and we hope to see you on Matrix or IRC!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi bridge followers, today we've released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.27.0-rc1">0.27.0-rc1</a> of the IRC bridge containing a huge number of changes following all the work we've been doing on libera.chat. Notable things to call out in this release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We've refactored the node-irc library to be typescripty and modern, rather than the quite old JS that it was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SASL support for username/password auth has landed, which hopefully means a smoother login process for many. (We're aware of some issues around setting usernames, watch this space)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing you to spin up the bridge with complete control over the alias namespace of a host (e.g. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libera:libera.chat">#libera:libera.chat</a> links to #libera).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally, a privacy feature to block incoming IRC messages when Matrix users are not all joined which is requested by some IRC networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please report bugs as you see them to https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc, and let's all pray this will be a smooth release :)</p>

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Read receipt improvements are here! They are in temporary branches until they've been tested for stability:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>better-receipts-dm</code> branch contains some smarts to prevent Puppeteer from having to &quot;view&quot; a LINE DM chat in order to sync it, which would make the contact you're DMing think you've read their messages when it was really Puppeteer that &quot;saw&quot; them. However, this doesn't work for non-text messages (like images) or messages in group chats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>better-receipts-msc2409</code> branch (which extends the above branch) uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2409">MSC2409</a> to detect when you read a bridged message on Matrix, so it can tell Puppeteer to view it on LINE on your behalf. This will let your LINE contacts know when you've read their messages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After this, only a few read receipt improvements are left to be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make Puppeteer check all LINE chats (not just the most recently-used one) to see if messages you sent have been read (in LINE). This will work by cycling through all LINE chats where the final message is posted by you and doesn't have a &quot;Read&quot; marker on it yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use MSC2409 to avoid having to view a LINE chat when syncing non-text messages (like images). The idea is to send a placeholder message that will get replaced with the real message (which requires Puppeteer to view the LINE chat) only when you actually view the placeholder.</p>
</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I've been slowly refactoring the room and communities list to prepare it for spaces. This work is now mostly complete, changing ~4000 lines of code, of which 1500 just got deleted. All of the sidebars are now expandable and collapsible, so you can see the full name of your tags and communities and the lists should also update more dynamically now. Startup also only takes half as long as before on my system and Nheko uses 100MB less memory for my account. Next week I'll probably add spaces to the communities list as well as the room list.</p>
<p>Apart from that LorenDB has been rewriting the member list as well as the invite dialog in Qml and manu has been making progress on the room directory. All of that seems to be coming along nicely and behave much more reasonably than the old versions. There has also been a lot of progress on the Italian and Esperanto translations as well as a few smaller bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>I hope we will make it to space next week!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week was a busy week for NeoChat. We added tons of cool stuff! We rewrote the setting page to add a bit of organization in the settings. This also pushed us to add new appearance options. You can now add a blur effect as background, change the color scheme of NeoChat and switch between bubbles and a more compact layout as you wish.</p>

<p>Another thing we worked on was spellchecking. NeoChat will now add a small red underline under misspelled words and will suggest corrections. This is using the Sonnet frameworks and will integrates perfectly with your personal dictionary from your other KDE apps.</p>

<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>

<p>This week the Spec Core Team has been reviewing various Spaces MSCs, most recently <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3230">MSC3230</a> (Space ordering). We're also hoping to square away the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issuecomment-655153491">aggregations MSCs</a> (message editing, reactions, etc) once and for all, though this will likely take a concerted effort from a few members to pull off.</p>
<p>Finally <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231">MSC3231</a> is a (currently draft status) MSC from Callum, one of Matrix.org's <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021">GSoC students</a> this year! His project aims to allow native token-based registration to homeservers (the idea is so that you can generate a few tokens from your registration-disabled homeserver and hand them out to a few trusted friends and family members).</p>
<p>And finally, work still continues on finishing up the technical portions of the new release process for the spec. As mentioned last week, we've attempted to split the work up over multiple people in order to get it done quicker. Slowly but surely...</p>

<p>Another round of updates on my smart caching media proxy. After refactoring a lot (as always), I implemented <strong>thumbnailing</strong>! Now the only big feature left to add is url previewing.
I also have a test deployment configured on media.pixie.town now, so you can try fetching a bit of remote media through there, or view <a href="https://media.pixie.town/_matrix/media/r0/download/media.pixie.town/GLhyjFL8MPAzz5Oh1gIzF3lQ">this submissions screenshot</a></p>

<ul>

<li>Improve resiliency of LINE user avatar syncing.</li>
<li>Properly support syncing LINE rooms with participants who aren't in your LINE friends list (This was harder than it sounds...!)</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes (and ones before it) will be merged to <code>master</code> once I reorganize some messy commits.</p>
<p>The next big task is still to fix outbound read receipts (i.e. to make it so that the bridge syncing a message doesn't make your &gt; LINE contacts think you actually read that message). Once that is done, I'll consider the bridge to be in beta.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://thunderbird.net">Thunderbird</a> now has Matrix support based on <code>matrix-js-sdk</code> enabled in the Nightly builds.</p>
<p>The star feature is probably that we support multiple Matrix accounts in the same client. Right now all your unencrypted rooms with text messages should work fine. While we think we won't destroy your account's state, it's still recommended to use a testing account with it. During account setup, it will ask you for a password, even if the homeserver supports SSO. If you intend to log in through SSO, just leave the password field blank.</p>
<p>We're not quite at the point where we support all the things you love about chatting with Matrix. Many of the missing features and polish to make communication successful are tracked in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1712710">this meta bug</a>. The goal for that milestone is to enable Matrix in our Beta builds.</p>
<p>You can get a Thunderbird Nightly build at the bottom of <a href="https://thunderbird.net/#channel">thunderbird.net</a> by switching from &quot;Beta Channel&quot; to &quot;Nightly Channel&quot;. If you run into bugs with the Matrix integration, please report them through <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Chat%20Core&amp;component=Matrix">this form</a>.

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Callum, our GSoC student, after spending some time on Synapse, had now his first go at Nheko's codebase. He implemented, that you can now just enter the server name on registration instead of the full URL. This means entering conduit.rs or matrix.org works now nicely, since those servers are actually hosted at a different URL. He's now working on the Token Registration MSC, which he will implement in Synapse and Nheko, so exciting times ahead!</p>
<p>We also had a small contribution from pcworld, who fixed that if you only viewed the room list in the narrow layout, you would not get notifications for the last selected room.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with some words, that you may have heard a few times already: &quot;Watch this space for next weeks update!&quot;</p>

<p>I've been working on a smart media worker/proxy, to offload initial spikes in traffic for homeservers behind slower network uplinks.</p>
<p>There's a <code>&lt;remote&gt;</code> component that sits on a small vps, handling the upload and download endpoints (and soon, thumbnails), with an in-memory cache to quickly respond to requests.
Media still gets forwarded to the <code>&lt;local&gt;</code> component where it gets stored in Synapse's media folder with an accompanying database entry, so all media is still stored long-term in the way Synapse expects it to be, so the proxy can be removed at any point. </p>
<p>Currently not production ready but you're welcome to snoop around the repo :)</p>

<p>Hey folks, some of you (well, frankly most of you) wanted to hear about our plans for libera.chat. I've been hard at work
this week building a brand new bridge which is hosted on the libera.chat homeserver and it's nearly ready to go. We're just making a few final
preparations before taking it out of beta, but it's currently available as a portaling bridge. You can currently reach any channel on libera.chat by joining
<code>#&lt;channel_name&gt;:libera.chat</code>. You can also add the homeserver to your room directory in your Matrix client to search all the bridged rooms.</p>
<p>We're also hanging out in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libera-matrix:libera.chat">#libera-matrix:libera.chat</a>, if you have any questions. Of course, the bridge is proving to be very popular so please be patient :)</p>

it all together in such short notice.</p>

<h4 id="plumbing-irc-channels-older-wrench">Plumbing IRC channels üßë‚Äçüîß</h4>
<p>Somewhat experimental feature that has landed this week is the ability to use single puppeting in a public Matrix room to bridge IRC channels.</p>
<p>This support comes through a new <code>PLUMB</code> admin command for network rooms that will ask the bridge bot to join a public Matrix room and an IRC channel.</p>
<p>On IRC side there will be only a single user/bot that will relay messages from Matrix users. This is a stop-gap between fully puppeting Matrix users on IRC and doesn't need explicit permission from an IRC network to use by channel operators as long as bots are allowed.</p>
<p>On Matrix side puppets will join and leave based on their presence on the IRC channel. The bridge bot does not need any special permissions in a room as it doesn't do permission synchronization so it can be kept without any power levels.</p>
<p>Unplumbing a room is as simple as kicking the bridge out and it will take the puppets with it.</p>
<p>As this is a fairly new feature it does have some rough edges so feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>With all this said, if you're in the need to bridge any IRC channel on any network with little friction, Heisenbridge should have you covered!</p>
<h4 id="sasl-support-unloc">SASL support üîí</h4>
<p>If you're using Heisenbridge to connect to Libera.Chat from a network block that has SASL enforcement enabled (like some VPS providers) you can now configure SASL credentials to authenticate at connection time to bypass this restriction.</p>
<p>This only implements SASL PLAIN for now. Certificate authentication may be looked at in the future.</p>

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line">matrix-puppeteer-line</a> is a 
bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net">Fair</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week brings a variety of assorted bugfixes &amp; feature improvements in the <code>testing</code> branch. Included are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for <code>m.sticker</code> events for LINE stickers (with an option to use <code>m.image</code> if preferred)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear resolution of LINE emojis, and a config option to scale them (since they're tiny by default)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less frequent re-downloading of already-seen LINE stickers/emoji (there are limits to this, but it's still an improvement)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Option to disable syncing LINE stickers/emoji (in case re-hosting LINE imagery is a liability)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More reliable message syncing (should never get &quot;Decrypting message...&quot; or invisible images/stickers/emoji anymore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix crashes during inbound message &amp; read receipt syncing of multi-user rooms</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like last time, testing is much appreciated üòÄ</p>
<p>Remaining big tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rework message syncing so that receiving a message doesn't require &quot;viewing&quot; the LINE chat in the Puppeteer-controlled browser, which will make LINE send a read receipt even though you may not actually have read the message yourself (I mentioned this a while ago; it's still a todo)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for multiple bridge users at once (A public instance of the bridge will only be considered once multi-user support is ready)</p>
</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Since <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/21/this-week-in-matrix-2021-05-21#fractal">last week</a>, a couple things landed in <code>fractal-next</code>. Julian added support for accepting/rejecting invites (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/754">!754</a>/<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/issues/759">#759</a>). K√©vin did an <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/759">internal restructuring of how we handle the SyncResponse in !759</a>. The visible consequence for users is that room categories (also known as tags) are updated directly in Fractal when the user changes it from an other client. He also switched from comrak to <a href="https://docs.rs/ruma/0.1.1/ruma/events/room/message/struct.TextMessageEventContent.html#method.markdown">ruma‚Äôs markdown</a> in <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/756">!756</a>.

<h3 id="element-client-updates">Element Client Updates</h3>
<p>Crafted by the <a href="https://element.io">Element</a> teams.</p>
<p><strong>Delight</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spaces: We‚Äôve been listening to, investigating, triaging and organising feedback from the beta so far. There‚Äôs a lot to get through, but thanks to everyone who has submitted feedback in-app in Element so far! The insight has been invaluable and is instrumental in shaping up our next milestones.</li>
<li>Papercuts: We‚Äôre also organising and fixing small issues throughout Element, biasing for highly visible issues which have the greatest impact and reach, affectionately titled ‚Äòpapercuts‚Äô. Expect more info on these soon, but for now a fun one to highlight is we‚Äôre implementing <a href="https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash">blurhash</a> on Web &amp; Android (with iOS to follow soon after) to improve previewing and viewing images, especially when on low bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Web</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1.7.29 released
<ul>
<li>Improved startup performance by focusing decryption on recent rooms</li>
<li>Fixed reaction duplication</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sorting out why we sometimes see &quot;<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/9422#issuecomment-843366412">missing translations</a>&quot; hopefully for good this time</li>
<li>Continuing to improve application performance</li>
<li>Started work on Apple silicon desktop builds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We continued to work on technical subjects:
<ul>
<li>Stabilisation and performance improvements</li>
<li>New logging system. It will be possible to disable all logs for MatrixSDK, MatrixKit and Element-iOS</li>
<li>The code that manages application navigation in Element-iOS has been updated. It will allow us to add a slide menu to display things like user spaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Element Android 1.1.8 has been released on the beta track of the Google PlayStore. It will probably be pushed to production at the beginning of next week. The Android matrix SDK2 has also been released.</li>
<li>This week, we implemented the ability to change the network when looking in the room directory. Also gitter.im has been added to the default network list. See some screenshots in <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/3419">https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/3419</a> </li>
<li>Lots of improvements regarding Spaces have also landed to develop.</li>
<li>Besides that, we are still fixing issues and perform regular maintenance on the project</li>

<p>However, there were quite a few other fixes, improvements, and additions: I'd encourage you to read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/17/synapse-1-34-0-released">release announcement</a> for those.</p>
<p>But more than anything, we're hard at work realizing the room-join memory improvements we talked about in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=694VuhmVmfo">last week's Matrix Live</a>, and we expect to have some exciting news to share next week. Concretely: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9958">the pull request</a> to support incremental parsing of join responses was merged, and several pull requests (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10017">#10017</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10018">#10018</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10035">#10035</a>) to simplify and slim down the code for verifying event signatures are in review.</p>

<p>As announced in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021#fractal">the general Matrix GSoC post</a>, we are lucky to get two interns this year again. Alejandro (whose previous work includes <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/626">switching to matrix-rust-sdk for syncs</a>) will implement multi-account support, while Kai (also <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;state=merged&amp;author_username=V02460">a regular contributor</a> by now) will help bring our application rewrite to the same functionality level as our current nightly and stable versions. Both projects will build on top of Fractal Next.</p>
<p>Julian came back from his vacation and immediately got quite busy reviewing and merging contributions from others. Kevin (also known as zecakeh) and him made good progress on several fronts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Room handling was improved. We now keep track of whether the user joined them, left them, or has been invited to them, as well as their categories (favourites, low priority‚Ä¶).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sidebar uses these categories and now uses a single list with <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/git/docs/gtk4/struct.FilterListModel.html">GtkFilterListModels</a> instead of one list per category. The greatly simplifies code for things like moving a room from one category to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>History style has been tweaked, state events and timestamps have been added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markdown can be enabled from the newly implemented popover and the message composer offers syntax highlighting, although a bug currently makes it so that sent messages are still not sent with a <code>formatted_body</code>.</p>

<h3 id="ruma">Ruma</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ruma.io/">Ruma</a> is a set of Rust library crates around Matrix</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org">jplatte</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've been quiet in the past weeks, but certainly not due to lack of activity! So many awesome things have happened, I don't even know where to start. I guess I'll go chronologically:</p>
<p><strong>We published so many new crate releases.</strong> Most of our crates didn't see non-alpha releases for almost a year and now we've finally reset that counter! Now you can depend on <code>ruma 0.1</code> and get bug fixes and new functionality through <code>cargo update</code> without having to worry about breaking changes. Huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">@zecakeh</a> for automating our release process, without that this would have taken so much longer.</p>
<p><strong>We got initial spaces support!</strong> I'm super excited that we're now enabling client authors to take spaces into account, even if &quot;taking into account&quot; will initially just mean filtering out space rooms from their room lists. Code-wise, this was actually a <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/585">relatively small change</a>, with ruma-client-api receiving support for room types and ruma-events receiving support for the event types <code>m.space.child</code> and <code>m.space.parent</code>.</p>
<p><strong>We're swapping out ruma-signatures' crypto library.</strong> Since <code>ring</code>, which is what we've been using so far, doesn't currently support cross-compilation to WASM, there's long been some interest to exchange it for something else for webbrowser homeserver experiments. A viable alternative library was identified a while ago and now <a href="https://github.com/ShadowJonathan">@ShadowJonathan</a> has taken on the task of <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/589">implementing the switch</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to unblocking the WASM usecase, this work <a href="https://github.com/briansmith/ring/issues/1299">revealed a bug in <code>ring</code></a>, which generated invalid PKCS#8 documents. We are pretty confident that once the switch away from <code>ring</code> (including a small compatibility shim to convert the invalid documents), a certain class of signature verification failures that Conduit has been getting will be fixed.</p>
<p><strong>We're taking part in GSoC again.</strong> As you might have seen in the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021">earlier blog post</a>, two students are working on Ruma as part of GSoC this year: <a href="https://github.com/Frinksy">@Frinksy</a> (for the first time) and <a href="https://github.com/DevinR528">@DevinR528</a> (for the second time).</p>

<p>The issue can be followed at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/10021</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some combination of me, Kegan, Bruno and neilalexander have been working on v3 of the CS /sync API. (Today's /sync API in matrix is v2; v1 was the old /events API).  We're not yet at the point of publishing a draft or MSC, but it's coming soon. It's really exciting work which flips Matrix around so that sync scales independently of the number of rooms you're in - and it's at last possible to write rich clients which only ever sync the bare minimum data needed to work: i.e. lazy loading eeeeeeeeverything.  Watch this space :)</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.</p>
<h4 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h4>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3192">MSC3192: Batch state endpoint</a></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs entered proposed FCP state this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MSCs in Final Comment Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs are in FCP.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merged MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3122">MSC3122: Deprecate starting verifications without requesting first</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="merged-spec-prs">Merged Spec PRs</h4>
<p>Here are all the actual MSC-related changes made to the raw Matrix spec this week!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3179">Clarify that implementations can use stable prefixes once an MSC proposal has merged</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>There's been activity from the Spec Core Team on a number of different MSCs, such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3189">MSC3189</a> (per-room/space profile data). Additionally a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3168">spec PR</a> for Matrix URI schemes has been getting feedback and is moving forward at a quick pace! There was also some feedback from the team on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2448">MSC2448</a> (blurhashes) which I'll get around to answering shortly üôÇ.</p>
<p>Otherwise I think this week was a bit implementation-heavy for the team (the Spec Core Team is a task in addition to our full-time jobs). Hopefully next week will grant us more of a breather.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You can now <strong>disable</strong> the kick behaviour of the bridge on Matrix users if you are running a personal bridge, so losing your IRC connection no longer results in a kick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now remove bridges from rooms by using the admin room, so no need to use the provisioning API or modify the DB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've added a new feature to allow you to specify bridge options on a per room basis using room state. At the moment you can modify the limits of the automatic pastebin system but more features like reply formats are to come!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first iteration of visually representing the data gathered by Server Stats Discoverer (traveler bot)  is now publicly available at https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/</p>
<p>It for now is only a graph of room relations but in the future is supposed to be extended for a server based graph as well as a Table to search your room within.</p>
<p>Be aware that the page is best viewed and used on desktop. Clicking a Room Node will open a new tab with the matrix.to link. If this fails this might be because of no canonical alias being available.</p>
<p>For the developers the data can be taken from https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev/relations  The format currently is only available in the d3js format but in the future that API also will be extended for different usecases.</p>
<p>For any feedback like accessibility issues or other issues please reach out to me either via DM or in #server_stats:nordgedanken.dev </p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>A reminder that <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> is available to communicate directly with the Spec Core Team. A clarification from the last edition of TWIM is that this room is intended to be a low-traffic room solely for asking about the status of a/your MSC, rather than the Spec process or anything else. There is however <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org</a> for discussion of the Spec process, and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> for discussion of the Matrix spec and MSCs in general.</p>
<p>Otherwise the Spec Core Team has been doing a little bit of house-keeping. For those that have been living under a rock, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">Spaces</a> is an upcoming feature intended to replace the old Groups/Community stuff with a much-improved implementation. And one that will actually make it into the spec! We've closed all old groups-related MSCs as they are now obsolete.</p>
<p>Additionally we've been giving some feedback on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946</a> (Spaces Summary) which is another part of the Spaces puzzle (and is still a blocker for the release of the feature), as well as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3079">MSC3079</a> (Low Bandwidth CS API) which allows Matrix to operate on resource constrained devices and networks. Yours truly has also been making some PRs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3180">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3179">two</a>) to help clarify the Spec process.</p>

<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a release! <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/05/synapse-1-33-0-released">Synapse 1.33 is out</a>, and we plan to release a security patch for it on Tuesday, May 11th. This follows our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/discussions/9914">previous discussion</a> where we committed to trying to decouple routine security updates from our regular feature releases.</p>
<p>Read the release notes for details, but the big news is that we finally have experimental support for moving presence off of the main process. We're still testing it, but we hope it will allow instances that need presence to more easily scale out.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/04/30/this-week-in-matrix-2021-04-30#synapse">last week's TWiM</a> we shared a graph of Synapse's memory use when joining Matrix HQ for the first time. In particular, we saw a spike to 1.4 GB before settling at 800 MB.</p>
<p>In the week since producing that graph, we've managed to nearly eliminate the spike, halving it to 760 MB. After backfilling history, the room settles at around 650 MB:</p>

<p>These changes are still a work in progress, but we hope to get them merged into Synapse in time for the 1.35 release on June 1st.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> has a request:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote a patch for synapse, that reduces the size of almost empty incremental syncs by 50% (30% if you include http headers). If you are a client developer, you may want to test your client against a synapse with that patch applied, since it broke quite a few clients, that relied on synapse sending empty fields. While synapse sends empty fields, other server implementations, like conduit, don't, so fixing any issues here will help with portability across different server implementations too. With a bit of hope this patch can actually be applied in a few weeks to the official synapse, but it was backed out from the next RC because of the breakage. So if you can, please test your client, which you are developing, against the following PR and fix any issues you experience from it: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9919</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

Setup instructions are on docs.mau.fi: https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/imessage/ios/setup.html</p>
<p>Brooklyn was developed by ethanrdoesmc. It's an app/tweak that handles communicating with iMessage and runs mautrix-imessage as a subprocess for the Matrix side.

<h3 id="fluffychat">FluffyChat</h3>
<p><a href="https://fluffychat.im">FluffyChat</a> is the cutest cross-platform matrix client. It is available for Android, iOS, Web and Desktop.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">krille</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FluffyChat 0.30.0 has been released</p>
<p>In this release we have mostly focused on bugfixing and stability. We have switched to the new Flutter 2 framework and have done a lot of refactoring under the hood. The annoying freezing bug should now be fixed. Voice messages now have a new backend which should improve the sound quality and stability. There is now a more professional UI for editing aliases of a room. Users can now see a list of all aliases, add new aliases, delete them and mark one alias as the canonical (or main) alias. Some minor design changes and design fixes should improve the overall UX of the app exspecially on tablets.</p>
<p>Version 0.30.0 will be the first version with arm64 support. You can download binaries from the CI and we will try to publish it on Flathub. Together with the new Linux Desktop Notifications feature, this might be interesting for the Librem 5 or the PinePhone. Sadly I don't own one of these very interesting devices. If you have one, I would very like to see some screenshots of it! :-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shiny:shine.horse">Shine</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fluffychat update: Native Fluffychat Linux build now works well on aarch64 devices!</p>
<p>If you want to try the binary from CI, keep in mind that GDK_GL=gles needs to be set to force it to use the OpenGL ES. Flatpak build on Flathub already has it set up and works out of the box.</p>
<p>Some distributions can have issues with input fields and virtual keyboard, making it look like the input is set up as right-to-left. To my understanding, it's an issue of certain older GTK versions with Flutter.</p>

<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now should stop showing you actions, that you can't do anyway, because that is confusing and useless. This includes the following and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Invite members, if you have no invite permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete messages, if you don't have redaction permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send a message, reply to one, edit one and more, if you can't even send the message!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell us, if we missed something or we removed an action, that you actually have permissions to do!</p>
<p>Apart from that we also started working on some of the features for the next major release. That release will mostly focus on bringing End-to-End-Encryption out of beta. As a first step, Nheko now shows if a message was sent from a verified device or not. This has 3 different trust levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>green</strong>: The message is from a device you verified. Either by device verification or cross signing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>greyish</strong>: The message is from an unverified device, but that user has never rotated their master signing key and has cross-signed that device. As such we can probably assume, that this is a trusted device. For extra safety, you should of course verify that user, but if it is just an internet personality you will never meet, you trust you are speaking to the right party anyway and can't really verify them anyway, since you don't know how they look either! We don't want to prompt users with red warning signs in such cases, which will lead to them not doing verification properly, because they just want the red marks to go away. Many people are also not interested in the MITM aspects of E2EE. We think this is an okay tradeoff, but any feedback is welcome of course! This is basically Trust On First Use (TOFU), if you heard that term before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>red</strong>: The device is not verified. This can have a few reasons. Either we verified the user, but they didn't verify that device. Or we didn't verify that user and they have changed their master key at some point. Or the signatures for that device are wrong, etc. If you see such a device, you should probably investigate, why that is the case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some biggish changes, so if you experience issues, tell us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im">#nheko:nheko.im</a>!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Comment sections can now be initialized using <code>data-*</code> attributes on the <code>script</code> tag (Thanks to @NicolaiSoeborg for !5).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow using strings for any config parameter, including booleans and numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users can now set a displayname when commenting as a guest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some styling improvements for text inputs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://latest.cactus.chat">/ipns/latest.cactus.chat</a> is updated to point to the latest release, so sites linking there should already be using the new version.</p>

<p>I did a video a few months back trying to show the physical layout of Matrix over the years by looking at the phonehome stats and the number of active users per server (showing full-mesh edges between the top 100 servers, heatmapped by how busy the servers were at either end of the edge).  There was a bug in the phonehome stats during 2017, but it's still fairly cool...</p>

<h4 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h4>
<p>We've opened up a new room for MSC authors to come and ask about the MSC process, as well as for review and feedback on their MSC ideas over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a>. If you're unsure what the next steps for your MSC are, or aren't sure whether an idea would make sense for inclusion in the Matrix Specification, then this room is the perfect place to ask about it. Come on by!</p>
<p>In terms of MSC work, Spaces remains one of the most active topics in the spec this week, with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1772">MSC1772</a> finally reaching Final Comment Period! A lot of work went into writing and reviewing the MSC, as well as crafting the implementation - so congratulations to everyone involved! Of course, any concerns can still be raised over the next 5 days by anyone before the proposal is ultimately merged to the spec.</p>
<p>There are a number of changes being merged to the spec as we move swiftly towards the next major Spec release. Those that have merged this week are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3154">MSC2403: Knocking and MSC2998: Room Version 7</a></p>

<p>We expect to release 1.33 on Tuesday; more on that next week.

<p>At a first pass, we're aiming to significantly reduce the initial spikiness of that graph, and we <em>think</em> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9910">#9910</a> will help with the subsequent slow ramp up in memory.</p>

<p>Announcing a new bouncer style Matrix IRC bridge to <em>bridge</em> the gap between IRC and Matrix in a way that's easy to configure and manage by homeserver administrators for small scale deployment.</p>
<p>Meet Heisenbridge https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge ü•≥ (it's a Breaking Bad reference ü§¶)</p>
<p>It's written in Python and started off as an experiment if it's possible to create a somewhat well performing stateless IRC bridge that's practically almost zero configuration. It quickly found a use case of being able to join !channels on IRCnet that hasn't been possible in the past.</p>
<p>Intended target audience are people who run their own homeserver and would like to transition from a combination like ssh+irssi to pure Matrix (with weechat-matrix, of course!) but still keep IRC close without losing the &quot;fine details&quot; of the protocol that happens when plumbing a room properly.</p>
<p>As the bridge is written by someone who doesn't really know Python help is much appreciated in the form of filing issues, sending pull requests or just discussing about it on Matrix to tell how you would like to use it!</p>

<p><a href="https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line/">matrix-puppeteer-line</a>: A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.</p>
<p>Updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inbound read receipts! But with a view caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Receipts are only fetched for the &quot;most recently active&quot; room.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example: if you send a message in room A, then room B, receipts will only be fetched for room B and not room A, until you (or someone else, from LINE) posts in room A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will be fixed in the next update. I have an idea for some Puppeteer trickery to get it working.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read receipts in group chats are bridged as annotations (reactions) instead of &quot;real&quot; read receipts, until all members of the chat have read a message.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because LINE's read receipts for group chats don't tell show <em>who</em> read a message, but only <em>how many</em> people a message was read by.</li>
<li>To capture this in Matrix, instead of sending read receipts for a group chat message, the bridge puts a reaction of &quot;Read by #&quot; on it, with &quot;#&quot; matching how many people read the message so far. Once everyone in the chat has read a message, the reaction is removed and a &quot;real&quot; receipt is sent for all users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal changes to message syncing that should hopefully make inbound messages more reliable, or the very least improve code maintenance. </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey there, it is your friendly neighborhood cat client! Pardon, chat client!</p>
<p>Jedi18 implemented forwarding of messages. Just select a message and press Alt-F or use the context menu to send a message to the room you select in the popup! This encrypts and decrypts messages and media appropriately, but be aware that sending an encrypted file to an unencrypted room uploads the file unencrypted. (In all other cases the media is not uploaded again.)</p>
<p>Furthermore matrix.to links are now rewritten to matrix:-URIs internally. This means joining rooms and such should now work the same across both of them. It also makes navigation to events work now and even has a shiny highlight effect now! You can also create links to events now from the context menu. These are generated as matrix.to links, since currently the onboarding experience should still be better. Once the next version of the matrix.to website gets deployed, you can even just click there to open the event in Nheko! (Instead of having to copy a <code>/join</code> command).</p>
<p>Since &quot;Copy link to event&quot; was confusing to people and AppAraat opened his present box, only to realize it did not contain &quot;Copy link location&quot;, we implemented that too as well as a copy action, to copy the event body for good measure. I hope everyone who got confused will forgive me!</p>
<p>Apart from that we also updated our screenshots on <a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io/">https://nheko-reborn.github.io/</a> (and all AppStream based store pages) to be higher resolution and reflect the current design. Furthermore we fixed the login on conduit homeservers and that no rooms were shown, if the server didn't support the groups API.</p>
<p>That's all, and keep on c(h)atting! &lt;3</p>

<ul>
<li>We‚Äôve been maturing and iterating on <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/15930">MSC1772</a> in anticipating of wider testing of Spaces in the near future</li>
<li>On Web, we‚Äôve been iterating on designs &amp; implementations for a beta, including tweaking filtering to display rooms from all Spaces</li>
<li>On Android, we‚Äôve been doing the same, and have merged the initial Spaces implementation onto develop</li>
<li>On Synapse, we‚Äôve been implementing restricting rooms based on the Space Summary API</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>1.3.5 has been published to the App Store on Monday.</li>
<li>We have been polishing the new VoIP design this week. It should be merged into develop early next week and released in the App Store the week after.</li>
<li>We want to focus on code quality. We set up GitHub actions in our 3 repos. They run both unit tests and integration tests. We need to fix some of our 600+ tests in the SDK but we now have a CI able to complain about test failures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Spaces have landed on Element Android, on the develop branch. We are working to stabilize the feature before the release in beta next week.</li>
<li>In parallel, we are working to stabilize the whole application, and provide a better support on Android 11.</li>
<li>Also it will be possible in the next release to compress video before sending, which is a very expected feature.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kb1rd:kb1rd.net">KB1RD</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I announced this project last week. It's exactly what it sounds like: A puppetting bridge to puppet a telephone number from Matrix. It's currently pre-alpha and not ready for use on public-facing HSes.</p>
<p>Not too much has happened in the last week as I've been a bit busy. The main thing is that there's now a <a href="https://github.com/KB1RD/matrix-pstn-bridge/tree/voip-dev">dev branch where outbound voice calls work</a>. Other than the 2014 <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2014/11/30/bridging-matrix-sip-via-verto">SIP experiment</a>, I think this is the first bridge to make voice calls work?</p>
<p>I hope having a reference VoIP bridge can help pave the way for more VoIP bridging. I'm already looking into how code can be generalized for other bridges. For example, I've opened an <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk/issues/112">issue in matrix-bot-sdk to add helper classes and stuff for VoIP support</a>. I'd be curious to see how other bridge builders think this could be accomplished. üëÄ</p>

<p>Some context: I like how simple  EMS allows you to setup the Matrix homeserver, but it lacks any internal tuning or customization ability. Do you want more? OK, setup it yourself and try to stay normal while trying to configure coturn to properly run in docker cluster.  Because of that, I did a service where you can order initial setup and configuration of homeserver (yes, with coturn in docker cluster!) <strong>and</strong> with full control of customization and fine-tuning of manual configuration (website even has step-by-step guide how the process works).</p>
<p>It's based on the amazing spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy with additional stuff like system security hardening and maintenance</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev">MTRNord</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of you might already have seen that bot show up in rooms. To clear up some confusion around it I will briefly explain what it does and what it is supposed to do:</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-do">What does it do?</h4>
<p>The Bot is simply existing to do the same task as Matrix Traveler (bot) already did for years now. It joins rooms, listens for an alias, tries to join it.</p>
<p>The main difference between these 2 bots is that my bot also searches for aliases in old messages.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-save">What does it save?</h4>
<p>It only saves the relations between rooms. This means it knows which room was posted where. It doesn't know who posted it, when it was posted, why it was posted or any other content of messages.</p>
<p>However due to matrix' nature it does need to get the data once onto a synapse to read trough it. This means it has the data on my synapse. (Running in helsinki at hetzner).</p>
<h4 id="what-can-i-do-if-i-do-not-want-it">What can I do if I do not want it?</h4>
<p>The easiest way is to just ban it. It will fully forget that room.</p>
<p>Kicking works too but it might again join if it gets found again.</p>
<h4 id="where-is-the-source">Where is the source?</h4>
<p>The source code is available at https://git.nordgedanken.dev/MTRNord/server_stats/-/blob/main/src/bot/mod.rs</p>
<p>For further questions feel free to join #server_stats:nordgedanken.dev</p>
<p>Also note this bot is still very early in development which is why it does not respond to you yet on any commands. This will be added in the near future as well as a readme in the repository</p>

<h3 id="matrix-uri-scheme">Matrix URI scheme</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jboi:jboi.nl">Jonathan</a> noticed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>matrix:</code> URI scheme has just been officially accepted (safelisted) into the HTML standard! üöÄ</p>
<blockquote>
<p>https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/6320</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="what-is-the-matrix-uri-scheme">What is the Matrix URI scheme?</h4>
<p>You are probably familiar with <code>mailto:user@example.com</code> or <code>tel:+1-555-438-3732</code>. The former is usually used to open an email address in your mail client, while the latter is used for phone numbers. This allows applications to register themselves as a handler for it, like for example GMail or Thunderbird, and your browser and other applications can find them and tell them to open an editor or similar, with that identifier as the target. There are also a lot of other applications that have similar schemes like Telegram, Zoom and more.</p>
<p>In Matrix you have similar identifiers, most notably users (@user:example.org) and rooms (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#room:example.org">#room:example.org</a>). The matrix URI scheme now allows you to open such identifiers in your favourite Matrix clients. You can now just click on matrix:u/user:example.org or matrix:r/room:example.org and start chatting with the user or join the room. (There is a bit more to it, you actually need an action after the identifier for it, otherwise it will just open the user profile or show the room, if you are joined to it, but that is the idea. For more details, check https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/proposals/2312-matrix-uri.md )</p>
<p>As you can see the format of the matrix: scheme is a bit different that standard Matrix identifiers. This is mostly because they need to start with <code>scheme:</code>, where <code>scheme</code> is different depending on the application, but some characters are also treated differently in URIs, which is why the matrix scheme decided to avoid them where possible.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-mean-that-the-matrix-scheme-is-now-part-of-the-html-standard">What does it mean, that the matrix: scheme is now part of the HTML standard?</h4>
<p>In general desktop and mobile clients could already implement the Matrix scheme before, FluffyChat, Quaternion, gomuks and Nheko have even done so already. This means if you are using those clients, you can already use the Matrix scheme today!</p>
<p>On the web things are a bit more difficult though. Since you don't want arbitrary websites to intercept arbitrary schemes, schemes need to be safelisted in the HTML spec/browsers. So today web clients can't be registered to open matrix: URIs. But the first step is done now. The HTML spec now officially lists <code>matrix:</code> as a safelisted scheme.</p>
<h4 id="next-steps">Next steps</h4>
<p>For web clients like Element to be able to open matrix: URIs, a few more things need to happen.</p>
<ol>
<li>Browsers need to implement the HTML standard change and allow web apps to register the Matrix scheme.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Status in Firefox: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1688030</li>
<li>Status in Chrome(ium): https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1169258</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Web clients need to actually implement handling <code>matrix:</code> URIs.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Tracking issue for Element: https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/16875</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be wondering about matrix.to, which was used to share matrix identifiers before. In the long term matrix URIs will probably replace it. Watch the next few TWIMs to find out what happens and/or subscribe to the following issues: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to/issues/191 https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to/issues/192</p>
<h4 id="closing-words">Closing words</h4>
<p>As you can see, this was a big step for Matrix as a whole. This of course couldn't have been possible without <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">Alexey</a> writing such an awesome proposal and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mayeul:mayeul.net">MayeulC</a> pushing for the changes in browsers and the HTML standards. A lot of other people were also involved in implementing the scheme in their clients, sending the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/matrix">RFC to IANA</a> or working on matrix.to, which was our solution until now and will probably bridge the gap into the future. The matrix scheme being in the HTML standard may look small, but a lot of stuff was blocked on it, that can now start making progress. Exciting, isn't it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it gets better...</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MayeulC spotted, that Mozilla now safelisted the <code>matrix:</code> scheme in Firefox: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1688030#c15</p>
<p>Expect this to land around Firefox 90 probably.</p>
<p>So we can check one more thing on our list. Apart from Chrome, we are now only waiting on webclients to implement it. This is moving faster than I expected!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this truly lands in a Firefox version in the near future I'll be very, very happy.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello folks! Today at 17:41, we sunset the matrix.org gitter bridge after many years of active service. It started out as a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter/commit/c641e6eb4916c1addbff5ba50d0bf0a5f2084690">tiny little project, forked from another gitter&lt;-&gt;IRC bridge</a> before eventually becoming part of the matrix-appservice-bridge family of bridges (thanks Leo for putting in the hard work there!). It never quite gained all the nice features that the IRC and Slack bridges enjoyed, in part due to it's dependence on the use of one bot account (serving as a relay). However, it was still the entrypoint for Matrix users into the likes of NeoVIM and Typescript and continued to run for several years.</p>
<p>Years later, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix">gitter.im gained the ability to speak Matrix</a>,  so the old bridge can finally be laid to rest. Thanks to everyone that used and supported the bridge, and we hope you enjoy using the new one!</p>
<p>Thanks from the bridge team üåâ!</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre Franke</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In keeping with our tradition of sending an update every two months, here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been up to since <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/05/this-week-in-matrix-2021-02-05#fractal">the last one</a>.</p>
<p>Amongst a bunch of maintenance changes (dependency updates and the likes), we had a few ones that stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/695">Some views have been migrated to HdyStatusPage</a>. This provides a more homogeneous look across GNOME applications and help them fit better on smaller screens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We noticed regressions around message replacement and removal (edit display and redactions) and we started fixing them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another regression made it impossible to join rooms by alias or id. This was fixed as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We updated information in a couple places and we now have clearer contributing guidelines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We rarely talk about new issues that are still open and tend to focus on fixed ones. We do have <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/milestones/19">a milestone</a> with the remaining known blockers for our next version, 4.5, which we hope to be able to release Really Soon Now‚Ñ¢.</p>
<p>But as interesting as all that is, it pales in comparison to our bigger announcement. We are rewriting Fractal! Julian, Alexandre and Thib have documented the thought process behind this decision and the work done so far. For more details, have a look at <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2021/04/23/getting-fractal-up-to-speed/">Julian‚Äôs blog</a>. The summary is that even though such rewrites are usually frowned upon (for good reasons), two major technological shifts (from a homegrown backend to matrix-rust-sdk and from GTK3 to GTK4) made it an option that we needed to consider‚Ä¶ and so we did! This should result in a cleaner codebase, easier to maintain in the long run, and improvements that we can share with the rest of the Matrix community.</p>
<p>The work for the rewrite currently happens in a <code>fractal-next</code> branch. So far, we have the basic boilerplate in place. The app launches, offers a basic login form, does initial sync and while the interface then looks very similar to stable Fractal, it will just load an unsorted list of rooms for now. Not very impressive on the visible side, but Julian has also been very busy contributing to matrix-rust-sdk.</p>
<p>Hopefully we‚Äôll be able to break the aforementioned tradition and report more progress soon. Watch this space.</p>

<h4 id="how">How?</h4>
<p>It utilizes the synapse database to lookup alive and responding servers and on these currently just runs a query each 5m to check the version.</p>
<p>It allows a) to see the amount of servers and which servers my synapse at any point knows and b) to track the individual versions.</p>
<p>For my server at point of writing this results in 2348 Servers of which are 2269 running Synapse, 70 running Dendrite, 8 running Conduit and 1 running Construct.</p>

<p>Used under the hood is a small rust script doing all the heavy lifting of many thousand requests each five minutes (around 2-3 per server currently).</p>

<p>Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org">callahad</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to Homeservers, the Matrix spec also describes Push Gateways and Identity Services, which augment our ability to send notifications or discover users via identifiers like email addresses.</p>
<p>On the Matrix.org Foundation side, we maintain production-grade reference implementations of these services:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Synapse, a Homeserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sygnal, a Push Gateway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sydent, an Identity Service</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We recently became aware of a few security and denial of service concerns in Sydent. Yesterday, we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.3.0">Sydent 2.3.0</a> with fixes for those issues. It's extremely uncommon to self-host Sydent, but we wanted to highlight our work there all the same.</p>
<p>We've also finally settled on quarterly objectives for the Synapse team at Element, and the first thing we're focusing on is gaining a better understanding of how Synapse uses memory. Specifically, we'd like to drive down the peak RAM associated with joining large, complex rooms like Matrix HQ. We've already landed a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9825">small speed up</a> to that effect, but expect more specific metrics in the future.</p>
<p>Synapse 1.32 is due out early next week, and we look forward to seeing you then.</p>

<h3 id="old-gitter-bridge-end-of-life-2021-04-21">Old Gitter bridge end of life (2021-04-21)</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org">Eric Eastwood</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Next week on Wednesday (2021-04-21), the old Gitter bridge (identified as <code>@gitterbot:matrix.org</code>) will be shut down and any plumbed rooms (bridged connections) remaining will no longer bridge. To replace this, we've already migrated all of the portal rooms and many of the plumbed rooms in preparation so most users will not need to take any further actions. The remaining rooms with the old Gitter bridge are unfortunately not possible to migrate and for those communities a clean break will be needed. The new native Gitter bridge is here to replace this!</p>
<p>You can read most of the same information and details if you still need to plumb for your existing room in the blog post, https://matrix.org/blog/2021/04/15/old-gitter-bridge-end-of-life-2021-04-21-to-be-replaced-with-native-bridge</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey hey folks, something I can finally talk about in the open is that Element now has a Teams bridge! After months of being isolated on a desert island being fed nothing but rice crackers and diet pepsi, I can talk about our newest bridge. It's fairly feature packed with support for all the usual formatting options, plus Jitsi widget bridging (as links) and full puppeting including DMs. Matthew even went and nattered to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/14/matrix_teams/">The Register</a> about it. So you heard it here first, no network is truly safe from the open federation and we hope to welcome teams users into the Matrix. The bridge is currently a closed source offering under the EMS banner for now.</p>
<p>You can read about it in https://element.io/blog/ems-launches-bridging-for-microsoft-teams/</p>

<p>Also, some more news. I've started making improvements to <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-github">matrix-github</a> as it continues to serve as the primary way for me to get notifications from GitHub. The latest improvements are that you can now dynamically create and assign filters to notifications coming to the bridge. This means you can name filters and turn them on and off as required (i.e. don't bug me about matrix-org on weekends please).

<h3 id="matrix-pstn-bridge">Matrix PSTN Bridge</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kb1rd:kb1rd.net">KB1RD</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a simple puppetting bridge to the public telephone network via providers like Twilio. It's designed to be modular and support several different providers (though it only supports Twilio ATM). Once more providers are added, it will be possible to seamlessly migrate your phone number between multiple providers and save conversation history.
Chats are created by starting a DM with the control bot (currently hardcoded at <code>@_pstn_:myserver.org</code>) and running the <code>dial</code> command. Multiple users can join a room with the control bot and are all given access to puppet the bridge.</p>
<p>Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Connect to <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> &amp; get current account balance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send SMS texts to phone numbers and receive texts back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intelligent dialing looks up phone numbers based on the one you're using</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give SMS users &quot;pet names&quot; via the <code>name</code> command</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow multiple users to puppet a bridge &amp; allow the bridging of bots</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some planned features could include: (I'm not committing to any of these ;D)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Displaying bridge info in Element settings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dialer widget</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending MMS (pictures, video, voice, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting extended information about users. Services like Twilio offer carrier
lookups and that sort of thing. Could be useful to help weed out spam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phone calls -- This is very hard</p>
<ul>
<li>Answering machine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faxing. Why not, I guess?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay-as-you-go managed phone number service</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start a chat with the bridge bot and buy a phone number via Matrix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment security is an issue here ;)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Puppetting WhatsApp business or Facebook Messenger. Companies like Twilio offer connections to proprietary messengers like these.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not ready for production use, though. It's still stuck on a SQLite DB and has a few usability issues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As already mentioned a few times, this year the Matrix organization is taking part <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">in GSoC</a> again. This is an amazing opportunity for students to take part in various Matrix-related projects and helping those projects implement awesome new features. <strong>Submission for this closes on April 13 this year (which is Monday on my clock)!</strong> If you want to take part in GSoC as a student, submit your final proposals now! You can find some examples here: <a href="http://matrix-org.github.io/gsoc">http://matrix-org.github.io/gsoc</a>. If you want to submit your own ideas, please contact a potential mentor before that. If you have questions, please check out the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gsoc:matrix.org">#gsoc:matrix.org room</a>.</p>
<p>If you have already been writing a proposal, now is the time to put on the final polish and submit your proposal. If you are interested, now is the last opportunity this year to submit your proposal! We are excited to see, who will want to take part this year!</p>

<p>Ding dong the snake is dead! üêç‚ò†Ô∏è</p>
<p>We released <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/04/06/synapse-1-31-0-released">Synapse¬†1.31</a> on Tuesday. There are certainly nice things in it (read the release notes), but also, two days after that... WE FINALLY <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9766">REMOVED SUPPORT FOR PYTHON 3.5</a>!</p>
<p>As part of that, we now have a formal <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.31.0/docs/deprecation_policy.md">deprecation policy</a> that explicitly states our platform support strategy. Namely: <strong>we follow upstream lifecycles</strong>. Thus, we can say with confidence that we will drop support for Python 3.6 in December of this year. So when upgrading, please do ensure that your operating system of choice provides modern Python packages.</p>
<p>By the way: if you're looking to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribute to Synapse</a>, now is a good time to start grepping for <code>3.5</code> or <code>xenial</code> or <code>stretch</code> and seeing what cobwebs turn up which can finally be swept away. üï∏üßπ</p>
<p>We're also experimenting with using GitHub Actions for CI, and would certainly appreciate reviews and pull requests from folks who are more knowledgeable in that area, especially around speeding up workflows and caching.</p>
<p>We'll be back next week with more details on the specific quarterly goals the team is committing itself to, but until then, üëã!</p>

<p>If anyone understands German and listens to podcasts, Krille Fear and I will be on the LinuxLounge on the 25th of April: https://social.tchncs.de/@theradiocc/106025736391026211</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact there are dozens of people who understand German, and surely some subset of these listen to podcasts. With these conditions accepted, the LinuxLounge appearance will go ahead.</p>
