<p>If you didn't read it already, I encourage you to read <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org">Matthew</a>'s <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-special-2020">Matrix Holiday Special 2020</a> post. So much has happened this year! </p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@oleg:fiksel.info">Oleg</a> responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great summary! Very inspiring!</p>
<p>I have a feeling experiencing a revolution in how people perceive messaging. Now, public sector and multiple communities adopting Matrix, one cannot think of a world without Matrix any more.</p>
<p>Kudos to the Element team and to the wonderful Matrix community! ♥️</p>
<p>I'm very excited for the FOSDEM on Matrix!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andycuccaro:matrix.org">Andy</a> added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What a wonderful year has been for matrix, and it looks like next year will be equally as exciting. I'm HYPED.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I'm hyped too. Simple statements like &quot;loads of different universities have rolled out Matrix for collaboration&quot; don't quite capture how much work is going on, and how much excitement there is to get the growth in the network we're soon to see. </p>
<h3 id="homeserver-versions-graphs">Homeserver versions graphs</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@chris:settgast.org">Chris</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the first time (since recording the homeserver stats from Feb 2019) a non-synapse homeserver is now in the top 15 deployed homeserver versions: Welcome Dendrite 0.3.4: https://graph.settgast.org/d/z1nplqXik/matrix?orgId=1</p>

<p>How exciting is that! If you haven't already, do check out some of the history on these charts - big thanks to Chris for making this available.</p>

<h3 id="ansible-dendrite">Ansible-Dendrite</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:federator.dev">jaywink</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Created a new Ansible role to easily install a Dendrite server. Currently only tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with Ansible 2.9. Uses Docker to maintain a monolithic Dendrite. Requires but does not include PostgreSQL. Designed to easily be used with Traefik as reverse proxy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to be confused with matrix-puppet-groupme, <a href="https://gitlab.com/robintown/mx-puppet-groupme">mx-puppet-groupme</a> is a fancy new GroupMe bridge with support for as many features as the web client would let me get my hands on.

<p>The KDE Community is excited to announce the first release of NeoChat, a Matrix Client based on Spectral and libQuotient. With the power of Qt and KDE Frameworks, NeoChat currently runs on mobile and desktop Linux devices, Android and Windows. You can read more about NeoChat and how to get it at https://carlschwan.eu/2020/12/23/announcing-neochat-1.0-the-kde-matrix-client/</p>

<p>Congrats on the 1.0! I think we'll hear much more from the team next year. 🎉</p>
<h3 id="nheko">Nheko</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko</a> is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We finally fixed the Windows build, so there are nightlies on Windows again! Also lorendb finished his profile work, which means that if you were using custom profiles before on one of the nightlies, you may need to login again, but the whole code is a lot cleaner now.</p>

Nothing too significant, but <code>.well-known</code>-unaware homeservers should be treated better, and Matrix identifiers with special characters (ahem, slashes) can now be turned to valid URIs (matrix.to or proper <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2312">Matrix URIs</a>). Also, room tags starting with a <code>.</code> are no more considered valid, you'll get <code>u.</code> prepended to them.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">Ansible playbook</a> is meant to easily let you run your own Matrix homeserver.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> now defaults to using the Postgres database engine for all bridges, bots and related services (ma1sd, Dimension, etc).</p>
<p>Previously we were only using Postgres for Synapse and couldn't reuse the same database server for other services.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/pull/740">this huge pull request</a>, we've added Postgres support to 17 other services.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jdreichmann">Johanna Dorothea Reichmann</a> for starting the work on it and for providing great input!</p>
<p>Existing installations will get automatically migrated from SQLite/nedb to Postgres the next time you run the playbook.</p>
<p>Not only does this bring better performance and compatibility, but also, being able to reuse the same Postgres database for services other than Synapse paves the way for us to introduce other Postgres-only services such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-signal">mautrix-signal</a> bridge (existing <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/pull/686">pull request</a>), etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:elokapina.fi">kapina-jaywink</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Common accounts for support are tricky to handle due to needing the people using those accounts to keep separate clients open to use the common account. For this at Elokapina we created <em>Middleman</em>, which acts as a proxy between an account and a room.</p>
<p>It's a bit basic but works pretty well for pure text messages. Any messages in rooms where the bot is are relayed to the management room and any replies to those messages (prefixed with <code>!reply</code>) in the management room are relayed back. Optionally senders can be anonymised to enable a feedback bot.</p>
<p>Coming up is more configuration on for example ignoring non-mentions in rooms with lots of members and hopefully support for images and reactions in the not too long future.</p>
<p>Find it here: https://github.com/elokapina/middleman (built with nio-template).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you haven't already seen it, we wrote a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/15/dendrite-2020-progress-update">Dendrite 2020 Progress Update blog post</a> detailing our year in Dendrite. It also includes an announcement for our new public <code>dendrite.matrix.org</code> homeserver, which is open for registration!</p>
<p>Today we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.4">Dendrite 0.3.4</a>, which is a performance and bug-fix release, including the following changes from the last two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The stream tokens for <code>/sync</code> have been refactored, giving PDUs, typing notifications, read receipts, invites and send-to-device messages their own respective stream positions, greatly improving the correctness of sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new roominfo cache has been added, which results in less database hits in the roomserver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prometheus metrics have been added for sync requests, destination queues and client API event send perceived latency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event IDs are no longer recalculated so often in <code>/sync</code>, which reduces CPU usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync requests are now woken up correctly for our own device list updates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device list stream position is no longer lost, so unnecessary device updates no longer appear in every other sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A crash on concurrent map read/writes has been fixed in the stream token code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver input API no longer starts more worker goroutines than needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver no longer uses the request context for queued tasks which could lead to send requests failing to be processed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new index has been added to the sync API current state table, which improves lookup performance significantly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client API <code>/joined_rooms</code> endpoint no longer incorrectly returns <code>null</code> if there are 0 rooms joined</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roomserver will now query appservices when looking up a local room alias that isn't known</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The check on registration for appservice-exclusive namespaces has been fixed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a Dendrite server, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version!</p>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone! It's been ages since I've talked about a personal project on here. I've been working on the <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-github">matrix-github</a> bridge, which is an all singing all dancing service to connect you to Github AND Gitlab. (Yes, it's now poorly named).</p>
<p>I've landed the initial bits to make GitLab work, so that you can join issues and MRs as rooms in the UI but there is more work to do to make that solid and more interactive. The thing I am most looking forward to is notifications for GitLab so I can get away from emails.</p>
<p>ALSO, off the back of TravisR's fantastic widget work, I've landed initial support for widgets in admin rooms and soon issue/PR rooms. The idea here being that widgets give you a nicer UI to control the bridge or render details like commits going past or diffs. All the groundwork for authenticating widgets against the bridge and rendering them is done, now it just needs features.</p>
<p>That's the highlights this week. I'm hoping to really tighten the documentation to get more people spun up on it as the notifications features have turned out to be a killer feature for me :)</p>

<p>I've been using this (the bridge, rather than the upcoming widgets) for a couple of months now and find it really really powerful. I'm not in GitHub most of the day, so getting notifs piped direct into Matrix is great!</p>

<p>A few updates to the Gitter bridge itself this week handling Matrix edits outside of the 5 minute edit window on Gitter and fixing up @mentions being mangled by <code>:</code> colons on the Gitter side when someone mentions you from Element. We also strip the redundant Matrix reply quote when it goes into a Gitter threaded conversation because it's already easily viewable in the thread.</p>
<p>We're also getting started on some of the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26">Element feature parity with Gitter issues</a>. First directly tackling <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">backfilling existing message history</a>.</p>
<p>Other teams are already underway working on Spaces, Social login for Github which will ship in the new year!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In celebration of the cross-signing MSC being finally merged, Nheko master now supports cross signing other users and your own devices. 🎉 The UX is currently not final, you have to manually fetch the cross signing keys in the settings, if you don't have them after a verification. You are also not yet prompted to verify new logins and can't bootstrap cross-signing from Nheko, but the functional bits and bobs are there now. We are also still investigating, if prompting for your recovery key/passphrase is less confusing by using just one input field or if we should prompt for them separately. Currently Nheko just asks you to unlook and will accept whatever you input (if it can decrypt the secrets with it). FluffyChat does that and I think it is really nice!</p>
<p>There are also a few smaller features added recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now uses the icon from your theme on the login page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can react instead of reply with a (very) short text using /react</p>

<li>
<p>A few improvements(?) regarding whitespace and code rendering.</p>

<p>Today, we can announce the web/desktop variant of SchildiChat is <strong>out of beta</strong>!</p>
<p><a href="https://schildi.chat/">SchildiChat</a> is a fork of Element, which focuses on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list for both direct messages and groups, which is a more familiar approach to users of other popular instant messengers.</p>
<p>Since the last announcement on TWIM, we have not only fixed most of the layout bugs caused by the message bubbles, but can also report the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Settings for layouts work, so you can also use SchildiChat if you only want the unified overview and no message bubbles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All information about desktop is now on our new website: https://schildi.chat/desktop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hosted instance is now here: https://app.schildi.chat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Linux, SchildiChat is now available from AUR, apt repo for debian, flathub and as AppImage</p>

<h3 id="fluffychat">FluffyChat</h3>
<p><a href="https://fluffychat.im">FluffyChat</a> is a cute cross-platform matrix client. It is available for Android, iOS, Web and Desktop.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de">krille</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FluffyChat 0.24.0 is released with new features and fixes.</p>
<p>What is new:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new public room discovery page, where you can find and join public rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimental bootstrap support for cross-signing and keybackup and something really weird that is named SSSS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced power level managing for rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minor design changes like a new icon set</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beside of that we have of course a lot of bug fixes and stability improvements. All languages should now also work on iOS.</p>
<p>Also we are looking forward to publish the app in the AppStore for iOS but we will do this under the hood of Famedly. Btw. FluffyChat will soon move to the Famedly GitLab project and we will move the app in the PlayStore to the Famedly account too. This doesn't mean that anything will change there. It is just that Famedly will now handle the legal stuff for us and may offer paid customer support for businesses, which have interest in FluffyChat. But the app will still be available under the same AGPL3 license. This will just make it easier for us to publish the app in the official stores as we don't need to pay so much for the developer accounts.</p>

<p>We'd also like to remind you that we're planning on removing support for Python 3.5 early next year (a formal announcement and timeline will accompany the 1.25.0 release), and we'd appreciate and comments or concerns in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8782">this GitHub issue</a>.</p>

<p>Just updated my Synapse K8s-optimized image and Chart to 1.24.0, planning on deprecating the image at some point soon though, instead pointing people to upstream - or platform-optimized - images as I should be able to move all the Kubernetes-specific things into the chart itself to make it more compatible.</p>
<p>The image in question started off as a plain docker image, before there were official ones. I've since rebased it onto the official Matrix image with just the modified scripts and volume points.</p>
<p>My plan is to move all the Kubernetes-specific scripts into configmaps (which are a K8s way of storing text files/environment variables/etc), and then build my own launch arguments through the chart to get it to run on any image that has a Python interpreter and the Synapse modules available in the Python search path.</p>
<p>With all that done, it means I won't be a bottleneck in pushing updated image tags for people to be able to update, and I won't have to finagle multi-arch images 😃</p>

<p>In terms of bridge progress, we added support for <code>m.emote</code> status messages which means your <code>/me says hi</code> messages will bridge back and forth properly. On the Gitter side, we fixed the browser notifications so they show properly from the <code>virtualUser</code> instead of the generic <code>matrixbot</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kaiyou:tedomum.net">kaiyou</a> announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a first update regarding a very small project named &quot;axon&quot;, aimed at operating the synapse admin API from Python, either as a library or a CLI tool. It is currently in use everyday on our synapse instance for managing users and looking for suspicious rooms, and is being integrated into a prototype Web interface for managing synapse.</p>
<p>Admin API coverage is currently about 50%, mostly focusing on users and rooms management (get, list, update, delete). It is still enough to delete a user, edit an offensive avatar, or run as a cron to periodically purge remote media.</p>
<p>Our main repository: https://forge.tedomum.net/tedomum/axon</p>
<p>Github project mirror for contributing: https://github.com/kaiyou/axon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked if there was a GUI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not currently, but we are integrating it with another of our tools named &quot;hiboo&quot;, which is a general indie hoster user manager (provides SAML &amp; OIDC authentication with config templates for many projects including synapse, and integrates the account workflows and moderation features). Currently it provides room navigation and purging, plus deleting accounts either on moderator decision or when the user deletes her SSO account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds promising! Synapse Admin would benefit from this kind of tooling...</p>
<p>... so it was a surprise to find another project designed to help in this area!</p>
<h3 id="announcing-synadm">Announcing synadm</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jojo:peek-a-boo.at">jojo</a> told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, maybe it's about time for &quot;synadm - a CLI frontend to Matrix-Synapse admin APIs&quot; to be announced more officially. As the name implies it's a CLI tool that eases the usage of admin API commands for Synapse admins. It currently covers everything the room and user API's can do: https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#implementation-status--commands-list</p>
<p>It can be configured interactively and/or using a config file in yaml format: https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm#configuration</p>
<p>It's configurable whether the responds of the API are shown in pretty printed JSON or in a table format (using Python tabulate).</p>
<p>It's well documented via it's online help and supposed to be quite self-explanatory to the admin.</p>
<p>Any thoughts, ideas, feature-requests are very welcome in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at">#synadm:peek-a-boo.at</a> or as usual by filing PR's or issues in the project repo https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.2">version 0.3.2</a>, which contains some bug fixes. Changes this week include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Checking if a server is allowed to see an event has been optimised somewhat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to disable federation has been added</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application services are now sent correctly formatted client events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>create-account</code> has been simplified so that you can just point it to your Dendrite config</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/unpeek</code> support has been added (for MSC2753)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event IDs are now calculated far less often in the roomserver, since this is an expensive operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federation sender now caches events in memory to reduce load on the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;since&quot; parameter is now checked more thoroughly in the sync API, which led to a bug that could cause forgotten rooms to reappear (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kaniini">kaniini</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The polylith now proxies signing key requests through the federation sender correctly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spec compliance is unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Client-server APIs: 58%, same as last week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server-server APIs: 83%, same as last week</p>

<p>⚠️ The <strong>OpenSSL</strong> project has pre-announced a <a href="https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2020-December/000186.html">high severity issue</a> that will be disclosed on Tuesday. We will be regenerating Docker images and releasing Synapse 1.24.0 and 1.23.1 on Tuesday following that announcement. Note that these releases contain security fixes of their own, and you are encouraged to upgrade.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.24.0rc2/CHANGES.md#synapse-1240rc2-2020-12-04">Synapse 1.24.0rc2</a> is out and includes numerous bug fixes and internal improvements, especially around our OpenID Connect (OIDC) and SAML providers. Of note, the OIDC provider can now re-try generating MXIDs when there's a collision, reaching parity with the SAML provider.</p>
<p>We've been talking about <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</a> for a few weeks, but the end is in sight: the PR is reviewed and the tests pass, so we're on track for including it in 1.25.0!  We're also on the cusp of a finishing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8868">a new algorithm</a> for calculating the auth chain difference in <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/implementing-stateres">State Resolution v2</a>, which should significantly reduce worst case performance.</p>
<p>Lastly, the deprecated <code>/_matrix/client/*/admin</code> Admin API endpoints <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8785">have been removed</a>. If you have tools which target these endpoints, please update them to use the <code>/_synapse/admin</code> URL prefix instead.</p>

<p>We've soft-launched the new bridge to all public Gitter rooms! You can now find any public room on Gitter checking out the room directory for <code>gitter.im</code> or directly by replacing the forward slash in the URI part of the Gitter room with an underscore and joining <code>#*:gitter.im</code>(replace the *). If you come across any bugs, feel free check the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=matrix">list of known problems and create an issue</a>. There will be a full announcement next week so stay tuned!</p>

<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>This was actually just the beginning, the ground work needed to lay the foundations for A Better Future. We already have <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;state=opened">a bunch of other merge requests</a> to continue down that path. Hopefully there shouldn’t be such large ones in the (near) future. So what’s next? The work that landed this week was a switch to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/">the SDK</a> for almost all endpoint queries. Now need to handle the syncs with it. Later on, we will use it to handle storage, and then enable E2EE as well, but that will take quite some time.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I've actually not had much time to work on Nheko, I did at least fix most of the UTD (Unable to decrypt) issues, when sending encrypted messages. This has been a long standing annoyance, but it should now finally not be an issue anymore (well... at least it should not be caused by Nheko as often anymore)! With this there are only a few tickets left to finally bring E2EE out of beta in Nheko (SSSS and bootstrapping cross-signing, as well as a general review for potential issues).</p>
<p>And while I have actually not been doing much work, we actually had more Pull Requests (and merged them too) this week than I have ever seen before in Nheko! Thank you very much to everyone who contributed. A short summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nheko now uses the Nheko icon from your system theme, if available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can finally look at avatars in their full resolution!</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>On behalf of the Americans on the Synapse team: Happy Thanksgiving! This past week saw us land some improvements to the OpenID Connect SSO provider, bringing it closer to parity with the SAML provider. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8801">#8801</a> made it possible to gracefully handle username collisions when creating a new account over SSO.</p>
<p>We've also merged a pull request (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8785/">#8785</a>) from @dklimpel which removes deprecated paths for the Synapse Admin APIs. As of the next Synapse release, all Admin APIs will be accessibly only under the <code>/_synapse/admin/v1</code> path prefix.</p>
<p>Otherwise, much of our time has been spent on getting pull requests like <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/6739">#6739</a>, implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403: Add &quot;knock&quot; feature</a>, ready to merge. It's coming to a Synapse release soon!</p>
<p>Speaking of releases, we're looking forward to cutting a first release candidate of 1.24.0 early next week; keep your eyes peeled for that!</p>
<p>I'd be remiss in not mentioning that we started the week by <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/23/synapse-disclosing-cve-2020-26890">disclosing CVE-2020-26890</a>, which is a denial of service affecting Synapse versions prior to 1.20.0. If you've not upgraded, <em>please</em> do.</p>

<p>There were also quite a few cleanups, most of them done by Kirillpt! Some spacing here and there, saturation changes, the login page should now be less confusing, when you don't enter a valid mxid and toggles should now not get stuck in confusing intermediate states. There is also a russian translation now and some VOIP fixes. Pretty busy week, but I like it!</p>
