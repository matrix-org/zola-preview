                <p>Happy TWIMday everyone! Thib is away this week again, so I'm covering for him as your host in this edition of This Week In Matrix.</p>

<p>Following up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsw1bbBjAM">last week's tutorial</a> about using Docker Compose to install Synapse, this week Thib explains how to use Ansible to deploy your own Matrix homeserver.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the year, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/04/this-week-in-matrix-2022-03-04#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F">t2bot.io passed 1 Million known rooms</a> and now it's passed 10 Million bridged users (10,039,915 users to be exact, at time of writing). Most of these users will be people who have participated in a channel/chat on Discord or Telegram that was bridged to Matrix through t2bot.io's free service, with about 500 thousand being active each month.</p>
<p>Approximately 8 Million of the users are from Telegram, covering about 11% of all Telegram users (previously 15% based on information available at the time). The remaining 2 Million are Discord users, roughly 0.5% of Discord's user base. For perspective, t2bot.io has just over 683 Million events in the database and is bridging between 30 and 40 thousand people a day.</p>
<p>Like last time, this is just a milestone update, though it's also a good reminder to host your own server if you can. Element's own <a href="https://element.io/matrix-services">hosting platform</a> is a great option if you'd like to have a server without running it yourself, and <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> offers a richer bridging experience than t2bot.io can feasibly provide. If you'd like to go down the self-hosting route, check out Thib's video guide on hosting synapse or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsw1bbBjAM">last week's Matrix Live</a> for a better understanding of what hosting Synapse actually means.</p>
<p>As for an interesting statistic: despite not having much functionality that deals with Spaces, t2bot.io can see 2687 Spaces from the wider world. The plan in the coming months is to support a way to bridge a whole Discord server to a Matrix Space, making this statistic hopefully more interesting as time goes on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.5">Dendrite 0.9.5</a> which includes a number of fixes, particularly for federation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The roomserver will now correctly unreject previously rejected events if necessary when reprocessing</li>
<li>The handling of event soft-failure has been improved on the roomserver input by no longer applying rejection rules and still calculating state before the event if possible</li>
<li>The federation <code>/state</code> and <code>/state_ids</code> endpoints should now return the correct error code when the state isn't known instead of returning a HTTP 500</li>
<li>The federation <code>/event</code> should now return outlier events correctly instead of returning a HTTP 500</li>
<li>A bug in the federation backoff allowing zero intervals has been corrected</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> utility will no longer error if the homeserver URL ends in a trailing slash</li>
<li>A regression in <code>/sync</code> introduced in 0.9.4 should be fixed</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de">HarHarLinks</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib">simplematrixbotlib</a> has reached version <a href="https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib/releases/tag/v2.7.0">2.7.0</a>, adding support for end-to-end encryption! 🎉
Come chat over at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#simplematrixbotlib:matrix.org">#simplematrixbotlib:matrix.org</a>!</p>
<p>Here is a summary of things that have happened since we last announced v2.6.3 on this channel:</p>
<ul>
<li>🌐 The repo canonically moved to https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib, but the PyPI package remains available in the usual place.</li>
<li>🔒️ E2EE support! To enable it, simply install the optional e2ee dependencies. Find out how in <a href="https://simple-matrix-bot-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#e2e-encryption">the manual</a>.</li>
<li>😄 Emoji verification support! Enable the option and you'll be able to interactively verify between the bot and your devices. (But mind that for now, <a href="https://simple-matrix-bot-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#interactive-sas-verification-using-emoji">in-room verification is not supported, but only to-device</a>).</li>
<li>☝️ Fingerprint verification support! As an additional method, the bot will print it's encryption fingerprint so you can &quot;manually verify&quot;.</li>
<li>🗄️ Extensible config file! It is now easier than ever to add your own configuration options to the built-in TOML config file.</li>
<li>🧹 The usual housekeeping, bumping matrix-nio to 0.19.0.</li>
<li>🗨️ I (<a href="https://github.com/HarHarLinks">HarHarLinks</a>) will be presenting the library this weekend at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-summit-berlin-2022:c-base.org">#matrix-summit-berlin-2022:c-base.org</a>! If you are in the Berlin 🇩🇪 area, come visit c-base!</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest to use bot library for Matrix. Get started in just 10 lines of code:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>import simplematrixbotlib as botlib
</span><span>
</span><span>config = botlib.Config()

</span><span>creds = botlib.Creds(&quot;https://home.server&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;)

</span><span>
</span><span>@bot.listener.on_message_event
</span><span>async def echo(room, message):
</span><span>    if botlib.MessageMatch(room, message, bot, PREFIX).is_not_from_this_bot():

<p>This week the Spec Core Team focused on improvements to the spec source itself. richvdh <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1211">opened a PR</a> for edit events, and yours truly did <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pull/1210">a small PR</a> to clarify the required state of the response to <code>/_matrix/client/v3/login/</code>.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aspec-bug">a lot more open issues</a> available for people to tackle however, so feel free to get involved and help out if you have some spare time!</p>
<p>Finally other than the usual rounds of review by the team, I've been working on a spec process document that aims to explain the practical portions of the text found at https://spec.matrix.org/proposals/, but in a easily scannable manner. Look out for a PR with that in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2871">MSC2871: Give widgets an indication of which capabilities they were approved for</a>! What a mouthful!</p>
<p>Historically, widgets have laid outside of the spec and have only been implemented in a small subset of clients - mainly Element. As of recent weeks though, there's now a team at Element backing the feature. So exciting times ahead!</p>
<p>Regardless, let's highlight this MSC! It solves a crucial problem with a simple solution. Widgets can ask the client they're embedded in to do certain things (if granted certain capabilities), and the client, potentially after asking the user for permission, can allow or deny those actions. This MSC adds the machinery for a further step: the client will tell the widget what capabilities they requested were allowed, and which were denied.</p>
<p>I believe this spec is non-contentious, but is blocked on widgets entering the spec as a whole. Regardless, if this particular piece of the puzzle interests you, or you'd like to read all about widgets in general, the see either the MSC above or this widget spec tracking PR: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/pull/825.

<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.4">Dendrite 0.9.4</a>, containing primarily bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bug in the roomserver around handling rejected outliers has been fixed</li>
<li>Backfilled events will now use the correct history visibility where possible</li>
<li>The device list updater backoff has been fixed, which should reduce the number of outbound HTTP requests and <code>Failed to query device keys for some users</code> log entries for dead servers</li>
<li>The <code>/sync</code> endpoint will no longer incorrectly return room entries for retired invites which could cause some rooms to show up in the client &quot;Historical&quot; section</li>
<li>The <code>/createRoom</code> endpoint will now correctly populate <code>is_direct</code> in invite membership events, which may help clients to classify direct messages correctly</li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> tool will now log an error if the shared secret is not set in the Dendrite config</li>
<li>A couple of minor bugs have been fixed in the membership lazy-loading</li>
<li>Queued EDUs in the federation API are now cached properly</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now has some very dirty hack to render spoilers on desktop platforms. This does not show the reason and not work in mobile mode, doesn't hide it from notifications or from the sidebar. But it is at least something. Similarly we tightened what tags we allow when validating the incoming html again. Also, as a small fix, DMs should now also properly start with encryption enabled when started from a profile and there were a few crash fixes when searching for direct chat partners and closing the window too quickly or when a user uploads a device with invalid keys.</p>

The new reactive <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/940">Timeline API</a> has been progressed, it, too, has some FFI definitions now, allowing mobile client to start playing with it. Crypto-JS, too, has progressed, adding support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/958">de/encrypting attachments in an memory efficient fashion</a>. On the crypto-side, the longer on-going refactor and improvements have yielded another few PRs, too, that have successfully merged, while others are still pending reviews. Other than that, we've seen quite a few smaller fixes and improvements, around logging, docs and the examples.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week in the dart SDK we mostly fixed bugs. Many of those are related to call negotiations where streams were closed in the wrong order, not closed at all or in group calls the call never learned about new members or the call_ids would not match. There were also a few fixes to the background thumbnailing support added in 0.11.1, helper methods were added to easily send the right message corresponding to the mimetype of some media and fetching a timeline for some event id should work properly again.</p>
<p>We have some support to mark a room as either a dm or a group using slashcommands now, you have more flexibility when implementing the SSSS Bootstrap now (using the extra Bootstrap parameter in onUpdate() and to round it all off, we now have nice coverage numbers as well as coverage display on merge request diffs.</p>

<p>In less than a week the Matrix Community Summit Berlin is taking place at c-base.
Join us early on Thursday (25th August) for a Barcamp where we will brainstorm, draft and prototype new ideas.
The main conference days are Friday and Saturday (26th and 27th August). We have a schedule all about Matrix hosting, clients and development.
With three simultaneous tracks there sure is something for you to listen to. It's also the perfect place to get to know other community members.
Look forward to talks, workshops, a signing party, a Matrix P2P live test, dinner and barbecue!</p>
<p>We're not planing to stream or record the event. Our focus lies on providing a great in-person activities.
If attendees want to blog or toot/tweet about it, please use the hashtag #MatrixCommunitySummit.
Also, German-speaking folks can look forward to more coverage from the event on my podcast.
https://chrpaul.de/podcast/</p>
<p>Because we've heard about some confusion:
The event is NOT organised by the Matrix Foundation. To minimize the misconception, we've renamed it to the Matrix Community Summit Berlin.
This is an event initiated by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@yan:datanauten.de">Yan</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaller94:matrix.org">jaller94</a> and other Matrix enthusiasts. We also organise the Matrix Meetup Berlin.</p>

<p>The Spec Core Team had another retro this week, and part of what we talked about was how most of the spec PR writing falls to just a few people. Starting this week, we're going to try and diversify that work across the Spec Core Team, both for reducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> and increasing bandwidth of spec PRs. Hopefully the results of that will be noticeable!</p>
<h3 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h3>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3783">MSC3783: Fixed base64 for SAS verification</a>!</p>
<p>For those that don't know, &quot;SAS verification&quot; refers to the act of two devices verifying each other through the use of Short Authentication Strings (SAS). This is the backbone of emoji verification when you verify with another user or one of your own devices.</p>
<p>It turns out that libolm, the olm and megolm encryption library, originally incorrectly encoded the base64 output of the message authentication code (MAC) calculation, which is a values that's passed between devices. Due to trying to maintain backwards-compatibility with older clients, this has not been fixed in newer clients yet.</p>
<p>This MSC proposes bumping the MAC algorithm identifier (which is agreed upon between devices when verifying) to a something new, which allows newer clients to know when to use the new or old (and incorrect) method of calculating the base64 encoding of MAC values.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this has no security implications. It's just unfortunate to have incorrect base64 encoding when interfacing with other, non-libolm, implementations of olm and megolm.

<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org">Shay</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Synapse team is hard at work making Synapse faster and leaner. Work continues
apace on faster room joins over federation, and it seems that the work might land
sooner rather than later, although there are no solid dates yet.
In other news, profiling work is being done to determine ways to hopefully increase
the speed of local room joins and DM creation. Stay tuned for more information in the future on that.
Finally, it was an RC release week. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.65.0rc2">Synapse 1.65.0rc2</a> was released, and it contains some fun features and bugfixes. Check it out!</p>

<p>Dendrite is a second-generation Matrix homeserver</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org">neilalexander</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week we released <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.2">Dendrite 0.9.2</a> which contains the following updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dendrite now supports history visibility on the <code>/sync</code>, <code>/messages</code> and <code>/context</code> endpoints
<ul>
<li>It should now be possible to view the history of a room in more cases (as opposed to limiting scrollback to the join event or defaulting to the restrictive <code>&quot;join&quot;</code> visibility rule as before)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The default room version for newly created rooms is now room version 9</li>
<li>New admin endpoint <code>/_dendrite/admin/resetPassword/{userID}</code> has been added, which replaces the <code>-reset-password</code> flag in <code>create-account</code></li>
<li>The <code>create-account</code> binary now uses shared secret registration over HTTP to create new accounts, which fixes a number of problems with account data and push rules not being configured correctly for new accounts</li>
<li>The internal HTTP APIs for polylith deployments have been refactored for correctness and consistency</li>
<li>The federation API will now automatically clean up some EDUs that have failed to send within a certain period of time</li>
<li>The <code>/hierarchy</code> endpoint will now return potentially joinable rooms (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/texuf">texuf</a>)</li>
<li>The user directory will now show or hide users correctly</li>
<li>Send-to-device messages should no longer be incorrectly duplicated in <code>/sync</code></li>
<li>The federation sender will no longer create unnecessary destination queues as a result of a logic error</li>
<li>A bug where database migrations may not execute properly when upgrading from older versions has been fixed</li>
<li>A crash when failing to update user account data has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition when generating notification counts has been fixed</li>
<li>A race condition when setting up NATS has been fixed (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/brianathere">brianathere</a>)</li>
<li>Stale cache data for membership lazy-loading is now correctly invalidated when doing a complete sync</li>
<li>Data races within user-interactive authentication have been fixed (contributed by <a href="https://github.com/tak-hntlabs">tak-hntlabs</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This brings our current test compliance figures to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client-server APIs: 90%</li>
<li>Server-server APIs: 95%</li>
</ul>

<p>Announcing <code>matrix-appservice-discord</code> 3.0.0!</p>
<p>What? Another week, another major release?
Yes, we want to make breaking changes obvious, and the bridge now requires Node.js 16+.</p>
<p>The release fixes the outdated <code>yarn.lock</code> file. Thanks to the package maintainers of NixOS to point this out! 👋
Furthermore, mentioning Matrix users in Discord got fixed.</p>
<p>And, for the fans of containers, we've re-added the release of Docker images. 🐳
The URL changed and we don't plan to update <code>halfshot/matrix-appservice-discord</code> on Docker Hub.
The image can be pulled from <code>ghcr.io/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-discord:v3.0.0</code>.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now shows you a pretty preview for rooms you are trying to join. This uses <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3266">MSC3266</a>, which you might need to enable in your synapse config, if you want to see more than the roomid of the room you are trying to join. It tries to fall back to the /hierarchy endpoint, but that won't work over federation.</p>
<p>Similarly you can now somewhat edit what rooms are in a space. I grew up with Windows 98, so this is a very nested right click menu. We are still discussing some of the wording choices for the options there, so if you have any opinions about it, feel free to give feedback about it! This is part of the bigger goal to be able to manage your communities from within Nheko, so stay tuned for more features coming in that area.</p>
<p>red_sky (nheko.im) also improved our notifications code on macOS. You can now disable the notification sound in the system settings, which for some reason requires badge permissions to show that option... macOS will always remain a mystery to us! Similarly we fixed the source text for notifications on Windows, which should now not show a stray %1 anymore as well as a few other cleanups.

<li>Ever started a DM with someone, only to get distracted and leave them staring into an empty timeline wondering who you are and what you want. Well, it is no more! In this update new DMs will only notify the person you’re messaging once you’ve sent your first message.</li>
<li>That’s not the only exciting update in EleWeb/Desktop this week, including the newly extended voice messages! Instead of voice messages capped at 2 minutes, users are now able to send a voice note of up to 15 minutes long. Go forth and record 🎤</li>
<li>In upcoming releases we’re also looking at how to improve a user’s first few days in Element. We know that it can be daunting to stare at an empty screen and wonder how to get going, which is why we’ve designed and built a checklist for new users. This checklist will help them to get off the ground and messaging friends in no time.</li>
