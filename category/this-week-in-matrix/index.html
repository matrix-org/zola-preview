                <h2 id="welcometothelasttwimoftheyear">Welcome to the last TWIM of the year</h2>
It's the 28th of December as I write this, and I hope you had a good year. Long as it is, I recommend reading <a href="/blog/2018/12/25/the-2018-matrix-holiday-special/">Matthew's write-up of the year</a>, as it covers a lot of ground!
<p>Many of the core team have been out of the office this week, but there are still plenty of updates to share from the Matrix ecosystem!</p>
<h2 id="mxisdv122">mxisd v1.2.2</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> released mxisd v1.2.2:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a> had a Holiday-special release: <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.2.2">v1.2.2</a> before v1.3.0.
<p>This release introduces two new big features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Username login rewriting via 3PID to allow advanced flows, like bypassing the synapse restriction of having numerical usernames for non-guest users</li>
 	<li>Support for multiple Base DNs for LDAP backends</li>
</ul>
Work has started on v1.3.0 so this is definitely the last release before a non-backward compatible release.</blockquote>
<h2 id="scylla">Scylla</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@daniel:riot.danilafe.com">VaNilLa</a> has started a new client, a web app build in Elm:
<blockquote>Hi all! I am working on a Matrix client in Elm, and I was recommended to share it here: <a href="https://github.com/DanilaFe/Scylla">Scylla</a></blockquote><br /><h2 id="komadesktop">koma-desktop</h2><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@druig:matrix.org">druig</a>:<br /><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma-desktop">koma-desktop</a> is updated to JavaFx 11 and installation is simplified. Dependencies, including native modules can be packaged into one single file, which only needs to be downloaded and run. Java Runtime 11 is the only runtime dependency. Now it's just cross-compilation that needs to be set up before packaged releases can be provided for Mac, Windows, and Linux users.</blockquote>
<h2 id="prometheusalertmanagerbotformatrix">Prometheus Alertmanager bot for Matrix</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:feneas.org">Jason Robinson</a>:
<blockquote>I started work on a Prometheus Alertmanager bot for Matrix. The basic idea is that Alertmanager can send webhook alert events to the bot which will then send the formatted events to configured rooms based on the alert receiver. It works, but is still early work in progress. See code and info here: <a href="https://git.feneas.org/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager">https://git.feneas.org/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager</a>.</blockquote><br />Also mirrored on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager">https://github.com/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager</a><br /><h2 id="qmatrixclient">QMatrixClient</h2><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>:<br /><blockquote>This week <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient">QMatrixClient</a> project gained some improvements in macOS support (thanks to Matthew and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@aaron:raim.ist">Aaron Raimist</a>!); but most of <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">Kitsune</a>'s time (aside from dayjob) has been spent on attachments uploading in <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a>. This required improvement in support of uploading in the library. These changes have now landed in the master branches.</blockquote><br /><h2 id="fractal40">Fractal 4.0</h2><br /><a href="@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre Franke</a>:<br /><blockquote>As expected the Fractal team released 4.0 and is already hard at work on the next micro version. We recommend <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Fractal">getting it from Flathub</a> like we usually do.</blockquote>
From the release notes:
<blockquote>New features:
<ul>
 	<li>Enhanced history view with adaptive layout, day divider</li>
 	<li>Reorganised headerbar, app menu merged with user menu</li>
 	<li>Larger display of emoji-only messages</li>
 	<li>Some performance improvements</li>
 	<li>Opening a room jumps to first unread message</li>
</ul>
Bugfixes:
<ul>
 	<li>More reliable notifications</li>
 	<li>Fixed display bug for avatars</li>
</ul>
Under the hood:
<ul>
 	<li>Large code refactor</li>
 	<li>Logging infrastructure</li>
 	<li>Continuous integration</li>
 	<li>More informative build output</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="maubot">maubot</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> working on <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a>:

<blockquote>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a> bridge gained a XMPP specific backend for better performance when you want to do just xmpp bridging. It's rather quick right now, and needs dogfooding.</blockquote>

<p>Purism announced they are sponsoring <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a> development, starting with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@iamjsparber:matrix.org">Julian Sparber</a> working last month to improve the message view. You can <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2018/12/03/better-room-history-in-fractal/">read about his progress here</a>. Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>Before, there was a jarring cut when new messages were loaded, but now you can just scroll upward and older messages are loaded continuously.<br />The part I'm most excited about is the new "new message divider". When the user opens a room they can directly start reading the conversation from the last seen message and they don't need to search for the new message divider. Not only has the UX gotten a lot better, but also the underlying code is much cleaner now.<br />I also spent some time on making message rendering faster. I replaced the RegExp with more efficient code, this made the rendering much faster (from ~10ms to ~ 1ms) for every single message.<br />In summary, all of these things improve Fractal's UX a lot and make it feel more like a modern messaging app.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Beer! And pizza! And also Redecentralize<br />We chatted to a nice bunch of folks both demoing their decentralized projects and talked to the likes of scuttlebutt, BBC, IPFS and more. Was a interesting experience having around 8 minutes to quickly explain to newcomers what Matrix is and why they should use it in a speed dating format. We chatted (and demoed) bridges, <a href="https://riot.im/experimental/">new-riot</a> and generally how it all fits together. There were a lot of very interesting people with different profiles and backgrounds, and diversified questions which lead to a lot of interesting discussions.</blockquote>
<small>Note for the confused: the <em>format of the meetup</em> was comparable to speed dating. There is no suggestion that Matrix should be used at regular speed dating.

Longer than usual episode of Matrix Live this week. Amber talks to Neil about the works she's been doing over the last few months to port Synapse from Python 2 to Python 3. Recommended for anyone who's been following along the progress of Synapse, or who wants a good intro on the benefits of Python 3 over Python 2.

<h2 id="zerophone">ZeroPhone</h2>
This week we learned about ZeroPhone, a fairly mature project aiming to <a href="https://wiki.zerophone.org/index.php/Main_Page">build a working cellphone on top of a Raspberry Pi Zero</a>.
<blockquote>an open-source smartphone that can be assembled for 50$ in parts. It is Linux-powered, with UI software written in Python.
Currently, ZeroPhone is based on Raspberry Pi Zero, SIM800L GSM modem and 1.3" OLED screen and button interface.</blockquote>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@adam:thebeckmeyers.xyz">&amp;Adam</a> was the first to bring it to our attention:
<blockquote>I stumbled across this blog post which mentions a matrix app in a project to create an open, hackable phone out of a raspberry pi. It's old news at this point I guess, but I don't think I've seen it mentioned here, so I thought it might be a neat thing worth featuring: <a href="https://zerophone.github.io/newsletter/ZeroPhone-Weekly-No.-16/">https://zerophone.github.io/newsletter/ZeroPhone-Weekly-No.-16/</a></blockquote>
The creator of the Matrix app, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@derivmug:matrix.org">derivmug</a> also arrived to tell us about his work:
<blockquote>Hey everyone, I have been suggested to post about the <a href="https://wiki.zerophone.org/index.php/Main_Page">Zerophone project here</a>. I have written a basic matrix client for it. It's basically a simple phone based on a raspberry pi zero, focused on privacy, security and hackability.</blockquote>
The client app is built using the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a>, I'm also hoping to chat to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@derivmug:matrix.org">derivmug</a> as part of a future Matrix Live. <a href="https://github.com/ZeroPhone/ZPUI/tree/devel/apps/matrix">Take a look at the code here</a>.

He recently added Matrix to the list of protocols he scrapes and lists:
<blockquote>Matrix (or more specifically, Synapse) servers are now visible on the The Federation info website at <a href="https://the-federation.info/matrix%7Csynapse">https://the-federation.info/matrix%7Csynapse</a>. The website collects lists of servers for various federation protocols (like Matrix, ActivityPub, Diaspora, etc). If a server outputs usage information, it also shows some historical information for servers and projects. Currently the information available from Synapse on the site is just version, availability of registrations and (obviously) domain name. If you want to register your server, check https://the-federation.info/info for more details. Tips also welcome on how to register other Matrix server projects and how to get more data out of servers.</blockquote>

Not only the usual small bugfixes, but also some rather big changes:
The parsers for both Discord-&gt;Matrix sending and Matrix-&gt;Discord sending were re-written completely to properly handle things (and thus, at the same time, crunch a bunch of edge-case bugs!).
In addition, the long-awaited highlighting issues with @ everyone and @ here (on discord) and @ room (on matrix) were addressed.
