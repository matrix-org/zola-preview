<p>Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/proposals.</p>
<h2 id="msc-status">MSC Status</h2>
<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4026">MSC4026: Allow <code>/versions</code> to optionally accept authentication</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4009">MSC4009: Expanding the Matrix ID grammar to enable E.164 IDs</a> (merge)</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Closed MSCs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>No MSCs were closed/rejected this week.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>On the Spec Core Team (SCT), we've started converting the list of MSCs we received into a roadmap for the next 8-ish weeks. This is all to prepare for Matrix 1.8, and we're already starting to think a bit about what Matrix 1.9 looks like too. You can see what the team plans to look at <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/88">here</a> - each column is ordered in relative priority, where the top is more likely to receive attention first. Not everything is actionable at the moment, but that's the point üòÑ As we work through the next month or so, the remaining MSCs should be unblocked or near-unblocked enough to allow the SCT to make progress on them. </p>
<p>Most of the MSCs on the roadmap have a target state of acceptance (and merge, if we can make that happen), though some do have a simple task of reviewing the MSC ahead of implementation effort. We're aiming to test this process over the next few releases, where the SCT unblocks progress by providing review ahead of review actually being needed, but to do that we need to know what people plan to work on. If you have something which could do with review (not just acceptance) in the August-November window of time, let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">SCT Office</a>. </p>
<p>As always, if you have questions about a particular MSC's state or what this process actually means, let us know in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">SCT Office</a>. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the SCT is continuing its IETF/MIMI adventures by pushing Linearized Matrix towards working group adoption. The current stages involve updating the Internet-Draft (I-D, or MSC in IETF terms) to cover the MIMI-specific bits of the room model and working on multiple implementations of the proposal. We'll be updating <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3995">the MSC</a> at a later stage to account for the DAG interop components, though how to get a DAG to work with the linear, append-only, MIMI variant is very much top of mind. You can see the current rapidly-changing I-D <a href="https://turt2live.github.io/ietf-mimi-linearized-matrix/draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned, to further adoption of Linearized Matrix within MIMI we're looking for independent implementations. &quot;Independent&quot; here means not written by the Matrix Core Team and not written by Element given the potential for conflict of interest, though the Matrix team is working on proving the I-D through <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/eigen-server">eigen-server</a> and possibly a dual-stack Synapse (watch this space). We have a line on ~2 completely independent (but undisclosed üòá) Linearized Matrix implementations already, but more is often better for these things: if you work for a messaging service provider and are interested in writing an implementation, <a href="mailto:draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix@ietf.org?subject=Mail%20regarding%20draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix">get in touch</a> with us so we can coordinate some interop testing. You don't already have to be using Matrix to write an implementation, and in fact it's probably better if you aren't already using Matrix, awkwardly. </p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the week</h2>
<p>The script of fate has decided to put forward <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3060">MSC3060: Room Labels</a> this week. This is a relatively small MSC, but one which provides a ton of value to discovering rooms. The labels/topics your room covers are listed in a state event and can inform users of what to expect beyond the room name/avatar. For example, if your room has primarily NSFW/18+ content, you can disclose that in the labels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What would Friday be without TWIM? This week the backend team released Synapse v1.85.2. Notably this version fixed a regression where using TLS for HTTP replication between workers did not work and fixed a bug in the schema delta that broke upgrades for some deployments - both introduced in v1.85.0.</p>
<p>In addition, please note the security advisory that the following issues are fixed in 1.85.0 (and RCs):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-26c5-ppr8-f33p">GHSA-26c5-ppr8-f33p</a> / <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32682">CVE-2023-32682</a> ‚Äî Low Severity</li>

</ul>
<p>A discovered oEmbed or image URL can bypass the <code>url_preview_url_blacklist</code> setting potentially allowing server side request forgery or bypassing network policies. Impact is limited to IP addresses allowed by the <code>url_preview_ip_range_blacklist</code> setting (by default this only allows public IPs).</p>
<p>See the advisories for more details. If you have any questions, email <a href="mailto:security@matrix.org">security@matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a deprecation to call out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling the <code>/register</code> endpoint with an unspecced <code>user</code> property for application services is now deprecated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally a few more highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a new <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.85/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html">admin API</a> to <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.85/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#create-a-device">create a new device for a user</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/15611">#15611</a>)</li>
<li>Add Unix socket support for Redis connections.</li>
<li>Fix a long-standing bug where filters with multiple backslashes were rejected.</li>
<li>Remove the old version of the R30 (30-day retained users) phone-home metric</li>
</ul>
<p>And so much more! To read about everything in the release, take a look at the release notes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases">here</a> and otherwise have a great week.</p>

<p>Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="matrix-appservice-irc-1-0-0-is-finally-here">Matrix-appservice-irc 1.0.0 is finally here</h3>
<p>Afternoon all! We've had a pretty hectic time here at matrix.org bridge towers. Ever since we announced the first preview of the new connection pooling
feature way back in <del>May</del> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc1">April</a>, we've been busily working away
to try and make the bridge stable. The work put into the bridge is nothing short of a total refactor to our connection logic, and thankfully it's starting to bear fruit.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/1.0.0">1.0.0</a> is now ready for the masses!</p>
<p>The major highlights of this release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>üî• IRC connections can now be run via an external process using &quot;connection pooling&quot;, allowing the bridge to be restarted without IRC connection loss.</li>
<li>This release drops support for Node 16. The minimum required version is now 18+.</li>
<li>Bridge logging / bridge info state event configuration is now fully hot-reloadable.</li>
<li>Show a helpful error for !link/!unlink admin failures, rather than &quot;Check the logs for details&quot;, in more cases.</li>
<li>Sort the list of channels in !listrooms output</li>
<li>Fixes cases where powerlevel changes may not be correctly applied upon mode change</li>
<li>Allow usernames to include more characters when using the !username command</li>
</ul>
<p>I know a lot of you will be eager to go and enable connection pooling, but please bear in mind it is still a very new feature. Please test away
and follow our <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-appservice-irc/latest/connection_pooling.html">wiki instructions</a>, but be careful when running it in production!</p>
<h4 id="a-final-note-to-our-libera-chat-users">A final note to our libera.chat users</h4>
<p>Many of these changes have been incrementally deployed to our biggest deployment, the libera.chat bridge. We know that the bridge has suffered some reliability issues
recently, but we hope that the incremental changes have started to be noticed. We're now in a position where we can react to issues with the bridge, and make changes
without making so much as a whisper of noise to the IRC network. Over the coming weeks we expect to continue to do what we can to improve reliability and performance,
and overall grow the confidence in the bridge.</p>
<p>To that end, we've redesigned our support model for the bridge and we'd encourage you to take a look at our brand new tracker over at https://github.com/matrix-org/libera-chat.</p>
<p>For folks bridging to <em>other</em> networks, the old https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/ repository is still the best place to go for now.</p>

<h3 id="nheko-website">Nheko (<a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nheko now shows you custom reactions in your recent reactions (and renders them). Sateallia also made it easier to jump to search results, which makes searching for things a lot more useful! Similarly Sateallia made the last selected space or other filter sticky, which means if you had your DMs open, Nheko will open those again after a restart. Thanks to LcsTen notifications after you have been absent for a while are reduced to a single summary notification, which should make network outages or coming back to Nheko much less annoying!</p>
<p>But the big news is probably that the Nheko master branch is now using Qt6. This means anyone brave enough to venture into the nightlies, you will get a lot of fun new bugs. This is not for the weak of heart and I can just recommend you to stay away, if you are not ready to fight those bugs yet! It however allowed us to close about 20 issues at once, so it is not like some bugs aren't squashed. But it is a big change and big changes come with noise and regressions. However it does set us up much better for the future.</p>
<p>Speaking of future, we also changed the flatpak id. The old one didn't allow us to verify our domain ownership. This will mean you might need to sign in again, once the Qt6 Nheko is out and if you had been using the flatpak. However since this is a rather major change anyway, I hope you can forgive that and we might figure out a migration path until then.</p>
<p>Now back to those bugs. They are eating my assembly machine again!!!</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2020">JS crypto bindings now expose more key data</a>, and a new alpha version of the JS crypto bindings has been published: <code>matrix-sdk-crypto-js v0.1.0-alpha.10</code>.</li>
<li>The timeline got some nice improvements:
<ul>
<li>It's now possible to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2003">subscribe to room updates</a>.</li>
<li>There's now a public API method to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2022">retry sending events</a>, when sending failed before.</li>
<li>And some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2012">additional</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2019">bugfixes</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lots of progress in the implementation of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575">Sliding Sync</a> too:
<ul>
<li>The Room List API is making huge progress, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1953">a first version</a> has landed! This API attempts to make it easy to write clients using sliding sync by loading and subscribing to rooms in a fast, efficient and opinionated way.</li>
<li>A new high-level Notification API (<em>naming in progress</em>) <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2023">has been revealed</a>, in charge of creating a sliding sync instance focused on handling the bare minimum required to handle and decrypt push notifications.</li>
<li>And bugfixes, as usual: notably, the room name will now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2032">properly be taken into account</a> when using sliding sync.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And the recurring dose of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2011">sweet</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2033">refactorings</a> and CI <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2029">chores</a>.</li>

<p>Do you use Home Assistant? Have you tried using the default <code>matrix</code> integration and been frustrated due to its lack of maintenance, features, and compatibility with non-Synapse homeservers?</p>
<p>Well, I'm happy to announce that there's now a solution: <a href="https://github.com/PaarthShah/matrix-nio-hacs">Matrix Nio - HACS</a> is a HACS custom repository (making use of <code>matrix-nio</code>, of course!) that anyone can install onto their Home Assistant instance, immediately using their existing configurations, automations, and whatever else was set up for the default integration, with no further effort.</p>
<p>Over time, based on popular demand (and my own whims and desires for my own setup, otherwise), I'll be adding new features on top of what's already available, including e2ee, video attachments, polls, reactions, location messages, and hopefully more!</p>
<p>Suggestions are always welcome! Feel free to ask/get support on the github issues page, or in Matrix Nio - HACS!</p>

<h3 id="technicals-acteravatar-riverpods-ui-flows-matrix-sdk-update">Technicals: ActerAvatar, Riverpods, UI flows, matrix-sdk update</h3>
<p>The technical team is chugging away implementing the screens for the upcoming Alpha of Acter3, like the new <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/609">navigation bar</a>, <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/620">login flow</a> and its accompanying pages. As it will be an alpha, an Element-App-insipired <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/618">labs settings system</a> has been implemented, too, allowing users to opt-in into still experimental features while they are being developed.</p>
<p>But also under the hood a lot is changing: we are switching more and more things to <a href="https://riverpod.dev/">riverpod</a>, trying to replace GetX entirely before the alpha - most notably, the internal routing is using that already, while chat and tasks are rewritten at the moment. Secondly, we have started extracting simple UI components into reusable packages, starting with <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/acter-avatar/">ActerAvatar</a> (yet to be published) our take on showing avatars with fallback and alike. Unfortunately, our attempt to implementing a dart backend for uniffy now that async support landed, had to be put on hold and won't be in the first alpha. We are in the process of <a href="https://github.com/acterglobal/a3/pull/631">upgrading to the latest matrix-rust-sdk to add sqlite support</a> in the alpha though.</p>
<h3 id="nightly-builds-system-status-reporting">Nightly builds, system status reporting</h3>
<p>We have also been busy on the infrastructure side of things: Our nightly builds are now available for all target platforms (Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android &amp; iOS) and the newly created nightly reporting channel https://matrix.to/#/#nightly:acter.global has a convenient link to install the latest version on mobile devices, too. (Note: Because of Apple the iOS version is only working on pre-registered devices - get in contact if you want to use that).</p>
<p>Further more, a second channel now contains updates by our infrastructure monitoring system. Join https://matrix.to/#/#status:acter.global to stay up to date on that.</p>

<p><strong>New MSCs:</strong></p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Part of the SCT's goals with Matrix 1.8 is to pre-plan the majority of our review attention, which means we need to be told what folks are working on to plan accordingly. We'll still have some room for random/surprise MSC work, but this is expected to be harder to acquire going forward (and so should not be relied upon).</p>
<p>Please let us know if you're working on something which affects the spec! We want to hear about:</p>
<ul>
<li>things that aren't MSCs (yet)</li>
<li>things that are MSCs but aren't planned to be merged in 1.8</li>
<li>MSCs which are expected to be ready in time for Matrix 1.8 (in ~2 months)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you aren't sure if your project affects the spec, talk to us about it. We do not want to be the bottleneck in your development cycle, instead preferring to know ahead of time that something will need attention from us.</p>
<p>All we need is for you to mention your project/MSC and timeline in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a> - DMs and private rooms with SCT members are not enough to get something on the roadmap. This is to ensure there is full transparency in why the SCT is looking at something, and to ensure that the MSC moves through the process in an efficient manner. If your project has a sensitive context (commercial or otherwise), then we ask that you reference that here and someone from the team will contact you to get more information, relaying as much (non-sensitive) detail as possible back to the room here.</p>
<p>Our expected outcome for this system is to not only be a more effective team, but also to give you a faster/more reasonable turnaround on MSC review (at all stages), more rapid deployment of stable features (dropping unstable prefixes), and overall fewer review iterations as the SCT can think about problems ahead of you actually needing a review. We seriously do not want to be a blocker, but we need to know what we could end up blocking by accident.</p>
<p>Starting approximately August 1st, we will be starting to plan out what Matrix 1.9's release cycle will look like. A similar call to action will be raised at that point. Note that Matrix 1.8 is set to be released in late August, meaning we're aiming to have Matrix 1.9 thought out before Matrix 1.8 is released, which is a deliberately accelerated timeline than the current Matrix 1.8 release cycle planning.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions about this, please let us know in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org">#sct-office:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3869">MSC3869: Read event relations with the Widget API</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC would allow Matrix Widgets, knowing an event ID, to request any and all other events that relate to it. Thus, if you had a <code>m.room.message</code> event, you could ask the client whether any edits have been made to that event, via asking for <code>m.room.message</code> events with <code>m.replace</code> relations.</p>
<p>This would be useful for Widgets to traverse any data structure that used relations to tie together events - which could model all sorts of use cases!</p>
<p>As always, leave your feedback on the MSC if this is something you're interested in or want to push forwards :)</p>

<p>We released version 1.7 of the Matrix Spec on Thursday.  This release features media repository improvements and reactions.  Thank you to all who contributed to this release, whether through writing or reviewing MSCs, writing spec PRs, or finding spec bugs.  And congratulations to those who had their first MSC make it to the release.  Read the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/05/25/matrix-v-1-7-release">blog post</a> for the full details.</p>
<p>We're in the process of working out what Matrix 1.8 looks like and need to hear what people are working on. If you have an MSC or idea you're planning on looking at in the next 2 months, let us know in #sct-office:matrix.org so we can prioritize it accordingly.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org">dmr</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happy Friday, everyone. This week we disclosed three security advisories for Synapse. The TL;DR is that you should upgrade to at least Synapse 1.74.0 or newer. Please see <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2023/05/24/disclosing-synapse-security-advisories">the Matrix.org blogpost</a> for links to the advisories.</p>
<p>Also of note is the release of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.84.0">Synapse 1.84.0</a> this Tuesday. New in this release is</p>
<ul>
<li>an option to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/15197">prevent downloading media from specified domains</a>;</li>
<li>a new set of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/15312">redis TLS configuration options</a> (Roel ter Maat); and</li>
<li>addition support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4009">new</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2659">stabilised</a> MSCs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside this are a batch of bugfixes and internal improvements. We are aware of one regression in v1.84.0‚Äîexpect a minor release with a fix to that sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>We've also begun an effort to profile and improve the performance of the <code>/messages</code> endpoint. That should benefit everyone, but in particular we hope to improve the UX of the <a href="https://archive.matrix.org/">Matrix Public Archive</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you as ever to our contributors, testers, and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">community of server operators</a>.</p>

<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey, it's been a while. Which means we were busy, just not with developing Nheko! However, we did do some stuff now:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sticker and emoji pickers now have sections and include both normal emojis and custom emojis in the emoji picker. This means your search results are also sectioned and you don't need to use ~ for custom emoji anymore. You can also now edit your custom emoji right from the picker (or rather open the settings menu from there). This should make going crazy with custom emoji much easier and I hope you have fun with it!</li>
<li>LorenDB also finally fixed that pressing a key would focus the input bar but eat the first key. This was pretty annoying, but it should now behave much nicer!</li>
<li>Sateallia meanwhile fixed a similar bug with the focus in the search menu on some platforms, implemented selecting multiple files to upload in the filepicker (before you only could drop a group of files into Nheko at once).</li>
<li>You can now copy images from the image viewer to the clipboard.</li>
<li>And lastly your rooms in the search are now ordered by recency of the last message. This should make rooms with the same name have always the right room appear on top. Additionally upgraded rooms are now in italics, which should make it still possible to jump to them, but also distinguish them in the search.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a nice day and try custom stickers and emojis some time!

<blockquote>
<p>Here's what's happened in NeoChat in the last weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>I (Tobias) implemented support for sending stickers, based on MSC2545. You can now send them from the emoji picker, which has also been improved visually.</li>
<li>I also implemented support for editing your account's stickers in NeoChat's settings. Other parts of the MSC (room stickers, etc.) are coming soon.</li>
<li>James improved read markers and state changed, limiting the number of the that are shown at the same time.</li>
<li>Aleix and I improved the notifications by grouping multiple messages from the same room into a single notification.</li>
<li>James added caching for the last event in a room, meaning that on startup, NeoChat will now sort all rooms in a correct order.</li>
<li>We fixed a bug where the user/room/emoji completion menu randomly did not open.</li>
<li>James finished documenting all of NeoChat's codebase.</li>
<li>I improved NeoChat's space support by replacing the existing space view with a new sidebar in style similar to many other clients.</li>
<li>I also improved logging, which will hopefully help us debug many problems, especially around encryption issues. In the future, if you notice such problems, make a copy of <code>~/.local/share/KDE/neochat.log</code> (on Linux; for other platforms, talk to us to figure out where the log file is) and possible also <code>neochat.log.old</code> immediately, to help with debugging.</li>
<li>Rooms with only two users (i.e., DMs) will now show a more useful sidebar, omitting irrelevant details like the normal room member list.</li>
<li>James also improved NeoChat's developer tools, now showing more useful information.</li>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org">Ivan ü¶Ä</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, new projects have started!</p>
<ul>
<li>A new crate has been created, <code>matrix-sdk-ui</code>, which is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1931">the new home for the UI API</a> the Matrix SDK provides, like <code>Timeline</code>, and <code>RoomList</code>. Developing this kind of UI API inside the Matrix SDK instead of the client side (e.g. ElementX iOS or Android or even Gnome Fractal) means it improves testability and quality greatly, as we can tweak the network layer more easily, and in depth. It also means that it boosts the productivity of developers that create new Matrix clients: no need to deal with synchronisation, room presentation, timeline, pagination etc., everything is managed automatically.
<ul>
<li><code>RoomList</code> is a layer on top of <code>SlidingSync</code>. The work has started, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1911">the progress can be tracked in this meta issue</a>. To make it real, some improvements were necessary on the <code>SlidingSync</code> side, esp. being able <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1942">to change the sync-mode of an existing <code>SlidingSyncList</code></a>, which led to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1955">a nice revamping of the ranges API</a>. We are not mentioning many small clean ups (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1950">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1947">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1919">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1963">4</a> and so on).</li>
<li>Work has started to support <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1948">Sliding Sync sticky parameters properly</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1975">Ruma has been upgraded</a>, notably to support the latest Matrix 1.7 features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the Crypto land:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1970">User/device pairs who have invalid one-time keys are now timed out</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1939"><code>VerificationRequest</code> has a new state when a request transitions</a>. <code>VerificationRequest</code> is used to control the flow of the verification but only up to a certain point. Once different specific verification flows are handled (i.e. SAS or QR Code), the <code>VerificationRequest</code> object creates a child object of the <code>Verification</code> type. The idea behind this patch is to add a new <code>VerificationRequestState</code> variant called <code>Transitioned</code> which holds the child verification object as associated data. This makes it much simpler to go through the whole verification flow by allowing users to just listen to the <code>VerificationRequest::changes()</code> method,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/281">The return of OTK fetching failures</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1944">Replace the <code>libolm</code> backup encryption code with a native Rust version</a>, which allow Wasm targets to use the <code>backups_v1</code> feature of <code>matrix-sdk-crypto</code>,</li>

</li>
<li>In the Notification land, we need two sync loops instead of one (that controls them all), everything is described in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1928">The Two Sync Loops</a>, with sub-issues <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1961">1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1962">2</a>,</li>
<li>In the Media land, we are starting to support <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1968">media uploading progress</a>,</li>
<li>In the Bindings land:
<ul>
<li>We are starting to deploy <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1661">UniFFI async support</a>, which was partly reverted for particular cases, but it works in general,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1954">Stop unconditionally enabling <code>native-tls</code> from <code>matrix-sdk-ffi</code></a>, which led to compilation issue on Android architectures.</li>

<p>Matrix v1.7 has been given a release date of <strong>May 25th</strong>, right before the next TWIM! Expect a matrix.org blog post with all the details on the day.</p>
<p>Leading up to the release we've seen a number of great spec PRs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+">appearing and being merged</a>! Thank you to everyone for writing them (saving the SCT some time!) and to other reviewing on commenting. It's a huge help and the spec feels like it's chugging along at a blistering pace!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2213">MSC2213: Rejoinability of private/invite-only rooms</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC adds the ability for users who have previously joined a room to rejoin again. Typically this isn't desired in a public room setting, but it does specifically make sense in the case of a DM that you've left and want to return to without the other user needing to invite you. This case has specific implications for cases where there could be only ever one room between two users. Being able to rejoin it if the other user has disappeared is key!</p>
<p>Outside of the DM use case, this functionality can mostly already be achieved by using <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms">restricted rooms</a>, where users of a given space/another room can always join your room. However, it would be nice to have the flexibility of allowing certain users to rejoin a room without needing another room to serve as proof of membership.</p>
<p>Is this something you're interested in? Do you have additional use cases? Feel free to check out the MSC and comment with your thoughts!</p>

<p>Fractal 5.beta1 is out!</p>
<p>Fractal 5.beta1 is the first beta release since the rewrite of Fractal to take advantage of GTK 4 and the Matrix Rust SDK. It is the result of over two years of work.</p>
<p>New features since Fractal 5.alpha1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joining room by ID, by alias or with a Matrix URI</li>
<li>Creation of direct chats</li>
<li>Sending and displaying read receipts, read markers and typing notifications</li>
<li>Notifications on new messages</li>
<li>Highlight messages with mentions</li>
<li>Added media file history viewers in the room details, thanks to our GSoC intern Marco Melorio</li>
<li>Displaying the other user's avatar as a room avatar for direct chats</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are a also a lot of less visible changes, fixes and translations thanks to all our contributors, and our upstream projects.</p>
<p>As the version implies, this is still considered beta stage and might trigger crashes or other bugs but overall should be pretty stable. It is available to install via Flathub Beta, see the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal#beta-version">instructions in our README</a>.</p>
<p><em>The GNOME 44 runtime used by the beta version Flatpak was shipped with a GTK version that has a regression which messes with room order in the sidebar: some rooms can appear twice and some rooms are missing. This is a known issue so there is no need to report it, there is nothing for us to do but wait until the fix is backported and shipped in an update of the GNOME runtime. In the meantime, the nightly version is unaffected by that.</em></p>
<p>A list of blocking issues for the release of version 5 can be found in the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/milestones/18">Fractal 5 milestone</a> on GitLab. All contributions are welcome !

<p><a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el">Ement.el</a>, a Matrix client for the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> Lisp machine and text editor, has been released at <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/releases/tag/v0.9">version 0.9</a>.  Changes since the last release include:</p>
<p><em>Additions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Option <code>ement-room-timestamp-header-align</code> controls how timestamp headers are aligned in room buffers.</li>
<li>Option <code>ement-room-view-hook</code> runs functions when <code>ement-room-view</code> is called.  (By default, it refreshes the room list buffer.)</li>
<li>In the room list, middle-clicking a room which has a buffer closes its buffer.</li>
<li>Basic support for video events.  (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/viiru-">Arto Jantunen</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Changes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Using new option <code>ement-room-timestamp-header-align</code>, timestamp headers default to right-aligned.  (With default settings, this keeps them near message timestamps and makes for a cleaner appearance.)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fixes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Recognition of certain MXID or displayname forms in outgoing messages when linkifying (aka &quot;pilling&quot;) them.</li>
<li>Unreadable room avatar images no longer cause errors.  (Fixes <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/147">#147</a>.  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jgarte">@jgarte</a> for reporting.)</li>

<p>Sometimes, development isn't about writing code, it's about looking ahead and planning!

<p>I've developed a rudimentary Matrix-Library for Scala for akka, for distributed async systems.
The underlying code is actually automatically generated from the specification, with strong typing, automatic JSON (de-) serializiation and a rudimentary client provided.
It features the entirety of the client-server API. This is achieved via a custom code-generator.
This library provides <em>just enough</em> stuff to easily build a fully fletched client.
A more high-level client is in development right now. Encryption will be hard, but will hopefully be implemented via JNI in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>I announced a little side project yesterday: Beepberry - a portable e-paper computer for hackers, designed for chatting on Beeper (universal messaging app built on top of Matrix). My day job is running <a href="https://beeper.com/">Beeper</a>, but I will always have a soft spot for building hardware (I was the founder of Pebble).</p>
<p>I wanted to create a ‚Äòweekend‚Äô device that would let me stay in touch with friends and family, without the distractions of a full smartphone. I imagined a tiny, hackable e-paper screen with a physical keyboard, powered by a Raspberry Pi, that I could use to chat around my home‚Ä¶and do pretty much nothing else.</p>
<p>Before Matrix, the idea probably would not have gone anywhere. Most chat apps do not have an API, making it¬†practically impossible to hack something like this together.</p>
<p>I partnered with <a href="https://twitter.com/sqfmi">sqmfi</a> and they‚Äôre starting to take pre-orders at https://beepberry.sqfmi.com for the first batch. It‚Äôs $79 (or $99 including a Pi Zero). Specs: Sharp Memory LCD (same display tech as in Pebble!), Pi Zero (BT/WIFI), physical keyboard, 2000mAh lipo.</p>
<p>On top of being an amazing chat device, it‚Äôs basically an e-paper Cyberdeck that fits in your pocket. It‚Äôs a ton of fun to hack on. Keep in mind - THIS IS NOT A REAL FINISHED PRODUCT. It‚Äôs basically a devkit.</p>

<p>The release of Matrix 1.7 is expected in the next 1-2 weeks! Keep an eye out for announcement blog post specifically for it. We'll call it out in the following TWIM as well of course :)</p>
<p>Matrix 1.8 is currently scheduled for around August 2023.</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3914">MSC3914: Matrix native group call push rule</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC adds a new push rule that causes your Matrix client to emit a notification if a group call (as defined by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401">MSC3401</a> is started in a Matrix room. This MSC (obviously) depends on MSC3041, so that MSC will need to be accepted before this one can be.</p>
<p>There is currently a client-side implementation for this MSC, but it is missing a homeserver side one (for adding the push rule).</p>
<p>Check out the MSC if you're interested, or perhaps take a look at adding that server-side implementation?</p>

<p>A Matrix Client written for MTRNord</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:midnightthoughts.space">MTRNord</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone :)</p>
<p>I recently started to work on my own personal Matrix client. It's still early in the progress, but I wanted to share it.</p>
<p>It mostly is based around some core concepts of element-web UI, however deviates from it quite quickly.
Notable changes are that it merges the space and roomviews into a single list, it has a richtext editor, and it renders things slightly different but close to element-web.</p>
<p>Additionally, the client is using the matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-js bindings as underlying e2ee and sliding-sync as it's /sync implementation.</p>
<p>This week it's just a preview, but I hope to improve upon it and make it more usable for people. You will find plenty of bugs like e2ee not decrypting past messages, no upscroll, no verification. But for very basic chatting it should work already.</p>
<p>Feel free to peek into <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#cetirizine:midnightthoughts.space">#cetirizine:midnightthoughts.space</a> or have a look at the repo https://github.com/MTRNord/cetirizine or try it for yourself at https://mtrnord.github.io/cetirizine (Or just view the storyboard at https://mtrnord.github.io/cetirizine/storybook )</p>
<p>Note that since this is meant to be a personal client there is no support given, and it's purely &quot;free and source available&quot; but neither includes community support nor any form of professional support. This is to prevent mental exhaustion for myself. Also note that this is still very early into the process. So many things are missing or buggy. If you try it, be careful.

<p><a href="https://radicale.org">Radicale</a> is dead simple CalDAV/CardDAV server, it's not fancy, but does the job. The only caveat with Radicale we had at <a href="https://etke.cc/?utm_source=twim">etke.cc</a> is manual htpasswd-based user management which is painful both for us and our customers.</p>
<p>So, we did that thing, called <code>radicale-auth-matrix</code> and you can use it authenticate from radicale against your matrix server, delegating user management on matrix side, where you have proper API and even UI for that.</p>
<p>How it works?
You enter your matrix account's credentials when login to your Radicale server, that's it! It even has simple hash-based cache to avoid unnecessary requests to matrix API once you logged in.</p>
<p>Pretty niche thing, but it pain caused by manual user management is gone üòÑ </p>

<p>Hi TWIM! It's been 3 months since a good chunk of the Matrix community gathered at FOSDEM. We had lots of fun meeting people at FOSDEM itself and on top an overwhelming response to the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org">#fosdem23-community-meetup:matrix.org</a> we hosted on Friday in advance.</p>
<p>One of the next hacker events has now appeared on the horizon, namely <strong>Chaos Communication Camp 2023</strong> happening August 15-19. Find all the info about it in several posts on https://events.ccc.de/category/camp-2023/ and in the rooms contained within the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#camp2023:events.ccc.de">#camp2023:events.ccc.de</a> space. Note that this event, while happening close to Berlin, Germany, and some of the presented content might be in German, the Camp still targets an international audience.</p>
<p>Some of us have already gotten together to organize a Matrix village at the CCCamp. If you are interested in attending or - even better - have any ideas to share, we invite you to join us in that room. In particular, we will meet next Monday (May 15) in a video conference in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#chaosevents:matrix.org">#chaosevents:matrix.org</a> for planning, exchanging info, etc.</p>

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>Lots of MSCs moving through the pipeline this week! Plus a myriad of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">spec changes</a> too! The spec seems to be gently humming along.</p>
<p>In other news, the next release of the spec, v1.7, is coming up in the not-too-distant future. In keeping with our roughly quarterly release schedule - the release of v1.6 was on February 14th, 2023 - a new release of the spec should come some time in next few weeks.</p>
<p>We haven't set a date yet, but expect to do so soon. So watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3741">MSC3741: Revealing the useful login flows to clients after a soft logout</a>!</p>
<p>This MSC fixes an edge case in the spec. Imagine the following scenario. You're logged into your homeserver via an SSO flow (let's say by signing into GitLab), and then you try to change your password on GitLab. Doing so may cause a &quot;soft logout&quot; to occur for your Matrix client. A soft logout, by the way, happens when your access token is invalidated, but your client is told explicitly not to wipe its local state (including encryption keys).</p>
<p>Your Matrix client is telling you to log back in again, and in doing so calls out to the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3login"><code>GET /_matrix/client/v3/login</code></a> endpoint to see what login methods are available. Your homeserver supports both password-based and SSO-based login, so that's what you get back. Your client happily presents you both options. You try to type your GitLab password, but it's incorrect. And you've just given your GitLab password to this Matrix homeserver in plaintext - oh no!</p>
<p>The problem here stems from the fact that <code>GET /login</code> is unauthenticated. The homeserver doesn't know who you are when you attempt to log in again, and thus can't tailor the available login methods to those that make sense for you. This MSC aims to fix this by having your Matrix client, upon trying to learn how to log in again after a soft logout, provide your expired access token in an <code>Authorization</code> request header. The homeserver can then check and see that 1) you were just soft logout'd and 2) you are an account that is authorised via SSO - so it doesn't make sense to suggest you log in again via a password specific to your Matrix homeserver!</p>
<p>While this MSC discusses a valuable solution, it is worth considering that the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api">User-Interactive Authentication system</a> as a whole is going to be completely replaced by OpenID Connect instead, which will make this problem (and solution) moot. Still, that day is not here yet, so if you suffer from this problem today, this may be one method to deal with it.</p>

<p>A Minimal, simple, multi-platform chat client for the Matrix protocol.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@alariej:matrix.org">JFA</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Version 1.6.5 of Quadrix (Matrix client for mobiles and desktops) has been released and is available in the respective app stores.</p>
<p>The latest changes include the replacement of the Jitsi Meet videoconferencing functionality with an embedded version of Element Call, using matrix-widget-api. Quadrix loads the Element Call web app located at https://element-call.netlify.app, which is the continually updated dev version. The Quadrix implementation is not quite compatible with Element Web, since it uses non-encrypted WebRTC signalling, but that's something I'll be working on in the next weeks.</p>
<p>Please go test-drive Element Call in Quadrix and leave feedback/comments at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#quadrix:matrix.org">#quadrix:matrix.org</a> or in the issues at https://github.com/alariej/quadrix (stars welcome :-)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>libolm is an implementation of the Olm and Megolm cryptographic ratchets used for end-to-end encryption in Matrix.  libolm 3.2.15 has been released.  This is mainly a maintenance release that improves the Python packaging and fixes a TypeScript issue.  The biggest change is that the Python package can now be installed from pypi.org, the default repository for Python packages.  The source package includes the libolm sources, so you do not need libolm to be installed separately any more.  All you need is cmake (or possibly GNU make) and a C/C++ compiler, and run <code>pip install python-olm</code>.  It unfortunately does not yet work on Windows, but should work on UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux and *BSD, and even macOS.</p>
<p>In other news: with Element iOS and Element Android switching to the rust crypto SDK, and hence using vodozemac, I'm considering deprecating the iOS and Android bindings for libolm.  If you still need those bindings, please let me know.</p>

<p>Some of you might have heard of it, but we're about to launch a (long overdue) update of the matrix.org website! The current one has served us well, but it grew organically as exciting projects and features were added to it. It became a little impractical to navigate and sometimes confusing.</p>
<p>The new matrix.org website, nicknamed &quot;Zola&quot; <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">after the static site generator it uses</a>, is not just a fresh coat of paint on the website: it's a complete rewrite to address three kind of people who would browse the website. Sorted by time they're willing to spend on a web page:</p>
<ul>
<li>The general public, who is not tech savvy and doesn't want to understand how things work, but who wants to get an easy onboarding</li>
<li>Community managers, who are not <em>too</em> tech savvy but are willing to spend a bit of time to understand more advanced use cases</li>
<li>Developers who want to understand how matrix works, and who want to build &amp; break things!</li>
</ul>
<p>We're in the final stages of developing the website, and <em>we need you</em> to help us making it ready! Head to <a href="https://matrix.turbo.fish/">the preview of the website</a>, use the website, and give is feedback by opening <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues">an issue on the website tracker</a>. Please make sure the issue doesn't <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Azola">already exist before opening it</a>.</p>
<p>Reporting the following is particularly helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something looks off, misplaced, is not aligned well or behaves oddly</li>
<li>Something is missing (the doc is incomplete? Some informationg is missing somewhere?)</li>
<li>There's an accessibility issue</li>
<li>Something doesn't work on your browser</li>
<li>It's not clear how to get to a particular information (you're looking for a client or a SDK, and after visiting the website you still don't know which one to use or how to get it?)</li>
</ul>
<p>We still need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish up the Bots page (which will likely be replaced by an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues/1539#issuecomment-1444180681">Integrations</a> page)</li>
<li>Flesh out the support page to highlight more of the work of the Matrix.org Foundation</li>
<li>Import the historical projects that are no longer maintained (clients, servers, bots, bridges, sdks)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to follow along, you can join the #matrix.org-website:matrix.org room.</p>
<p>Help us make the website look as neat as possible for launch!</p>

<p>Lots of MSCs moving through the process this week. I'm particularly excited about <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3952">MSC3952: Intentional Mentions</a>, which modifies the default push rules to only generate a notification if the sender's client has specifically intended to mention you. That's a really impactful, user-facing feature!</p>
<p>The other MSCs on the list, especially <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2246">MSC2246: Asynchronous media uploads</a>, bring quality-of-life improvements and unlock future functionality in Matrix. Check them out!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3189">MSC3189: Per-room/per-space profiles</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3189">MSC3189</a> proposes a concept of per-room/per-space profiles within Matrix, allowing users to have different display names and avatars across their various rooms and spaces. To do so, an optional query parameter scope is added to all profile-related endpoints. When specified, the scope defines the profile that should be used to complete that action.</p>
<p>That way you can represent yourself in a business context in one space, and a less serious context in another space. Short of profile-rooms, this would get us a fair way towards having multiple public profiles in Matrix!</p>
<p>Check out the MSC if you're interested. Reviews are always welcome!</p>

<p>This handy tool bridges Meshtastic channels and Matrix rooms 1:1, and is built using matrix-nio.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Meshtastic, it's a project enabling encrypted long-distance messaging via decentralized LoRa meshnets, using affordable devices. LoRa is license-free and certification-free in most of the world, making it accessible for everyone. Radios automatically rebroadcast messages, creating a mesh network for group communication‚Äîeven from the furthest member. The Meshtastic mesh can sustain up to 80 device nodes, depending on settings.</p>
<p>Naturally, we wanted to integrate this incredible tech with Matrix.</p>
<p><strong>M&lt;&gt;M Relay's Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bidirectional message relay between Meshtastic meshnets and Matrix chat rooms, supporting multiple meshnets</li>
<li>Serial and network connections to Meshtastic devices</li>
<li>Truncation of long messages to fit within Meshtastic's payload size</li>
<li>Extended features via plugins, such as meshnet health plugin analyzing telemetry data and providing network stats</li>
<li>E2EE support is planned, but not yet implemented (we appreciate any help!)</li>
</ul>
<p>We're excited about extending our meshnets' range using existing Matrix bridges. Learn more and download the files <a href="https://github.com/geoffwhittington/meshtastic-matrix-relay">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="hookshot-4-0-0-makes-its-debut">Hookshot 4.0.0 makes its debut</h3>
<p>Greetings all; Hookshot latest release is out, along with some exciting news!</p>
<p>You may recall the TWIM post for 2.6.0 from back in January having announced <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/encryption.html">Encrypted Room Support</a>, though not without warnings of it being experimental &amp; not quite ready for prime time.  Well, the latest release changes all that: <strong>encrypted room support is much more stable now,</strong> as we've collaborated with the fine folks behind the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@matrix-org/matrix-sdk-crypto-nodejs">matrix-sdk-crypto Rust library</a> to squash some of the biggest bugs that had been plaguing Hookshot.  Encryption support even works for <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/service_bots.html">Service Bots</a>!</p>
<p>Other than enabling encryption in your Hookshot's config file, there is no migration necessary to enable these fixes, even if you've already enabled Hookshot's encryption from before this release.  Please give it a try and let us know how it goes!</p>
<p>This release also brings some useful features for RSS feeds: <strong>the ability to customize the format of feed messages</strong>, and <strong>the option to toggle posting messages for feed failures.</strong>  This provides much more control &amp; peace of mind over your feed messages, so give them a try &amp; enjoy!</p>
<p>Finally, to align with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v20-release-announce">the recent release of Node 20</a>, this latest Hookshot release <strong>adds support for Node 20, and drops support for Node 16.</strong>  The latter is due to Hookshot's policy of supporting only LTS &amp; Active releases of Node.  So, please ensure to update your Node versions if needed.</p>
<p>The release is available at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/4.0.0, or by doing <code>docker pull halfshot/matrix-hookshot:4.0.0</code>.  And as usual, feel free to direct any questions about Hookshot in our Matrix room: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#hookshot:half-shot.uk">#hookshot:half-shot.uk</a></p>

<p>Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 id="major-new-1-0-0-rc1-for-the-irc-bridge">Major new 1.0.0-rc1 for the IRC bridge</h3>
<p>Friday's greetings TWIM. On June 15th, 2018 I submitted my first pull request to matrix-appservice-irc. Little did I know then, that nearly 5 years later I would now be announcing the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc1">1.0.0</a> release candidate of the IRC bridge. This release brings a major new component, which is the ability to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VKBD_6PTvs">restart the bridge <em>in place</em></a>. This allows us to effectively do noise-less restarts of our larger bridges (in nearly all cases). This should also give us quite a bit more headroom on the bridge, so performance should improve.</p>
<p>The feature is currently marked as experimental but has been tested by the bridge crew fairly extensively, so the major wrinkles should have been ironed out by now. We'd really appreciate feedback, so please <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-appservice-irc/latest/connection_pooling.html">try it out</a>.</p>
<p>We've also bumped the minimum required version of the bridge to Node 18 to slightly get ahead of the curve, as Node 16 is due to lose support later this year.</p>
<p>Notable changes for this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>IRC connections can now be run via an external process using &quot;connection pooling&quot;, allowing the bridge to be restarted without IRC connection loss. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1669">#1669</a>)</li>
<li>Bridge logging can now be hot-reloaded. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1704">#1704</a>)</li>
<li>Fix not handling thread fallbacks as replies. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1697">#1697</a>)</li>
<li>Show a helpful error for !link/!unlink admin failures, rather than &quot;Check the logs for details&quot;, in more cases. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1702">#1702</a>)</li>
<li>Fix documentation not being built and uploaded to GitHub pages on release. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1703">#1703</a>)</li>
<li>Fix linking rooms from setup widget when a <code>networkId</code> is configured. (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1706">#1706</a>)</li>
</ul>

<li>Trinity has been <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bnjbvr/trinity">dockerized</a>! It's now possible to start Trinity in a Docker environment, provided <a href="https://github.com/bnjbvr/trinity#deploy-with-docker">a few environment variables and configuration options</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>I've been working on refactoring one of my older projects, <a href="https://git.pixie.town/f0x/synapse-media-proxy">synapse-media-proxy</a>, which separates the media repository from Synapse (similar to <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a>), but instead only acting as a caching proxy layer. This keeps the media in long-term storage at the homeserver (which is literally at home in my case, behind a slower residential line), but serves requests as fast as possible from a cheap VPS which keeps a minimal in-memory cache.</p>
<p>The refactor includes a lot of general cleanup/rework, but also moves the caching from in-process caches to a separate Redis database, as my previous implementation had some memory leakage. While not quite finished yet (no uploads, url previews), preliminary benchmarks for downloads and thumbnailing are very promising, way faster than both the original implementation and normal synapse. Benchmarks were done with <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a>, all against localhost on the same machine for a fair comparison.</p>

It's still in the very early stages, but I've gotten to the point of being able to write a simple echo bot.  I'll be tackling end-to-end encryption next.  Feedback is welcome.  Client authors, if you have any tips and tricks, or potential pitfalls, that you think that every client author should know, feel free to share.  The document can be read at https://uhoreg.gitlab.io/matrix-tutorial/ and the sources are at https://gitlab.com/uhoreg/matrix-tutorial.</p>

<p>An open source Matrix homeserver implementation written from scratch in ANSI C and designed to be lightweight and simple, yet functional</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jordan:bancino.net">Jordan Bancino</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Telodendria, the very-much-a-work-in-progress Matrix homeserver written in C,  has undergone some major architecture changes that make it more robust, more maintainable, and more feature-complete. Of note are these new features that came about as a result of the changes, though there are many more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TLS:</strong> We now have full TLS support for both the client and the server. Take your pick of OpenSSL or LibreSSL, or easily add support for another TLS implementation using our simple I/O API.</li>
<li><strong>Admin API:</strong> Work on the administrator API has begun. This includes implementing user privileges, and moving the program configuration to the database so it can be managed with a simple JSON API.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also done a little work on the Matrix specification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Management:</strong> Users can now change their passwords, set display names and avatars, and get information about their account.</li>
<li><strong>User Interactive Authentication (UIA):</strong> UIA is basically complete, I'm just working on wrapping up the web fallback pages. You can now use registration tokens to register for accounts on a Telodendria server as well, though as of the time of my writing this, these tokens can't be created through the Admin API quite yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost all of Client Authentication is complete and we are almost ready to move on to the core of the Matrix specification‚Äîrooms and events.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria-newsletter:bancino.net">#telodendria-newsletter:bancino.net</a> for more details, and feel free to join the discussion at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria-general:bancino.net">#telodendria-general:bancino.net</a> if you're interested in the project.</p>

<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org">Shay</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome back to the backend section of TWIM. This week we released Synapse
v1.82.0rc1 for your consideration. Here are a few of the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow loading the <code>/directory/room/{roomAlias}</code> endpoint on workers</li>
<li>Add some validation to <code>instance_map</code> configuration loading</li>
<li>Delete server-side backup keys when deactivating an account</li>
<li>Fix and document untold assumption that <code>on_logged_out</code> module hooks will be called before the deletion of pushers</li>
<li>Remove the broken, unspecced registration fallback. Note that the <em>login</em> fallback is unaffected by this change.</li>
</ul>
<p>And much more! You can take a look at the release notes here: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases. As always, if you encounter a bug feel free to report it at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new/choose.</p>

<h3 id="construct-website">Construct (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">website</a>)</h3>
<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>üîì <strong>End-to-End Encryption</strong> is significantly more reliable in Construct this week. <strong>E2EE</strong> had always been flaky, but it was never clear before where it was going wrong.</p>
<p>‚õèÔ∏è The ice broke earlier this week when I noticed in a small corner of an Element dialogue that my <code>device_id</code> was being cut off at its <code>:</code> character. After <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/commit/15cb6bfdcaedc8e34db14affa6b56dee26c27ff5">simplifying</a> the <code>device_id</code> grammar things started to light up green again. I was then able to work through a standard list of <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/commit/0a151a3a9092dcee4eb37af85f8f217b22a62926">bugs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/commit/080748f0af172045fb0402492c945cf1595cac70">ancient</a> <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/commit/336026dde675e3266e93e98329049612dabef423">code-rot</a>, and a couple of <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/commit/1e42fa16a72ce339b14e72d2e5a7a5615d52f04f">incomplete</a> <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis/commit/321ea3d6417250f2848d04397b9feffcf15e4158">endpoints</a>.</p>
<p>üîê All of this results in robust encryption sessions that survive clear-cache and reload, proper key backups without old sessions hanging around, and interactive verification without random cancellations. At the time of this writing, there is still one remaining hold-up with device verification for cross-signing so this week's <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jevolk/construct/tags">dockers</a> might not finish building until mid-Saturday.</p>
<p>üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'd like to thank Giovanni Bottaro for tracking down an issue leading one of the patches above.
üôã I'd like to thank qg for tracking down a rocksdb-related bug late last week right after TWIM. This fix has already been shipped in the latest Construct.</p>

<p>Matrix SDK implemented in Elm. </p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bram:noordstar.me">Bram</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After having received feedback from the Matrix and Elm community on the <a href="https://chess.noordstar.me/">Chess client</a>, it is now time for the final development phase: making the SDK developer-friendly so that a version <code>v1.0.0</code> can be published.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk">Elm SDK</a> has received a large refactor, which includes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more <code>Task</code> types! Everything is now packaged in a <code>Cmd</code> type from a <code>Task Never VaultUpdate</code> type, which means that the <code>Vault</code> type handles all potential complaints for you.</li>
<li>When a <code>Cmd</code> fails and the <code>Vault</code> thinks it is wise to try again, it will sneak that one along with the next <code>Cmd</code> you're planning on giving to the API. Feedback on this behaviour is welcome, this might still change before version <code>1.0.0</code>.</li>
<li>Greatly improved documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>The current plan is to implement filters so that the SDK will be butter smooth sailing through that endless initial sync. There's still a few ambiguities left in the Matrix spec that are holding the SDK back as a pure and immutable language, but we're slowly getting there.</p>
<p>For demo purposes, here's a demonstration of how to get all named Matrix rooms from your client:</p>
<pre data-lang="elm" style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;" class="language-elm "><code class="language-elm" data-lang="elm"><span>rooms </span><span style="color:#569cd6;">: List String

<h2 id="spec-updates">Spec Updates</h2>
<p>The concept of Linearized Matrix (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3995">MSC3995</a>) is moving forwards as a potential answer to the European Union's, Digital Markets Act. The fully-decentralised Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) model of Matrix is well-known, yet complex to implement and thus a potential blocker to gatekeepers who are looking for an interoperable messaging protocol to link their chat service to. Enter Linearized Matrix, a concept of a Matrix room that uses a linked-list to store events in a room, rather than a DAG. Crucially, while being simpler to implement, our aim is to be forward-compatible with the DAG version of Matrix, such that gatekeepers may switch over to DAG-style Matrix in the future if they so chose.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3995">MSC3995</a> for more information, and a reminder that this is all still very much in flux!</p>
<h2 id="random-msc-of-the-week">Random MSC of the Week</h2>
<p>The random MSC of the week is... <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2943">MSC2943: Return an event ID for membership endpoints</a>!</p>
<p>Currently, when you send a (state) event manually via <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#put_matrixclientv3roomsroomidsendeventtypetxnid">PUT /_matrix/client/v3/rooms/{roomId}/send/{eventType}/{txnId}</a>, you'll receive an event ID in the response. While you can send membership events this way, it's often a bit nicer to use the various <code>POST /_matrix/client/v3/rooms/{roomId}/join,leave,kick</code> endpoints instead. However, these do not return an event ID in their response. For clients that don't use <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3sync"><code>/sync</code></a>, this would force them to use the former, generic endpoint in order to retrieve the event ID of the membership event.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2943">MSC2943</a> attempts to rectify that by specifying that membership-related endpoints should return an event ID, similar to the generic event send endpoint. Currently this MSC is just waiting on an implementation in a homeserver (and possible a client) in order to move forward. If you feel strongly about this change being included in the Matrix spec, why not get your hands dirty with some homeserver dev?</p>

<h3 id="synapse-website">Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org">Shay</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another week has gone by and we here at Synapse have another release for you, v1.81.0, filled with features and bugfixes. But first some announcements:</p>
<p>Synapse now attempts the versioned appservice paths before falling back to the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/application-service-api/#legacy-routes">legacy paths</a>. Usage of the legacy routes should be considered deprecated.</p>
<p>Additionally, Synapse has supported sending the application service access token via <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/application-service-api/#authorization">the <code>Authorization</code> header</a> since v1.70.0. For backwards compatibility it is <em>also</em> sent as the <code>access_token</code> query parameter. This is insecure and should be considered deprecated.</p>
<p>A future version of Synapse (v1.88.0 or later) will remove support for legacy application service routes and query parameter authorization.</p>
<p>And now the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to enable/disable registrations when in the OIDC flow.</li>
<li>Added a primitive helper script for listing worker endpoints. </li>
<li>Built Debian packages for Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar Lobster)</li>
<li>Fixed a long-standing bug preventing users from rejoining rooms after being banned and unbanned over federation. Contributed by Nico.</li>
<li>Fixed a long-standing bug where edits of non-<code>m.room.message</code> events would not be correctly bundled. </li>
<li>Fixed a bug introduced in Synapse v1.55.0 which could delay remote homeservers being able to decrypt encrypted messages sent by local users.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so much more! To read about everything in the release, take a look at the release notes <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.81.0">here</a> and otherwise have a great week.</p>

<h3 id="construct-website">Construct (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct">website</a>)</h3>
<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You probably know about the client command-line that pops up when a message starts with <code>/</code>. Construct has its own server-side command-line when a message starts with <code>\</code>. Unlike commands sent to the <code>!control</code> room, the server-side command-line is available to all users and not just administrators. In fact, the <code>!control</code> room is quite pass√© as I find myself always using the <code>control</code> server-side command, since the results can be echoed to the room I'm in and others can see it too.</p>
<p>This week Construct's server-side command-line gained the <code>watch</code> command. This is similar to <code>watch(1)</code> in unix environments. You type <code>watch &lt;interval&gt; &lt;command&gt;</code> to repeat your command at a set interval. Previously the <code>watch</code> command was only available at the terminal <a href="https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/wiki/Useful-console-command-examples#accessing-the-console">console</a>. The <code>watch</code> command will run until you click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button, or redact the command itself.</p>

<h3 id="nheko-website">Nheko (<a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io">website</a>)</h3>
<p>Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev">Nico</a> reports</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I found some time to step away from the 3d printer (damn, those things are addiciting), let me give you an update of some of the changes happening recently in Nheko!</p>
<p>A very fundamental change from LorenDB is that Nheko now renders messages it doesn't understand. For various reasons Nheko always tried to hide those from you, but LorenDB convinced me, that showing them has more benefits than downsides and also did all the changes and wrote plenty of tests, even when I was especially picky! And at the same time Nheko can now render the rainfall chat effect. üåßÔ∏è</p>
<p>Similarly I reworked how our message variant/enum type works. This made the debug build of Nheko shrink from 450MB to 350MB for me, which is quite significant, even if it probably has no visible impact on any users, since the compressed debug size as well as the stripped binary are basically the same size. (The flatpaks were at 5MB download size and still are at 5MB download size.) It does make some of our error messages nicer and allows us to implement some further improvements for devs down the line. It does mean Nheko now won't compile on GCC10 anymore though, which is included in the current debian stable release. But the next Debian release is just around the corner, so hopefully the impact from that is limited.</p>
<p>We also had a nice contribution from Sateallia: You can now order rooms alphabetically. While I never saw any use for that feature, some people can't live without it and I appreciate that someone stepped up to implement it.</p>
<p>And the last interesting change, we teaked our threads UI a bit again. Because it was easy to miss, that a message is in a thread, we added a thread indicator on the left as well. We are still experimenting if that should replace the old indicator or it should complement it, so lease give feedback if it is an improvement or not.

<p>This last week the core team has been working on Linearized Matrix, which now exists in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3995">MSC form</a>. The idea is still very much in flux, but the MSC covers a large part of the backing context for the overall approach.

<p>Today's random proposal is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3860">MSC3860: Media Download Redirects</a>! Quite a few medium-large servers use a CDN of some kind to host media shared in rooms, and currently the usefulness of that CDN is diminished by servers not necessarily being able to tell clients that the media is actually found on another URL. This proposal formalizes HTTP 307 redirects, and the SCT is interested to hear if this will break any clients - check it out, leave some comments, and let us know :)</p>

<p>A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org">Jason Volk</a> announces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct features a Github webhook bot built into the server as a loadable module. This is something which existed from the very first days of the project and something I've worked on intermittently. For those that don't remember shortly after reactions were released in Riot, Construct was the first to make use of them as status indicators for continuous integration by reacting with üü° and üü¢. Sometime later we were one-upped by the creativity of the folks over at #nheko whose bot sends a very baroque set of reactions for individual Gitlab jobs.</p>
<p>Last week Construct added a rather large Docker image matrix both for release consumption and to replace the the Appveyor CI. I'm sad to see Appveyor go since only a couple weeks ago they were very helpful with a support ticket of mine, but our needs now have exceeded that and I prefer to do things myself.</p>
<p>This week I'd like to present Construct's live-action continuous-integration status bar. Each box is actually a clickable hyperlink to the Github actions page, so when something turns red you can find the error.</p>
<p>If you're interested in a demonstration, I would have some screencasts but nothing I've tried yet seems to work in wayland. As always, feel free to check out <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net">#construct:zemos.net</a> for a live demonstration of the real thing.</p>

<h2 id="quaternion-0-0-96-beta">Quaternion 0.0.96 beta</h2>
<p>The first beta of Quaternion's new version has been published earlier this week, with (still work-in-progress and incomplete at the moment) E2EE support as the main highlight. The release notes can be found at <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/tree/0.0.96-beta1">the usual place at GitHub</a>. Most of the changes are actually due to using libQuotient 0.7 under the hood so it's a short read this time; but make sure to check <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.7.0#user-content-e2ee">the E2EE section in the library release notes</a> (two key things: don't use encryption if it's the only device you're logged in from, and don't expect Quaternion to decrypt historical messages). Translators are welcome to update the strings at <a href="https://app.lokalise.com/project/730769035bbc328c31e863.62506391">the usual place</a> (you only need strings tagged <code>dev</code>).</p>
<p>For this beta, both the pre-built packages at GitHub and the Flatpak (NB: you have to use the Flathub <a href="https://discourse.flathub.org/t/how-to-use-flathub-beta/2111">beta channel</a> to get it) have E2EE switched on and you <em>cannot</em> turn it off; so please don't use this version for anything serious (I know you waited for so long; it's still the first beta, okay?). The work on <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/issues/603">making E2EE opt-in on a per-account basis</a> is ongoing, and there's still a <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/projects/2#column-5799377">laundry list</a> of things to do before the final 0.0.96 is released, with a lot of quick and easy fixes - so please help with closing them off to make the release come sooner!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As by <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/help/design-guidelines#design-for-a-concrete-use-case">Elm's guidelines</a>, packages and SDK's in Elm aren't just published as they're being developed - they're published when they're finished and can be used widely.</p>
<p>For this reason, the final phase of developing <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk">the Elm SDK</a> is to test, make examples, and ask the community for feedback. For this reason, I've built <a href="https://github.com/BramvdnHeuvel/Matrix-Chess">a chess client as a demo version</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully,</p>
<ul>
<li>This shows the performance optimization of Elm to the Matrix community. The entire client fits in a 57,22kB JavaScript file, which is quite small when considering that Hydrogen's JavaScript file is 13 times as large.</li>
<li>This shows the potential of using Matrix to the Elm community as a simple back-end for the purpose of <em>&quot;and now you can do this with other Elm clients&quot;</em>.</li>
