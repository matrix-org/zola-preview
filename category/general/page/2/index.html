                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We've been flooded with questions about the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220315IPR25504/">DMA</a>
since it was announced last week, and have spotted some of the
gatekeepers jumping to the wrong conclusions about what it might entail.
Just in case you don't want to wade through
yesterday's <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/29/how-do-you-implement-interoperability-in-a-dma-world/">sprawling blog post</a>,
we've put together a quick FAQ to cover the most important points based on
our understanding.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-dma-mean-for-the-gatekeepers">What does DMA mean for the gatekeepers?</h3>
<p>The gatekeepers will have to open and document their existing APIs, so that
alternative clients and/or bridges can connect to their service. The DMA
requires that the APIs <em>must</em> expose the same level of privacy for remote
users as for local users. So, if their service is end-to-end-encrypted
(E2EE), the APIs must expose the same E2EE semantics (e.g. so that an
alternative client connecting would have to implement E2EE too). For
E2EE-capable APIs to work, the gatekeeper will likely have to model remote
users as if they were local in their system. In the short term (one year
horizon) this applies only to 1:1 chats and file transfers. In the long term
(three year horizon) this applies to group chats and voip calls/conferences
too.</p>
<h3 id="who-counts-as-a-gatekeeper">Who counts as a “gatekeeper”?</h3>
<p>The DMA defines any tech company worth over €75B or with over €7.5B of
turnover as a gatekeeper, who must open their communication APIs. This means
only the tech giants are in scope (e.g. as of today that includes Meta,
Apple, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce/Slack - not Signal, Telegram, Discord,
Twitter).</p>
<h3 id="does-this-mean-the-gatekeepers-are-being-forced-to-implement-an-open-standard-such-as-matrix-or-xmpp">Does this mean the gatekeepers are being forced to implement an open standard such as Matrix or XMPP?</h3>
<p>No. They can keep their existing implementations and APIs. For
interoperability with other service providers, they will need to use a
bridge (which could bridge via a common language such as Matrix or XMPP).</p>
<h3 id="are-bridges-secure">Are bridges secure?</h3>
<p>If the service lacks end-to-end-encryption (Slack, Teams, Google Chat,
non-secret chats on Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Google Messages etc) then
the bridge does not reduce security or privacy, beyond the fact that bridged
conversations by definition will be visible to the bridge and to the service
you are interoperating with.</p>
<p>If the service has E2EE (WhatsApp, iMessage, secret chats on Messenger) then
the bridge will necessarily have to decrypt (and reencrypt, where possible)
the data when passing it to the other service. This means the conversation is
no longer E2EE, and thus less secure (the bridge could be compromised and
inspect or reroute their messages) - and so gatekeepers must warn the user
that their conversation is leaving their platform and is no longer E2EE with
something like this:</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-warning.jpg" width="430"/>
</div>
<br/>
<h3 id="why-is-the-dma-good">Why is the DMA good?</h3>
<p>The upside is that the user has the freedom to use an infinite number of
services (bots, virtual assistants, CRMs, translation services, etc) as well
as speak to any other user in the world, regardless what platform they use.</p>
<p>It also puts much-needed pressure on the gatekeepers to innovate and
differentiate rather than rely on their network effects to attract new
users - creating a much more vibrant, open, competitive marketplace for
users.</p>
<p>See &quot;<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/29/how-do-you-implement-interoperability-in-a-dma-world#whats-driven-the-dma">What's driven the DMA?</a>&quot;
for more details.</p>
<h3 id="if-the-dma-requires-that-remote-users-have-the-same-security-as-local-users-how-can-bridges-work">If the DMA requires that remote users have the same security as local users, how can bridges work?</h3>
<p>The DMA requires that the <em>APIs</em> expose the same level of security as for
local users - ie E2EE must be exposed. If the users in a conversation choose
to use a bridge and thus reencrypt the messages, then it is their choice to
tradeoff encryption in favour of interoperability for a given conversation.</p>
<h3 id="does-this-undermine-the-gatekeepers-current-encryption">Does this undermine the gatekeepers’ current encryption?</h3>
<p>Absolutely not. Users talking to other users within the same E2EE-capable
gatekeeper will still be E2EE (assuming the gatekeeper doesn’t pull that rug
from under its users) - and in fact it gives the gatekeepers an excellent way
to advertise the selling point that E2EE is only guaranteed when you speak to
other users on the same platform.</p>
<h3 id="but-why-do-we-need-bridges-if-everyone-spoke-a-common-protocol-you-wouldn-t-ever-have-to-decrypt-messages-to-convert-them-between-protocols">But why do we need bridges? If everyone spoke a common protocol, you wouldn’t ever have to decrypt messages to convert them between protocols.</h3>
<p>Practically speaking, we don’t expect the gatekeepers to throw away their
existing stacks (or implement multihead messengers that also speak open
protocols). It’s true that if they natively spoke Matrix or XMPP then the
reencryption problem would go away, but it’s more realistic to focus on
opening the existing APIs than interpret the legislation as a mandate to
speak Matrix. Perhaps in future players will adopt Matrix of their own
volition.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-these-bridges-come-from">Where do these bridges come from?</h3>
<p>There is already a vibrant community of developers who build unofficial
bridges to the gatekeepers - eg Element, Beeper and hundreds of open source
developers in the Matrix and XMPP communities. Historically these bridges
have been hampered by having to use unofficial and private APIs, making them
a second class citizen - but with open documented APIs guaranteed by the DMA
we eagerly anticipate an explosion of high quality transparent bridges which
will be invisible to the end user.</p>
<h3 id="can-you-run-e2ee-bridges-clientside-to-make-them-safer">Can you run E2EE bridges clientside to make them safer?</h3>
<p>Maybe. For instance, current iMessage bridges work by running iMessage on a
local iPhone or Mac and then reencrypting the messages there for
interoperability. Given the messages are already exposed on the client
anyway, this means that E2EE is not broken - and avoids decrypting them on a
server. There is lots of development in this space currently, and with open
APIs guaranteed by DMA the pace should speed up significantly.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-you-tell-what-service-you-should-use-to-talk-to-a-given-remote-user">How can you tell what service you should use to talk to a given remote user?</h3>
<p>For 1:1 chats this is easy: you can simply ask the user which service they
want to use to talk to a given user, if that user is not already on that
service.</p>
<p>For group chats it is harder, and this is why the deadline for group chats is
years away. The problem is that you need a way to verify the identity of
arbitrary numbers of remote users on  different platforms - effectively
looking up their identity in a secure manner which stops services from
maliciously spoofing identities.</p>
<p>One possible way to solve this would be for users to explicitly link their
identity on one service with that on the gatekeeper’s service - eg “Alice on
AliceChat is talking in the same room as Bob on BobChat; Bob will be asked to
prove to AliceChat that he is the real Bob” - and so if AliceChat has already
validated Bob’s identity, then this can be used to spot him popping up on
other services. It also gives Bob a way to block themselves from ever being
unwittingly bridged to AliceChat.</p>
<p>There are many other approaches too - and the onus is on the industry to
figure out the best solution for decentralised identity in the next 3-4 years
in order to realise the most exciting benefits of the DMA.</p>

                <p>With last week’s revelation that the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220315IPR25504/deal-on-digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-competition-and-more-choice-for-users">EU Digital Markets Act</a>
will require tech gatekeepers (companies valued at over $75B or with over
$7.5B of turnover) to open their communication APIs for the purposes of
interoperability, there’s been a lot of speculation on what this could mean
in practice, To try to ground the conversation a bit, we’ve had a go at
outlining some concrete proposals for how it could work.</p>
<p>However, before we jump in, we should review how the DMA has come to pass.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-driven-the-dma">What’s driven the DMA?</h3>
<p>Today’s gatekeepers all began with a great product, which got more and more
popular until it grew to such a size that one of the biggest reasons to use
the service is not necessarily the product any more, but the benefits of
being able to talk to a large network of users. This rapidly becomes
anti-competitive, however: the user becomes locked into the network and can’t
switch even if they want to.  Even when people have a <strong>really</strong> good reason
to move provider (e.g. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/06/whatsapp_privacy_policy_demand/">WhatsApp’s terms of use changing</a> to
share user data with Facebook, <a href="https://blog.elcomsoft.com/2021/01/apple-scraps-end-to-end-encryption-of-icloud-backups/">Apple doing a 180 on end-to-end encrypting iCloud backups</a>,
or <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/telegram-encryption-end-to-end-features">Telegram not actually being end-to-end encrypted</a>),
in practice <a href="https://medium.com/@carlagriggio/the-great-messaging-app-migration-that-didnt-really-happen-56af637bc5d8">hardly anything changes</a> -
because the users are socially obligated to keep using the service in order
to talk to the rest of the users on it.</p>
<p>As a result, it’s literally harmful to the users. Even if a new service
launches with a shiny new feature, there is enormous inertia that must be
overcome for users to switch, thanks to the pull of their existing network -
and even if they do, they’ll just end up with their conversations haphazardly
fragmented over multiple apps. This isn’t accepted for email; it isn’t
accepted for the phone network; it isn’t accepted on the Internet itself -
and it shouldn’t be accepted for messaging apps either.</p>
<p>Similarly: the closed networks of today’s gatekeepers put a completely
arbitrary limit on how users can extend and enrich their own conversations.
On email, if you want to use a fancy new client like Superhuman - you can. If
you want to hook up a digital assistant or translation service to help you
wrangle your email - you can.  If you want to hook up your emails to a CRM to
help you run your business - you can.  But with today’s gatekeepers, you have
literally no control: you’re completely at the mercy of the service
provider - and for something like WhatsApp or iMessage the options are
limited at best.</p>
<p>Finally - all the users’ conversation metadata for that service (who talks to
who, and when) ends up centralised in the gatekeepers’ databases, which then
become an incredibly valuable and sensitive treasure trove, at risk of abuse.
And if the service provider identifies users by phone number, the user is
forced to disclose their phone number (a deeply sensitive personal
identifier) to participate, whether they want to or not.  Meanwhile the user
is massively incentivised not to move away: effectively they are held hostage
by the pull of the service’s network of users.</p>
<p>So, the DMA exists as a strategy to improve the situation for users and
service providers alike by building a healthier dynamic ecosystem for
communication apps; encouraging products to win by producing the best quality
product rather than the biggest network. To quote Cédric O (Secretary of
State for the Digital Sector of France), the strategy of the legislation came
from Washington advice to address the anticompetitive behaviour of the
gatekeepers “not by breaking them up… but by breaking them open.”  By
requiring the gatekeepers to open their APIs, the door has at last been
opened to give users the option to pick whatever service they prefer to use,
to choose who they trust with their data and control their conversations as
they wish - without losing the ability to talk to their wider audience.</p>
<p>However, something as groundbreaking as this is never going to be completely
straightforward.  Of course while some basic use cases (i.e. non-E2EE chat)
are easy to implement, they initially may not have a UX as smooth as a closed
network which has ingested all your address book; and other use cases(eg E2EE
support) may require some compromises at first.  It’s up to the industry to
figure out how to make the most of that challenge, and how to do it in a way
which minimises the impact on privacy - especially for end-to-end encrypted
services.</p>
<h3 id="what-problems-need-to-be-solved">What problems need to be solved?</h3>
<p>We’ve <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/25/interoperability-without-sacrificing-privacy-matrix-and-the-dma">already written about this</a>
from a Matrix perspective, but to recap - the main challenge is the trade-off
between interoperability and privacy for gatekeepers who provide end-to-end
encryption, which at a rough estimate means: WhatsApp, iMessage, secret chats
in Facebook Messenger, and Google Messages.  The problem is that even with
open APIs which correctly expose the end-to-end encrypted semantics (as DMA
requires), the point where you interoperate with a different system
inevitably means that you’ll have to re-encrypt the messages for that system,
unless they speak precisely the same protocol - and by definition you end up
trusting the different system to keep the messages safe.  Therefore this
increases the attack surface on the conversations, putting the end-to-end
encryption at risk.</p>
<p>Alex Stamos (ex-CISO at Facebook) said that “<a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1507366543360897028">WhatsApp rolling out mandatory
end-to-end encryption was the largest improvement in communications privacy
in human history</a>” – and we agree.
Guaranteed end-to-end encrypted conversations on WhatsApp is amazing, and
should be protected at all costs. If users are talking to other users on
WhatsApp (or any set of users communicating within the same E2EE messenger),
E2EE should and must be maintained - and there is nothing in the DMA which says otherwise.</p>
<p>But what if the user consciously wants to prioritise interoperability over
encryption?  What if the user wants to hook their WhatsApp messages into a
CRM, or run them through a machine translation service, or try to start a
migration to an alternative service because they don’t trust Meta?  Should
privacy really come so spectacularly at the expense of user freedom?</p>
<p>We also have the problem of figuring out how to reference users on other
platforms.  Say that I want to talk to a user with a given phone number, but
they’re not on my platform - how do I locate them?  What if my platform only
knows about phone numbers, but you’re trying to talk to a user on a platform
which uses a different format for identifiers?</p>
<p>Finally, we have the problem of mitigating abuse: opening up APIs makes it
easier for bad actors to try to spam or phish or otherwise abuse users within
the gatekeepers. There are going to have to be changes in anti-abuse
services/software, and some signals that the gatekeeper platforms currently
use are going to go away or be less useful, but that doesn't mean the whole
thing is intractable. It will require changes and innovative thinking, but
we’ve been making steady progress (e.g. the work done by <a href="https://element.io/blog/moderation-needs-a-radical-change/">Element’s trust and
safety team</a>). Meanwhile, the
gatekeepers already have massive anti-abuse systems in place to handle the
billions of users within their walled gardens, and unofficial APIs are
already widespread: adding official APIs does not change the landscape
significantly (assuming interoperability is implemented in such a way that
the existing anti-abuse mechanisms still apply).</p>
<p>In the past, gatekeepers dismissed the effort of interop as not being
worthwhile - after all, the default course of action is to build a walled
garden, and having built one, the temptation is to try to trap as many users
as possible.  It was also not always clear that there were services worth
interoperating with (thanks to the chilling effects of the gatekeepers
themselves, in terms of stifling innovation for communication startups).
Nowadays this situation has fundamentally changed however: there is a vibrant
ecosystem of open communication startups out there, and a huge appetite to
build a vibrant open ecosystem for interoperable communication, but like the
open web itself.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-requirements">What are the requirements?</h3>
<p>Before going further in considering solutions, we need to review the actual
requirements of the DMA.  Our best understanding at this point is that the
DMA will mandate that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gatekeepers will have to provide open and documented APIs to their services, on request, in order to facilitate interoperability (i.e. so that other services can communicate with their users).</li>
<li>These APIs must preserve the same level of end-to-end encryption (if any) to remote users as is available to local users.</li>
<li>This applies to 1:1 messaging and file transfer in the short term, and group messaging, file-transfer, 1:1 VoIP and group VoIP in the longer term.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-what-could-this-actually-look-like">So, what could this actually look like?</h3>
<p>The DMA legislation deliberately doesn’t focus on implementation, instead
letting the industry figure out how this could actually work in practice.
There are many different possible approaches, and so from our point of view
as Matrix we’ve tried to sketch out some options to make the discussion more
concrete. Please note these are preliminary thoughts, and are far from
perfect - but hopefully useful as a starting point for discussion.</p>
<h4 id="finding-bob">Finding Bob</h4>
<p>Imagine that you have a user Alice on an existing gatekeeper, which we’ll call
AliceChat, who runs an E2EE messaging service which identifies users using
phone numbers.  Say that they want to start a 1-to-1 conversation with Bob,
who doesn’t use AliceChat, but Alice knows he is a keen user of BobChat.
Today, you’d have no choice but to send them an SMS and nag them to join
AliceChat (sucks to be them if they don’t want to use that service, or if
they’re unable to for whatever reason - e.g. their platform isn’t supported,
or their government has blocked access, etc), or join BobChat yourself.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-bob-invite.jpg" width="430"/>
<img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-bob-invite-b.png" width="430"/>
</div>
<br/>
<p>However, imagine if instead the gatekeeper app had a user experience where the
app prompted you to talk to the user via a different platform instead.  It’d
be no different to your operating system prompting you to pick which app to
use to open a given file extension (rather than the OS vendor hardcoding it
to one of their own apps - another win for user rights <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Corp._v._Commission">led by the EU</a>!).</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-bob-invite2.jpg" width="430"/>
</div>
<br/>
<p>Now, the simplest approach in the short term would be for each gatekeeper to
pre-provision a set of options of possible alternative networks.  (The DMA
says that, on request, other service providers can ask to have access to the
gatekeeper’s APIs for the purposes of interoperability, so the gatekeeper
knows who the alternative networks may be).  “Bob is not on AliceChat - do
you want to try to reach him instead on BobChat, CharlieChat, DaveChat
(etc)”.</p>
<p>Much like users can configure their preferred applications for file extensions
in an operating system today, users would also be able to add their own
preferred service providers - simply specifying their domain name.</p>
<h4 id="connecting-to-bob">Connecting to Bob</h4>
<p>Now, AliceChat itself needs to figure out how to query the remote service
provider to see if Bob actually exists there.  Given the DMA requires that
gatekeepers provide open APIs with the same level of security to remote users
as their local ones using today’s private APIs - and very deliberately
doesn’t mandate specific protocols for interoperability - they will need to
locate a bridge which can connect to the other system.</p>
<p>In this thought experiment, the bridge used would be up to the destination
provider.  For instance, bobchat.com could announce that AliceChat users
should connect to it via alicechat-bridge.bobchat.com using the AliceChat
protocol(or matrix-bridge.bobchat.com via Matrix or xmpp-bridge.bobchat.com
via XMPP) by a simple HTTP API or even a .well-known URL.  Users might also
be able to override the bridge used to connect to them (e.g. to point instead
at a client-side bridge), and could sign the advertisement to prove that it
hadn’t been tampered with.</p>
<p>AliceChat would then connect to the discovered bridge using AliceChat’s
vendor-specific newly opened API, and would then effectively treat Bob as if
they were a real AliceChat user and client to all intents and purposes.  In
other words, Bob would effectively be a “ghost user” on AliceChat, and
subject to all their existing anti-abuse mechanisms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other side of the bridge converts through to whatever the
target system is - be that XMPP, Matrix, a different proprietary API, etc.
For Matrix, it’d be chatting away to a homeserver via the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/latest/application-service-api/">Application Service
API</a> (using
<a href="https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/end-to-bridge-encryption.html">End-to-Bridge Encryption</a> via
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/travis/msc/otk-dl-appservice/proposals/3202-encrypted-appservices.md">MSC3202</a>).
It’s also worth noting that the target might not even be a bridge - it could
be a system which already natively speaks AliceChat’s end-to-end encrypted
API, thus preserving end-to-end encryption without any need to re-encrypt.
It’s also worth noting that while historically bridges have had a bad
reputation as being a second class (often a second class afterthought),
Matrix has shown that by considering them as a first class citizen and really
focusing on mapping the highest common denominator between services rather
than lowest common denominator, it’s possible for them to work transparently
in practice.  <a href="https://beeper.com">Beeper</a> is a great example of Matrix
bridging being used for real in the wild (rather amusingly they just
<a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1507827177374445569">shipped emoji reactions for WhatsApp</a> on iOS via their
WhatsApp&lt;-&gt;Matrix bridge before WhatsApp themselves did…)</p>
<p>Architecturally, it could look like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-alice-bob.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Or, more likely (given a dedicated bridge between two proprietary services
would be a bit of a special case, and you’d have to solve the dilemma of who
hosts the bridge), both services could run a bridge to a common open standard
protocol like Matrix or XMPP instead (thus immediately enabling
interoperability with everyone else connected to that network):</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-alice-bob-bridged.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Please note that while these examples show server-side bridges, in practice it
would be infinitely preferable to use client-side bridges when connecting to
E2EE services - meaning that decrypted message data would only ever be
exposed on the client (which obviously has access to the decrypted data
already).  Client-side bridges are currently complicated by OS limits on
background tasks and push notification semantics (on mobile, at least), but
one could envisage a scenario where you install a little stub AliceChat
client on your phone which auths you with AliceChat and then sits in the
background receiving messages and bridging them through to Matrix or XMPP,
like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-alice-bob-clientside.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Another possible architecture could be for the E2EE gatekeeper to expose their
open APIs on the clients, rather than the server.  DMA allows this, to the
best of our knowledge - and would allow other apps on the device to access
the message data locally (with appropriate authorisation, of course) - effectively
doing a form of realtime
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Data_Liberation_Front">data liberation</a>
from the closed service to an open system, looking something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-alice-bob-clientside-apis.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Finally, it's worth noting that when peer-to-peer decentralised protocols
like <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix/">P2P Matrix</a>
enter production, clientside bridges could bridge directly into a local
communication server running on the handset - thus avoiding metadata being
exposed on Matrix or XMPP servers providing a common language between the
service providers.</p>
<h4 id="locating-users">Locating users</h4>
<p>Now, the above describes the simplest and most naive directory lookup system
imaginable - the problem of deciding which provider to use to connect to each
user is shouldered by the users.  This isn’t that unreasonable - after all,
users may have strong feelings about what providers to use to talk to a given
user.  Alice might be quite happy to talk to Bob via BobChat, but might be
very deliberately avoiding talking to him on DaveChat, for whatever ominous
reasons.</p>
<p>However, it’s likely in future we will also see other directory services
appear in order to map phone numbers (or other identities) to providers -
whether these piggyback on top of existing identity providers
(gatekeepers, DNS, telcos, SSO providers, governments) or are decentralised
through some other mechanism.  For instance, Bob could send AliceChat a
blinded proof that he authorises them to automatically route traffic to him
over at BobChat, with BobChat maintaining a matching proof that Bob is who he
claims to be (having gone through BobChat’s auth process) - and the proofs
could be linked using a temporary key such that Bob doesn’t even need to
maintain a long-term one. (Thanks to James Monaghan for suggesting this one!)</p>
<p>Another alternative to having the user decide where to find each other could
be to use a decentralised Keybase-style identity system to track verified
mappings of identities (phone numbers, email addresses etc) through to
service providers - perhaps something like <a href="https://idx.xyz/">IDX</a> might fit
the bill?  While this decentralised identity lookups have historically been a
hard problem, there is a <em>lot</em> of promising work happening in this space
currently and the future looks promising.</p>
<h4 id="talking-to-bob">Talking to Bob</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, Alice still needs to talk to Bob. As already discussed, unless
everyone speaks the same end-to-end encrypted protocol (be it Matrix,
WhatsApp or anything else), we inevitably have a trade-off here between
interoperability and privacy if Bob is not on the same system as Alice
(assuming AliceChat is end-to-end encrypted) - and we will need to clearly
warn Alice that the conversation is no longer end-to-end encrypted:</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-warning.jpg" width="430"/>
</div>
<br/>
<p>To be clear: right now, today, if Bob were on AliceChat, he could be
copy-pasting all your messages into (say) Google Translate in a frantic
effort to workaround the fact that his closed E2EE chat platform has no way
to do machine translation.  However, in a DMA world, Bob could legitimately
loop a translation bot into the conversation… and Alice would be warned that
the conversation was no longer secure (given the data is now being bridged
over to Google).</p>
<p>This is a clear improvement in user experience and transparency.  Likewise, if
I’m talking to a bridged user today on one of these platforms, I have no way
of telling that they have chosen to prioritise interop over E2EE - which is
frankly terrifying.  If I’m talking to someone on WhatsApp today I blindly
assume that they are E2EE as they are on the same platform - and if they’re
using an unofficial app or bridge, I have no way to tell.  Whereas in a DMA
world, you would expect the gatekeeper to transparently expose it.</p>
<p>If anything, this is good news for the gatekeeper in that it consciously
advertises a big selling point for them: that for full E2EE, users need to
talk to other users in the same walled garden (unless of course the platform
speaks the same protocol).  No more need for bus shelter adverts to remind
everywhere that WhatsApp is E2EE - instead they can remind the user every
time they talk to someone outside the walled garden!</p>
<p>Just to spell it out: the DMA does not require or encourage any reduction in
end-to-end encryption for WhatsApp or similar: full end-to-end encryption
will still be there for users in the same platform, including through to
users on custom clients (assuming the gatekeeper doesn’t flex and turn it off
for other reasons).</p>
<p>Obviously, this flow only considers the simple case of Alice inviting Bob. The
flow is of course symmetrical for Bob inviting Alice; AliceChat will need to
advertise bridges which can be used to connect to its users.  As Bob pops up
from BobChat, the bridge would use AliceChat’s newly open APIs to provision a
user for him, authing him as per any other user (thus ensuring that AliceChat
doesn’t need to have trusted BobChat to have authenticated the user).  The
bridge then sends/receives messages on Bob’s behalf within AliceChat.</p>
<h4 id="group-communication">Group communication</h4>
<p>This is all very well for 1:1 chats - which are the initial scope of the DMA.
However, over the coming years, we expect group chats to also be in scope.
The good news is that the same general architecture works for group chats
too.  We need a better source of identity though: AliceChat can’t possibly
independently authenticate all the new users which might be joining via group
conversations on other servers (especially if they join indirectly via
another server).  This means adopting one of the decentralised identity
lookup approaches outlined earlier to determine whether Charlie on
CharlieChat is the real Charlie or an imposter.</p>
<p>Another problem which emerges with group chats which span multiple service
providers is that of indirect routing, especially if the links between the
providers use different protocols.  What if AliceChat has a direct bridge to
BobChat (a bit like AIM and ICQ both spoke OSCAR), BobChat and CharlieChat
are connected by Matrix bridges, and AliceChat and CharlieChat are connected
via XMPP bridges?  We need a way for the bridges to decide who forwards
traffic for each network, and who bridges the users for which network.  If
they were all on Matrix or XMPP this would happen automatically, but with
mixed protocols we’d probably have to extend the lookup protocol to establish
a spanning tree for each conversation to prevent forwarding loops.</p>
<p>Here’s a deliberately twisty example to illustrate the above thought experiment:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-03-29-alice-bob-charlie.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>There is also a risk of bridge proliferation here - in the worst case, every
service would have to source bridges to directly connect to every other
service who came along, creating a nightmarish n-by-m problem.  But in
practice, we expect direct proprietary-to-proprietary bridges to be rare:
instead, we already have open standard communication protocols like Matrix
and XMPP which provide a common language between bridges - so in practice,
you could just end up in a world where each service has to find a
them-to-Matrix or them-to-XMPP bridge (which could be run by them, or
whatever trusted party they delegate to).</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>A mesh of bridges which connect together the open APIs of proprietary vendors
by converting them into open standards may seem unwieldy at first - but it’s
precisely the sort of ductwork which links both phone networks and the
Internet together in practice.  As long as the bridging provides for highest
common denominator fidelity at the best impedance ratio, then it’s
conceptually no different to converting circuit switched phone calls to VoIP,
or wired to wireless Ethernet, or any of the other bridges which we take
entirely for granted in our lives thanks to their transparency.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while this means a bit more user interface in the communication
apps in order to select networks and warn about trustedness, the benefits to
users are enormous as they put the user squarely back in control of their
conversations. And the UX will improve as the tech evolves.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, we should not be scared of interoperability, just because
we’ve grown used to a broken world where nothing can interconnect.  There are
tractable ways to solve it in a way that empowers and informs the user - and
the DMA has now given the industry the opportunity to demonstrate that it can
work.</p>

                <p>Yesterday the EU Parliament &amp; Council agreed on the contents of the Digital
Markets Act - new legislation from the EU intended to limit anticompetitive
behaviour from tech “gatekeepers”, i.e. big tech companies (those with market
share larger than €75B or with more than €7.5B a year of revenue).</p>
<p>This is absolutely landmark legislation, where the EU has decided not to break
the gatekeepers up in order to create a more competitive marketplace - but
instead to “break them open”.  This is unbelievably good news for the open
Internet, as it is obligating the gatekeepers to provide open APIs for their
communication services.  In other words: no longer will the tech giants be
able to arbitrarily lock their users inside their walled gardens - there will
be a legal requirement for them to expose APIs to other services.</p>
<p>While the formal outcomes of yesterday’s agreement haven’t been published yet
(beyond <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220315IPR25504/deal-on-digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-competition-and-more-choice-for-users">this press release</a>),
our understanding is that the DMA will mandate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gatekeepers will have to provide open and documented APIs to their
services, on request, in order to facilitate interoperability (i.e. so
that other services can communicate with their users).</li>
<li>These APIs must preserve the same level of end-to-end encryption (if any)
to remote users as is available to local users.</li>
<li>This applies to 1:1 messaging and file transfer in the short term, and
group messaging, file-transfer, 1:1 VoIP and group VoIP in the longer
term.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the best possible outcome imaginable for the open internet.  Never
again will a big tech company be able to hold their users hostage in a walled
garden, or arbitrarily close down or sabotage their APIs.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-s-the-catch">So, what’s the catch?</h3>
<p>Since the DMA announcement on Thursday, there’s been <a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1507145126006587411">quite a lot</a>
of <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecMuffett/status/1507366934412734491">yelling</a> from some very
experienced voices that mandating interoperability via open APIs is going to
irrevocably undermine end-to-end encrypted messengers like WhatsApp.  This
seems to mainly be born out of a concern that the DMA is somehow trying to
subvert end-to-end encryption, despite the fact that the DMA explicitly
mandates that the APIs must expose the same level of security, including
end-to-end encryption, that local users are using. (N.B. Signal doesn’t
qualify as a gatekeeper, so none of this is relevant to Signal).</p>
<p>So, for WhatsApp, it means that the API would expose both the message-passing
interface as well as the key management APIs required to interoperate with
WhatsApp using your own end-to-end-encrypted WhatsApp client - E2EE would be
preserved.</p>
<p>However, this does mean that if you were to actively interoperate between
providers (e.g. if Matrix turned up and asked WhatsApp, post DMA, to expose
an API we could use to write bridges against), then that bridge would need to
convert between WhatsApp’s E2EE’d payloads and Matrix’s E2EE’d payloads.
(Even though both WhatsApp and Matrix use the Double Ratchet, the actual
payloads within the encryption are completely different and would need to be
converted).  Therefore such a bridge has to re-encrypt the traffic - which
means that the plaintext is exposed on the bridge, putting it at risk and
breaking the end-to-end encryption guarantee.</p>
<p>There are solutions to this, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We could run the bridge somewhere relatively safe - e.g. the user’s client.
There’s a bunch of work going on already in Matrix to run clientside
bridges, so that your laptop or phone effectively maintains a connection
over to iMessage or WhatsApp or whatever as if it were logged in… but then
relays the messages into Matrix once re-encrypted.  By decentralising the
bridges and spreading them around the internet, you avoid them becoming a
single honeypot that bad actors might look to attack: instead it becomes
more a question of endpoint compromise (which is already a risk today).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gatekeeper could switch to a decentralised end-to-end encrypted protocol
like Matrix to preserve end-to-end encryption throughout.  This is
obviously significant work on the gatekeeper’s side, but we shouldn’t rule
it out.  For instance, making the transition for a non-encrypted service is
impressively little work, as <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix#how-do-you-make-an-existing-chat-system-talk-matrix">we proved with Gitter</a>.
(We’d ideally need to figure out decentralised/federated identity-lookup
first though, to avoid switching from one centralised identity database
to another).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Worst case, we could flag to the user that their conversation is insecure
(the chat equivalent of a scary TLS certificate warning).  Honestly, this
is something communication apps (including Matrix-based ones!) should be
doing anyway: as a user you should be able to tell what 3rd parties
(bots, integrations etc) have been added to a given conversation.  Adding
this sort of semantic actually opens up a much richer set of communication
interactions, by giving the user the flexibility over who to trust with
their data, even if it breaks the platonic ideal of pure E2E encryption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On balance, we think that the benefits of mandating open APIs outweigh the
risks that someone is going to run a vulnerable large-scale bridge and
undermine everyone’s E2EE.  It’s better to have the option to be able to get
at your data in the first place than be held hostage in a walled garden.</p>
<h3 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h3>
<p>One other complaint which has come up a bunch is around speed of innovation:
the idea that WhatsApp or similar would be seriously slowed down by having
to (effectively) maintain stable documented federation APIs, and figure out
how to do backwards compatibility for new features.  It’s true that this will
take a bit more effort (similar to how adding GDPR compliance takes some
effort), but the ends make it more than worth it.  Plus, if the rag-tag
Matrix ecosystem can do it, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to think that a
$600B company like Meta can figure it out too...</p>
<p>Another consideration is that it might make it too easy to build malicious 3rd
party clients - e.g. building your own &quot;special&quot; version of Signal which
connects to the official service, but deliberately or otherwise has security
flaws.  The fact is that we're already in this position though: there are
illicit alternative clients flying around all over the place, and the onus is
on the app stores to protect their users from installing malware.  This isn't
reason to throw the baby of interoperability out with the bathwater of
bootleg clients.</p>
<p>The final complaint is about moderation and abuse: while open APIs are good
news for consumer choice, they can also be used by spammers, phishers and
other miscreants to cause problems for the users within the gatekeeper.  Much
like a mediaeval citadel; opening up your walled garden means that both good
and bad people can turn up.  And much like real life, this is a solvable problem,
even if it’s unfortunate: the benefits of free trade massively outweigh the
downsides of having to police strangers more effectively.  Frankly,
moderation and anti-abuse approaches on the Internet today are infamously
broken, with centralised moderation by gatekeepers producing increasingly
erratic results.  By opening the walled gardens, we are forcing a much-needed
opportunity to review how to empower users and admins to filter unwanted
content on their own terms.  There’s a recent write-up of the proposed
approach for Matrix at
<a href="https://element.io/blog/moderation-needs-a-radical-change/">https://element.io/blog/moderation-needs-a-radical-change/</a>,
which outlines one strategy - but there are many others.  Honestly, having to improve
moderation tooling is a worthwhile price to pay for the benefits of open
APIs.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. Hopefully you’ll agree that the benefits here outweigh
the risks: without open APIs we wouldn't even have the <em>option</em> to talk about
interoperability.  We should be celebrating a new dawn for open access,
rather than fearing that the sky is falling and this is nefarious attempt to
undermine end-to-end encryption.</p>

                <p>Last year was the first time FOSDEM was hosted on Matrix, and it was generally a huge success - and so the FOSDEM team trusted us again this year and we’re happy to say that it seems to have gone really well! This year’s FOSDEM was massive once again, featuring 654 speakers, 731 events, and 103 tracks.</p>
<p>This year hosting the event went smoother than last year, the only significant issue was some of the Q&amp;A Jitsis not being broadcast to the devrooms on Saturday before 10:15 UTC, for which we offer our apologies to the speakers impacted. This turned out to be a problem with the Matrix&lt;-&gt;Jitsi access control sync system which hadn’t showed up during earlier testing, but we patched around it rapidly on the day.</p>
<p>The most notable difference between this year and the previous year has been the usage of a “attendees.fosdem.org” instance in addition to the original “fosdem.org” one, specifically for attendees. The graphs speak for themselves: Synapse could handle the load of the 23K users (13K joined users and 10K lurkers) spread across a total number of 941 rooms. The real eye-opener however is that of the 13K joined users, only 4K came came from the FOSDEM attendee server, and 1K from Libera Chat, meaning that ~70% of the Matrix participants were already on Matrix and came in from existing servers! 🤯 That means the vast majority of people attended over federation. Decentralisation at work, people! It works! We didn’t host the conference… you did!!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-07-02-fosdem_attendees_heatmap.png" alt="FOSDEM attendees heatmap" /></p>
<p>But not only did the backend handle the load smoothly: the general user experience felt tightly integrated. People were welcomed by a tailor-made home page in Element to help them navigate through all the tracks and stands:.</p>

<p>One of the great things is it doesn’t require heavy modifications to Element: anyone who installs their own instance of Element can use a simple html file to display relevant information to their audience.</p>
<p>New this year, we also generated a space hierarchy for the whole conference at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#fosdem2022:fosdem.org">#fosdem2022:fosdem.org</a> to help navigate the maze of rooms, making it even easier for users on their own servers to jump in:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-07-02-fosdem_space.png" alt="FOSDEM Space listing all the FOSDEM rooms" /></p>
<p>Another greatly appreciated feature was the famous “maximised widgets” I (Thib) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Matrixdotorg">keep telling you about in Matrix Live episodes</a>. Attendees and speakers could give the conference the central attention it deserved while simultaneously keeping an eye on what was happening in the chat. </p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-07-02-fosdem_stand.png" alt="FOSDEM stand with maximised widget view" /></p>
<p>From the speaker's perspective, we tried to streamline the user journey as much as possible: a bot invited them to a backstage room, in which they joined a Jitsi widget while their talk was being played in the track or devroom. They could see the most upvoted questions by the audience in a dedicated widget. A few minutes before their pre-recorded talk was over, a countdown (new this year!) could be displayed to tell them and the host they were about to go live. At the end of the countdown, the backstage Jitsi was broadcasted to the track so the speaker could answer the questions.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-07-02-fosdem_backstage.png" alt="Backstage room where the speaker and host could talk and see the questions" /></p>
<p>If you want to have an in-depth look at the backend’s architecture, it didn’t change much from last year. You can have a look at <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/15/how-we-hosted-fosdem-2021-on-matrix#how-was-it-built">last year’s blog post for the details on the setup</a>. Most of the heavy lifting was around <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/conference-bot">the conference bot</a> used to set rooms up, create the spaces, populate them with widgets, arrange layouts and trigger countdowns before going live…</p>
<p>Finally we are immensely proud that we had our first ever Matrix Devroom! Not only does it mean the staff of a large international open source conference thinks it’s worth having a track of our own, it also means our community has grown to the point where we could have <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/matrixorg_foundation_and_community/">8 hours of back to back Matrix content</a>! Here’s a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl5dnxRMP1hW7HxlJiHSox02MK9_KluLH">the YouTube playlists to which we are going to add the videos of FOSDEM</a> as they’re being published.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to the FOSDEM team for trusting us, massive shout-out to <a href="https://ems.element.io/">Element Matrix Services</a> and Element’s Ops and infrastructure team for their fantastic job in setting everything up and making sure everything was ready in time, a sincere thank you to all the fantastic speakers who shared awesome content, and finally to all the attendees. What a weekend!</p>

                <p>Today the European Parliament, the European Council and the European Commission will meet again for a discussion about the Digital Markets Act (DMA). This is the second of three of these meetings, appropriately called trilogues, where each party exposes their stance on a proposed law and the group tries to agree on the final version.</p>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">The DMA</a> is a groundbreaking step forward in shaking the hold a few gatekeepers have on users and the market, in particular because it looks to (among others):</p>
<ul>
<li>Require gatekeepers to allow other services to interoperate with their services</li>
<li>Prevent them to treat their own services and products more favourably (for example by ranking) </li>
<li>Require them to allow users to uninstall any pre-installed software or app</li>
</ul>
<p>The interoperability obligation is obviously the one on which we’ve kept a particularly close eye, as if it lands well it could take the success of Matrix to the next level completely overnight.</p>
<p>However, whilst in our mind interoperability automatically implies “open standard”, there are actually different ways of implementing it, depending on how far one wants to go. Typical debates here have been between whether to force gatekeepers to maintain open and well documented APIs, or whether to go full swing and mandate an open standard, and every shade in between.</p>
<p>We’ve been lucky to have had the opportunity to talk to policy advisors from different European member states, and it has been pretty fascinating to realise that it was always the same arguments which were being presented back at us, straight from the gatekeepers partyline.</p>
<p>We’ve ended up just listing them in a quick, high level, Myth Debunking exercise and thought it would be useful to actually publish them for everyone to access, so here they are!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MYTH #1 -</strong> &quot;It is impossible to have a standard that is open, decentralized and secure at the same time&quot;<br />
⇒ <strong>false</strong>: HTTPS did it, Matrix did it.</li>
<li><strong>MYTH #2 -</strong>&quot;It is difficult and expensive to make existing services compatible with a standard&quot;<br />
⇒ <strong>false</strong>: <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix#how-do-you-make-an-existing-chat-system-talk-matrix">Gitter was integrated into Matrix in less than a month</a>, with a single developer</li>
<li>**MYTH #3 - **&quot;Interoperability is incompatible with end-to-end encryption&quot;<br />
⇒ <strong>false</strong>: services just have to speak the same language, email has proved this with S/MIME and PGP - where different vendors can and do interoperate with E2EE. It’s even better when the protocol is E2EE by default.</li>
<li>**MYTH #4 - **&quot;It may work for messaging, but less so for social networks&quot;<br />
⇒ <strong>false</strong>: it's still about managing content and users. Even though social networks have more varied content, it is already well modelled for their own APIs, ready to be expressed in a common language. The key is in the fallback option on unsupported features, as well as the ability to have moderation tools (more on that later).</li>
<li>**MYTH #5 - **“Interoperability is not compatible with data privacy”<br />
⇒ <strong>false</strong>: Interoperability gives the ability to users to choose who is hosting their data and as such choose providers they trust. Besides, the DMA doesn’t live in a vacuum: it will exist alongside horizontal regulations like the GDPR and the Data Act, which give people sufficient control over their data to rectify their choices if they are not happy. Because the possibility of interoperability is there, it does not mean it will become mandatory for users to use it: they will still have their own threat models and will make decisions accordingly, just as they do today. But enshrining interoperability in law will at least ensure gatekeepers need to provide recourse for people to have further control over their data, which will be an improvement from the landscape today. </li>
<li>**MYTH #6 - **&quot;There is no user need&quot;<br />
⇒ <strong>false</strong>: most haven't had a taste of interoperable chat/social media (but they know email), others are demanding bridges between services: <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-10451559/One-four-people-struggle-friends-using-apps.html">25% users of 2 communication apps lose contact with friends because they are using too many apps</a>. And this figure doubles for people using more than 5 apps. There was no demand for cars when they were created: people only wanted faster horses.</li>
<li>**MYTH #7 - **&quot;There is no demand from European companies&quot;<br />
⇒ <strong>false</strong>: The fact it is so hard for European companies to remain competitive enough to stay alive means there are few of them to complain about what is killing them! However these companies are gathering to push for interoperability (like the <a href="https://competitivedigitalmarkets.eu/">Coalition for Competitive Digital Markets</a>). It will enable them to be more innovative in the product they develop by benefiting from an existing open network rather than being slowed down by having to build one from scratch. Companies will compete on the value they add rather than the size of their network. An open standard also gives an open field for innovation from a business model perspective. The Web is an excellent example of how much an open network fuels innovation and growth.</li>
<li>**MYTH #8 - **&quot;It is better to require providers to have open and stable APIs than define a single open standard&quot;<br />
⇒ <strong>false</strong>: this is the best way to leave gatekeepers at the center of the ecosystem as it means that each player has to multiply its effort to interface with every single other player, but every player will only have the resources to interface with a few of its counterparts and will logically default to the bigger ones, effectively not solving the problem. In addition, if providers are not aligned on which encryption to use it will just break end-to-end encryption and create risk for the user in every bridge. In practice the DMA is about forcing the gatekeepers to interoperate only, but we strongly believe that <em>everyone</em> should be interoperating if we are about improving the user’s experience and control, and giving more space to companies to innovate. Limiting it to the gatekeepers is a first step, but only a defensive one.</li>
<li>**MYTH #9 - **“An open standard limits innovation if it defines a lowest common denominator”<br />
⇒ <strong>false</strong>: the lowest common denominator should match what users consider as table stakes in a messaging or social media app. Providers can innovate on top by providing different features which go beyond table stakes, for example by targeting niche use cases, like messaging services focused on elderly and disabled users, or focused on healthcare, warehouse workers, or integrated in a CRM for call centers, or creatives…  Providers also can implement a profile of the standard which is a subset of its full scope, ensuring the standard remains a highest common denominator..</li>
<li>**MYTH #10 - **“It will be impossible to moderate social networks built on an open standard”<br />
⇒ <strong>false</strong>: decentralised networks actually have driven the adoption of much more sophisticated moderation techniques than the coarse approaches of centralised silos. Appropriate moderation means have to be part of the open standard definition, and some are already used in Matrix. It would also empower victims who today have no choice but get in touch with providers one by one. Each provider will also have control over their own users, and users can select providers whose T&amp;Cs are aligned with their ethics. The world is not black and white, unlike what Silicon Valley tries to make us believe.</li>
<li>**MYTH #11 - **“It will take years before being able to define an open standard”<br />
⇒ <strong>you don’t have to</strong>: You could leverage existing technologies which are being used by the industry. Matrix, XMPP and ActivityPub exist today. For instance, Matrix has been managed by its own standard body (The Matrix Foundation) and could be ratified by a more established one like IETF, ETSI or W3C if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously the devil will be in the details of the way the final text is formulated, as well as the limits, obligations and controls put in place, but overall it should be an improvement for all European users and companies and we’re looking forward to seeing how today’s trilogue goes!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>If you’re reading this - congratulations; you made it through another year :)  Every winter we sit down and review Matrix’s progress over the last twelve months, and look forward to the next - for it’s all too easy to get lost in the day-to-day development and fail to realise how much the overall project is evolving, especially when it’s one as large and ambitious as Matrix!</p>
<p>Looking back at 2021, it’s unbelievable how much stuff has been going on in the core team (as you can tell by the length of this post - sorry!).  There’s been a really interesting mix of activity too - between massive improvements to the core functionality and baseline features that Matrix provides, and also major breakthroughs on next generation work.  But first, let’s check out what’s been happening in the wider ecosystem…</p>
<h2 id="the-matrix-ecosystem">The Matrix Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Over 2021 the Matrix ecosystem has expanded unrecognisably.  This time last year we were aware of 2 governments who were seriously adopting Matrix at scale (France and Germany), with the UK and US starting to roll out initial deployments.  12 months later, and we are now aware of <strong>12</strong> governments who are adopting Matrix in various capacities - and we hope to be able to talk about at least some of them in public in 2022!  The UK and US have both progressed significantly too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one of the most exciting new public sector stories this year has been <a href="https://www.gematik.de/anwendungen/ti-messenger">gematik</a>: Germany’s national healthcare agency, who <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/21/germanys-national-healthcare-system-adopts-matrix">announced Matrix</a> as the basis for interoperable secure messaging throughout the whole healthcare sector.  This is a genuine step change for Matrix: rather than a government putting out tenders for “a secure messaging solution”, instead we are seeing tenders for Matrix solution providers.  The Matrix industry is real; it exists today, and we’re seeing more and more new providers such as <a href="https://famedly.com/">Famedly</a> (building on the <a href="https://gitlab.com/famedly/company/frontend">Flutter/Dart stack</a> which powers <a href="https://fluffychat.im">FluffyChat</a>) and <a href="https://folivo.net/portfolio/timmy-messenger/">Folivonet</a> (building on the <a href="https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity">Trixnity</a> Kotlin Multiplatform stack) stepping up to get involved - as well as many more big incumbents.  We created Matrix in order to bootstrap a new decentralised communication industry, and frankly it’s amazing to see it actually taking shape.</p>
<p>Another big step change has been the number of existing chat providers looking to become part of the wider Matrix network. Back in September our friends at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBtBiUXLqAk&amp;t=1691s">Rocket.Chat announced that they’re working on Matrix support</a> for federation, perhaps inspired by our case study in making <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix">Gitter speak Matrix</a> - and meanwhile Matrix comes up a lot in the context of Twitter’s Bluesky initiative, and a few big players we can’t yet mention have also been in touch wanting to natively talk Matrix too.</p>
<p>We’ve also seen a huge shift in big enterprises adopting Matrix for self-sovereign secure communication (although we can’t drop any names yet 😔). This may have been spurred on by such misadventures as Electronic Arts being compromised via a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvkqb/how-ea-games-was-hacked-slack">leaked Slack access token</a>, but it feels like many of the biggest organisations now realise that unquestioningly handing their data to Slack or Teams is a bad idea, when they could have an end-to-end encrypted deployment of their own instead.</p>
<p>There has also been a turning point in legislation in favour of Matrix - with the EU Digital Markets Act <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1471191916838633481">pushing hard for interoperability</a> for ‘big tech’ communication services in the EU (see <a href="https://interoperability.news/2021/12/eu-parliament-upgrades-dma-to-open-gatekeepers-gates/">Amandine’s take</a> here), and meanwhile Eric Migicovsky, CEO at <a href="https://www.beeper.com/">Beeper</a> has been busy <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4992173/user-clip-eric-migicovsky-testimony">testifying to US Congress</a> on the merits of interoperability too. It’s not inconceivable that we will soon live in a world where governments mandate that the walled gardens will finally have to open up, and we may see a whole new level of interest in communication providers wanting to join Matrix!</p>
<p>Communities themselves have also been embracing Matrix more and more over the last year: we were incredibly proud to host <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/15/how-we-hosted-fosdem-2021-on-matrix">FOSDEM 2021</a>, the world’s biggest open source conference via Matrix (all 35K attendees!) - and we’re gearing up to do it again in February for <a href="https://twitter.com/fosdem/status/1451475324684980241">FOSDEM 2022</a> (this time with our <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/02/call-for-participation-for-the-fosdem-2022-matrix-dev-room">very first FOSDEM Matrix dev room</a>!). We were also really glad that <a href="https://libera.chat/">Libera.chat</a> let us point a dedicated homeserver and IRC bridge at their new IRC network (meaning you can join anywhere on Libera from Matrix as #channel:libera.chat, and talk to anyone as @nick:libera.chat). High profile open source projects have been adopting Matrix all over the place - <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DebianSocial/Matrix">Debian</a>, <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/multiple-matrix-sessions-with-element-on-fedora-linux/">Fedora</a>, <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Matrix">NixOS</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Matrix">Arch</a>, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/entering-the-matrix/">Tor</a>, <a href="https://ansible.github.io/community/posts/matrix_and_ansible.html">Ansible</a>, <a href="https://whatwg.org/chat">WHATWG</a> and many others (check out <a href="https://www.ubuntubuzz.com/2021/10/matrix-chat-adoption-by-community-in.html">this list</a>!) now have their own Matrix servers and spaces.  (You know things are busy when we haven’t had time to do a big blog post to announce folk as important as these joining the network!)</p>
<p>Finally, there has been an explosion of new projects and milestones in the wider community - <a href="https://conduit.rs">Conduit</a> entered <a href="https://conduit.rs/release-0-2-0/">beta</a> as a super exciting lightweight Rust homeserver implementation; <a href="https://fluffychat.im">FluffyChat</a> hit 1.0 with an impressively polished Flutter-based experience; <a href="https://beeper.com">Beeper</a> pre-launched to huge amounts of mainstream excitement; <a href="https://cinny.in/">Cinny</a> exploded out of the blue as an incredibly elegant next-generation web client; <a href="https://keanu.im/">Keanu</a> materialised from <a href="https://guardianproject.info/">The Guardian Project</a> as their glossy Matrix client suite; <a href="https://commune.chat/">Commune</a> appeared as a hybrid messageboard/chatroom interface; <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/">Nheko</a> has matured significantly with huge E2EE improvements and feature and VoIP polish; <a href="https://apps.kde.org/en-gb/neochat/">NeoChat</a> and <a href="https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient">libQuotient</a> development is progressing solidly; <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal">Fractal</a> is busy with the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/tree/fractal-next">fractal-next</a> rewrite to move everything over to matrix-rust-sdk and GTK 4;  <a href="https://syphon.org/">Syphon</a> continues to forge ahead as a privacy-focused Flutter-based client, and non-chat clients like <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard">The Board</a>, <a href="https://github.com/opentower/populus-viewer">Populus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/DanilaFe/matrix-highlight">Matrix Highlight</a> have started to appear in earnest too!  We also had a super successful <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021">Google Summer of Code</a> this year, with a record number of 7 students participating in both core team and community projects.</p>
<p>Please note this is just a random sample of all the community news over the last year - to get more colour on what’s been going on, we highly recommend flipping through the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix">This Week In Matrix archives</a>!</p>
<h2 id="the-matrix-spec">The Matrix Spec</h2>
<p>The Matrix spec is the single source of truth of what Matrix actually is, and this year it got some major improvements thanks to a beautiful new website at <a href="https://spec.matrix.org">https://spec.matrix.org</a> thanks to Will Bamberg, formerly of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN</a> (and who’s now back fighting the good fight with the MDN team at <a href="https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs/updates/will-bamberg-joins-open-web-docs-staff">OWD</a>).</p>
<p>Aside from the new spec site, we also released our first official point release in a while - <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release">Matrix 1.1</a>, and we’re going to aim to keep regular releases happening once a quarter from here on in.  It’s also worth noting that it’s very much a feature and not a bug that spec releases lag behind the various <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">spec proposals</a> which fly around as the core team and community experiment with new features like spaces, threads, etc.  We very deliberately only merge change proposals to the spec which have been proven to work in real life implementations, and which have fully passed the spec review process (along with any dependencies they might have!).</p>
<p>Talking of which, in 2021 we saw a record <strong>109</strong> Matrix Spec Change proposals (MSCs) created. Even better, we closed <strong>62</strong> MSCs - so while the backlog is still growing, we’re still making very concrete progress.  Of the 109 new MSCs: 34 were from the wider Matrix community, 34 were from ex-community contributors who are now part of the core team, 13 were from the founding Matrix team, and 28 were from folks hired to work on Matrix by Element on behalf of the Matrix.org Foundation.  This feels like a pretty healthy blend of contributions, and while it’s true that spec work could always progress faster, things do seem to be heading in the right direction.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-12-22-spec.png" alt="The latest MSC stats" /></p>
<p>In the new year, the Spec Core Team (responsible for reviewing MSCs and voting on what gets merged to the spec) is going to make a concerted effort to carve out more dedicated time for spec work - thankfully one of the side-effects of Matrix growing is that there are now a lot more people around with whom we can share other work, hopefully meaning that we can put significantly more hours into keeping the spec growing healthily.</p>
<h2 id="synapse">Synapse</h2>
<p>Synapse is the primary homeserver implementation published by the Matrix core team, and its maturity is unrecognisable from where we were a year ago.  One of the big breakthroughs has been stabilising memory usage through caching improvements - the Matrix.org synapse now reliably only uses 2-3GB of RAM on its main process, despite its activity having more than doubled over the last year (up from 513K monthly active users to 1.11M!).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-12-22-perf.jpg" alt="Synapse memory performance fixes" /></p>
<p>Further signs of maturity include Synapse’s radically improved new <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/">documentation</a> and the new <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html">module API</a>, the fact that mypy type-safety coverage has improved from ~75% to over 89.7% (across 151,903 lines of code!), and the fact that Open Tracing support has matured to the point that visualising complex cross-worker behaviour is nowadays a genuine pleasure.  Frankly, Synapse should be feeling robust and stable these days - if you see folks claiming otherwise, please check they’re not basing that on outdated info (or failing that, get them to file bug reports that we can jump on!).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the feature side, we’ve landed a huge spate of long-awaited core functionality.  Probably the best way to track it is by the Matrix Spec Change proposals (MSCs) which have been implemented (although I dare you to also go and check out Synapse’s <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/CHANGES.md">changelog</a>, all 675KB of it, which is frankly a thing of beauty and will take you down a rabbithole all the way back to v0.0.0 in Aug 2014 if you so desire ;P). Major MSCs which we’ve landed include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spaces! It’s hard to overstate how positive this has been for Matrix’s usability: at last, we can group our rooms together however we please, both for our own edification and to share with others - and we can view space hierarchies over federation, complete with pagination (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2946">MSC2946</a>) as well as specify who can join a room based on whether they’re a member of a given space/room (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083">MSC3083</a>).</li>
<li>Threads! Yes, that’s right - coming any day now to a Matrix client close to you, we have ‘classic’ threaded messaging landing, providing sidebars of conversation through the new m.thread relation type (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>), building on Matrix’s existing aggregation API as used for edits and reactions.  We’ve chosen to prioritise single-level-deep-threads rather than arbitrarily-deep-trees (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2836">MSC2836</a>) as it maps more easily to a chat UX, although the two approaches are not mutually exclusive.</li>
<li>Aggregations! Everyone’s favourite bête noire in Matrix tends to be that aggregations for edits &amp; reactions predate today’s Matrix Spec Change process and went mainstream without using a vendor prefix before their spec had been stabilised.  Better late than never, we’ve taken advantage of Threads to go back and fix what once went wrong - and now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674">MSC2674</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675">MSC2675</a> and friends are hopefully on a much better track to provide a basis for how aggregations work - both in the spec and in the reference implementation in Synapse.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-12-22-aggs.png" alt="Anatomy of a bête noire" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Social Login via multiple SSO providers (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2858">MSC2858</a>) - almost 50% of new registrations on the Matrix.org homeserver now use social login!  Interestingly the split of SSO usage is roughly 70% Google, 12% GitHub, 11% Apple, 6% Facebook and 1% GitLab. Make of that what you will!</li>
<li>Knocking (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403">MSC2403</a>)! Huge thanks to Sorunome and Anoa, we now support the ability to knock to ask to join a room if not yet invited. If this sounds unfamiliar, it may be because it hasn’t landed in Element yet, but expect it to land next year.</li>
<li>Refresh tokens (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918">MSC2918</a>)! At last, we have a standard way for clients to refresh their access tokens, so that if your access token leaks it will not give access to your account indefinitely.  (This also has yet to land in Element, but has been proved on a branch on Hydrogen).</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, last but not least, Eric from Gitter has been fearlessly hacking his way through some of Matrix’s gnarliest problems in his quest to bring Matrix+Element up to full feature parity with Gitter. In practice, this means adding the ability to incrementally import old history into existing Matrix rooms (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a>), so we can expose the vast amounts of knowledge in Gitter’s archives directly into Matrix - and in future provide bridging in general of existing archives (Slack, Discord, mailing lists, newsgroups, forums, etc.) into Matrix.</p>
<p>This is a <em>tough</em> problem, as Matrix rooms are fundamentally immutable - events sent into a room cannot be changed.  However, we can bend time a bit and add old chapters of history to the room as if we’d just discovered them down the back of the sofa - and this is what <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a> does.  The (rewritten!) <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/%5BMSC2716%5D(https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716)/proposals/2716-batch-send-historical-messages.md">spec proposal</a> is a thing of beauty and well worth a look, and you can see an early preview in action back on <a href="https://youtu.be/gSrqj2IzJew?t=529">Matrix Live in June</a>. Over the last few months it’s been merging and maturing in Synapse and we should see it in the wild in the near future!  And for bonus points Eric’s also just added in Jump-to-date support (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030">MSC3030</a>), letting clients jump around room history by timestamp - another Gitter feature that we sorely need, and will also help us publish excellent Gitter-style online chat archives in future.  You can see it in action in last week’s <a href="https://youtu.be/Hsyqa5ozWIo?t=581">Matrix Live</a>!</p>
<h2 id="element">Element</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, on the client side, Element continues to act as a flagship client to drive the development of the official client SDKs we ship as the Matrix.org Foundation - and our focus more than ever before has been to ensure that Matrix can be used to create mainstream-usable polished glossy apps.  After all, Matrix will only succeed if clients emerge which can punch their weight against the enormous incumbents - be they Slack, Teams, WhatsApp or Discord.</p>
<p>This year, improving UX quality has been front and center - and hopefully the shift has been obvious in the app (and huge thanks to everyone who tweeted/tooted/enthused about improvements when they saw them!).  Part of this has been ensuring that all new features are built in a design- and product-led fashion by folks who are explicitly focused on product engineering - with product design involved from the outset and with coordination and focus provided by product management folks. This is far from the typical way that FOSS operates, but if we’re to succeed against the incumbents we have to beat them at their own game (just as, for instance, Mozilla wields conventional product management in their browser wars).</p>
<p>More recently, there’s also been a major shift towards structured <a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1470798993122807809">user testing</a> in order to evaluate new features and analyse how users trip over the app in general, including radically improved analytics (for those who opt in!) to help visualise which bits of the app aren’t working.  In the new year, the expectation is to double down on user testing: quite simply, if you can hand Element to a casual mainstream user and they can get the core jobs done (sign up, chat to someone, call someone, etc.) without tripping over, then mission successful :)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://element.io/blog/">Element blog</a> covers the work this year from the Element side, but from the Matrix side, the key changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>finalising <a href="https://element.io/blog/spaces-blast-out-of-beta/">Spaces</a> as a way to group together rooms - providing the equivalent of Discord servers or Slack workspaces, or alternatively letting you gather your own rooms together into a private space.</li>
<li>building out Threads (available in labs; launching soon!)</li>
<li>Social Login!</li>
<li>radically improving Element’s Information Architecture (i.e. the layout of the UI, so that the panels and buttons are correctly semantically grouped together in a visual hierarchy)</li>
<li>adding <a href="https://element.io/blog/introducing-voice-messages-and-so-much-more/">Voice Messages</a> as a really beautiful polished feature powered by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3245">MSC3245</a></li>
<li>adding Location Share (available in labs; launching soon!) powered by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3488">MSC3488</a> (and in future <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3489">MSC3489</a> for live-location sharing - in dev on iOS right now!)</li>
<li>adding <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-1-9-1-export-is-finally-here/">Chat Export</a>, thanks to the amazing GSOC work by Jaiwanth </li>
<li>adding Polls via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3381">MSC3381</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-12-22-spaces.gif" alt="Spaces in all their glory" /></p>
<p>From a spec perspective, it’s been particularly exciting to be finally using Extensible Events (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767">MSC1767</a>) for many of these new features: voice messages, location sharing and polls are all experimenting with this new idiom for expressing richer structured data over Matrix while presenting a consistent and useful ‘fallback’ representation for clients which don’t know how to natively render the richer data.</p>
<p>We’ve also done a huge amount of work this year in improving 1:1 VoIP - both via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2746">MSC2746</a> and within the JS, iOS &amp; Android Matrix SDKs. If you haven’t tried doing a 1:1 call via Matrix recently we’d highly recommend giving it a go - probably the main remaining bug at this point is that we need to find a better default ringtone for Element(!). Huge thanks go to Šimon Brandner both for his community contributions to VoIP and across all of Element Web - including proper screensharing for 1:1 (and group!) VoIP calls. This has also laid excellent groundwork for native Group VoIP/Video over Matrix - more on that later.</p>
<p>On Element Mobile, work on all the above features has been balanced by fighting against the various platform’s quirks, and lots of under-the-hood work improving performance. iOS has gone through a long journey to get back to stability after iOS’s push notification API changes, while also improving incremental sync performance by rearchitecting the local cache in the client.  Android meanwhile has been working away improving the app; reworking Notifications, migrating to Kotlin coroutines and Hilt, and closing over 690 GH issues.  Android has also had its fair <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-on-google-play-store/">share of dramas</a>, including some recent long Play Store review times, but we’ve come through the other side intact.</p>
<p>However, we’ve been thinking more and more about the nightmarish pain point that is the amount of time we spend implementing the same features across the three different platforms. This becomes particularly apparent for security-sensitive features such as end-to-end encryption, or major API changes such as aggregations, spaces or sync v3 (more on that later). Or simply rapidly sharing improvements to implementation best practices between platforms.</p>
<p>Historically we consciously built platform-native Matrix SDKs in order to provide entirely idiomatic SDKs for other Matrix developers to use - and also to better dogfood the protocol and ensure that the heterogenous implementations could interoperate successfully. However, in practice, relatively few third party projects other than Element build on top of matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk2 - and meanwhile there are more than enough other Matrix clients out there nowadays to dogfood interoperability against (including alternative experimental clients from the core team such as Hydrogen).</p>
<p>So, we’ve been thinking increasingly seriously about how to solve this…</p>
<h2 id="a-new-hope-matrix-rust-sdk">A new hope: matrix-rust-sdk</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk">matrix-rust-sdk</a> is an attempt to build a new reference client SDK for Matrix which can be used by as many platforms as possible - hopefully forever stopping us from reimplementing the wheel more than we need to. Work began towards the end of 2019, building on top of <a href="https://www.ruma.io/">Ruma</a>’s excellent Matrix rust crates, and poljar has been working away solidly at it ever since.  We teased matrix-rust-sdk in last year’s update, but as of this year it is properly coming of age and we’ve started using it in earnest - beginning by swapping out Element Android’s encryption implementation for matrix-rust-sdk-crypto (the E2EE cryptography crate provided by the SDK).</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Rust, the main benefits we get here are a heavy emphasis on safety and security without compromising performance; while providing a single codebase which can be used equally from iOS, native Desktop apps such as Fractal, Android (with native bindings) and even Web (via WASM, in future).  While technically this results in a “non-native” SDK relative to matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk - in practice, it’s become so common to depend on native-code shared libraries (outside the web, at least) that it’s not really a problem.</p>
<p>Initial results look wildly promising here: “Element R” (formerly known as Corroded Element - the codename for the Rust-enhanced version of Element Android) builds are now out there, and out-perform the kotlin E2EE implementation by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/170">roughly 10x</a>, thanks to using native code and Rust’s improved parallelisation.</p>
<p>Our next step is to start using it on iOS, and we’ll be experimenting with a next-generation of Element iOS shortly in the new year with the SDK provided exclusively by matrix-rust-sdk.  Element will also be funding more people to work fulltime on matrix-rust-sdk itself, and to see what the developer experience is like when you use it seriously on the Web - watch this space!</p>
<h2 id="bridges-bots-widgets-and-integration-managers">Bridges, Bots, Widgets and Integration Managers</h2>
<p>Elsewhere in Matrix, the Bridge Crew has busy polishing bridges like crazy - working away on encrypted application services (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3202">MSC3202</a>), massively improving the IRC bridge (particularly in the fallout of the great Freenode-&gt;Libera migration), stabilising and extending <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-bifrost">matrix-bifrost</a> (our XMPP-and-more bridge), getting libpurple bridging working properly in bifrost, getting <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack">matrix-appservice-slack</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord">matrix-appservice-discord</a> stable enough to be hosted by <a href="https://element.io/blog/slack-bridging/">EMS</a>, experimenting with <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk">matrix-bot-sdk</a> as an alternative bridging API, and even looking at adding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/tree/main/crates/matrix-sdk-crypto">matrix-rust-sdk-crypto</a> into matrix-bot-sdk as an elegant way to power robust encrypted bridges (thus replacing Panatalaimon for that use case).</p>
<p>There’s also a new kid in town: <a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot">matrix-hookshot</a> (formerly known as matrix-github) is a new all-singing-all-dancing general purpose integration built on matrix-bot-sdk, coming soon to an integration manager near you, which can bridge through to GitHub, GitLab, JIRA and freeform webhooks! Check it out a few weeks ago on <a href="https://youtu.be/55P-NdDa-UI?t=1018">Matrix Live</a>. matrix-hookshot is primarily Node, but is also getting in on the Rust action with some functions being implemented in native code.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, change is afoot for integration managers, which have been screaming out for an overhaul for years. There was a cheeky hint in last week’s <a href="https://youtu.be/Hsyqa5ozWIo?t=724">Matrix Live</a> where <a href="https://dimension.t2bot.io/">Dimension</a> did an unexpected cameo looking particularly swish…  All shall be revealed next year!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-12-22-dimension.png" alt="A whole new Dimension" /></p>
<h2 id="dendrite-low-bandwidth-matrix-and-peer-to-peer-matrix">Dendrite, Low bandwidth Matrix and Peer-to-Peer Matrix</h2>
<p>Dendrite is our next-generation homeserver implementation written in Go, and having shipped the first beta in Oct 2020, we’ve cut another 11 releases over the course of this year - adding in features such as E2EE key backups, cross-signing, support for room versions 7, 8 and 9 (knocking and restricted join rules), massive state resolution performance improvements, an entirely new state storage implementation that uses ~15x less disk space, sync filtering, experimental support for peeking-over-federation (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2444">MSC2444</a>) - not to mention huge numbers of bug fixes. Even more excitingly, we’re in the process of ditching Kafka in favour of native-Go message queuing in the form of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/compare/nats">NATS</a>!</p>
<p>However, it’s been a bit of a weird year as the team has been repeatedly pulled onto other projects due to competing priorities - and there’s still a bunch of stuff left which is keeping us in beta.  Some of this is plain old missing features (search, push rules/notifications, room upgrades, presence etc) - but we’ve also run up against some problems over the last few months while implementing new room versions and similar thanks to the sheer number of different microservices which Dendrite is made out of. In retrospect, it feels like Dendrite has ended up too granular, and when hacking on it you get slowed down badly by all the boilerplate required to glue the various services together.  Therefore, we’ve just started to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/2055">merge some of the services together</a> - still preserving horizontal scaling of course, but refactoring the architecture a bit while we’re still in beta to help speed up development again. So far things are looking promising!  We’re also really looking forwards to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pulls?q=+is%3Apr+author%3As7evinK">s7evinK</a> joining the team to work on Dendrite fulltime in the coming weeks :)</p>
<p>Talking of competing priorities, there have been three other big missions going on at the same time as Dendrite dev: firstly - formalising Low Bandwidth Matrix. LB Matrix is super important for maximising battery life on mobile, as well as (obviously) supporting worse network conditions - and it’s effectively a prerequisite for P2P Matrix.  We did a bunch of experiments around it back in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/03/12/breaking-the-100-bps-barrier-with-matrix-meshsim-coap-proxy">2019</a>, but earlier in the year we needed it <a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1418632867626770433">for real</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3079">MSC3079</a> was the result. The low bandwidth dialect which we’ve proposed in the MSC is designed for use on the real Internet using standard IETF protocols (CoAP + DTLS + CBOR) and so isn’t quite as exotic as the 2019 version, but still gives a ~10-20x bandwidth improvement over normal HTTP+JSON based Matrix.  It hasn’t made it to Element yet, but if you’re interested go <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/10/low-bandwidth-matrix-an-implementation-guide">check out the blog post</a>!</p>
<p>Secondly, we’ve been sidetracked by the entirety of P2P Matrix.  This is our long-term mission to let Matrix run peer-to-peer without the need for any servers (or indeed Internet connectivity, thanks to Bluetooth Low Energy) by embedding servers such as Dendrite into clients such as Element and so let each Matrix Client have its own personal local homeserver.  We’ve made massive progress over the course of the year on P2P - the biggest breakthroughs being <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/06/introducing-the-pinecone-overlay-network">Pinecone</a> as an entirely new P2P overlay network, with the novel SNEK (sequentially networked edwards key) routing topology.  (The animation below shows a P2P network arranging itself into a SNEK!)</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-12-22-pinecone.gif" alt="SNEK" /></p>
<p>You can read all about it in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/06/introducing-the-pinecone-overlay-network">the blog post</a>, but suffice it to say that Pinecone outperformed all the other P2P overlay networks in <a href="https://github.com/mwarning/meshnet-lab">meshnet-lab</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/mwarning/meshnet-lab/tree/master/tests/mobility2">Mobility2</a> test:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-12-22-pinecone-perf.png" alt="Pinecone perf benchmarks" /></p>
<p>You can play with P2P Matrix today on iOS and Android (head over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#p2p:matrix.org">#p2p:matrix.org</a> for builds), but there is some major work still to be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to bridge to today’s Matrix network. Right now, having a weird experimental test network for P2P means that in practice nobody actually uses it other than for demos - whereas if you could actually talk to everything else in Matrix, it’d be way more compelling and interesting to use and dogfood.  We’re currently thinking about how best to do this!</li>
<li>We need to standardise the actual transport to be used over Pinecone.  Currently it uses HTTPS over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Transport_Protocol">μTP</a> (purely because empirically it handled packet loss and congestion well, and LB Matrix wasn’t ready at the time).  We’re currently experimenting with switching to LB Matrix using our own CoAP implementation called PineCoAP (potentially using pCoCoA congestion control, given CoAP doesn’t provide any congestion control out of the box), but this is early days.</li>
<li>We still need to finalise store-and-forward: if your destination is offline, do you buffer your transactions in the network somehow, or do you use another Matrix node to buffer them?</li>
<li>Relatedly, we need to tweak federation so that if events get lost, federation for a room can recover more gracefully than it does today - for instance, by bundling redundant auth events on transactions, or by providing more recovery mechanisms.</li>
<li>We still need to spec and implement multihomed accounts, so that your identity on your phone is not divorced from your identity on your laptop.</li>
<li>…and obviously, we need a robust post-beta Dendrite to act as the local homeserver!</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now focus is going back to Dendrite for a bit, but P2P work will resume again in the new year :)</p>
<p>Finally, the third big distraction from Dendrite has been… sync v3.</p>
<h2 id="sync-v3">Sync v3</h2>
<p>Sync v3 is shaping up to be the single most significant improvement to Matrix since we began.</p>
<p>Syncing data from the homeserver to the client is obviously fundamental to Matrix - and the current behaviour (sync v2) is far from perfect, as it’s designed around the assumption that your client wants to receive information for every room that it’s in.  In the early days of Matrix, this was fine: a typical user might be in tens of conversations, and it’s useful to have them all available for offline access.  Nowadays, however, it’s a disaster: users can easily accumulate hundreds or thousands of rooms - especially with rooms used to describe spaces or profiles and other structured realtime data.  Moreover, the number of rooms you’re in typically increases linearly over time, unbounded, as nobody wants to archive their old conversations.</p>
<p>So, the idea of sync v3 is that you only sync the strict subset of data that your client actually cares about to display in its UI - effectively making both initial and incremental sync instant, incredibly low bandwidth, and completely independent of the number of rooms you’re in (just as filesystem performance should be independent of the number of directories or files present).</p>
<p>For instance, the full initial sync for @matthew:matrix.org in sync v2 is 417MB of JSON uncompressed - or ~100MB if gzipped, and takes about 5 minutes to calculate on matrix.org (during which it murders the sync worker responsible and hammers the database like crazy).  By contrast, sync v3’s initial sync is 15KB uncompressed, or 5106 bytes compressed - and synced in 250 microseconds from a local sync-v3 server.  <strong>Yes folks, that’s somewhere between a 30,000x to 1,200,000x improvement over sync v2, depending on how you count it.</strong></p>
<p>Sync v3 gets this unbelievable performance by the client defining a sliding window into the server’s datasets, sized and ordered as needed for the client’s UI. This effectively performs real-time serverside pagination, so that as the client scrolls around or filters their roomlist or membership list, the client requests new views from the server.  Meanwhile the server sends incremental updates to the client if they intersect with the sliding window.  This may sound unwieldy, but in practice it works fine (although we’ll have some interesting challenges when we get around to encrypting state events, given serverside ordering and filtering will become distinctly harder).  It also doesn’t design out offline access, as the client caches its view of the world so even if you do go offline you can still work with all the data that has sent to your client so far (and the client could even proactively paginate in other content, if it wanted to, similar to an email client synchronising for offline access).</p>
<p>Sync v3 exists today as a proxy called <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sync-v3">sync-v3</a> which sits between any existing homeserver and a sync-v3-capable Matrix client.  It’s very early days, but Hydrogen has <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/compare/kegan/syncv3">basic v3 support</a> on a branch which we’ve been using to experiment with the API and flesh it out - and you can see a demo and intro talk in <a href="https://youtu.be/Hsyqa5ozWIo?t=59">last week’s Matrix Live</a>!</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hsyqa5ozWIo?t=59" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The API itself is still in flux, but those interested can see the initial spec design at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sync-v3/blob/main/api.md">https://github.com/matrix-org/sync-v3/blob/main/api.md</a> and also an MSC is emerging at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/kegan/sync-v3/proposals/3575-sync.md">MSC3575</a>.  Next steps will be to finish hooking up to Hydrogen (including filtering the room list), finish the MSC, and then start thinking about implementing it in other clients and servers!</p>
<h2 id="fast-joins-over-federation">Fast Joins over Federation</h2>
<p>While we’re on the subject of speeding up Matrix… it’s all very well being able to sync your client instantly, but the other big complaint everyone has about Matrix is how long it takes to join rooms - especially big ones.  As most people will know, it can easily take 5-10 minutes to join a large room like Matrix HQ on a new homeserver - and given this is the first experience most users have of running their own homeserver, it can prove pretty disastrous and we are determined to fix it.  It will become even more relevant when we implement peeking over federation, as the last thing you want is to have to wait 5 minutes to temporarily dip into some random federated room to see if you want to join it or not (or to sniff its room state for things like extensible profiles or <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2313">MSC2313</a> reputation rooms).</p>
<p>So, to address this, we’re currently in the middle of experimenting with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2775">MSC2775</a> (Lazyloading over Federation) in Synapse. This MSC lets servers participate in a room before they’ve received the full room state by defining a subset of state which is mandatory for participation, and then letting the rest get added lazily.  It’s quite a violent change as it means the assumption that room state is complete (to the best of the server’s knowledge) is no longer true - but given Matrix already has to handle incomplete room state, it’s not necessarily a showstopper.</p>
<p>Watch this space for how well it works in practice, but we’re hoping for a ~20x speed improvement in joining Matrix HQ.</p>
<h2 id="hydrogen">Hydrogen</h2>
<p>2021 has been a busy year for Hydrogen - our ultra-lightweight Matrix Client, which provides a small but perfectly formed progressive web app for us to experiment on! There have been no fewer than 56 releases over the course of the year, with loads of contributions from Bruno, Midhun (who joined first as a GSOCcer and then as a fulltime Element employee) and also Danila who interned at Element on Hydrogen over the summer.</p>
<p>People often ask why Hydrogen exists as well as Element Web - and the reason is because Element Web is (for now at least) very far from a progressive web app and is stuffed full of features, whereas Hydrogen is intended to be as lightweight and simple and efficient as possible while also targeting as wide a range of web browsers as possible (even Internet Explorer!).  It also provides a simpler platform for experimenting with new approaches such as sync v3 or OIDC without getting entangled in the constant hive of activity around Element Web.  Finally, it gives us a playground to experiment with embeddable chat clients thanks to Hydrogen’s strict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel">MVVM</a> component model.</p>
<p>In terms of features, 2021 has seen huge steps forwards as Hydrogen converges on feature parity with Element - proper mentions and replies; rich formatted linkified messages; reactions; redactions; memberlist; member info; webpush notifications; proper image, video &amp; file uploads; SSO login; sync v3(!) and so much more. Can’t wait to see what 2022 will bring!</p>
<h2 id="end-to-end-encryption">End-to-End Encryption</h2>
<p>2021 saw the long-awaited creation of a dedicated cryptography team to focus exclusively on improving encryption in Matrix: previously encryption expertise was split across various different areas, meaning that it could prove hard to carve out time to tackle the bigger remaining encryption challenges.</p>
<p>So far the team has been busy digging deep into the few remaining causes of UISIs (undecryptable messages), including automated UISI reporting and tracing E2EE flows end-to-end (from client to server to server to client).  There’s also been an initial wave of UX work - with much more to come next year as we overhaul cross-signing and device backups to make it way more user friendly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the more foundational side of things, we’re continuing to define Decentralised MLS as a potential next-generation form of end-to-end encryption, building on the IETF’s <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/">MLS</a> work - providing much better scalability for large chat rooms and potentially helping with some causes of encryption failures.  Hubert (uhoreg) has been leading the charge here, with his <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/mls-ts/-/blob/decentralised2/decentralised.org">latest thoughts emerging here</a> alongside a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiUyWZg3J7k">brand new demo</a> showing his <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/uhoreg/mls-demo">DMLS simulator</a> - which under the hood is actually sending real Matrix events over DMLS!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2021-12-22-dmls.png" alt="DMLS" /></p>
<p>Otherwise, the team has had three big projects: adding matrix-rust-sdk-crypto into Element Android (which we already covered above), arranging a fresh security audit of Matrix’s end-to-end encryption (due to complete January 2022)… and, most excitingly: vodozemac.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac">Vodozemac</a> (pronounced roughly vod-oz-eh-matz) is an entirely new implementation of our Olm and Megolm end-to-end encryption system, written from scratch in pure Rust, aiming to replace the original reference C/C++11 implementation in <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm">libolm</a>.  Originally written as an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/compare/vodozemac-bench">experiment for matrix-rust-sdk</a> at the beginning of the year, in the last week it’s received a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/graphs/contributors">huge explosion of attention</a> from poljar and dkasak to bring it up to production quality… for we decided that if we are doing a full E2EE audit for Matrix, we should target the new and future codebase rather than burn money on re-auditing the legacy libolm library (much as the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last">original 2016 review of libolm</a> happened when the library was fresh and new).</p>
<p>The motivation for vodozemac in general is to benefit from the intrinsic type and memory safety and fearless parallelism provided by Rust - and also maintain full type &amp; memory safety throughout the matrix-rust-sdk stack, including encryption.  Over the last year we’ve been taking<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/14/adventures-in-fuzzing-libolm"> more and more of a careful look at libolm</a>, and despite our best efforts a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/13/disclosure-buffer-overflow-in-libolm-and-matrix-js-sdk">few</a> memory management bugs have crept in - which vodozemac should be immune to.  Vodozemac will solve another embarrassing problem with libolm: that its default cryptography primitives are designed for correctness rather than performance or safety.  By switching to Rust’s ed25519-dalek and rustCrypto AES primitives we should be in a much better position in terms of performance and safety.</p>
<p>Next up, we’ll be fully integrating vodozemac into matrix-rust-sdk, and figuring out how best to provide it as a libolm replacement in general.</p>
<h2 id="matrix-security">Matrix Security</h2>
<p>Alongside the new Cryptography team we’ve also established a new dedicated Security team for Matrix, led by dkasak.  As well as <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/14/adventures-in-fuzzing-libolm">fuzzing excursions</a> into libolm and similar research, Denis has been handling all our <a href="https://matrix.org/security-disclosure-policy">security disclosure policy</a> submissions, managing the <a href="https://blog.intigriti.com/matrix/">Intigriti bug bounty</a> programme, helping coordinate all our security releases, and coordinating the upcoming external independent security audit of vodozemac, matrix-rust-sdk, Element and Synapse.  It’s a huge step forwards to be able to fund full-time infosec researchers to focus exclusively on Matrix, and this is just the beginning!</p>
<h2 id="trust-and-safety">Trust and Safety</h2>
<p>Another place where we’ve created a dedicated team this year is around Trust &amp; Safety: building tools to fight spam and abuse on our own servers, while also empowering the wider network of users, moderators and admins to manage abuse as they see fit.  This includes lots of work on Mjolnir, our primary moderation bot, but also defining MSCs such as <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3215">MSC3215</a> (Aristotle: Moderation in all things) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3531">MSC3531</a> (Letting moderators hide messages pending moderation) and internal tooling as we experiment with different approaches.</p>
<p>We’ll have more updates on this in the coming year as we release the tools we’ve been working on, but suffice it to say that the goal is to empower mainstream users in the wider Matrix network to apply their own rules as they see fit, directly from the comfort of their favourite Matrix client - without having to know what a Mjolnir is (or how to run one), and without having to be a moderation expert.</p>
<h2 id="openid-connect">OpenID Connect</h2>
<p>A new project brewing throughout 2021 has been the investigation into replacing the entirety of Matrix’s authentication APIs with industry standard OpenID Connect.  Spearheaded by Quentin, this has proved to be a fascinating and challenging endeavour, but we’re starting to see some really interesting results.  The problem we’re trying to solve here is:</p>
<ul>
<li>As Matrix grows, we’re seeing more and more clients and services appearing which you might want to log into with your Matrix account.  But do you really want to trust each app with your account password?  And what if you only want to give it access to a small subset of your account?</li>
<li>Similarly, we’re seeing more and more login mechanisms used to access Matrix - it’s no longer just a matter just a username + password; many servers use single-sign-on (e.g. mozilla.org) or social login (fosdem.org, matrix.org), or layer on 2FA or MFA hardware tokens and similar to access their accounts via an SSO provider.  We also see passwordless login on the horizon.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, do we really want to mandate each new Matrix client to have to implement custom flows to handle this explosion of login/registration mechanisms?  And is it even really the client’s problem in the first place?  You’re securing access to your account on your chosen server, which isn’t really a client-specific thing at all.</p>
<p>The real turning point for the project however has been our recent experiences building out a new wave of single-use domain-specific clients (see below) for video conferencing, whiteboarding, metaverse-browsing etc… where by <em>far</em> the most painful bit of the project has been hooking up the UI for login, registration, guest access, incremental signup, password reset, email verification, CAPTCHA, SSO, etc.  And that’s even when building on top of matrix-react-sdk, which theoretically has it all already thanks to Element Web!</p>
<p>Frankly, it has become blindingly obvious that it’s crazy for clients to reimplement this every time, and they should instead chuck the user over to a sign-on portal provided by their homeserver - just like Google and everyone else’s single-sign-on does.  And rather than inventing our own homebrew way of doing that, we should just use the existing industry standard SSO best practices defined by OpenID Connect.</p>
<p>The main objections which have come up against this are: “what if my Matrix client doesn’t have a web browser, or what if I want to provide my own native login UI”, and “does this design out the idea of using a single password to access your account as well as your E2EE history”?  In both instances, we have workarounds: in practice, there are so many Matrix clients around that we won’t be removing today’s legacy login/registration APIs any time soon (just like HTTP Basic Auth is still very much a thing on the web!).  And in terms of “cryptographic login”, there are ways we could daisychain the auth required to unlock your E2EE storage to also authenticate you with your server - although this would be a major extension (much as cryptographic login is already today!)</p>
<p>The current status is that we’ve defined a set of initial MSCs (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2964">MSC2964</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2965">MSC2965</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2966">MSC2966</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2967">MSC2967</a>), and are implementing an initial Open ID Connect auth server (in Rust!) called <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-authentication-service">matrix-authentication-service</a> (better name suggestions welcome!) designed to sit alongside your homeserver, and we’re experimenting with hooking <a href="https://github.com/sandhose/hydrogen-web/tree/sandhose/oidc-login">Hydrogen</a> (and some of the new domain-specific clients) up to see how it feels.  But if it goes as well as we think it might, folks should prepare for 2022 to be the year where Matrix’s authentication system finally gets fixed!</p>
<h2 id="native-matrix-video-voip-conferencing">Native Matrix Video/VoIP Conferencing</h2>
<p>One of the most anticipated features in Matrix over the years has been the prospect of native, decentralised, end-to-end encrypted video and voice conferencing.  Today, voice and video conferencing in Matrix works by embedding Jitsi as a third party centralised service into your chatroom.  This works fairly well - but Jitsi is an entirely separate service with lots of moving parts, and its own concept of users and access control (provided by XMPP!) and its megolm-based end-to-end-encryption doesn’t actually integrate with Matrix’s own Olm identities, verification or cross-signing.  The fact that the conference is then logically centralised on whoever is hosting the Jitsi service also misses one Matrix’s main goals - that users should be able to hold a conversation without being dependent on any single service or provider.  Plus it’s really confusing that Matrix has proper native 1:1 calls for DMs… but then switches to a totally different system in group chats.</p>
<p>So, this year we set out to fix it - and succeeded :D  The solution hinges around <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/group-voip/proposals/3401-group-voip.md">MSC3401</a> - a spec proposal that describes how to extend native 1:1 calls to work for groups, while providing real flexibility on how to actually mix the calls together.  At the simplest extreme, it defines how full mesh calls work (where every client simply calls every other client simultaneously) - but then also defines how you can mix calls together either using a single focus (conferencing server) or multiple foci run by different parties, where foci can either be Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs, like Jitsi) or Multipoint Conferencing Units (MCUs, like FreeSWITCH).  The end result is to give us decentralised, cascading, end-to-end encrypted conferencing which even has direct compatibility with today’s 1:1 Matrix calling, letting you easily hook in bots and bridges which already support 1:1 Matrix calls!</p>
<p>Robert Long has been frantically hacking away at the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/matrix-video-chat">initial implementation</a> over the last few months, fleshing out full-mesh conferencing at first and getting it running in as many browsers as possible (including Mobile Safari and Chrome Android!).  We were hoping to fully unveil the end result in time for Christmas, but in practice we hit some last minute snags (turns out Matthew forgot guest users can’t use TURN, who knew? so much for incremental login! 😰) which have pushed the launch to early next year.  But hopefully in a few weeks, you’ll be able to start jumping on a native group call in Matrix!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those interested can see all the gory details from our CommCon 2021 talk a few weeks ago, complete with a demo of the shape of things to come…</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A4k7DVIK5TE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Next up, we’ll be working on building an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3401">MSC3401</a>-compatible SFU so we can go beyond full mesh (which typically supports a maximum of ~7 callers).  Our candidates right now are mediasoup, ion-sfu, janus and signal-calling-service - we’ll let you know how it goes!  Also, if you’re interested in helping us build this out quicker, we are frantically searching for more WebRTC &amp; VoIP gurus to <a href="https://apply.workable.com/elementio/j/25BB112FBD/">join the team at Element</a> working on this.</p>
<h2 id="applications-beyond-chat">Applications Beyond Chat</h2>
<p>Finally, 2021 was the year where we seriously started building out functionality on Matrix which goes far beyond plain old chat rooms.</p>
<p>Work began in the summer as a research project led by Ryan, formerly tech lead for Element Web - looking at ways to store hierarchical structured data into Matrix while preserving real-time semantics; effectively using Matrix as a collaborative decentralised object tree, providing CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) to allow richer applications to be built on Matrix.  This journey led him to create <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/patience">Patience</a> as a test environment for building out these sort of clients, and meanwhile Timo (famous of <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard">The Board</a>) joined the team to build out <a href="https://youtu.be/Hsyqa5ozWIo?t=1054">Full Screen Widgets</a> in Element, providing a much better UI for beyond-chat experiments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Matthew Weidner and the Composable Systems Lab at CMU stunned us all by presenting a complete CRDT solution using Matrix named <a href="https://github.com/composablesys/collabs">Collabs</a> at <a href="https://youtu.be/Exr0iY_D-vw?t=382">Strange Loop 2021</a>.  This is <em>really</em> impressive stuff - the brave of heart can go and embed a Matrix-powered end-to-end-encrypted collaborative markdown editor straight into Element via Collabs by following the <a href="https://compoventuals-tests.herokuapp.com/">instructions here</a>.  In practice, Collabs works by serialising the CRDT updates as base64 blobs inside Matrix timeline events (hello <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/wave/whitepapers/federation/wavespec.html#anchor35">Wave</a>, is that you?), but we’re now investigating how you might reconcile this with maintaining a proper realtime object tree in Matrix.</p>
<p>It’s hard to overstate how powerful storing freeform tree CRDTs in Matrix would be.  It could open up everything from decentralised encrypted collaborative document editing to collaborative whiteboarding and collaborative <a href="https://figma.com/">Figma</a>-style (or <a href="https://penpot.app/">Penpot</a>- or <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>-style) design.  You could even start storing an HTML DOM into a room, alongside its binary assets, giving you a multiplayer DOM to build on… and then imagine if you could store the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format">syntax tree</a> of the code operating on that DOM alongside it, in the same room.  Before you know it, we will have created kind of some incredible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquet_Project">Croquet</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a> nirvana where code is data and data is code and it’s all running live in some kind of decentralised encrypted multiplayer Metaverse :D</p>
<p>While we’ve been looking at storing object trees in Matrix, another obvious angle that has emerged is to use Matrix for encrypted decentralised file storage. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3089">MSC3089</a> is a proposal on how you might represent hierarchies of files in Matrix - where each room acts effectively as a directory of files, with spaces forming a directory structure (much as they do already in today’s Matrix), leveraging Matrix’s existing decentralised access control mechanisms to control who can access what.  Combine such a file storage system with the collaborative editing capabilities mentioned above, and suddenly a really exciting proposition starts to emerge.  We’re investigating this right now, and all will be revealed early next year…</p>
<p>Finally, and last but not least, Robert Long has been building on top of our shiny new Native Matrix Voice/Video Conferencing capabilities to use Matrix as the communication backbone for a truly open, equitable and interoperable vision of the Metaverse.  The best way of describing it is to look at his awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e26UJRCGfGk&amp;t=2263s">Third Room demo from the Open Metaverse Interoperability Group demo session</a> in September:</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e26UJRCGfGk?t=2263s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Now, some folks will recall that since day one (in fact, since before day one) the hope for Matrix was that it might end up as the communications fabric of the Metaverse.  We were about 4 years early when we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2017/04/04/opening-up-cyberspace-with-matrix-and-webvr">first starting enthusing about this</a>, and then still ahead of our time when we did the world’s first <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/02/05/3-d-video-calling-with-matrix-webrtc-and-webvr-at-fosdem-2018">3D Video calling</a> over Matrix.  However, it now feels like the world has finally caught up - and we’re in grave danger of being overtaken by a dystopia where the big tech companies balkanize the Metaverse into a series of closed proprietary user-exploiting walled gardens, much like today’s incumbent chat silos - but even worse.</p>
<p><strong>This is our chance to fix it before it’s too late</strong>, and <a href="https://element.io/careers">Element is funding a small but highly targeted team</a> to focus exclusively on building out open interoperable Metaverse over Matrix - ensuring that collaboration in 3D (and 2D) spatial environments in future is decentralised, secure and standards-based.  This obviously ties in directly with the rest of the Beyond Chat projects listed above: it’s early days, but it’s incredibly exciting to imagine where we could end up if this works!</p>
<p>Finally, a question which has kept coming up while working on Beyond Chat projects has been whether to implement this new functionality as Matrix widgets, bake them into existing Matrix clients, or build them as domain-specific dedicated Matrix clients.  But perhaps we’re thinking about this all wrong: what if your Matrix client was just a browser for Matrix rooms?  Some of these could be chatrooms.  Some of these could be VoIP/Video conferences or Discord-style voice/video rooms.  Some of these could be message boards or mailing lists.  Some of these could be collaborative editors or whiteboards.  Some of these could be 3D views into the metaverse.  Some of these could be rendered via widgets; some could be rendered natively if the client knows how.  And some of these could even be good old web pages(!!!).</p>
<p>Imagine if your Matrix client was effectively a genuine browser of arbitrary decentralised realtime content?  If your view into a Matrix room was just that: a full window view into that room, be it textual or 2D or 3D - and your Matrix client was just a browser which added the necessary chrome and navigation to help you tab between rooms, login and logout, manage your encryption, track who’s in the room, track your notifications, etc.?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you’re in a web browser, you might hop into a lightweight single-page domain-specific webapp which happens to use Matrix for collaboration.  Or if you’re in a Matrix client/browser, you could hop to the same matrix URL to get at the same functionality with all the supporting chrome and UI overlays sliding in as needed…</p>
<p>Perhaps the vision of Matrix as the missing communication layer of the open Web is more literal than we ever thought.  Eitherway, it will be fascinating to see how Applications Beyond Chat evolves over the next year.</p>
<h2 id="2022">2022</h2>
<p>Now, I dare you to cross-reference all of the above with <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-special-2020#2021">last year’s predictions for 2021</a> to see how we did :D In practice, the only things from the list we haven’t got to are peeking-over-federation (although arguably fast joins are a key part of that), account portability, and restoring incremental sign-up (although our new clients have it!).</p>
<p>So, here go the predictions for 2022 (keeping it short, otherwise it’ll be 2023 before this blog post gets finished…):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client polish and performance</strong> - our prime directive is to ensure that Matrix clients can be built with UX polish and quality which exceeds our centralised alternatives.  In practice, this means:
<ul>
<li><strong>Element must spark joy</strong>.  Ensuring Element’s Information Architecture continues to be simplified and refined, and that <em>nobody</em> who knows how to use a computer hits a WTF moment when first using the app.  Never again do we want to see someone on Twitter saying “I have no idea how to use Matrix”.</li>
<li><strong>Instant launch</strong>.  With Sync v3 and matrix-rust-sdk we hope to make Element launch instantly on all platforms - including initial sync.</li>
<li><strong>Fast joins</strong>.  We should never get bored while waiting to join a room or accept an invite.</li>
<li><strong>Spaces</strong>.  While Spaces are already a huge improvement in letting users organise and discover rooms, there’s still much more to be done:
<ul>
<li><strong>Flair</strong> - Users who are members of a space should be able to announce it loud and proud with a Flair badge on their avatar, like we used to with the old pre-spaces Communities feature (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3219">MSC3219</a> being the potential proposal).</li>
<li><strong>Synchronising access controls</strong> - You should be able to apply access controls based on whether a user is a member of a given group (so that if you invite them to #moderators:example.com, they automatically get made moderator in all the rooms in a given space).  It looks likely that this will be implemented at last using joepie91’s <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3216">MSC3216</a> proposal for Synchronized access control for Spaces (rather than Matthew’s original <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2962">MSC2962</a> - an excellent example of the community steering the spec process :)</li>
<li><strong>Bulk joins</strong> - It should be a one-button operation to join all the rooms in a space.</li>
<li>**Subspaces **- as more and more spaces emerge, the ability to navigate them as a hierarchy becomes more and more useful.  We want to get to the point where we can turn off the Matrix.org public rooms list, and instead present a Space tree of all the good rooms we know about in Matrix… delegating over curation to the wider community; building a huge USENET-style hierarchy of where to go in Matrix.  To do that, we need subspaces to sing!</li>
<li><strong>Removing communities/groups</strong>, which will then be entirely superseded by spaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>**Threads **go-live!</li>
<li><strong>Location share</strong> go-live</li>
<li><strong>Pinned messages</strong>, so the most important messages are always visible to everyone n the room</li>
<li><strong>Starred messages</strong>, so you never lose a message ever again</li>
<li><strong>Custom emoji</strong>, finally merging in all the custom emoji work from the community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>matrix-rust-sdk</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Element iOS on rust-sdk</strong></li>
<li><strong>Element Android on rust-sdk-crypto</strong></li>
<li>…and experiment to see how matrix-rust-sdk feels on Web? It’s a real shame that <a href="https://github.com/daydream-mx/Daydream">Daydream</a> got archived…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Encryption</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vodozemac</strong> in matrix-rust-sdk, maybe even elsewhere.</li>
<li>**Updated E2EE Audit **spanning vodozemac, olm+megolm, matrix-rust-sdk… and a representative sample of a typical Element+Synapse deployment.</li>
<li><strong>DMLS</strong> - getting to the point where we can experiment with it in real clients.</li>
<li><strong>Encryption Agility</strong> - the ability to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3516">migrate encrypted history</a> is going to become really important as we evolve our E2EE, whether that’s by adding in post-quantum algorithms, or moving from Megolm to MLS, or any other shifts.  We will need to start thinking about it in 2022.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Next-generation MSCs</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aggregations</strong> - finalising the foundational MSCs for aggregations, at last</li>
<li><strong>Extensible events</strong> - finalising the foundational MSCs for extensible events, at last</li>
<li>**Sync v3 **- finalising the MSC and implementing it in matrix-rust-sdk</li>
<li><strong>Fast joins</strong> - getting them implemented in Synapse and Dendrite</li>
<li><strong>Peeking over federation</strong> - getting them implemented in Synapse and Dendrite</li>
<li><strong>Extensible profiles</strong> - who needs a facebook wall when you have a profile room on Matrix?</li>
<li><strong>Open ID Connect</strong> - using OIDC as an alternative auth mechanism for new clients.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Gitter parity</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Importing the Gitter archives into Matrix</strong> via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716">MSC2716</a></li>
<li><strong>Implementing excellent public static Matrix archives</strong> (replacing both view.matrix.org and gitter.im’s static views)</li>
<li><strong>Transfiguring Gitter into a Gitter-themed Element</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dendrite</strong>
<ul>
<li>**Parity with Synapse **- and out of beta, with any luck!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>P2P Matrix</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exposing the normal Matrix network via P2P!</strong></li>
<li><strong>Multihomed accounts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Store and forward</strong> (if only by relaying via other P2P Matrix nodes)</li>
<li>**Low bandwidth transports **- via PineCoAP or similar</li>
<li><strong>Making federation robust in a highly disconnected network.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hydrogen</strong>
<ul>
<li>**Daily Driver **- making sure that Hydrogen can be readily used as a daily driver Matrix client, even if it lacks full parity with Element.</li>
<li>**Embeddable Hydrogen **- making the most of Hydrogen as a tiny lightweight PWA to embed it into existing websites.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bots and Bridges</strong>
<ul>
<li>**Landing End-to-Bridge-Encryption **for all existing matrix-appservice-bridge based bridges</li>
<li><strong>All the integrations!</strong></li>
<li><strong>First-class UI for configuring integrations!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Trust &amp; Safety</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Empower users to manage abuse within their communities</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Native Group Voice/Video Conferencing</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Launch a standalone conferencing app!</strong></li>
<li><strong>Build a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3401">MSC3401</a>-capable SFU</strong></li>
<li><strong>Add native group calling to Element</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Border gateways</strong>
<ul>
<li>Something we didn’t mention in 2021 is the increasing interest in building border gateways and hardware cross domain gateways to safely link different Matrix federations together.  We expect to see a lot of activity in this space in 2022, and there should be some new MSCs too :)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Beyond Chat</strong>
<ul>
<li>**Metaverse on Matrix **- building out the dream as per above!</li>
<li>**Collaborative editing **- extending Matrix to store trees of events, and collaborate on them in realtime - starting with a collaborative editor!</li>
<li><strong>File storage in Matrix</strong> - building out real-life file storage on top of Matrix.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there you have it. If you’ve got this far… it’s incredible; you’re amazing: thank you for reading!  The sheer length of this update shows just how much Matrix has grown in 2021 relative to previous years; it’s frankly terrifying to imagine how long the equivalent post will be next year.  We may have to change the format a little :)</p>
<p>And that’s a wrap for 2021: we hope you stay safe and have an excellent end of the year.  Huge thanks for flying Matrix and supporting the project - we literally wouldn’t be here without you.</p>
<p>- Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix core team.</p>

                <h2 id="a-full-day-of-matrix-talks">A full day of Matrix talks</h2>
<p>This year, the Matrix.org Foundation is excited to host the first ever <em>Matrix.org Foundation and Community</em> devroom at FOSDEM. A full day of talks, demos and workshops around Matrix itself and projects built on top of Matrix.</p>
<p>Matrix is the open source project that publishes the Matrix open standard for secure, decentralised, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed reference implementations.</p>
<p>We encourage people working on the Matrix protocol or building on it in an open source project to submit a proposal! Note that companies are welcome to talk about the Matrix details of their open source projects, but marketing talks are not welcome.</p>
<p>We want this devroom to be a space where the Matrix community can show its work, where developers can talk about the challenges they faced and how they overcame them, and where people can get a glimpse of the future of the Matrix protocol and ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="talk-details">Talk Details</h2>
<p>The talks will be pre-recorded in January. They will be played during FOSDEM, followed by a session of live Q&amp;A depending on the format. During the playback of the talk, people will be able to comment and ask questions in the chat (via Matrix!).</p>
<p>The talks can follow one of three formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 min lightning talk, ideal to showcase your project and make people want to have a look at it</li>
<li>20 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A, for topics that can be covered briefly</li>
<li>50 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A for more complex subjects which need more focus</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly encourage you to prepare a demo when it makes sense, so people can actually see what your work looks like in practice!</p>
<p>Of course, the proposal must respect the FOSDEM terms as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conference language is English. All content must relate to Free and Open Source Software. By participating in the event you agree to the publication of your recordings, slides and other content provided under the same licence as all FOSDEM content (CC-BY).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="submitting-a-proposal">Submitting a Proposal</h2>
<p>Proposals must be <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22">submitted on FOSDEM's conference management system Pentabarf</a> before December 17th 2021. If you are not used to Pentabarf, you can follow this <a href="https://eyskens.me/beginners-guide-to-pentabarf/">beginners guide to Pentabarf</a>.</p>
<p>We expect to receive more requests than we have slots available. The devroom organisers (two community members and one core team rep) will be reviewing the proposals and accepting them based on the potential positive impact the project has on Matrix (as defined in by the Mission section of https://matrix.org/foundation).</p>
<p>If a project proposal has been turned down, it doesn't mean we don't believe it has good potential. Maintainers are invited to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a> Matrix room to give it some visibility.</p>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Big news today: Element, the startup founded by the team who created Matrix,
just raised $30M of Series B funding in order to further accelerate Matrix
development and improve Element, the flagship Matrix app. The round is led by
our friends at <a href="https://protocol.ai">Protocol Labs</a> and <a href="https://metaplanet.com">Metaplanet</a>,
the fund established by Jaan Tallinn (co-founder of
Skype and Kazaa).  Both Protocol Labs and Metaplanet are spectacularly on
board our decentralised communication quest, and you couldn't really ask for
a better source of funding to help take Matrix to the next level.  Thank you
for believing in Matrix and leading Element's latest funding!</p>
<p>You can read all about it from the Element perspective over at the
<a href="https://element.io/blog/element-raises-30m-as-matrix-explodes">Element Blog</a>,
but suffice it to say that this is enormous news for the Matrix ecosystem as a
whole.  In addition to transforming the Element app, on the Matrix side this
means that there is now concrete funding secured to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>finish building out <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/06/introducing-the-pinecone-overlay-network">P2P Matrix</a>
and get it live (including finishing Dendrite, given our P2P work builds on Dendrite!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1419820122143961093">native decentralised E2EE voip/video conferencing</a> for Matrix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fully build out our
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">relative decentralised reputation system</a>
in order to combat abuse in Matrix.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously this is in addition to all the normal business-as-usual work going
on in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting <a href="https://element.io/blog/spaces-the-next-frontier/">Spaces</a> out of beta</li>
<li>adding Threading to Element (yes, it's finally happening!)</li>
<li>speeding up room joins over federation</li>
<li>creating 'sync v3' to lazy-load all content and make the API super-snappy</li>
<li>lots of little long-overdue fun bits and pieces (yes, custom emoji, we're looking at you).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're wondering whether Protocol Labs' investment means that we'll be
seeing more overlap between <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> and Matrix, then yes -
where it makes tech sense to do so, we're hoping to work more closely
together; for instance collaborating with the libp2p team on our P2P work
(we still need to experiment properly with gossipsub!), or perhaps giving
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/travis/msc/ipfs/proposals/2706-IPFS.md">MSC2706</a>
some attention.  However, there are no plans to use cryptocurrency incentives
in Matrix or Element any time soon.</p>
<p>So, exciting times ahead!  We'd like to inordinately thank everyone who has
supported Matrix over the years - especially our Patreon supporters, whose
donations pay for all the matrix.org infrastructure while inspiring others to
open their cheque books; the existing investors at Element (especially <a href="https://notion.vc">Notion</a>
and <a href="https://automattic.com">Automattic</a>, who have come in again on this round); all the large scale
Matrix deployments out there which are effectively turning Matrix into an
industry (hello <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/21/germanys-national-healthcare-system-adopts-matrix">gematik!</a>) -
and everyone who has ever run a Matrix server, contributed code, used the
spec to make their own Matrix-powered creation, or simply chatted on Matrix.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Matrix wouldn't exist without you: the protocol and network
would have fizzled out long ago were it not for all the people supporting it
(the matrix.org server can now see over 35.5M addressable users on the
network!) - and meanwhile the ever-increasing energy of the community and the
core team combines to keep the protocol advancing forwards faster than ever.</p>
<p>We will do everything we possibly can to succeed in creating the long-awaited
secure communication layer of the open Web, and we look forward to large
amounts of Element's new funding being directed directly into core Matrix
development :)</p>
<p>thanks for flying Matrix,</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix core team.</p>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>We’re incredibly excited to officially announce that the national agency for
the digitalisation of the healthcare system in Germany (<a href="http://gematik.de">gematik</a>)
has selected Matrix as the open standard on which to base all its
interoperable instant messaging standard - the TI-Messenger.</p>
<p>gematik has released a <a href="https://fachportal.gematik.de/anwendungen/ti-messenger">concept paper</a>
that explains the initiative in full.</p>
<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>With the TI-Messenger, gematik is creating a nationwide decentralised private
communication network - based on Matrix - to support potentially more than
<strong>150,000</strong> healthcare organisations within Germany’s national healthcare system.
It will provide end-to-end encrypted VoIP/Video and messaging for the whole
healthcare system, as well as the ability to share healthcare based data,
images and files.</p>
<p>Initially every healthcare provider (HCP) with an HBA (HPC ID card) will be
able to choose their own TI-Messenger provider. The homesever for HCP
accounts will be hosted by the provider’s datacentre. The homeserver for
institutions can be hosted by TI-Messenger providers, or on-premise.</p>
<p>Each organisation and individual will therefore retain complete ownership and
control of their communication data - while being able to share it securely
within the healthcare system with end-to-end encryption by default. All
servers in the Matrix-based private federation will be hosted within
Germany.</p>
<p>Needless to say, security is key when underpinning the entire nation’s
healthcare infrastructure and safeguarding sensitive patient data. As such,
the entire implementation will be <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html">accredited by BSI</a>
(Federal Office for Information Security) and <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html">BfDI</a>
(Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information).</p>
<h2 id="the-full-context">The full context...</h2>
<p>Germany’s digital care modernisation law (“Digitale Versorgung und Pflege
Modernisierungs Gesetz” or DVPMG), which came into force in June 2021, spells
out  the need for an instant messaging solution.</p>
<p>The urgency has increased by a significant rise in the use of instant
messaging and video conferencing within the healthcare system - for instance,
the amount of medical practices using messenger services doubled in 2020
compared to 2018 (much of this using insecure messaging solutions).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gematik.de/">gematik</a>, majority-owned by Germany’s
<a href="https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/english-version.html">Federal Ministry of Health</a>,
is responsible for the standardised digital transformation of Germany’s
healthcare sector. It focuses on improving efficiency and introducing new
ways of working by setting, testing and certifying healthcare technology
including electronic health cards, electronic patient records and
e-prescriptions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gematik.de/anwendungen/ti-messenger/">TI-Messenger</a> is gematik’s
technical specification for an interoperable secure instant messaging
standard. The healthcare industry will be able to build a wide range of apps
based on TI-Messenger specifications knowing that, being built on Matrix, all
those apps will interoperate.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 organisations - ranging from local doctors to clinics,
hospitals, and insurance companies - can potentially standardise on instant
messaging thanks to gematik’s TI-Messenger initiative.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-interoperability">The road to interoperability</h2>
<p>By 1 October 2021, TI-Messenger will initially specify how communication
should work in practice between healthcare professionals (HCPs). Physicians
will be able to find and communicate with each other via TI-Messenger
approved apps - specifications include secure authentication mechanisms with
electronic health professional cards (eHBAs), electronic institution cards
(SMC-B) and a central <a href="https://hl7.org/FHIR/">FHIR</a> directory. The first
compliant apps for HCPs are expected to be licensed by Q2 2022.</p>
<p>Eric Grey (product manager for TI-Messenger at gematik), reckons there will
initially be around 10-15 TI-Messenger compliant Matrix-based apps for HCP
communications available from different vendors. </p>
<p>Healthcare professionals will be able to choose a TI-Messenger provider, who
will be hosting their personal accounts and provide the messenger-client. </p>
<p>Healthcare organisations will choose a TI-Messenger provider to build the
dedicated homeserver infrastructure (on prem or in a data center), provide
the client and ongoing support.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-the-matrix-community">What does this mean for the Matrix community?</h2>
<p>Matrix is already integral to huge parts of the public sector; from the French
government’s Tchap platform, to Bundeswehr’s use of BwMessenger and adoption
by universities and schools across Europe. </p>
<p>Germany’s healthcare system standardising on Matrix takes this to entirely the
next level - and we can’t wait to see the rest of Europe (and the world!)
converge on Matrix for healthcare!</p>
<p>We'll have more info about TI-Messenger on this week's Matrix Live, out on
Friday - stay tuned!</p>

            <div>
                
                <p>Last week the UK government published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/draft-online-safety-bill">draft of the proposed Online Safety
Bill,</a>
after having initially introduced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/online-harms-white-paper/public-feedback/online-harms-white-paper-initial-consultation-response">formal proposals for said bill in early
2020</a>.
With this post we aim to shed some light on its potential impacts and explain
why we think that this bill - despite having great intentions - may actually
be setting a dangerous precedent when it comes to our rights to privacy,
freedom of expression and self determination.</p>
<p>The proposed bill aims to provide a legal framework to address illegal and
harmful content online. This focus on “not illegal, but harmful” content is at
the centre of our concerns - it puts responsibility on organisations
themselves to arbitrarily decide what might be harmful, without any legal
backing. The bill itself does not actually provide a definition of harmful,
instead relying on service providers to assess and decide on this. This
requirement to identify what is “likely to be harmful” applies to all users,
children and adults. Our question here is - would you trust a service provider
to decide what might be harmful to you and your children, with zero input from
you as a user?</p>
<p>Additionally, the bill incentivises the use of privacy-invasive age
verification processes which come with their own set of problems. This
complete disregard of people’s right to privacy is a reflection of the
privileged perspectives of those in charge of the drafting of this bill, which
fails to acknowledge how <em>actually</em> harmful it would be for certain groups of
the population to have their real life identity associated with their online
identity.</p>
<p>Our view of the world, and of the internet, is largely different from the one
presented by this bill. Now, this categorically does not mean we don’t care
about online safety (it is quite literally our bread and butter) - we just
fundamentally disagree with the approach taken.</p>
<p>Whilst we sympathise with the government’s desire to show action in this space
and to do something about children’s safety (everyone’s safety really), we
cannot possibly agree with the methods.</p>
<p>Back in October of 2020 we presented <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">our proposed approach to online safety</a> -
ironically also in response to a government proposal, albeit about encryption
backdoors. In it, we briefly discussed the dangers of absolute determinations
of morality from a single cultural perspective:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">As uncomfortable as it may be, one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter, and different jurisdictions have different laws - and it’s not up to the Matrix.org Foundation to play God and adjudicate.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now find ourselves reading a piece of legislation that essentially demands
these determinations from tech companies. The beauty of the human experience
lies with its diversity and when we force technology companies to make calls
about what is right or wrong - or what is “likely to have adverse
psychological or physical impacts” on children - we end up in a dangerous
place of centralising and regulating relative morals. Worst of all, when the
consequence of getting it wrong is criminal liability for senior managers what
do we think will happen?</p>
<p>Regardless of how omnipresent it is in our daily lives, technology is still
not a solution for human problems. Forcing organisations to be judge and jury
of human morals for the sake of “free speech” will, ironically, have severe
consequences on free speech, as risk profiles will change for fear of
liability.</p>
<p>Forcing a “duty of care” responsibility on organisations which operate online
will not only drown small and medium sized companies in administrative tasks
and costs, it will further accentuate the existing monopolies by Big Tech.
Plainly, Big Tech can afford the regulatory burden - small start-ups can’t.
Future creators will have their wings clipped from the offset and we might
just miss out on new ideas and projects for fear of legal repercussions. This
is a threat to the technology sector, particularly those building on emerging
technologies like Matrix. In some ways, it is a threat to democracy and some
of the freedoms this bill claims to protect.</p>
<p>These are, quite frankly, steps towards an authoritarian dystopia. If Trust &amp;
Safety managers start censoring something as natural as a nipple on the off
chance it might cause “adverse psychological impacts” on children, whose
freedom of expression are we actually protecting here?</p>
<p>More specifically on the issue of content moderation: the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/985283/Draft_Online_Safety_Bill_-_Impact_Assessment_Web_Accessible.pdf">impact assessment
provided by the government alongside this
bill</a>
predicts that the additional costs for companies directly related to the bill
will be in the billions, over the course of 10 years. The cost for the
government? £400k, in every proposed policy option. Our question is - why are
these responsibilities being placed on tech companies, when evidently this is
a societal problem?</p>
<p>We are not saying it is up to the government to single-handedly end the
existence of Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) or extremist content
online. What we are saying is that it takes more than content filtering, risk
assessments and (faulty) age verification processes for it to end. More
funding for tech literacy organisations and schools, to give children (and
parents) the tools to stay safe is the first thing that comes to mind. Further
investment in law enforcement cyber units and the judicial system, improving
tech companies’ routes for abuse reporting and allowing the actual judges to
do the judging seems pretty sensible too. What is absolutely egregious is the
degradation of the digital rights of the majority, due to the wrongdoings of a
few.</p>
<p>Our goal with this post is not to be dramatic or alarmist. However, we want to
add our voices to the countless <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/online-abuse-why-management-liability-isnt-the-answer/">digital rights
campaigners</a>,
individuals and organisations that have been raising the alarm since the early
days of this bill. Just like with coercive control and abuse, the degradation
of our rights does not happen all at once. It is a slippery slope that starts
with something as (seemingly) innocuous as <a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1392823038920564736">mandatory content scanning for
CSAE content and ends with authoritarian surveillance
infrastructure</a>.
It is our duty to put a stop to this before it even begins.</p>
