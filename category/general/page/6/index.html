                <p><strong>TL;DR DON'T PANIC - Synapse 1.0 will support Postgres 9.4 and Python 2.7</strong></p>
<p>Folks, this is an update to explain that we will be shortly deprecating Synapse support for Postgres 9.4 and Python 2.x.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-we-doing">What are we doing?</h2>
<p>From the dates described below, we will no longer guarantee support for deprecated versions. This means that Synapse <em>may </em>continue to work with these versions but we will not make any attempt to ensure compatibility and will remove old library versions from our CI.</p>
<h2 id="when-is-this-happening">When is this happening?</h2>
<p><strong>Synapse 1.0 will continue to support both technologies, but subsequent releases may not:-</strong></p>
<p>For Python, we shared that we would discontinue to Python 2.x support from<a href="/blog/2018/12/21/porting-synapse-to-python-3/"> April 1st 2019</a>, so for the first release that follows 1.0 we do not guarantee Python 2.x support.</p>
<p>For Postgres, will give server admins 6 weeks to upgrade to a newer version, and will guarantee support <strong>up until 20th May 2019.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-would-you-do-this-to-us">Why would you do this to us?</h2>
<p>We have multiple reasons, but broadly:-</p>
<ul>
 	<li>We want to make use of new language features not supported in old versions. This will enable us to continue to improve the performance and maintainability of Synapse.</li>
 	<li>Python 2.x overall will be <a href="https://pythonclock.org/">end of life'd at the end of the year</a>. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/">Postgres 9.4's final release</a> will follow 2 months later on 13th February 2020.</li>
 	<li>Since very few server admins still use these technologies on the wild, providing support is costly and we want to reduce our overall maintenance load.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="la-la-la-i-am-ignoring-you-what-will-happen">La la la I am ignoring you - what will happen?</h2>
<p>You will be able to upgrade to Synapse 1.0, but will likely experience incompatibilities that prevent you upgrading further. Seriously, you really need to upgrade.</p>
<h2 id="okay-but-i-have-questions-where-should-i-go">Okay, but I have questions, where should I go?</h2>
<p>Come and say Hi in #synapse:matrix.org and we'll do our best to help you.</p>

Folks, as you know we are now very close to achieving Matrix 1.0 and finally being in a position to shed our ‘beta' tag. It has been a long time coming and speaks to the huge effort from hundreds of people over the past 5 years.
<p>A critical step towards this goal is the release of Synapse 1.0. We want to ship Synapse 1.0 as soon as possible but can't do so without your help! </p>
<p>We'd like to introduce <a href="http://arewereadyyet.com/"> AreWeReadyYet.com</a> - a quick and easy way for everyone to track the progress and check if their federation is ready for Matrix 1.0!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.arewereadyyet.com/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4110 size-medium" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screenshot-2019-03-15-at-10.05.19-300x214.png" alt="Are we ready yet?" width="300" height="214" /></a></p>
Synapse 1.0 is good news for anyone running a Synapse installation - it contains critical bug fixes, security patches, a new room algorithm version and dramatically improved user and room search. However, as part of the security work it also 
<b>contains a breaking change from previous Synapse versions. From 1.0 onwards it will necessary to ensure a valid TLS certificate on the federation API. Self signed certificates will no longer be accepted</b>. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md#it-used-to-work-just-fine-why-are-you-breaking-everything">Why would we do such a thing?</a>
<p>In anticipation for this, everyone currently running a homeserver must ensure that they have checked their federation certificate (check yours <a href="/federationtester/">here</a>). Failure to do so will mean being unable to federate with any Matrix 1.0 compliant server. If your server fails the check, our <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/MSC1711_certificates_FAQ.md">FAQ</a> has all the details on what you need to do. </p>
<p>This post is a call to arms to try and get as many admins to upgrade their certificates as possible. We are tracking adoption at <a href="https://arewereadyyet.com">https://arewereadyyet.com</a> - currently this sits at about 55% - we need this figure to be higher before we can pull the lever.  </p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Check that your server has valid certs - then tell all your admin pals to do the same. 
<b>Friends don't let friends miss out on Synapse 1.0, send them to</b><a href="http://arewereadyyet.com/"><b> arewereadyyet.com</b></a><b> (or tweet </b><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Are%20you%20running%20a%20Matrix%20server%3F%20Are%20you%20ready%20for%20Matrix%201.0%3F%20Find%20out%20at%20https%3A%2F%2Farewereadyyet.com!"><b>here</b></a><b> to remind them!)</b> We really need the community to help us here because at some point soon, we will need to pull the lever and release.</p>
<p>Once we make more progress on adoption, we will announce an official release date and finally get Synapse out of beta!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We're very excited to officially welcome the KDE Community on to Matrix as they announce that <a href="https://dot.kde.org/2019/02/20/kde-adding-matrix-its-im-framework">KDE Community is officially adopting Matrix</a> as a chat platform, and kde.org now has an official Matrix homeserver!</p>
<p><a href="https://dot.kde.org/2019/02/20/kde-adding-matrix-its-im-framework"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4015" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kde-matrix-1-1024x355.png" alt="" width="653" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>You can see the full announcement and explanation over at <a href="https://dot.kde.org/2019/02/20/kde-adding-matrix-its-im-framework">https://dot.kde.org/2019/02/20/kde-adding-matrix-its-im-framework</a>.  It is fantastic to see one of the largest Free Software communities out there proactively adopting Matrix as an open protocol, open network and FOSS project, rather than drifting into a proprietary centralised chat system.  It's also really fun to see Riot 1.0 finally holding its own as a chat app against the proprietary alternatives!</p>
<p>This doesn't change the KDE rooms which exist in Matrix today or indeed the KDE Freenode IRC channels - so many of the KDE community were already using Matrix, all the rooms already exist and are already bridged to the right places.  All it means is that there's now a shiny new homeserver (powered by <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a>) on which KDE folk are welcome to grab an account if they want, rather than sharing the rather overloaded public matrix.org homeserver.  The rooms have been set up on the server to match their equivalent IRC channels - for instance, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#kde:kde.org">#kde:kde.org</a> is the same as #kde on Freenode; <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#kde-devel:kde.org">#kde-devel:kde.org</a> is the same as #kde-devel etc.  The rooms continue to retain their other aliases (<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#kde:matrix.org">#kde:matrix.org</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#freenode_#kde:matrix.org">#freenode_#kde:matrix.org</a> etc) as before.</p>
<p>There's also a dedicated Riot/Web install up at <a href="https://webchat.kde.org">https://webchat.kde.org</a>, and instructions on connecting via other Matrix clients up at <a href="https://community.kde.org/Matrix">https://community.kde.org/Matrix</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-20-at-01.56.40.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4020" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-2019-02-20-at-01.56.40-1024x898.png" alt="" width="832" height="730" /></a></p>
<p>This is great news for the Matrix ecosystem in general - and should be particularly welcome for Qt client projects like <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko-Reborn</a>, who may feel a certain affinity to KDE!</p>
<p>So: welcome, KDE!  Hope you have a great time, and please let us know how you get on, so we can make sure Matrix kicks ass for you :)</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>It's that time again where we break out the mince pies and brandy butter (at least for those of us in the UK) and look back on the year to see how far Matrix has come, as well as anticipate what 2019 may bring!</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>It's fair to say that 2018 has been a pretty crazy year.  We have had one overriding goal: to take the <a href="/blog/2018/01/29/status-partners-up-with-new-vector-fueling-decentralised-comms-and-the-matrix-ecosystem/">funding</a> we received in January, stabilise and freeze the protocol and get it and the reference implementations out of beta and to a 1.0 - to provide a genuinely open and decentralised mainstream alternative to the likes of Slack, Discord, WhatsApp etc.  What's so crazy about that, you might ask?</p>
<p>Well, in parallel with this we've also seen adoption of Matrix accelerating ahead of our dev plan at an unprecedented speed: with France selecting Matrix to power the communication infrastructure of its whole public sector - first <a href="/blog/2018/04/26/matrix-and-riot-confirmed-as-the-basis-for-frances-secure-instant-messenger-app/">trialling over the summer</a>, and now <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1070392608801910784">confirmed for full roll-out</a> as of a few weeks ago.  Meanwhile there are several other similar-sized projects on the horizon which we can't talk about yet.  We've had the growing pains of establishing <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a> as a startup in order to hire the core team and support these projects.  We've launched <a href="https://modular.im">Modular</a> to provide professional-quality SaaS Matrix hosting for the wider community and help fund the team.  And most importantly, we've also been establishing the non-profit <a href="/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2/">Matrix.org Foundation</a> to formalise the open governance of the Matrix protocol and protect and isolate it from any of the for-profit work.</p>
<p>However: things have just about come together.  Almost all the spec work for 1.0 is done and we are now aiming to get a 1.0 released in time by the end of January (in time for FOSDEM).  Meanwhile Synapse has improved massively in terms of performance and stability (not least having migrated over to <a href="/blog/2018/12/21/porting-synapse-to-python-3/">Python 3</a>); Riot's spectacular redesign is now <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/redesign-experimenters-needed-afa7c2d4c858">available for testing</a> right now; E2E encryption is more stable than ever with the usability rework <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/compare/develop...uhoreg:e2e_cross-signing">landing</a> as we speak.  And we've even got a full rewrite of Riot/Android in the wings.</p>
<p>But it's certainly been an interesting ride.  Longer-term spec work has been delayed by needing to apply band-aids to mitigate abuse of the outstanding issues.  Riot redesign was pushed back considerably due to prioritising Riot performance over UX. The E2E UX work has forced us to consider E2E holistically… which does not always interact well with structuring the dev work into bite-sized chunks.  Dendrite has generally been idling whilst we instead pour most of our effort into getting to 1.0 on Synapse (rather than diluting 1.0 work across both projects). These tradeoffs have been hard to make, but hopefully we have chosen the correct path in the end.</p>
<p>Overall, as we approach 1.0, the project is looking better than ever - hopefully everyone has seen both Riot and Synapse using less RAM and being more responsive and stable, E2E being more reliable, and anyone who has played with the <a href="https://riot.im/experimental">Riot redesign</a> beta should agree that it is light-years ahead of yesterday's Riot and something which can genuinely surpass today's centralised proprietary incumbents. And that is unbelievably exciting :D</p>
<p>We'd like to thank everyone for continuing to support Matrix - especially our <a href="http://patreon.com/matrixdotorg">Patreon</a> &amp; <a href="http://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg">Liberapay</a> supporters, whose donations continue to be critical for helping fund the core dev team, and also those who are supporting the project indirectly by hosting homeservers with <a href="https://modular.im">Modular</a>.  We are going to do everything humanly possible to ship 1.0 over the coming weeks, and then the sky will be the limit!</p>
<p>Before going into what else 2019 will hold, however, let's take the opportunity to give a bit more detail on the various core team projects which landed in 2018…</p>
<h2 id="france">France</h2>
<p>DINSIC (France's Ministry of Digital, IT &amp; Comms) have been busy building out their massive cross-government Matrix deployment and custom Matrix client throughout most of the year.  After the <a href="/blog/2018/04/26/matrix-and-riot-confirmed-as-the-basis-for-frances-secure-instant-messenger-app/">announcement in April</a>, this started off with an initial deployment over the summer, and is now moving towards the full production rollout, as confirmed at the Paris Open Source Summit a few weeks ago by Mounir Mahjoubi, the Secretary of State of Digital.  All the press coverage about this ended up in French, with the biggest writeup being at <a href="https://www.cio-online.com/actualites/lire-mounir-mahjoubi%C2%A0-%C2%A0le-libre-n-est-pas-toujours-moins-cher-mais-c-est-toujours-plus-transparent%C2%A0-10842.html">CIO Online</a>, but the main mention of Matrix (badly translated from French) is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>Denouncing the use of tools such as WhatsApp; a practice that has become commonplace within ministerial offices, Mounir Mahjoubi announced the launch in production of Tchap, based on Matrix and Riot: an instant messaging tool that will be provided throughout the administrations. So, certainly, developing a product can have a certain cost. Integrating it too. "Free is not always cheaper but it's always more transparent," admitted the Secretary of State.
</i></p>
The project really shows off Matrix at its best, with up to 60 different deployments spread over different ministries and departments; multiple clusters per Ministry; end-to-end encryption enabled by default (complete with e2e-aware antivirus scanning); multiple networks for different classes of traffic; and the hope of federating with the public Matrix network once the S2S API is finalised and suitable border gateways are available.  It's not really our project to talk about, but we'll try to share as much info as we can as roll-out continues.
<h2 id="the-matrix-specification">The Matrix Specification</h2>
<p>A major theme throughout the year has been polishing the <a href="/docs/spec">Matrix Spec</a> itself for its first full stable release, having had more than enough time to see which bits work in practice now and which bits need rethinking.  This all kicked off with the <a href="/blog/2018/05/17/introducing-matrix-specification-changes/">creation of the Matrix Spec Change process</a> back in May, which provides a formal process for reviewing and accepting contributions from anyone into the spec.  Getting the balance right between agility and robustness has been quite tough here, especially pre-1.0 where we've needed to move rapidly to resolve the remaining long-lived sticking points.  However, a process like this risks encouraging the classic “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good">Perfect is the Enemy of Good</a>” problem, as all and sundry jump in to apply their particular brand of perfectionism to the spec (and/or the process around it) and risk smothering it to death with enthusiasm.  So we've ended up iterating a few times on the process and hopefully now converged on an approach which will work for 1.0 and beyond. If you haven't checked out the current <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">proposals guide</a> please give it a look, and feel free to marvel at all the MSCs in flight.  You can also see a <a href="/~richardv/proposal_news.html">quick and dirty timeline of all the MSC status changes</a> since we introduced the process, to get an idea of how it's all been progressing.</p>
<p>In August we had a big sprint to cut <a href="/blog/2018/09/03/matrix-spec-update-august-2018/">stable “r0” releases of all the APIs</a> of the spec which had not yet reached a stable release (i.e. all apart from the Client-Server API, which has been stable since Dec 2015 - hence in part the large number of usable independent Matrix clients relative to the other bits of the ecosystem).  In practice, we managed to release 3 out of the 4 remaining APIs - but needed more time to solve the remaining blocking issues with the Server-Server API. So since August (modulo operational and project distractions) we've been plugging away on the S2S API.  </p>
<p>The main blocking issue for a stable S2S API has been State Resolution. This is the fundamental algorithm used to determine the state of a given room whenever a race or partition happens between the servers participating in it.  For instance: if Alice kicks Bob on her server at the same time as Charlie ops Bob on his server, who should win? It's vital that all servers reach the same conclusion as to the state of the room, and we don't want servers to have to replicate a full copy of the room's history (which could be massive) to reach a consistent conclusion.  Matrix's original state resolution algorithm dates back to the initial usable S2S implementation at the beginning of 2015 - but over time deficiencies in the algorithm became increasingly apparent. The most obvious issue is the “<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2432">Hotel California</a>” bug, where users can be spontaneously re-joined to a room they've previously left if the room's current state is merged with an older copy of the room on another server and the ‘wrong' version wins the conflict - a so-called state-reset.</p>
<p>After a lot of thought we ended up proposing an <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/state_res_rejections/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">all new State Resolution algorithm</a> in July 2018, nicknamed State Resolution Reloaded.  This extends the original algorithm to consider the ‘auth chain' of state events when performing state resolution (i.e. the sequence of events that a given state event cites as evidence of its validity) - as well as addressing a bunch of other issues.  For those wishing to understand in more detail, there's <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/state_res_rejections/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md">the MSC</a> itself, the formal terse description of the algorithm now merged into the <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/unstable.html#state-resolution-algorithm-for-version-2-rooms">unstable S2S spec</a> - or alternatively there's an excellent <a href="https://matrix.uhoreg.ca/stateres/reloaded.html">step-by-step explanation and guided example</a> from uhoreg (warning: contains Haskell :)  Or you can watch Erik and Matthew try to explain it all on <a href="https://youtu.be/f6ZdmPSUUBA">Matrix Live</a> back in July.</p>
<p>Since the initial proposal in July, the algorithm has been proofed out in a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-test-state-resolution-ideas">test jig</a>, iterated on some more to better specify <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1693">how to handle rejected events</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4040">implemented in Synapse</a>, and is now ready to roll.  The only catch is that to upgrade to it we've had to introduce the concept of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1516/files">room versioning</a>, and to flush out historical issues we require you to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/room_upgrades/proposals/1501-room-version-upgrades.md">re-create rooms to upgrade them</a> to the new resolution algorithm. Getting the logistics in place for this is a massive pain, but we've got an approach now which should be sufficient. Clients will be free to smooth over the transition in the UI as gracefully as possible (and in fact Riot has this already hooked up).  So: watch this space as v2 rooms with all-new state resolution in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>Otherwise, there are a bunch of other issues in the S2S API which we are still working through (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/event_id_hashes/proposals/1640-event-id-as-hashes.md">changing event IDs to be hashes</a> of event contents to avoid lying about IDs, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1711">switching to use normal X.509 certificates for federation</a> and so resolve problems with Perspectives, etc).  </p>
<p>Once these land and are implemented in Synapse over the coming weeks, we will be able to finally declare a 1.0!</p>
<p>Also on the spec side of things, it's worth noting that a lot of effort went into improving performance for clients in the form of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1227">Lazy Loading Members MSC</a>.  This ended up consuming a lot of time over the summer as we updated Synapse and the various matrix-*-sdks (and thus Riot) to only calculate and send details to the clients about members who are currently talking in a room, whereas previously we sent the entire state of the room to the client (even including users who had left). The end result however is a 3-5x reduction in RAM on Riot, and a 3-5x speedup on initial sync.  The current MSC is currently being <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1758">merged as we speak</a> into the main spec (thanks Kitsune!) for inclusion in upcoming CS API 0.5.</p>
<h2 id="the-matrix-org-foundation-cic">The Matrix.org Foundation (CIC!)</h2>
<p>Alongside getting the open spec process up and running, we've been establishing The Matrix.org Foundation as an independent non-profit legal entity responsible for neutrally safeguarding the Matrix spec and evolution of the protocol.  This kicked off in June with the “<a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">Towards Open Governance</a>” blog post, and continued with the <a href="/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2/">formal incorporation</a> of The Matrix.org Foundation in October.  Since then, we've spent a lot of time with the non-profit lawyers evolving <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318">MSC1318</a> into the final Articles of Association (and other guidelines) for the Foundation.  This work is basically solved now; it just needs MSC1318 to be updated with the conclusions (which we're running late on, but is top of Matthew's MSC todo list).</p>
<p>In other news, we have confirmation that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company">Community Interest Company</a> (CIC) status for The Matrix.org Foundation has been approved - this means that the CIC Regulator has independently reviewed the initial Articles of Association and approved that they indeed lock the mission of the Foundation to be non-profit and to act solely for the good of the wider online community.  In practice, this means that the Foundation will be formally renamed The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C, and provides a useful independent safeguard to ensure the Foundation remains on track.</p>
<p>The remaining work on the Foundation is:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Update and land MSC1318, particularly on clarifying the relationship between the legal Guardians (Directors) of the Foundation and the technical members of the core spec team, and how funds of the Foundation will be handled.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Update the Articles of Association of the Foundation based on the end result of MSC1318
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Transfer any Matrix.org assets over from New Vector to the Foundation.  Given Matrix's code is all open source, there isn't much in the way of assets - we're basically talking about the matrix.org domain and website itself.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Introduce the final Guardians for the Foundation.
</li>
</ul>
We'll keep you posted with progress as this lands over the coming months.
<h2 id="riot">Riot</h2>
<p>2018 has been a bit of a chrysalis year for Riot: the vast majority of work has been going into the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/a-sneak-peek-at-a-whole-new-riot-im-1114df653782">massive redesign</a> we started in May to improve usability &amp; cosmetics, performance, stability, and E2E encryption usability improvements.  We've consciously spent most of the year feature frozen in order to polish what we already have, as we've certainly been guilty in the past of landing way too many features without necessarily applying the needed amount of UX polish.</p>
<p>However, as of today, we're super-excited to announce that Riot's redesign is at the point where the intrepid can start experimenting with it - in fact, internally most of the team has switched over to dogfooding (testing) the redesign as of a week or so ago.  Just shut down your current copy of Riot/Web or Desktop and go to <a href="https://riot.im/experimental">https://riot.im/experimental</a> instead if you want to experiment (we don't recommend running both at the same time).  Please note that it is still work-in-progress and there's a lot of polish still to land and some cosmetic bugs still hanging around, but it's definitely at the point of feeling better than the old app.  Most importantly, please provide feedback (by hitting the lifesaver-ring button at the bottom left) to let us know how you get on. See the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/redesign-experimenters-needed-afa7c2d4c858">Riot blog</a> for more details!</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-25-at-04.00.44.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3854" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-25-at-04.00.44-1024x578.png" alt="" width="1024" height="578" /></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the performance and stability side of things - Lazy Loading (see above) made a <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/riot-im-web-0-17-and-ios-0-7-6-smaller-footprint-faster-launch-5ddd18a65abb">massive difference</a> to performance on all platforms; shrinking RAM usage by 3-5x and similarly speeding up launch and initial sync times.  Ironically, this ended up pushing back the redesign work, but hopefully the performance improvements will have been noticeable in the interim.  We also <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/6477">switched</a> the entire rich text composer from using Facebook's <a href="https://draftjs.org/">Draft.js</a> library to instead use <a href="https://www.slatejs.org">Slate.js</a> (which has generally been a massive improvement for stability and maintainability, although took <em><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/1890">ages</a></em> to land - huge thanks to t3chguy for getting it over the line). Meanwhile Travis has been blitzing through a massive list of key “<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/projects/12">First Impression</a>” bugs to ensure that as many of Riot's most glaring usability gotchas are solved.</p>
<p>We also welcomed ever-popular <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/stickers-are-here-introducing-riot-im-0-15-for-web-desktop-284c32b93acc">Stickers</a> to the fold - the first instance of per-account rather than per-room widgets, which ended up requiring a lot of new infrastructure in both Riot and the underlying integration manager responsible for hosting the widgets.  But judging by how popular they are, the effort seems to be worth it - and paves the way for much more exciting interactive widgets and integrations in future!</p>
<p>An unexpectedly large detour/distraction came in the form of GDPR back in May - we spent a month or so running around ensuring that both Riot and Matrix are GDPR compliant (including the necessary legal legwork to establish how GDPR even applies to a decentralised technology like Matrix).  If you missed all that fun, you can <a href="/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/">read about it here</a>.  Hopefully we won't have to do anything like that again any time soon...</p>
<p>And finally: on the mobile side, much of the team has been distracted helping out France with their Matrix deployment.  However, we've been plugging away on Riot/Mobile, keeping pace with the development on Riot/Web - but most excitingly, we've also found time to experiment with a <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-android-redesign-PoC/tree/develop">complete rewrite of Riot/Android</a> in Kotlin, using Realm and Rx (currently nicknamed Riot X).  The rewrite was originally intended as a test-jig for experimenting with the redesign on mobile, but it's increasingly becoming a fully fledged Matrix client… which launches and syncs over 5x faster than today's Riot/Android.  If you're particularly intrepid you should be able to run the app by checking out the project in Android Studio and hitting ‘run'. We expect the rewrite to land properly in the coming months - watch this space for progress!</p>
<h2 id="e2e-encryption">E2E Encryption</h2>
<p>One of the biggest projects this year has been to get E2E encryption out of beta and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/6779">turned on by default</a>.  Now, whilst the encryption itself in Matrix has been <a href="/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last/">cryptographically robust</a> since 2016 - its usability has been minimal at best, and we'd been running around polishing the underlying implementation rather than addressing the UX.  However, this year that changed, as we opened a war on about 6 concurrent battlefronts to address the remaining issues. These are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Holistic UX.  Designing a coherent, design-led UX across all of the encryption and key-management functionality.  Nad (who joined Matrix as a fulltime Lead UI/UX designer in August) has been leading the charge on this - you can see a <a href="/blog/2018/11/02/user-experience-preview-end-to-end-encryption-by-default/">preview of the end result</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here.  Meanwhile, Dave and Ryan are working through implementing it as we speak.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Decryption failures (UISIs).  Whenever something goes wrong with E2E encryption, the symptoms are generally the same: you find yourself unable to decrypt other people's messages.  We've been plugging away chasing these down - for instance, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/597">switching from localStorage to IndexedDB</a> in Riot/Web for storing encryption state (to make it harder for multiple tabs to collide and corrupt your encryption state); providing mechanisms to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/780">unwedge Olm sessions</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which have got corrupted (e.g. by restoring from backup); and many others.  We also added full telemetry to track the number of UISIs people are seeing in practice - and the good news is that over the course of the year their occurrence has been steadily reducing.  The bad news is that there are still some edge cases left: so please, whenever you fail to decrypt a message, please make sure you submit a bug report and debug logs from *both* the sender and receiving device.  The end is definitely in sight on these, however, and good news is other battlefronts will also help mitigate UISIs.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Incremental Key Backup.  Previously, if you only used one device (e.g. your phone) and you lost that phone, you would lose all your E2E history unless you were in the habit of explicitly manually backing up your keys.  Nowadays, we have the ability to optionally let users encrypt their keys with a passphrase (or recovery key) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1703">constantly upload them to the server</a> for safe keeping.  This was a significant chunk of work, but has actually <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/2169">landed already</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Riot/Web and Riot/iOS, but is hidden behind a “Labs” feature flag in Settings whilst we test it and sort out the final UX.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-signing Keys. Previously, the only way to check whether you were talking to a legitimate user or an imposter was to independently compare the fingerprints of the keys of the device they claim to be using.  In the near future, we will let users prove that they own their devices by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1756">signing them with a per-user identity key</a>, so you only have to do this check once. We've actually <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/795">already implemented</a> one iteration of cross-signing, but this <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1680">allowed arbitrary devices for a given user to attest each other</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which creates a directed graph of attestations, and associated problems with revocations), hence switching to a simpler approach.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Improved Verification. Verifying keys by manually comparing elliptic key fingerprints is incredibly cumbersome and tedious.  Instead, we have proposals for using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1267">Short Authentication String</a> comparisons and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1543">QR-code scanning</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to simplify the process.  uhoreg is currently implementing these as we speak :)
</span>
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Search.  Solving encrypted search is Hard, but t3chguy did a lot of work earlier in the year to build out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-search">matrix-search</a>: essentially a js-sdk bot which you can host, hand your keys to, and will archive your history using a golang full-text search engine (bleve) and expose a search interface that replaces Synapse's default one.  Of all the battlefronts this one is progressing the least right now, but the hope is to integrate it into Riot/Desktop or other clients so that folks who want to index all their conversations have the means to do so.  On the plus side, all the necessary building blocks are available thanks to t3chguy's hacking.
</li>
</ul>
So, TL;DR: E2E is hard, but the end is in sight thanks to a lot of blood, sweat and tears.  It's possible that we may have opened up too many battlefronts in finishing it off rather than landing stuff gradually.  But it should be transformative when it all lands - and we'll finally be able to turn it on by default for private conversations.  Again, we're aiming to pull this together by the end of January.
<p>Separately, we've been keeping a close eye on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/">MLS</a> - the IETF's activity around standardising scalable group E2E encryption.  MLS has a lot of potential and could provide algorithmic improvements over Olm &amp; Megolm (whist paving the way for interop with other MLS-encrypted comms systems).  But it's also quite complicated, and is at risk of designing out support of decentralised environments. For now, we're obviously focusing on ensuring that Matrix is rock solid with Olm &amp; Megolm, but once we hit that 1.0 we'll certainly be experimenting a bit with MLS too.</p>
<h2 id="homeservers">Homeservers</h2>
<p>The story of the Synapse team in 2018 has been one of alternating between solving scaling and performance issues to support the ever-growing network (especially the massive matrix.org server)... and dealing with S2S API issues; both in terms of fixing the design of State Resolution, Room Versioning etc (see the Spec section above) and doing stop-gap fixes to the current implementation.</p>
<p>Focusing on the performance side of things, the main wins have been:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Splitting yet more functionality out into worker processes which can scale independently of the master Synapse process.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet more profiling and optimisation (particularly caching).  Between this and the worker split-out we were able to resolve the performance ceiling that we hit over the summer, and as of right now matrix.org feels relatively snappy.
</span>
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lazy Loading Members.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="/blog/2018/12/21/porting-synapse-to-python-3/">Python 3</a>.  As everyone should have seen by now, Synapse is now Python 3 by default as of 0.34, which provides significant RAM and CPU improvements across the board as well as a path forwards given Python 2's planned demise at the end of 2019.  If you're not running your Synapse on Python 3 today, you are officially doing it wrong.
</li>
</ul>
There are also some major improvements which haven't fully landed yet:
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">State compression.  We have a new algorithm for storing room state which is ~10x more efficient than the current one.  We'll be migrating to it in by default in future. If you're feeling particularly intrepid you can actually <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/rust-synapse-compress-state">manually use it today</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (but we don't recommend it yet).
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Incremental state resolution.  Before we got sucked into redesigning state resolution in general, Erik came up with a <a href="/_matrix/media/v1/download/jki.re/ubNfLtrmXZMmlGjJZYPnlHHy">proof that it's possible to memoize state resolution</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and incrementally calculate it whenever state is resolved in a room rather than recalculate it from scratch each time (as is the current implementation).  This would be a significant performance improvement, given non-incremental state res can consume a lot of CPU (making everything slow down when there are lots of room extremities to resolve), and can consume a lot of RAM and has been one of the reasons that synapse's RAM usage can sometimes spike badly. The good news is that the new state res algorithm was designed to also work in this manner.  The bad news is that we haven't yet got back to implementing it yet, given the new algorithm is only just being rolled out now.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1229">Chunks</a>.  Currently, Synapse models all events in a room as being part of a single DAG, which can be problematic if you can see lots of disconnected sections of the DAG (e.g. due to intermittent connectivity somewhere in the network), as Synapse will frantically try to resolve all these disconnected sections of DAG together.  Instead, a better solution is to explicitly model these sections of DAG as separate entities called Chunks, and not try to resolve state between disconnected Chunks but instead consider them independent fragments of the room - and thus simplify state resolution calculations significantly. It also fixes an S2S API design flaw where previously we trusted the server to state the ordering (depth) of events they provided; with chunks, the receiving server can keep track of that itself by tracking a DAG of chunks (as well as the normal event DAG within the chunks).  Now, most of the work for this happened already, but is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3785">currently parked</a> until new state res has landed.
</li>
</ul>
Meanwhile, over on Dendrite, we made the conscious decision to get 1.0 out the door on Synapse first rather than trying to implement and iterate on the stuff needed for 1.0 on both Synapse & Dendrite simultaneously.  However, Dendrite has been ticking along thanks to work from Brendan, Anoa and APWhitehat - and the plan is to use it for more niche homeserver work at first; e.g. constrained resource devices (Dendrite uses 5-10x less RAM than Synapse on Py3), clientside homeservers, experimental routing deployments, etc.  In the longer term we expect it to grow into a fully fledged HS though!

<p>2018 was a bit of a renaissance for Bridging, largely thanks to Half-Shot coming on board in the Summer to work on IRC bridging and finally get to the bottom of the stability issues which plagued Freenode for the previous, uh, few years.  Meanwhile the Slack bridge got its first ever release - and more recently there's some Really Exciting Stuff happening with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a>; a properly usable bridge through to any protocol that libpurple can speak… and as of a few days ago also supports <em>native</em> XMPP bridging via XMPP.js.  There'll probably be a dedicated blogpost about all of this in the new year, especially when we deploy it all on Matrix.org. Until then, the best bet is to learn more is to watch <a href="https://youtu.be/B0faoVdw0ak">last week's Matrix Live</a> and hear it all first hand.</p>
<h2 id="modular">Modular</h2>
<p>One of the biggest newcomers of 2018 was the launch of <a href="https://modular.im">Modular.im</a> in October - the world's first commercial Matrix hosting service.  Whilst (like Riot), Modular isn't strictly-speaking a Matrix.org project - it feels appropriate to mention it here, not least because it's helping directly fund the core Matrix dev team.</p>
<p>So far Modular has seen a lot of interest from folks who want to spin up a super-speedy dedicated homeserver run by us rather than having to spend the time to build one themselves - or folks who have yet to migrate from IRC and want a better-than-IRC experience which still bridges well.  One of the nice bits is that the servers are still decentralised and completely operationally independent of one another, and there have been a bunch of really nice refinements since launch, including the ability to point your own DNS at the server; matrix-&gt;matrix migration tools; with custom branding and other goodness coming soon.  If you want one-click Matrix hosting, please give Modular a go :) </p>
<p>Right now we're promoting Modular mainly to existing Matrix users, but once the Riot redesign is finished you should expect to see some very familiar names popping up on the platform :D</p>
<h2 id="twim">TWIM</h2>
<p>Unless you were living under a rock, you'll hopefully have also realised that 2018 was the year that brought us <a href="/blog/category/general/this-week-in-matrix/">This Week In Matrix</a> (TWIM) - our very own blog tracking all the action across the whole Matrix community on a weekly basis.  Thank you to everyone who contributes updates, and to Ben for editing it each week. Go flip through the archives to find out what's been going on in the wider community over the course of the year!  (This blog post is already way too long without trying to cover the rest of the ecosystem too :)</p>
<h2 id="shapes-of-things-to-come">Shapes of Things to Come</h2>
<p>Finally, a little Easter egg (it is Christmas, after all) for anyone crazy enough to have read this far: The eagle-eyed amongst you might have noticed that one of our accepted talks for FOSDEM 2019 is “<a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/matrix/">Breaking the 100bps barrier with Matrix</a>” in the Real Time Communications devroom.  We don't want to spoil the full surprise, but here's a quick preview of some of the more exotic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project">skunkworks</a> we've been doing on low-bandwidth routing and transports recently.  Right now it shamelessly assumes that you're running within a trusted network, but once we solve that it will of course be be proposed as an MSC for Matrix proper.  A full write-up and code will follow, but for now, here's a mysterious video…</p>

<h2 id="2019">2019</h2>
<p>So, what will 2019 bring?</p>
<p>In the short term, as should be obvious from the above, our focus is on:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">r0 spec releases across the board (aka Matrix 1.0)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing them in Synapse
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Landing the Riot redesign
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Landing all the new E2E encryption UX and features
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Finalising the Matrix.org Foundation
</li>
</ul>
However, beyond that, there's a lot of possible options on the table in the medium term:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reworking and improving Communities/Groups.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reactions.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">E2E-encrypted Search
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Filtering. (empowering users to filter out rooms & content they're not interested in).
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Extensible events.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Editable messages.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Extensible Profiles (we've actually been experimenting with this already).
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Threading.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Landing the Riot/Android rewrite
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Scaling synapse via sharding the master process
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Bridge UI for discovery of users/rooms and bridge status
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Considering whether to do a similar overhaul of Riot/iOS
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Bandwidth-efficient transports
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Bandwidth-efficient routing
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Getting Dendrite to production.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Inline widgets (polls etc)
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Improving VoIP over Matrix.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adding more bridges, and improving the current ones..
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Account portability
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing MXIDs with public keys
</li>
</ul>
In the longer term, options include:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Shared-code cross-platform client SDKs (e.g. sharing a native core library between matrix-{'{'}js,ios,android{'}'}-sdk)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Matrix daemons (e.g. running an always-on client as a background process in your OS which apps can connect to via a lightweight CS API)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Push notifications via Matrix (using a daemon-style architecture)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Clientside homeservers (i.e. p2p matrix) - e.g. compiling Dendrite to WASM and running it in a service worker.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Experimenting with MLS for E2E Encryption
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Storing and querying more generic data structures in Matrix (e.g. object trees; scene graphs)
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Alternate use cases for VR, IoT, etc.
</li>
</ul>
Obviously we're not remotely going to do all of that in 2019, but this serves to give a taste of the possibilities on the menu post-1.0; we'll endeavour to publish a more solid roadmap when we get to that point.
<p>And on that note, it's time to call this blogpost to a close. Thanks to anyone who read this far, and thank you, as always, for flying Matrix and continuing to support the project.  The next few months should be particularly fun; all the preparation of 2018 will finally pay off :)</p>
<p>Happy holidays,</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix.org team.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400">It's been a long-standing goal to enable end-to-end encryption by default for private communication in Matrix. The technical effort so far has included </span>
<a href="/docs/guides/e2e_implementation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">our libolm library</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span>
<a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/matrix-olm-cryptographic-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400">an independent cryptographic review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span>
<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/6779"><span style="font-weight: 400">a massive backlog of feature development and bug fixes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Today, instead I'd like to focus on some of the User Experience challenges and goals we're facing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should also introduce myself—I'm Nad Chishtie (</span>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nadonomy:matrix.org"><span style="font-weight: 400">@nadonomy:matrix.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">) and I recently joined the Matrix core team (at New Vector) as Lead Designer, most recently focusing on end-to-end encryption.</span></p>
<p>When using encrypted messages, most existing services fall short in one or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">They don't allow you to use multiple devices independently. For example, a web session might be locally tethered to a mobile device.</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">They don't support a way to restore or temporarily access message history. For example, if you don't have physical access to your main device because it's broken or has been stolen.</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">They don't allow you to verify that devices are controlled by their owners rather than eavesdroppers, and persist that trust across multiple devices, sessions or rooms.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Modern users, even those we talk to at security and privacy-led organisations, expect these features to 'just work' by default out of the box. Before enabling end-to-end encryption by default, we've been hard at work figuring out how we can deliver these features without compromising security or usability.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(For some users, restrictions such as limiting the number of places encryption keys reside, and not having a synchronised message history may be desirable </span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400">security features.</span>
</i><span style="font-weight: 400"> We'll support these cases, but just not as the default behaviour.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let's dive in to some of the fundamental concepts we'll be putting forward to deliver a default end-to-end encryption experience that makes sense for most modern users. In this post we'll look at an overview of</span>
<b> work-in-progress wireframes</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, in the spirit of designing in the open and gathering feedback from the wider Matrix community. Please note that these don't represent the actual interface design.</span></p>
<h2 id="cross-signing-personal-devices">Cross-signing personal devices</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Cross-signing.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3708 size-large" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Cross-signing-1024x576.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When logging in to a new device, you'll be able to use an existing device to verify your new one. Verification is done by </span>
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1543"><span style="font-weight: 400">scanning a QR code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on whichever device has the most convenient camera to use, or by </span>
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1267"><span style="font-weight: 400">comparing a short text string</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. You only have to complete this process once to mutually verify both devices.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1680"><span style="font-weight: 400">Verifying your new device by cross-signing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> transfers encryption keys, giving it access to your encrypted messages, and also signals to other users that the new device is trustworthy.</span></p>
<h2 id="secure-message-recovery">Secure Message Recovery</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Secure-Message-Recovery.gif.gif"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3725" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Secure-Message-Recovery.gif.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To the end user, Secure Message Recovery works a lot like setting up disk encryption or a password manager. A user can optionally secure their message history using a recovery passphrase and/or key. If logged out, or using another device, the user can use the recovery passphrase or key to access their encrypted message history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In practise, this </span>
<a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/5675"><span style="font-weight: 400">incrementally encrypts and backs up encryption keys to a user's homeserver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, kept secure by the homeserver never having access to the passphrase or key. Like cross-signing, using a recovery passphrase or key will also signal to other users that a device is trustworthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We think that in most cases users will cross-sign personal devices, but as a safety net (for example, if a user's devices are broken or lost) Secure Message Recovery is an invaluable tool for users to minimise the chance of them losing their encrypted message history.
</span></p>
<h2 id="people-should-trust-people">People should trust people</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Verification.gif"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3726" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Verification.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With both cross-signing and Secure Message Recovery in place, we think that people should trust people, instead of individual devices. Now, when you verify a device, it'll mark all of that users trusted devices as trusted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gone are the days of every person you talk to having to independently verify your new device upgrade. Like cross-signing, you can verify a device by scanning a QR code or comparing a short text string.</span></p>
<h2 id="sensible-and-extensible">Sensible and extensible</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Settings.gif"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3727" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/E2E-UX-Settings.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Riot, we're implementing these features with a sensible default experience that strikes a balance between usability and security. We think most people would prefer to trust cross-signed devices, and that user trust shouldn't block encryption. However, if you aren't most people, you'll be free to configure whatever level of security you need.
</span></p>
<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With all of the above in place, and after resolving any remaining technical issues, users will be able to:</span></p>
<ul>
 	<li>Use end-to-end encryption by default in private rooms.</li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Use an existing device or Secure Message Recovery to access their encrypted message history on multiple devices, and to signal device trust to other users.</span>
</li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Access their encrypted message history using Secure Message Recovery, by storing encrypted message keys on their homeserver.</span>
</li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Mark a user as trusted by verifying one of their devices, persisting across all rooms and devices.</span>
</li>
 	<li>Keep their encrypted messages out of the hands of eavesdroppers.</li>
 	<li>Opt out, or further configure if they have more specific security requirements.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400">There's more nuance to making all this work than we can cover in this overview post; things like recovery key management and immutable security notifications are all important pieces of the puzzle. For further reading, we're filling up more detail in </span>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Back in June we blogged about <a href="/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/">the plan of action to establish a formal open governance system</a> for the Matrix protocol: introducing both the idea of the Spec Core Team to act as the neutral technical custodian of the Matrix Spec, as well as confirming the plan to incorporate the Matrix.org Foundation to act as a neutral non-profit legal entity which can act as the legal Guardian for Matrix's intellectual property, gather donations to fund Matrix work, and be legally responsible for maintaining and evolving the spec in a manner which benefits the whole ecosystem without privileging any individual commercial concerns.  We published a draft proposal for the new governance model at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318">MSC1318: a proposal for open governance of the Matrix.org Spec</a> to gather feedback and to trial during the <a href="/docs/spec/proposals">day-to-day development of the spec</a>. Otherwise, we refocused on getting a 1.0 release of the Spec out the door, given there's not much point in having a fancy legal governance process to safeguard the evolution of the Spec when we don't even have a stable initial release!</p>
<p>We were originally aiming for end of August to publish a stable release of all Matrix APIs (and thus a so-called 1.0 of the overall standard) - and in the end we managed to <a href="/blog/2018/09/03/matrix-spec-update-august-2018/">publish stable releases of 4 of the 5 APIs</a> (Client-Server, Application Service, Identity Service and Push APIs) as well as a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/commits/master/specification/server_server_api.rst">major overhaul</a> of the Server-Server (SS) API.  However, the SS API work has run on much longer than expected, as we've ended up both redesigning and needing to implement many major changes to to the protocol: the new State Resolution algorithm (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1442">State Resolution Reloaded</a>) to fix state resets; versioned rooms (in order to upgrade to the new algorithm); changing event IDs to be hashes; and fixing a myriad federation bugs in Synapse.  Now, the remaining work is progressing steadily (you can see the progress over at <a href="https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/2">https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/2</a> - although some of the cards are redacted because they refer to non-spec consulting work) - and <strong>the end is in sight</strong>!</p>
<p>So, in preparation for the upcoming Matrix 1.0 release, we've been moving ahead with the rest of the open governance plan - and we're happy to announce that as of a few hours ago,<strong> the initial incarnation of The Matrix.org Foundation exists!</strong></p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Certificate.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3691" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Certificate-723x1024.png" alt="" width="496" height="702" /></a></p>
<p>Now, it's important to understand that <strong>this process is not finished </strong>- what we've done is to set up a solid initial basis for the Foundation in order to finish refining <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318">MSC1318</a> and turning it into the full Articles of Association of the Foundation (i.e. the legal framework which governs the remit of the Foundation), which we'll be working on over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>In practice, what this means is that in the first phase, today's Foundation gives us:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>A UK <strong>non-profit company</strong> - technically incorporated as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_company_limited_by_guarantee">private company, limited by guarantee</a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Guardians</strong>, whose role is to be legally responsible for ensuring that the Foundation (and by extension the Spec Core Team) keeps on mission and neutrally protects the development of Matrix.  Matrix's Guardians form the Board of Directors of the Foundation, and will provide a 'checks and balances' mechanism between each other to ensure that all Guardians act in the best interests of the protocol and ecosystem.<br/ ><br />For the purposes of initially setting up the Foundation, the initial Guardians are Matthew & Amandine - but in the coming weeks we're expecting to appoint at least three independent Guardians in order to ensure that the current team form a minority on the board and ensure the neutrality of the Foundation relative to Matthew & Amandine's day jobs at New Vector.The profile we're looking for in Guardians are: folks who are independent of the commercial Matrix ecosystem (and especially independent from <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a>), and may even not be members of today's Matrix community, but who are deeply aligned with the mission of the project, and who are respected and trusted by the wider community to uphold the guiding principles of the Foundation and keep the other Guardians honest.</li>
 	<li>An immutable <strong>asset lock</strong>, to protect the intellectual property of the Foundation and prevent it from ever being sold or transferred elsewhere.</li>
 	<li>An immutable <strong>mission lock</strong>, which defines the Foundation's mission as a non-profit neutral guardian of the Matrix standard, with an initial formal goal of finalising the open governance process.  To quote article 4 from the initial Articles of Association:
<ul>
 	<li>
<div class="page" title="Page 8">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">4. The objects of the Foundation are for the benefit of the community as a whole to:</div>
<div class="column">
<p>4.1.1  empower users to control their communication data and have freedom over their communications infrastructure by creating, maintaining and promoting Matrix as an openly standardised secure decentralised communication protocol and network, open to all, and available to the public for no charge;</p>
</div>
</div>
4.1.2  build and develop an appropriate governance model for Matrix through the Foundation, in order to drive the adoption of Matrix as a single global federation, an open standard unencumbered from any proprietary intellectual property and/or software patents, minimising fragmentation (whilst encouraging experimentation), maximising speed of development, and prioritising the long-term success and growth of the overall network over the commercial concerns of an individual person or persons.
</div></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>You can read the initial <a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Constitution.pdf">Articles of Association</a> here (although all the rest of it is fairly generic legal boilerplate for a non-profit company at this point which hasn't yet been tuned; the Matrix-specific stuff is Article 4 as quoted above).  You can also see the initial details of the Foundation straight from the horse's mouth over at <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11648710">https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11648710</a>.</li>
</ul>
Then, in the <strong>next and final phase</strong>, what remains is to:
<ul>
 	<li>Appoint 3+ more Guardians (see above).</li>
 	<li>Finalise<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318"> MSC1318</a> and incorporate the appropriate bits into the Articles of Associations (AoA).  (We might literally edit MSC1318 directly into the final AoA, to incorporate as much input as possible from the full community)</li>
 	<li>Tune the boilerplate bits of the AoA to incorporate the conclusions of<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318"> MSC1318</a>.</li>
 	<li>Register the Foundation as a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-regulator-of-community-interest-companies">Community Interest Company</a>, to further anchor the Foundation as being for the benefit of the wider community.</li>
 	<li>Perform an Asset Transfer of any and all Matrix.org property from New Vector to the Foundation (especially the Matrix.org domain and branding, and donations directed to Matrix.org).</li>
</ul>
So there you have it! It's been a long time in coming, and huge thanks to everyone for their patience and support in getting to this point, but finally The Matrix.org Foundation exists.  Watch this space over the coming weeks as we announce the Guardians and finish bootstrapping the Foundation into its final long-term form!  Meanwhile, any questions: come ask in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org</a> or in the blog comments here.
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine, and the forthcoming Guardians of [the] Matrix!</p>

                <p>Guest post today from <a href="https://giveth.io/">Giveth</a>: <em>Giveth is re-engineering charitable giving, by creating an entirely free, open-source platform, built on the Ethereum Blockchain. Our system cuts out bureaucracy and enables nonprofits to create a high level of transparency and accountability towards Givers.</em></p>

<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/giveth1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3629" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/giveth1.png" alt="" width="901" height="253" /></a></p>
<p><i>Giveth's new chatbot in action!
</i></p>
<p>Online or offline, joining a new community always requires some adjustment. Even the most open, inclusive communities have shared knowledge and shared practices which new members learn as they participate. </p>
<p>I recently joined <a href="https://giveth.io">Giveth's</a> Riot community, where the majority of Giveth's communication occurs. Immediately upon joining, I received the message pictured above from the Giveth Bot, kindly encouraging me to download Riot mobile and change my notifications to mention-only. The bot shortened my adjustment period by giving me key tidbits of information that everyone in Giveth's community knows, but that may have taken me time to pick up on my own. This blog post will cover how the Giveth Bot came to be, what it is capable of, and where the project is headed in the future. </p>
<p>The Giveth Bot actually started out as an attempt to solve a completely different problem: helping Giveth efficiently distribute internal reward points. Giveth's system for rewarding people who meaningfully contribute to the project is called RewardDAO. “If someone contributes in a meaningful way, a core contributor from each of the Giveth Campaigns can dish them points to recognize the contribution”, describes <a href="https://medium.com/@cle0">Cleo</a> in an article explaining <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/how-rewarddao-works-aka-what-are-points-7388f70269a">how RewardDAO works</a>. At the end of each month, contributors receive Ether based on how many points they have earned.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/giveth2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3626" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/giveth2-1024x246.png" alt="" width="1024" height="246" /></a></p>
<p><i>The Giveth RewardDAO motto. Photo from https://medium.com/giveth.
</i></p>
<p>However, any time that a core contributor dished points to someone, they had to record who received the points, and how many, on a spreadsheet. In search of a better way, Giveth opened up the project of automating this system to the <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-social-coding-fa81feacfa32">social coding hub</a>, a community of altruistic developers looking to tackle impactful and interesting projects, offering a 2 eth bounty for a solution.</p>
<p>A lot of great work was submitted, and ultimately Deam's (
<a href="https://twitter.com/deamlabs">@deamlabs</a>) code was chosen to power the bot and the code for the pointsbot itself was further developed and refined by <a href="https://github.com/FrederikBolding">Frederik Bolding</a>. Now, by using a command of the form “!dish [number] [type] points to [contributor] for [contribution]”, Giveth core contributors can distribute points as needed, and the bot will automatically update the spreadsheet accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/giveth3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3628" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/giveth3.png" alt="" width="918" height="520" /></a></p>
<p><i>The Giveth Bot dishing points like a champion! 
</i></p>
<p>Once the bot's framework was established, chatbot features were added. In addition to the welcome message I received, the bot gives custom welcome messages in each of Giveth's different rooms, allows Matrix users to have 1-on-1 chats with it, and listens for keywords and sentences it recognizes in rooms and private chats. Riot is built on top of an open-source protocol called Matrix. Matrix has a javascript standard development kit (SDK), which the bot uses to detect events occurring in each of the Riot rooms and chats that it is a part of.</p>
<p>Giveth began by using Slack, but switched to Riot to support Matrix's decentralized, open-source model, which which aligns far more with Giveth's own business model and values. The Giveth Bot is a great example of how Matrix enables users to build their own solutions to problems. In the future, we hope that the Giveth Bot will be able to interact directly with the Ethereum Blockchain, and that more analytics and measurement tools can be incorporated. And of course, we welcome any and all feedback on the Giveth Bot!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Since we created Matrix.org back in 2014, the majority of the Matrix core team has worked for the same company - originally subsidiaries of Amdocs, and then since August 2017 for New Vector; the startup we incorporated to rehire the core team and support Matrix after we parted ways from Amdocs.</p>
<p>Despite working for a for-profit company, our prime directive has <b>always</b> been the long term mission to successfully run Matrix as a non-profit initiative for the benefit of the whole internet: to create a ubiquitous secure open network which gives users control back over their communication and avoids them ever being locked into silos again.  And even though Matrix.org hasn't been a formal non-profit foundation, we've treated it as such in all respects (e.g. gathering donations to support development on Matrix)</p>
<p>Running Matrix.org as a non-profit means prioritising to neutrally support all players in the whole ecosystem without ever giving unfair advantage to any individual participant (particularly New Vector) - where that ecosystem includes end-users, client devs, testers, spec devs, server admins, companies building products on Matrix, bridge devs, bot devs, widget devs, server devs, distro maintainers, moderators, even end-users who are using Matrix indirectly via bridges.</p>
<p>That being said, having the core team work for the same startup is still a somewhat unorthodox model for an open source project building an open standard, so we'd like to explain the main reasons for doing it up to this point:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure that Matrix is fit for real-world usage and to force us to dogfood it. To ensure that it is a protocol that works well enough that you can build a commercial startup around it if you so wanted, and to motivate us to build Matrix as something more than an academic or nerdy exercise in protocol design - rather one which can be commercially viable.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To help ensure the core team is aligned and pulling towards the same goal, especially during the process of actually designing and “giving birth” to the initial protocol and getting it to an ‘r0' release across all APIs.  We strongly believe that when a project is in the design phase you get faster and better design from a bunch of people who are collaborating together towards the same goal, rather than independent factions who might pursue their own agendas at the expense of the overall project.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Because we believe the value of Matrix lies in the size of the ecosystem, and if Matrix realises its full potential (i.e. it grows as big as the web), it only makes it more useful and valuable for *everyone*. We realise that it might be a leap of faith to believe that we don't have any incentive to sabotage Matrix by privileging specific players (after all, there are so many companies out there in it just for the cash), but the fact is that this is where we stand, and we're doing our best to prove it. To spell it out: it is in New Vector's interest (and also in the interests of other Matrix-focused companies) to grow Matrix to be as big, open, unfragmented and as neutral as possible.  Matrix should be big enough for a multitude of wildly successful companies and projects to benefit from it, and everyone wins - just like the web.</li>
</ul>
<b>However</b>, this approach is not perfect and comes with some major problems:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Without clear separation of responsibilities and incentives, we have to ask the community to take it on faith that our efforts are never intended to privilege New Vector ahead of the wider ecosystem. This leaves room for doubt, especially when our reasoning is unclear or our conclusions controversial.<br />A good example of a controversial decision is the lack of investment by the core team in the Server-Server API.  For the last ~2 years (since Mar 2016) we made the judgement call to prioritise user-facing features and experience.  The rationale was that to grow Matrix we need to provide a viable alternative to Slack/Discord/WhatsApp etc, and doing that means providing a Client-Server API which lets clients do just that, and server implementations capable of running at scale. This is why the CS API has had a stable release since Dec 2015 (currently at r0.3.0) and why we've put so much effort into server scaling/perf... but the SS API itself still has bugs and has still not yet made it to a stable release.<br />This is obviously incredibly frustrating to server devs who tried to implement the SS API despite it being unstable and unreleased. In retrospect it might have been a mistake and we could probably have turned off signup on matrix.org and diverted the resources to the SS API work instead.  However, this is a case of making the judgement call to prioritising the overall ecosystem over one class of stakeholders (server devs) by focusing on providing users usable and featureful decentralised communication apps. Indeed we strongly believe that users are the main means to grow the ecosystem (others have failed without them): no one joins a network with no friends, however popular it is among devs.  Nonetheless, we are finally in a position to <a href="/blog/2018/06/15/this-week-in-matrix-2018-06-15/">hire spec maintainers and get to a stable S2S</a> as fast as we possibly can, and frankly feel relieved to be able to unblock this situation.<br />Another good example is the recent <a href="/blog/2018/06/14/security-update-synapse-0-31-2/">0.31.2 security update</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Synapse: this was a defensive patch to the protocol that we added to ensure that even if bugs occur when authing events over federation, it should be impossible for a random user to ever hijack a room again.  We specced this out as a formal proposal and are gathering feedback, but expedited implementation in Synapse to protect the overall ecosystem. However, it turns out that the change breaks a small number of highly custom rooms, and so we find ourselves accused of privileging NV.  The reality is that we made a judgement call to protect the vast majority of today's ecosystem (and hope to provide a longer-term fix in the relatively near future which /will/ be compatible with more custom room use cases).
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another problem is some companies find it a turn-off to participate in Matrix unless they have a well-defined process for influencing the direction of the protocol.  Now, sometimes this could be seen as a feature rather than a bug; the last thing the ecosystem needs is a greedy corp trying to subvert the protocol to its own competitive advantage, and we don't want to be locked in that kind of battle either.  However, there are also lots of well-meaning and constructive companies who want to participate too, and there's an argument that they want a well-defined process for doing so.
</span>
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The other main problem is simply one of checks & balances.  Even though NV may be a good guardian today, what if something changed in future? e.g. if NV got bought by Microsoft, or if someone on the team had some crisis and changed priorities?  Whilst one could always fork, such things are incredibly disruptive and fragmenting and it'd be good to engineer Matrix.org's governance to be resilient to such eventualities as much as is possible.
</li>
</ul>
To address these problems, in March of this year we started work on a long term proposal to establish an open governance model for Matrix which ensures the neutrality of the protocol, lets the community contribute as widely as possible, and incorporates a dedicated neutral non-profit Matrix.org Foundation separate to New Vector.
<p>As work progressed on the proposal, it became clear that actually transitioning to a new governance model would seriously slow down the sprint towards a stable r0 release. We therefore decided to put completing the governance model on hold until after the r0 release (scheduled for the end of August).</p>
<p>With the end of r0 now in sight, completing work on the governance model is back on the agenda. We obviously want to ensure that the proposed governance model is going to work for everyone, so we'd like to introduce the first draft of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vASIt2v0UwKnUKHNEjA_P3SFCM0kcIUl1LQyM--ax04/edit#">Matrix Spec Change 1318: a proposal for open governance of the Matrix.org Spec</a>. This is quite an early draft; the idea is to gather feedback over the next few months and we'll then incorporate the Foundation and deploy the new governance model to coincide with the long-awaited stable release of all APIs of the Matrix Spec (assuming the release doesn't slip).</p>
<p>The main points in the proposal are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To adopt the new governance model once all APIs have had a stable r0 release.  For S2S API, this means fixing the remaining flaws in the federation protocol and closing the spec omissions such that compliant independent implementations can be written purely based on the spec.  For the AS and IS and Push API it means just closing spec omissions (if any) and doing a final review.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To define the mission of Matrix: to return control of communication to users by building a standards-based open secure decentralised communication network.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To define the mandate of the core team to act as a neutral custodian of the Matrix Spec, prioritising the long-term success and growth of the overall network over individual commercial concerns.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To define the guiding principles of the core team, e.g. collaboration rather than competition and contrarianism.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To restructure the core team to incorporate members of the community as well as the founding core team.
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To propose succession logistics for the core team
</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">To propose the role and governance structure of the Matrix.org Foundation legal entity.
</li>
</ul>
Feedback would be much appreciated on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vASIt2v0UwKnUKHNEjA_P3SFCM0kcIUl1LQyM--ax04/edit#">MSC1318 Google Doc</a> - or come talk about it on 
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org">#matrix-spec-process:matrix.org</a> (which we might as well use for governance too).
<p>It's exciting times as we finally move towards an initial stable release of Matrix across all APIs - we are firmly on the road to a 1.0, and improving our governance model is a massive part of that process.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the core team.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We just rushed out an urgent hotfix release for Synapse 0.26.1, addressing a nasty bug in the ujson library which causes it to misbehave badly in the presence of JSON containing very large &gt;64-bit integers.  Anyone whose synapses are currently filling up with &quot;Value too big!&quot; errors will want to upgrade immediately from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.26.1">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.26.1</a>.</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<h3 id="changes-in-synapse-v0-26-1-2018-03-15">Changes in synapse v0.26.1 (2018-03-15)</h3>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Fix bug where an invalid event caused server to stop functioning correctly, due to parsing and serializing bugs in ujson library.</li>
</ul>
