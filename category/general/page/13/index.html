<p>Both the recording equipment and the video team volunteers were new this year, so some problems were encountered, which means that our lightning talk video unfortunately was lost. However, our talk in the IoT-devroom is now available:</p>

                <p>Heads up that we released Synapse 0.8.1 a little while back, but we've all been too busy writing software to announce it... you know how it goes. Anyway, here are the changes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Disable registration by default. New users can be added using the included <code>register_new_matrix_user</code> script or by enabling registration in the config.</li>
	<li>Add metrics to synapse. To enable metrics use config options <code>enable_metrics</code> and <code>metrics_port</code>.</li>
	<li>Fix bug where banning only kicked the user.</li>
</ul>
Note that first one in particular: if you set up a new install, you won't be able to register new users using the API by default. This means random people on the Internet can't create accounts on your Home Server unless you actually choose to let them. Also, if you were trying to ban users and noticed that didn't work... yeah, we fixed that.
<p>Okay, back to writing software again!</p>

                <p>Last week, we mentioned that we released part of a first implementation of the long awaited <a title="Application Service (AS) API" href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api">Application Service (AS) API</a> as part of the <a title="Synapse 0.7.1 released – with Application Service API" href="http://matrix.org/blog/2015/02/19/synapse-0-7-1-released-with-application-service-api/">0.7.1 release</a>. The AS API makes it dead simple to connect your service into the Matrix ecosystem using an existing standard Matrix server.</p>
<p>And today we're very excited that the first implementation using this API has gone live! <a title="OpenMarket" href="http://openmarket.com">OpenMarket</a> just announced the <a title="OpenMarket Matrix Gateway" href="http://www.openmarket.com/matrix/">OpenMarket Matrix Gateway</a> which lets you chat with non-Matrix users via their phone number: as you send and receive instant messages from your Matrix chat room, they'll receive and send SMSes back to you, which will appear in your Matrix room as IM, extending your reach to any non-Matrix user.</p>
<p>To use the new OpenMarket service just login to the matrix.org <a title="webclient" href="/beta/">webclient</a> and start a chat with your target mobile phone user by identifying him/her with a Matrix ID in the format <em>@+&lt;msisdn&gt;:matrix.openmarket.com</em> (msisdn being the internationally formatted phone number of your contact) - any messages to them will be sent via OpenMarket's SMS service. The SMSes will be sent from dynamically assigned numbers so that the recipient is able to respond to your message(s) - and the user will first receive an &quot;opt-in&quot; message from the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway to invite them to the conversation (just as they would if you invited them to a conversation in Matrix). Note that there are a finite set of these dynamically assigned numbers: OpenMarket reserves the right to recycle contact numbers if they have not been used to send or receive traffic for more than 2 months.</p>
<p>Sending SMS through the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway will be free during the introductory beta testing period, and users will be warned when that changes - although usage is subject to a per-user fair-usage policy. Despite the free service today, you'll have to associate a valid PayPal account to your account in order to send messages for security purposes. OpenMarket will not (and cannot) charge this account without your consent. You can associate your PayPal account via the settings page of any reference Matrix web client which has been configured to be aware of the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway - for example, the matrix.org <a title="webclient" href="/beta/#/settings">webclient</a>.</p>
<p>You'll also have to accept the OpenMarket Matrix API End User License Agreement to use the service.</p>
<p>The OpenMarket Matrix Gateway is a great example of how the Application Service API can be used to extend Matrix, we're really happy to see it live and hope it's going to give our community lots of ideas! There are a lot of services that could mutually benefit from being integrated with Matrix, and the AS API makes this much easier to accomplish!</p>
<p>Thus, we strongly urge you to have a look at the <a title="AS API" href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api">AS API</a> - and as always we are happy to answer any questions at <a title="#matrix:matrix.org" href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a>!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We released Synapse 0.7.1 this morning - <strong>This release includes more critical federation stability and performance updates - please upgrade as soon as you can!</strong>.  You can get the code and installation instructions from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a> as normal.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> You can also install and run Synapse now via <a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a>, thanks to a Dockerfile at <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/silviof/docker-matrix/">https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/silviof/docker-matrix/</a> contributed today by Silvio Fricke.  Thanks Silvio!!</p>
<p>Other than the federation improvements, the big new feature that lands here is the long-awaited Application Service API.  This is a set of simple extensions to the Client-Server API to make it much easier to build powerful gateways and other application logic on top of Matrix.  You can think of it being somewhere between IRC Services, IMS application services and XMPP components - but with the simplicity of an IRC bot.  The extensions let you register application services as privileged Matrix clients, and create virtual users and virtual rooms in bulk within Matrix (e.g. bridging an entire IRC network into Matrix).  The API also lets your application service receive inbound events as HTTP pushes rather than having to poll.  The end result is that it's suddenly become <strong>a lot</strong> easier to bridge existing communities with Matrix!</p>
<p>We'll post another blog post shortly to give a lot more information; in the interim you can read more about it in the newly updated spec at <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api">http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="http://fosdem.org" title="FOSDEM">FOSDEM</a> was great fun! Two days full of conferences and demos; lots of interesting technologies and interested people - and most of all: talking to so many new faces about Matrix and potential uses and integration ideas. </p>
<p>Both our lightning talk and IoT-devroom talk were completely filled up with huge queues outside (sorry folks), and our demos seemed to go down fairly well.  In fact several people <a href="/code">set up their own homeserver</a> and joined the federated network of Matrix servers during FOSDEM itself!</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/561535884567130112" title="view from our stand">view from our stand</a>, from our <a href="http://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/561543011662696448" title="lightning talk">lightning talk</a> and from our <a href="http://twitter.com/thierrymarianne/status/561828001231695872" title="IoT-devroom talk">IoT-devroom talk</a>.</p>
<p>If you missed the talks, recordings will (soon) be available from the FOSDEM site (links will be added here once available) - in the meantime you can check out the slides here: <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-31-Matrix_FOSDEM.pdf" title="lightning talk">lightning talk</a> and <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-01-Matrix-IoT-FOSDEM.pdf" title="IoT-devroom talk">IoT-devroom talk</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who came to have a chat about Matrix and/or help with setting up their own homeserver (or to play with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyIw2AkYpeo">Sentinel, our mascot</a>) - please do reach out to us via our <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="Matrix HQ room">Matrix HQ room</a> or IRC (<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/matrix">#matrix on freenode</a>) if you have any problems - or want to help us fix our python packaging ;)  Now is a great time to get involved as we are currently landing new APIs and soon will be offering an Application Server API to ease bridging to other services.</p>

                <p>This weekend, Matrix is heading to FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting) in Brussels, Belgium. We will be hosting two events: a <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/matrix/" title="lightning talk">lightning talk</a> on Saturday at 16:30 in room H.2215 (Ferrer), and an <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/deviot04/" title="IoT devroom talk">IoT devroom talk</a> on Sunday morning at 11:00 in room H.2213.</p>
<p>FOSDEM's <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/" title="schedule">schedule</a> is looking very interesting and varied, and we hope we can learn about interesting projects - and of course show how and where Matrix can be used to lots of FOSDEM-attendees. Please come over and have a chat if you are interested; we have a stand on the second floor in the K building - just take a right after coming up the stairs and say hi! </p>
<p>We have also set up a Matrix &lt;-&gt; IRC bridge on the #fosdem channel on freenode, which means that any conversation happening there will be copied over to <a href="/beta/#/room/#fosdem:matrix.org" title="#fosdem:matrix.org">#fosdem:matrix.org</a> - and vice versa. Making bridges to other services is currently being worked on as part of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/application-services/drafts/application_services.rst" title="Application Services API">Application Services API</a> - we want to be able to connect different services together via Matrix.</p>
<p>Finally, we are always available in the official <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="Matrix HQ room">Matrix HQ room</a> - please join and say hi!</p>

                <p>Some updates on the conferences Matrix attended over the last 3 weeks: WebRTC Summit in Santa Clara, TAD Summit in Istanbul, WebRTC World West in San José and fOSSa in Rennes. Great shows, ending in lots of interesting discussions and new excitement in Matrix!</p>
<h2 id="webrtc-summit-santa-clara-november-4-6">WebRTC Summit (Santa Clara, November 4-6)</h2>
<p>Matrix was a <a href="http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/3242708">sponsor</a> at the Santa Clara <a href="http://webrtcsummit.net/">WebRTC Summit</a> at CloudExpo, and opened the WebRTC track alongside our friends at <a href="http://www.openpeer.org">Open Peer / Hookflash</a>. Matthew presented Matrix as the missing signalling layer for WebRTC and as a good federated complement to MQTT and COAP for IoT use cases: you can find his presentation <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-03-Matrix_Missing-Link_IOT.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Great techie discussions and debates down there, the stand was flooded with interested people and John had a hardtime answering everyone by himself on day 2!</p>
<p>But he still found a few minutes to do a TV interview for SYSCon TV on Tuesday evening! :)</p>

<h2 id="tad-summit-istanbul-november-12-13">TAD Summit (Istanbul, November 12-13)</h2>
<p>Matrix was a partner at <a href="http://tadsummit.com/2014/">TAD Summit</a> in Istanbul this year, a great opportunity to meet a very good mix of developers, industry players and mobile networks! TAD mixes conferences and technical workshops where everyone gets involved to create a vibrant ecosystem for Telecom Application Developers. Again really productive discussions and meetings as we continue our search for partners to help support the uptake of Matrix.</p>
<p>Matthew's talk was fully recorded so just watch the video to get the real pitch!</p>

<h2 id="webrtc-world-san-jose-november-18-20">WebRTC World (San Jose, November 18-20)</h2>
<p>Matrix's attendance at <a href="http://www.webrtcworld.com/conference/west/default.aspx">WebRTC World</a> in San Jose was more rewarding than expected! The team was ready to be part of the expo and give a talk on FOSS WebRTC options... but didn't hesitate to jump at the opportunity when a demo slot opened up! And that was a worthwhile decision as Matrix ended up winning not one but<strong> TWO awards from the demo:</strong> The <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Audience Choice Award</strong></span>
as the audience's favourite demo of the 10 shown on Tuesday, and also the overall <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Best Social Integration Award</strong> </span>
from the Jury! So a big congrats to the dev team who were rushing to get the fine details ready in time and to Matthew for getting the audience's attention! And of course a even bigger thank you to everyone who voted for us, including in the Jury!</p>

<p>Of course this drew lots of interest, and WebRTC Expo ended up the busiest show ever for the team who pitched solidly at the booth for 2 days in a row!</p>

<h2 id="fossa-rennes-november-20">fOSSa (Rennes, November 20)</h2>
<p>And eventually, while Matthew and John were celebrating in San José (or flying home, more accurately), Amandine was also evangelising at home in Rennes (France), where <a href="https://fossa.inria.fr/">fOSSa </a>was gathering experts from the opensource world for 3 days. Matrix was presented within the Serendipity section on the conférence, &quot;Le Carrefour des Possibles&quot;: 6 minutes to pitch an open project that making dreams possible.</p>
<p>So if you speak French or are not afraid to only read from <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-17.2-Matrix.pdf">the slides</a>, check out the video the team made of the pitch. The official one should be available soon!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>There's been loads of work going on in various branches on Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/federation_authorization">federation_authorization</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/event_signing">event_signing</a>) as we land the final features needed for Synapse to be used in production as a Matrix reference server.  Meanwhile the iOS demo client and SDK has been coming on leaps and bounds too over at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk</a>.</p>
<p>However, stuff has also been happening on the main Synapse development branch too, and we've just released 0.4.2 onto master for lots of various goodies - see release notes below.</p>
<p>Please upgrade your homeservers and play with the new client - the new JSON viewing/editing features are particularly useful and interesting for powerusers and developers!</p>
<p>Matthew</p>
<pre>
Changes in synapse 0.4.2 (2014-10-31)

            <div>
                
                <p>It's been an incredibly busy few weeks in Matrixland - we've had our heads down rushing to get new stuff ready for today's <a href="http://disrupteuhackathon.challengepost.com">TechCrunch Disrupt London hackathon</a>.</p>
<p>The big news is that we have our first alpha releases of native Mobile SDKs available today for Matrix for iOS &amp; Android! These are entirely new projects - you can check out the SDKs and demo apps (which implement a basic Matrix chatroom client similar to the <a href="http://matrix.org/alpha">webclient demo</a> at:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk</a></li>
</ul>
We still have a lot of polishing and lipstick to apply to these, but it should be a good starting point for folks who'd like to hack on mobile apps for Matrix! We haven't had a chance to generate appledoc/javadoc for these yet, but we'll post them on matrix.org shortly.
<p>There's also been some work going into restructuring our documentation and finalising the spec - all Matrix generic documentation now lives in a new git project at <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc">http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc</a>. We're still working on wrapping all the details of the spec into a single canonical document, but it's getting there and should be locked down shortly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we're also pleased to announce the new Synapse 0.4 release series of the reference Matrix homeserver. Our focus on Synapse over the last few weeks has been on implementing the remaining pieces of the Matrix security model and getting the server to the point where folks can deploy it properly in production environments.</p>
<p><b>Synapse 0.4 deliberately breaks backwards compatibility on the server-server federation protocol</b>, as we now cryptographically sign all federation traffic at the HTTP layer (using Authorization headers) in order to have a strong assertion to the identity of the servers which exchange traffic. We can't really use SSL client/server certificates for this as it's incompatible with Synapse deployments which are hosted behind generic SSL loadbalancers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we have two other major development branches on Synapse which will land shortly - one of which <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/event_signing">cryptographically signs all events</a>, thus preventing tampering with room history, and the other of which performs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/federation_authorization">strict authorization</a> on all traffic received through federation to avoid malicious events being injected and breaking the consistency of the distributed room. These should be landing shortly - at which point the full security model of Matrix will be implemented in Synapse and we can finally remove the &quot;don't use this in production!&quot; warnings!</p>
<p>API developers: be aware that this release also fixes the confusion over timestamps in the client-server (and server-server) API. Events now have only one well-defined timestamp - event.origin_server_ts; the localtime on the homeserver which first receives a message. This replaces the previous confusing event.ts and event.content.hsob_ts timestamps. This should be a trivial change to implement.</p>
<p>Finally, we've also had a detour into <a href="http://trossenrobotics.com/phantomx-ax-hexapod.aspx">robotics</a> to build our new mascot (Sentinel)... pictures forthcoming shortly!</p>
<p>Thanks for supporting Matrix - please let us know how you get on with the new releases at <a href="http://matrix.org/alpha">#matrix:matrix.org!</a></p>
