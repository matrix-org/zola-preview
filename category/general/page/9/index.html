                <p>This week, Matrix is visiting San Francisco for <a href="http://fluentconf.com/" title="Fluent">Fluent</a>, a web development conference over three days, with events ranging from 2-day training sessions to 10-min showcase presentations.</p>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/fluent1.png"><img src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/fluent1.png" alt="fluent" width="1328" height="540" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-894" /></a></p>
<p>I had the opportunity to participate in the latter: Tuesday's Solutions Showcase in the Community Lounge. The presentation was recorded, here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhZ1D_DFQAY" title="video">video</a> and <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-20_Fluent_10min.pdf">slides</a>.</p>
<p>I also had a 30-min in-depth <a href="http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015/public/schedule/detail/42666" title="talk">talk</a> earlier today, where I went through a case study of adding Matrix to your existing app (<a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-20_Fluent_30min.pdf">slides</a>). After evaluating options, we decided to use the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/chat.html" title="flux-chat">flux-chat</a> example by Facebook - it's a basic chat application that uses their internal message dispatcher and showcases how a React/Flux app works.</p>
<p>The code for the original example can be found <a href="https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-chat/" title="here">here</a>, and the complete diff of changes necessary to integrate it with Matrix - using the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk" title="matrix-js-sdk">matrix-js-sdk</a> - can be found <a href="https://github.com/facebook/flux/compare/master...ara4n:mxstore" title="here">here</a> (thanks to Matthew for yet another late-night hack!). I think it's very cool to see how easily their chat example can be turned into a Matrix client, albeit a fairly basic one! <a href="http://arasphere.net/flux/examples/flux-chat/" title="Here">Here</a> is an online version if you want to try it out!</p>
<table style="border:solid 0px #ffffff;" border="0" width="100%"><tr style="border:0"><td style="border:0">

<p>If you have any questions or comments, we are still at Fluent - you can catch us in the exhibition hall in booth #208 - or virtually, as always, in <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a>!</p>

                <p>This week, Matthew and myself went to the <a href="http://webrtc-conference.com/" title="WebRTC conference">WebRTC conference</a> and its related <a href="http://webrtc-conference.com/kranky-geek/" title="Kranky Geek">Kranky Geek</a> event in sunny London.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ipcortex/status/588261705144262656" title="picture credit: twitter.com/ipcortex"><img src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/matrix1.jpg" alt="Matrix at WebRTC conference London 2015" width="1024" height="579" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-799" /></a></p>
<p>Matrix had a speaker slot in both events; the first talk was &quot;Proposing an open interoperable signalling layer for WebRTC&quot; (<a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-15-Matrix-WebRTC-London.pdf">slides</a>).</p>
<p>As I was talking to people in the tea-breaks between sessions, I was actually surprised at the amount of people who not only knew about Matrix, but who had been following eagerly since the early days, and had questions about specific features and recent developments!</p>
<p>Later in the day it was time for the Kranky Geek, and the talk then was a bit more technical: &quot;Interoperable HTTP Signalling with Matrix&quot; (<a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-15-Matrix-WebRTC-Kranky-Geek.pdf">slides</a>). The talk included a &quot;dangerous demo&quot; where we made a WebRTC call from our Matrix iOS App to our webclient for the first time - thanks to the <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenWebRTC/status/588784386440593408" title="OpenWebRTC">OpenWebRTC</a> team for helping us make the demo!</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/webrtcHacks/status/588341443363786752" title="picture credit: twitter.com/webrtcHacks"><img src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/matrix-krankygeek.jpg" alt="matrix-krankygeek" width="1024" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800" /></a></p>
<p>What's great about these kind of events is the feedback and discussion following talks; lots of people have relevant experiences and opinions that they are happy to share, and of course questions on how exactly different features actually work. </p>
<p>It's always great to meet new people and have lots of various discussions. Hopefully we have got a few more people interested in Matrix - we have already seen some new joiners in the <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a> room! </p>
<p>Next up is <a href="http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015/">Fluent</a> in San Francisco next week, where I will be <a href="http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015/public/schedule/detail/42666" title="speaking">speaking</a>.</p>

<p>Both the recording equipment and the video team volunteers were new this year, so some problems were encountered, which means that our lightning talk video unfortunately was lost. However, our talk in the IoT-devroom is now available:</p>

                <p>Heads up that we released Synapse 0.8.1 a little while back, but we've all been too busy writing software to announce it... you know how it goes. Anyway, here are the changes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Disable registration by default. New users can be added using the included <code>register_new_matrix_user</code> script or by enabling registration in the config.</li>
	<li>Add metrics to synapse. To enable metrics use config options <code>enable_metrics</code> and <code>metrics_port</code>.</li>
	<li>Fix bug where banning only kicked the user.</li>
</ul>
Note that first one in particular: if you set up a new install, you won't be able to register new users using the API by default. This means random people on the Internet can't create accounts on your Home Server unless you actually choose to let them. Also, if you were trying to ban users and noticed that didn't work... yeah, we fixed that.
<p>Okay, back to writing software again!</p>

            <div>
                
                <p>Last week, we mentioned that we released part of a first implementation of the long awaited <a title="Application Service (AS) API" href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api">Application Service (AS) API</a> as part of the <a title="Synapse 0.7.1 released – with Application Service API" href="http://matrix.org/blog/2015/02/19/synapse-0-7-1-released-with-application-service-api/">0.7.1 release</a>. The AS API makes it dead simple to connect your service into the Matrix ecosystem using an existing standard Matrix server.</p>
<p>And today we're very excited that the first implementation using this API has gone live! <a title="OpenMarket" href="http://openmarket.com">OpenMarket</a> just announced the <a title="OpenMarket Matrix Gateway" href="http://www.openmarket.com/matrix/">OpenMarket Matrix Gateway</a> which lets you chat with non-Matrix users via their phone number: as you send and receive instant messages from your Matrix chat room, they'll receive and send SMSes back to you, which will appear in your Matrix room as IM, extending your reach to any non-Matrix user.</p>
<p>To use the new OpenMarket service just login to the matrix.org <a title="webclient" href="/beta/">webclient</a> and start a chat with your target mobile phone user by identifying him/her with a Matrix ID in the format <em>@+&lt;msisdn&gt;:matrix.openmarket.com</em> (msisdn being the internationally formatted phone number of your contact) - any messages to them will be sent via OpenMarket's SMS service. The SMSes will be sent from dynamically assigned numbers so that the recipient is able to respond to your message(s) - and the user will first receive an &quot;opt-in&quot; message from the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway to invite them to the conversation (just as they would if you invited them to a conversation in Matrix). Note that there are a finite set of these dynamically assigned numbers: OpenMarket reserves the right to recycle contact numbers if they have not been used to send or receive traffic for more than 2 months.</p>
<p>Sending SMS through the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway will be free during the introductory beta testing period, and users will be warned when that changes - although usage is subject to a per-user fair-usage policy. Despite the free service today, you'll have to associate a valid PayPal account to your account in order to send messages for security purposes. OpenMarket will not (and cannot) charge this account without your consent. You can associate your PayPal account via the settings page of any reference Matrix web client which has been configured to be aware of the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway - for example, the matrix.org <a title="webclient" href="/beta/#/settings">webclient</a>.</p>
<p>You'll also have to accept the OpenMarket Matrix API End User License Agreement to use the service.</p>
<p>The OpenMarket Matrix Gateway is a great example of how the Application Service API can be used to extend Matrix, we're really happy to see it live and hope it's going to give our community lots of ideas! There are a lot of services that could mutually benefit from being integrated with Matrix, and the AS API makes this much easier to accomplish!</p>
<p>Thus, we strongly urge you to have a look at the <a title="AS API" href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api">AS API</a> - and as always we are happy to answer any questions at <a title="#matrix:matrix.org" href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a>!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We released Synapse 0.7.1 this morning - <strong>This release includes more critical federation stability and performance updates - please upgrade as soon as you can!</strong>.  You can get the code and installation instructions from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a> as normal.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> You can also install and run Synapse now via <a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a>, thanks to a Dockerfile at <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/silviof/docker-matrix/">https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/silviof/docker-matrix/</a> contributed today by Silvio Fricke.  Thanks Silvio!!</p>
<p>Other than the federation improvements, the big new feature that lands here is the long-awaited Application Service API.  This is a set of simple extensions to the Client-Server API to make it much easier to build powerful gateways and other application logic on top of Matrix.  You can think of it being somewhere between IRC Services, IMS application services and XMPP components - but with the simplicity of an IRC bot.  The extensions let you register application services as privileged Matrix clients, and create virtual users and virtual rooms in bulk within Matrix (e.g. bridging an entire IRC network into Matrix).  The API also lets your application service receive inbound events as HTTP pushes rather than having to poll.  The end result is that it's suddenly become <strong>a lot</strong> easier to bridge existing communities with Matrix!</p>
<p>We'll post another blog post shortly to give a lot more information; in the interim you can read more about it in the newly updated spec at <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api">http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#application-service-api</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="http://fosdem.org" title="FOSDEM">FOSDEM</a> was great fun! Two days full of conferences and demos; lots of interesting technologies and interested people - and most of all: talking to so many new faces about Matrix and potential uses and integration ideas. </p>
<p>Both our lightning talk and IoT-devroom talk were completely filled up with huge queues outside (sorry folks), and our demos seemed to go down fairly well.  In fact several people <a href="/code">set up their own homeserver</a> and joined the federated network of Matrix servers during FOSDEM itself!</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/561535884567130112" title="view from our stand">view from our stand</a>, from our <a href="http://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/561543011662696448" title="lightning talk">lightning talk</a> and from our <a href="http://twitter.com/thierrymarianne/status/561828001231695872" title="IoT-devroom talk">IoT-devroom talk</a>.</p>
<p>If you missed the talks, recordings will (soon) be available from the FOSDEM site (links will be added here once available) - in the meantime you can check out the slides here: <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-31-Matrix_FOSDEM.pdf" title="lightning talk">lightning talk</a> and <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-01-Matrix-IoT-FOSDEM.pdf" title="IoT-devroom talk">IoT-devroom talk</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who came to have a chat about Matrix and/or help with setting up their own homeserver (or to play with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyIw2AkYpeo">Sentinel, our mascot</a>) - please do reach out to us via our <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="Matrix HQ room">Matrix HQ room</a> or IRC (<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/matrix">#matrix on freenode</a>) if you have any problems - or want to help us fix our python packaging ;)  Now is a great time to get involved as we are currently landing new APIs and soon will be offering an Application Server API to ease bridging to other services.</p>

                <p>This weekend, Matrix is heading to FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting) in Brussels, Belgium. We will be hosting two events: a <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/matrix/" title="lightning talk">lightning talk</a> on Saturday at 16:30 in room H.2215 (Ferrer), and an <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/deviot04/" title="IoT devroom talk">IoT devroom talk</a> on Sunday morning at 11:00 in room H.2213.</p>
<p>FOSDEM's <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/" title="schedule">schedule</a> is looking very interesting and varied, and we hope we can learn about interesting projects - and of course show how and where Matrix can be used to lots of FOSDEM-attendees. Please come over and have a chat if you are interested; we have a stand on the second floor in the K building - just take a right after coming up the stairs and say hi! </p>
<p>We have also set up a Matrix &lt;-&gt; IRC bridge on the #fosdem channel on freenode, which means that any conversation happening there will be copied over to <a href="/beta/#/room/#fosdem:matrix.org" title="#fosdem:matrix.org">#fosdem:matrix.org</a> - and vice versa. Making bridges to other services is currently being worked on as part of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/application-services/drafts/application_services.rst" title="Application Services API">Application Services API</a> - we want to be able to connect different services together via Matrix.</p>
<p>Finally, we are always available in the official <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org" title="Matrix HQ room">Matrix HQ room</a> - please join and say hi!</p>

                <p>Some updates on the conferences Matrix attended over the last 3 weeks: WebRTC Summit in Santa Clara, TAD Summit in Istanbul, WebRTC World West in San José and fOSSa in Rennes. Great shows, ending in lots of interesting discussions and new excitement in Matrix!</p>
<h2>WebRTC Summit (Santa Clara, November 4-6)</h2>
Matrix was a <a href="http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/3242708">sponsor</a> at the Santa Clara <a href="http://webrtcsummit.net/">WebRTC Summit</a> at CloudExpo, and opened the WebRTC track alongside our friends at <a href="http://www.openpeer.org">Open Peer / Hookflash</a>. Matthew presented Matrix as the missing signalling layer for WebRTC and as a good federated complement to MQTT and COAP for IoT use cases: you can find his presentation <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-03-Matrix_Missing-Link_IOT.pdf">here</a>.
<p>Great techie discussions and debates down there, the stand was flooded with interested people and John had a hardtime answering everyone by himself on day 2!</p>
<p>But he still found a few minutes to do a TV interview for SYSCon TV on Tuesday evening! :)</p>
<p>[embed]http://youtu.be/JVq6S9V1Jcg[/embed]</p>
<h2>TAD Summit (Istanbul, November 12-13)</h2>
Matrix was a partner at <a href="http://tadsummit.com/2014/">TAD Summit</a> in Istanbul this year, a great opportunity to meet a very good mix of developers, industry players and mobile networks! TAD mixes conferences and technical workshops where everyone gets involved to create a vibrant ecosystem for Telecom Application Developers. Again really productive discussions and meetings as we continue our search for partners to help support the uptake of Matrix.
<p>Matthew's talk was fully recorded so just watch the video to get the real pitch!</p>

<h2>WebRTC World (San Jose, November 18-20)</h2>
Matrix's attendance at <a href="http://www.webrtcworld.com/conference/west/default.aspx">WebRTC World</a> in San Jose was more rewarding than expected! The team was ready to be part of the expo and give a talk on FOSS WebRTC options... but didn't hesitate to jump at the opportunity when a demo slot opened up! And that was a worthwhile decision as Matrix ended up winning not one but<strong> TWO awards from the demo:</strong> The <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Audience Choice Award</strong></span>
 as the audience's favourite demo of the 10 shown on Tuesday, and also the overall <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Best Social Integration Award</strong> </span>
from the Jury! So a big congrats to the dev team who were rushing to get the fine details ready in time and to Matthew for getting the audience's attention! And of course a even bigger thank you to everyone who voted for us, including in the Jury!
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sj.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-239" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sj-300x168.jpg" alt="Matthew at WebRTC World 2014" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Of course this drew lots of interest, and WebRTC Expo ended up the busiest show ever for the team who pitched solidly at the booth for 2 days in a row!</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Audience_Choice_14.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-240" style="box-shadow: none ! important;" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Audience_Choice_14.png" alt="Audience_Choice_14" width="300" height="229" /></a> <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Best_Social_Integration_14.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-241" style="box-shadow: none ! important;" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Best_Social_Integration_14.png" alt="Best_Social_Integration_14" width="300" height="229" /></a></div>
<h2>fOSSa (Rennes, November 20)</h2>
And eventually, while Matthew and John were celebrating in San José (or flying home, more accurately), Amandine was also evangelising at home in Rennes (France), where <a href="https://fossa.inria.fr/">fOSSa </a>was gathering experts from the opensource world for 3 days. Matrix was presented within the Serendipity section on the conférence, "Le Carrefour des Possibles": 6 minutes to pitch an open project that making dreams possible.
<p>So if you speak French or are not afraid to only read from <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-17.2-Matrix.pdf">the slides</a>, check out the video the team made of the pitch. The official one should be available soon!</p>
