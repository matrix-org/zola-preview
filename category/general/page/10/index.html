                <p>Hi folks - another few months have gone by and once again the core Matrix team has ended up too busy hacking away on the final missing pieces of the Matrix jigsaw puzzle to have been properly updating the blog; sorry about this. The end is in sight for the current crunch however, and we expect to return to regular blog updates shortly! Meanwhile, rather than letting news stack up any further, here's a quick(?) attempt to summarise all the things which have been going on!</p>
<h3 id="synapse-0-16-1-released">Synapse 0.16.1 released!</h3>
<p>This one's a biggy: in the mad rush during June to support the public debut for <a href="https://vector.im">Vector</a>, we made a series of major <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> releases which apparently we forgot to tell anyone about (sorry!). The full changelog is at the bottom of the post as it's huge, but the big features are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Huge performance improvements, including adding write-thru event caches and improving caching throughout, and massive improvements to the speed of the room directory API.</li>
 	<li>Add support for inline URL previewing!</li>
 	<li>Add email notifications!</li>
 	<li>Add support for LDAP authentication (thanks to Christoph Witzany)</li>
 	<li>Add support for JWT authentication (thanks to Niklas Riekenbrauck)</li>
 	<li>Add basic server-side ignore functionality and abuse reporting API</li>
 	<li>Add ability to delegate /publicRooms API requests to a list of secondary homeservers</li>
 	<li>Lots and lots and lots of bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
If you haven't upgraded, please do asap from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>!
<p>There's also been a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes on horizontal scalability for Synapse.  We haven't drawn much attention to this yet (or documented it) as it's still quite experimental and in flux, but the main change is to add the concept of application-layer replication to Synapse - letting you split the codebase into multiple endpoints which can then be run in parallel, each replicating their state off the master synapse process.  For instance, right now the Matrix.org homeserver is actually running off three different processes: the main synapse; another specific to calculating push notifications and another specific to serving up the /sync endpoint.  These three are then abstracted behind the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendron">dendron</a> layer (which also implements the /login endpoint). The idea is that one can then run multiple instances of the /sync and pusher (and other future) endpoints to horizontally scale.  For now, they share a single database writer, but in practice this has improved our scalability and performance on the Matrix.org HS radically.</p>
<p>In future we'll actually document how to run these, as well as making it easy to spin up multiple concurrent instances - in the interim if you find you're hitting performance limits running high-traffic synapses come talk to us about it on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev:matrix.org</a>.  And the longer term plan continues to be to switch out these python endpoint implementations in future for more efficient implementations.  For instance, there's a golang implementation of the media repository currently in development which could run as another endpoint cluster.</p>
<h3 id="vector-released">Vector released!</h3>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@Vector/2d33b23a787">Much has been written</a> about this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11871527">elsewhere</a>, but Web, iOS and Android versions of the <a href="https://www.vector.im">Vector</a> clients were finally released to the general public on June 9th at the <a href="http://www.decentralizedweb.net/">Decentralised Web Summit</a> in San Francisco.  Vector is a relatively thin layer on top of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk">matrix-react-sdk</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">matrix-ios-sdk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">matrix-android-sdk</a> Matrix.org client SDKs which showcases Matrix's collaboration and messaging capabilities in a mass-market usable app.  There's been huge amounts of work here across the SDKs for the 3 platforms, with literally thousands of issues resolved.  You can find the full SDK changelogs on github for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">React</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-kit/blob/master/CHANGES.rst">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.rst">Android</a>.  Some of the more interesting recent additions to Vector include improved room notifications, URL previews, configurable email notifications, and huge amounts of performance stability work.</p>
<p>Future work on Vector is focused on showcasing end-to-end encryption, providing a one-click interface for adding bots/integrations &amp; bridges to a room, and generally enormously improving the UX and polish.  Meanwhile, there's an F-Droid release for Android landing <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=im.vector.alpha">any day now</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't checked it out recently, it's really worth a look :)</p>
<p><a href="https://vector.im"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1658" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-04-at-12.18.10-1024x591.png" alt="Vector" width="1024" height="591" /></a></p>
<h3 id="matrix-spec-0-1-0">Matrix Spec 0.1.0</h3>
<p>In case you didn't notice, we also released <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/">v0.1.0 of the Matrix spec</a> itself in May - this is a fairly minor update which improves the layout of the document somewhat (thanks to a PR from Jimmy Cuadra) and a some bugfixes.  You can see the <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.1.0.html#changelog">full changelog here</a>. We're overdue a new release since then (albeit again with relatively minor changes).</p>
<h3 id="google-summer-of-code">Google Summer of Code</h3>
<p>We're in the middle of the second half of GSoC right now, with our GSoC students Aviral and Half-Shot hacking away on Vector and Microblogging projects respectively.  There's a lot of exciting stuff coming out of this - Aviral contributing Rich Text Editing, Emoji autocompletion, DuckDuckGo and other features into Vector (currently on branches, but will be released soon) and Half-Shot building a Twitter bridge as part of his Matrix-powered microblogging system.  Watch this space for updates!</p>
<h3 id="ruma">Ruma</h3>
<p>Lots of exciting stuff has been happening recently over at <a href="https://ruma.io">Ruma.io</a> - an independent Matrix homeserver implementation written in Rust.  Over the last few weeks Jimmy and friends have got into the real meat of implementing e<a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/commit/8a2fe269196dfd5b629c6e301e8d78e19ae6d279">vents</a> and the core of the Matrix CS API, and as of the time of writing they're the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12028475">topmost link</a> on HackerNews!  There's a lot of work involved in writing a homeserver, but Ruma is looking incredibly promising and the feedback from their team has been incredibly helpful in keeping us honest on the Matrix spec and ensuring that it's fit for purpose for 3rd party server implementers.</p>
<p>Also, Ruma just released some <a href="https://www.ruma.io/docs/matrix">truly excellent documentation</a> as a high-level introduction to Matrix (thanks to Leah and Jimmy) - much better than anything we have on the official Matrix.org site.  Go check it out if you haven't already!</p>
<h3 id="end-to-end-encryption">End to End Encryption</h3>
<p>There has been <em>LOADS</em> of work happening on End to End encryption: finalising the core 1:1 &quot;<a href="/git/olm">Olm</a>&quot; cryptographic ratchet; implementing the group &quot;<a href="http://matrix.org/git/olm/tree/src/megolm.c">Megolm</a>&quot; ratchet (which shares a single ratchet over all the participants of a room for scalability); fully hooking Olm into matrix-js-sdk and Vector-web at last, and preparing for a formal and published-to-the-public 3rd party security audit on Olm which will be happening during July.</p>
<p>This deserves a post in its own right, but the key thing to know is that Olm is almost ready - and indeed the work-in-progress E2E UX is even available on the <a href="https://vector.im/develop">develop branch of vector</a> if you enable E2E in the new 'Labs' section in User Settings.  Olm itself is usable only for 'burn after reading' strictly PFS messages, but Megolm integration with Vector &amp; Synapse will follow shortly afterwards which will finally provide the E2E nirvana we've all been waiting for :)</p>
<h3 id="decentralised-web-summit">Decentralised Web Summit</h3>
<p>Matrix had a major presence as a sponsor at the first ever <a href="http://www.decentralizedweb.net/">Decentralised Web Summit</a> hosted by the Internet Archive in San Francisco back in June.  This was a truly incredible event - with folks gathering from across the world to discuss, collaborate and debate on ensure that the web is not fragmented or trapped into proprietary silos - with the likes of Tim Berners-Lee, Vint Cerf and Brewster Kahle in attendance.  We ran a long 2 hour workshop on Matrix and showed off Vector to anyone and everyone - and meanwhile the organisers were kind enough to promote Matrix as the main decentralised chat interface for the conference itself (bridged with their Slack).  A full writeup of the conference really merits a blog post in its own right, but the punchline is that you could genuinely tell that this is the beginning of a new era of the internet - whether it's using Merkle DAGs (like Matrix) or Blockchain or similar technologies: we are about to see a major shift in the balance of power on the internet back towards its users.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend checking out the videos which have all been published at <a href="http://www.decentralizedweb.net/">Decentralised Web Summit</a>, including <a href="https://archive.org/details/DWebSummit2016_Lightning_Talks_Session_B">lightning talks introducing both Matrix and Vector</a>, and digging into as many of the projects advertised as possible.  It was particularly interesting for us to get to know Tim Berners-Lee's latest project at MIT: <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid</a> - which shares quite a lot of the same goals as Matrix, and subsequently seeing Tim pop up on <a href="https://vector.im/develop/#/room/#decentralizedweb-general:matrix.org/$146549767249761pyAQF:matrix.org">Matrix via Vector</a>.  We're really looking forward to working out how Matrix &amp; Solid can complement each other in future.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/parkan/status/740324969884700672"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1660 size-large" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/timbl-768x1024.jpg" alt="Matthew, Tim Berners-Lee and Matrix" width="384" height="512" /></a></p>
<h3 id="matrix-to">Matrix.to</h3>
<p>Not the most exciting thing ever, but heads up that there's a simple site up at <a href="https://matrix.to">https://matrix.to</a> to provide a way of doing client-agnostic links to content in Matrix.  For instance, rather than linking specifically into an app like Vector, you can now say <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org">https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org</a> to go there via whatever app you choose.  This is basically a bootstrapping process towards having proper mx:// URLs in circulation, but given mx:// doesn't exist yet, https://matrix.to hopefully provides a useful step in the right direction :)</p>
<p>PRs very welcome at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bridges-and-bots">Bridges and Bots</h3>
<p>Much of the promise of Matrix is the ability to bridge through to other silos, and we've been gradually adding more and more bridging capabilities in.</p>
<p>For instance, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">IRC bridge</a> has had a complete overhaul to add in huge numbers of new features and finally deployed for Freenode a few weeks ago:</p>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Nicks set via <code>!nick</code> will now be preserved across bridge restarts.</li>
 	<li>EXPERIMENTAL: IRC clients created by the bridge can be assigned their own IPv6 address.</li>
 	<li>The bridge will now send connection status information to real Matrix users via the admin room (the same room <code>!nick</code>commands are issued).</li>
 	<li>Added <code>!help</code>.</li>
 	<li>The bridge will now fallback to <code>body</code> if the HTML content contains <em>any</em> unrecognised tags. This makes passing Markdown from Matrix to IRC much nicer.</li>
 	<li>The bridge will now send more metrics to the statsd server, including the join/part rate to and from IRC.</li>
 	<li>The config option <code>matrixClients.displayName</code> is now implemented.</li>
</ul>
Bug fixes:
<ul>
 	<li>Escape HTML entities when sending from IRC to Matrix. This prevents munging occurring between IRC formatting and textual &lt; element &gt; references, whereby if you sent a tag and some colour codes from IRC it would not escape the tag and therefore send invalid HTML to Matrix.</li>
 	<li>User IDs starting with <code>-</code> are temporarily filtered out from being bridged.</li>
 	<li>Deterministically generate the configuration file.</li>
 	<li>Recognise more IRC error codes as non-fatal to avoid IRC clients reconnecting unnecessarily.</li>
 	<li>Add a 10 second timeout to join events injected via the <code>MemberListSyncer</code> to avoid HOL blocking.</li>
 	<li>'Frontier' Matrix users will be forcibly joined to IRC channels even if membership list syncing I-&gt;M is disabled. This ensures that there is always a Matrix user in the channel being bridged to avoid losing traffic.</li>
 	<li>Cache the <code>/initialSync</code> request to avoid hitting this endpoint more than once, as it may be very slow.</li>
 	<li>Indexes have been added to the NeDB .db files to improve lookup times.</li>
 	<li>Do not recheck if the bridge bot should part the channel if a virtual user leaves the channel: we know it shouldn't.</li>
 	<li>Refine what counts as a "request" for metrics, reducing the amount of double-counting as requests echo back from the remote side.</li>
 	<li>Fixed a bug which caused users to be provisioned off their <code>user_id</code> even if they had a display name set.</li>
</ul>
Meanwhile, a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter">Gitter bridge</a> is in active development (and in testing with the Neovim community on Gitter/Matrix/Freenode), although lacking documentation so far.
<p>Finally, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/Matrix-NEB">NEB</a> - the Matrix.org bot framework is currently being ported from Python to Golang to act as a general Go SDK for rapidly implementing new bot capabilities.</p>
<p>There's little point in all of the effort going into bridges and bots if it's too hard for normal users to deploy them, so on the Vector side of things there's an ongoing project to build a commercial-grade bot/bridge hosted service offering for Matrix which should make it <em>much</em> easier for non-sysadmins to quickly add their own bots and bridges into their rooms.  There's nothing to see yet, but we'll be yelling about it when it's ready!</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I'm sure there's a lot of stuff missing from the quick summary above - suffice it to say that the Matrix ecosystem is growing so fast and so large that it's pretty hard to keep track of everything that's going on.  The big remaining blockers we see at this point are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>End-to-end Encryption roll-out</li>
 	<li>Polishing UX on Vector - showing that it's possible to build better-than-Slack quality UX on top of Matrix</li>
 	<li>Bots, Integrations and Bridges - making them absolutely trivial to build and deploy, and encouraging everyone to write as many as they can!</li>
 	<li>Improving VoIP, especially for conferencing, especially on Mobile</li>
 	<li>Threading</li>
 	<li>Editable messages</li>
 	<li>Synapse scaling and stability - this is massively improved, but there's still work to be done.  Meanwhile projects like <a href="https://ruma.io">Ruma</a> give us hope for light at the end of the Synapse tunnel!</li>
 	<li>Spec refinements - there are still a <a href="/jira/browse/SPEC">lot of open spec bugs</a> which we need to resolve so we can declare the spec (and thus Matrix!) out of beta.</li>
 	<li>More clients - especially desktop ones; helping out with <a href="https://github.com/Fxrh/Quaternion">Quaternion</a>, <a href="https://github.com/davidar/tensor">Tensor</a>, <a href="https://pto.im">PTO</a>, etc.</li>
</ul>
...and then all the pieces of the jigsaw will finally be in place, and Matrix should hopefully fulfil its potential as an invaluable, open and decentralised data fabric for the web.
<p>Thanks, once again, to everyone who's been supporting and using Matrix - whether it's by hanging out in the public chatrooms, running your own server, writing your own clients, bots, or servers, or just telling your friends about the project.  The end of the beginning is in sight: thanks for believing in us, and thank you for flying Matrix.</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the Matrix Team.</p>

<p>Last week I went to <a href="https://www.kamailioworld.com/k04/">Kamailio World 2016</a> in Berlin to meet fellow VoIP-developers and tell them all about Matrix. It's a fairly small conference, which is actually quite nice as it means you get to talk to almost everyone. A lot of people were interested in Matrix - both new and familiar faces - in fact, some of them heard about Matrix <a href="/blog/2015/06/01/matrix-wins-most-entertaining-demo-at-kamailio-world/">a year ago at Kamailio World 2015</a> and were interested in hearing what progress we've made since.</p>
<p>As always, Matrix participated in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkjIIh0cqcM&t=9m">James Body's dangerous demos session</a> - and I also gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV4WHaCJh2k">30min talk on Matrix and recent updates</a> to a full room on the first day of the conference. </p>
<p>Several people mentioned that Matrix could be interesting to their project, either as a glue between services, or for adding text-based chat to VoIP apps. I hope to see some of you in Matrix at some point - please join us in <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a> and say hi! It's also a good place to ask questions and discuss how Matrix can work with your project. Auf Wiedersehen!</p>

<p>It's soon time for the 2nd <a href="http://tadhack.com/2016/mini-london/">TADHack-mini London</a>. The event starts at 10am on Saturday April 9th and hacking continues until the projects are pitched, starting at 1pm on Sunday April 10th. As you can see by the <a href="/blog/posts/?s=tadhack">many previous TADHacks</a>, every hackathon brings interesting and impressive projects, so we are again expecting great things! </p>
<p>As usual, there are great prizes to be won - worth around $5k in total. This time, we will award the best Matrix-related hack a <a href="http://www.trossenrobotics.com/phantomx-ax-hexapod.aspx">PhantomX AX Metal Hexapod Mark III</a> from Trossen Robotics, a build-it-yourself hexapod robot kit! The robot is built on an entirely open source platform, complete with 3D cad models of the robot, open software, and schematics for the electronics.</p>

                <p>It's been 3 months since the <a href="/blog/2015/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-special/">Matrix Holiday Special</a> and once again we've all been too busy writing code to put anything that detailed on the blog.  So without further a do here's a quick overview of how things have progressed so far in 2016!</p>
<h3 id="home-servers">Home servers</h3>
<br/>
<h4 id="synapse">Synapse</h4>
<p>Work on <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> (our reference homeserver) has been primarily focused on improving performance.  This may sound boring, but there's been a huge amount of improvement here since synapse 0.12 was released on Jan 4. Synapse 0.13 on Feb 10 brought huge CPU savings thanks to a whole fleet of caching and other optimisation work - the best way of seeing the difference here is to look at the load graph of the server that hosts matrix.org's synapse+postgres over the last few months:</p>
<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/matrix-org-load.png" alt="matrix-org-load" width="497" height="173" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1563" />
<p>Ignoring the unrelated blip during March, you can see an enormous step change in system load (which had a matching decrease in actual CPU usage) at the beginning of Feb when the 0.13 optimisations landed on matrix.org :)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Synapse 0.14 is due any day now with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.14.0-rc2">0.14.0-rc2</a> released on Wednesday.  Here, the focus has been all about memory optimisation - anyone who's run a Synapse seriously will be aware that it can be a memory hog thanks to aggressively caching as much state and history in RAM as possible to avoid hitting the database and keeping everything responsive.  0.14 should improve memory usage just as dramatically as 0.13 improved CPU utilisation - introducing a quick-and-dirty SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR environment variable that lets admins dial down the aggressiveness of the caching (at the expense of performance), but more interestingly implementing string interning and ensuring that events are cached by ID rather than duplicated across multiple caches in order to make memory usage more efficient.  It's too early to have impressive looking graphs, and there are still a few memory spikes being tracked down before we release 0.14, but we're hoping for at least a 50% reduction in memory footprint.</p>
<p>Featurewise the highlights include: server-generated unread notification &amp; highlight counts and push badge support, lots of support and refinements for guest access and 3rd party ID invites.  Meanwhile we've finally fixed some of the most embarrassing long-standing missing features such as letting folks logout serverside(!), delete aliases and determine whether rooms should be published in the room directory or not. </p>
<p>Finally, Synapse is now part of <a href="http://www.freshports.org/net/py-matrix-synapse/">FreeBSD Ports</a> thanks to Brendan Molloy, and <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/nixos/modules/services/misc/matrix-synapse.nix">NixOS</a> thanks to Robin Lambertz!  Huge thanks to them for contributing the packages to the respective OSes and to all the other synapse package maintainers out there!</p>
<p>It's incredibly exciting to see Synapse's maturity improving and hitting the optimisation stage of its life; huge kudos to Erik for spearheading the optimisation work.  We strongly recommend folks upgrade to 0.14 when it's available; it's never been a better time to run a homeserver! :D</p>
<br/>
<h4 id="dendron">Dendron</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendron">Dendron</a> (our next generation homeserver) development has been progressing interestingly: we finished an initial spike to get a Golang skeleton server in place, albeit one that delegates most of the endpoints through to Synapse.  In fact, matrix.org itself has been running via Dendron since February!</p>
<p>The whole point of Dendron is to provide an architecture where we can split apart the various endpoints that Synapse provides today, re-implementing them where appropriate in Golang, and critically letting the endpoints scale horizontally with clusters of backend servers abstracted by the single Dendron API facade.  As a result, most of the Dendron work has actually ended up going into restructuring Synapse such that multiple Synapses can be run in a cluster behind a single Dendron, allowing us to horizontally scale API endpoints at last.  This takes the form of adding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/1acc319070c0390d2330003bdc1e71cc66383dbb">cluster replication support</a> to Synapse.  This is still work-in-progress as we go through fixing up more and more state to be replicable (replicatable?) between synapses - hopefully it should land in the Synapse 0.15 timeframe.  And then we enter a very very interesting new world of horizontally scalable homeservers...</p>
<br/>
<h4 id="ruma">Ruma</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.ruma.io/">Ruma</a> has also seen some progress over the last few months - Ruma is an independent Rust language homeserver project led by Jimmy Cuadra, and whilst in early development still (currently focusing on the user login and registration system) shows a lot of promise.  Lots of work has ended up going into the required Rust dependencies rather than the Matrix code itself, but if you're interested in Rust then please drop by <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a> or #ruma on Freenode and say hi!</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="clients">Clients</h3>
<p>Whilst homeserver development is mainly all about performance and scaling work currently, the client side of the Matrix ecosystem is the polar opposite - with lots of rapid progress on exciting new clients happening from all over the community.</p>
<br/>
<h4 id="perpetually-talking-online-pto">Perpetually Talking Online (PTO)</h4>
<p><a href="http://pto.im/">PTO</a> has evolved enormously since Torrie Fischer first revealed it at the end of 2015.  PTO is an independent project that acts as a Matrix client that exposes an IRC server interface - effectively turning any Matrix homeserver into an ircd; letting folks hook their favourite IRC clients directly into Matrix and use it as an enormous decentralised IRC network.  (N.B. this is not to be confused with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">matrix-appservice-irc</a>, which acts as a server-side bridge between Matrix rooms and IRC channels.)  Obviously you lose some of the Matrix specific features (read receipts, typing notifs, VoIP, etc) but there's clearly a huge benefit for the IRC community to be able to use Matrix as if it were an IRC network.</p>
<p>There have been three releases so far, with the <a href="https://github.com/tdfischer/pto/releases">v0.3.0 (&quot;Carburetor&quot;) release</a> in March being tantalisingly close to being usable for everyday purposes.  We actually have pto.matrix.org all set up and ready to go as an IRC frontend for the matrix.org homeserver and once <a href="https://github.com/tdfischer/pto/issues/60">issue #60</a> is resolved we'll be turning it on :)</p>
<p>There's one catch though - XChat was never quite built to handle the hundreds of rooms that we've got used to Matrix supporting... :D</p>

<p>Come hang out in <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#pto:oob.systems">#pto:oob.systems</a> if you're interested in PTO!</p>
<br/>
<h4 id="quaternion">Quaternion</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Fxrh/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> is a new Qt/QML/C++ desktop client created by Felix Rohrbach.  It's a fairly early alpha but still quite usable and in very active development. <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#quaternion:matrix.org">#quaternion:matrix.org</a> is the place to talk all things Quaternion :)</p>
<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/quaternion-1024x702.png" alt="quaternion" width="1024" height="702" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1566" />
<br/>
<h4 id="matrix-glib-sdk">matrix-glib-sdk</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, over on the GTK side of the world, Gergely Polonkai has been been making great progress on his <a href="https://github.com/gergelypolonkai/matrix-glib-sdk">matrix-glib-sdk</a> Glib client SDK for Matrix.  The end goal here is to implement a full <a href="https://telepathy.freedesktop.org">Telepathy</a> plugin for Matrix on top of the SDK.  Originally written in C, but now shifted to Vala, the SDK is in very active development and now implements all(?) of the Matrix client-server API - a snapshot of the work-in-progress SDK API docs can be found at <a href="http://gergely.polonkai.eu/matrix-glib-sdk/">http://gergely.polonkai.eu/matrix-glib-sdk</a>.  Next up is a formal release and building out clients on top!</p>
<br/>
<h4 id="matrix-react-sdk-matrix-ios-sdk-matrix-android-sdk-and-vector">matrix-react-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk, matrix-android-sdk and Vector</h4>
<p>Finally, huge amounts of time and effort have continued to be pumped into the official <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk">matrix-react-sdk</a>, <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">matrix-ios-sdk</a> and <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">matrix-android-sdk</a> - driven substantially by requirements for <a href="http://vector.im">Vector</a>, the <a href="http://github.com/vector-im">FOSS</a> Matrix-powered collaboration app that we've been helping with:</p>
<br/>

</p>
<br/>
<p>The best way of seeing what's been going on here is probably by considering Vector itself, which is currently in formal beta (0.4.1 for web, 0.1.2 for iOS and #116 on Android).  The big news includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beta iOS and Android apps.  These are early beta but feedback is very much appreciated - the Android beta can be downloaded from <a href="http://matrix.org/jenkins/job/VectorAndroidDevelop/">Jenkins</a>; if you want to help beta iOS via TestFlight, come ask on <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#ios:matrix.org">#ios:matrix.org</a>.</li>
<li>Guest access.  Anyone can jump straight into Matrix by going to http://vector.im without even having to sign up for an account.  Guests are quite restricted on what they can do (and can only join rooms which explicitly have guest access enabled), but this is a *huge* improvement in getting folks using Matrix.</li>
<li>Ability to jump to any message ever - e.g. when clicking through search results or when permalinking a message... using precisely the same UI that you use when chatting.  Permalinks are awesome.  If you want to <a href="https://vector.im/develop/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org/$1416420724004tADpi:matrix.org">randomly jump back in time</a> to the first weeks of #matrix:matrix.org, now you can...</li>
<li>Read Markers, scrolling that remembers the scroll offset per-room, and the ability to jump to unread messages</li>
<li>Synchronised missed notification and missed highlighted notification information per-room</li>
<li>Badge counts for unread notifications</li>
<li>Entirely reworked Room Settings</li>
<li>Entirely reworked User Settings, including push notification configuration</li>
<li>Entirely reworked Room Directory</li>
<li>Lots of performance improvements</li>
<li>Much improved inviting by email</li>
<li>Much improved reliability on video conferencing</li>
<li>Closing literally <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed">hundreds and hundreds of bugs</a>...</li>
</ul>
<p>All that remains right now is yet more bugfixing and incorporating feedback from the current betas!  Please give as much feedback as possible in <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#vector:matrix.org">#vector:matrix.org</a> :)</p>

<h3 id="bridges-bots">Bridges &amp; Bots</h3>
<p>Bridges, bots, and other integrations and application services have inevitably taken slightly lower priority whilst we've been focusing on the core server and client bits of the ecosystem.  However, as of March we've started a major new project to get these moving again, starting with a big update to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">IRC Bridge</a>.  This is due to be released next week, but you can get a sneak peek at what's going into the release at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/commits/develop">commit log</a>.  Highlights include the ability to persist nicks; connect via IPv6; improve formatted message handling; actually feed error messages from IRC back to Matrix; and much much more.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-verto">matrix-appservice-verto</a> also got some love, which means that multiway video conferencing powered by FreeSWITCH now works reliably.  The quality still could be improved, but the unreliable call setup that plagued earlier versions is now fixed.</p>
<p>In the next few months we're expecting to see a lot more activity on bridges &amp; bots... watch this space :)</p>
<p><b>Update Sat March 26:</b></p>
<p>Totally forgot to mention a few of the key new bridges which have been contributed by the community this year - particularly interesting are the <a href="https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Federation">Rocket.Chat&lt;-&gt;Matrix bridge</a> written by Sing-Li over at Rocket.Chat which provides basic bridging between the awesome <a href="http://rocket.chat">Rocket.Chat</a> collaboration app and the wider Matrix ecosystem.  It's early days, but this is incredibly promising for 'hardcoded' bridging between specific rooms - it just needs Rocket.Chat to support 'virtual' users and will then be seamless federation.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter">matrix-appservice-gitter</a> is a Gitter&lt;-&gt;Matrix bridge built by Leonerd on top of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> Node library.  Again, it's early days but is working well for 'hardcoded' bridging - supporting dynamic rooms and users is next on the todo list :)</p>

<h3 id="the-spec">The Spec</h3>
<p>We started our formal release process for the spec just before Christmas with r0.0.0 - and released <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/r0.0.1">r0.0.1</a> in January with <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/r0.0.1/client_server.html#changelog">minor clarifications and updates</a>.  In practice the spec feels quite stable right now, although things have moved on a bit since January and r0.0.2 is definitely overdue at this point.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can always get the very latest bleeding edge copy of the spec via <a href="http://matrix.org/speculator">the speculator</a>.  We've also added an initial cut at a spec for the <a href="http://matrix.org/speculator/spec/HEAD/identity_service.html">Identity Service</a> at last.</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="events">Events</h3>
<p>We've been focusing on writing code than evangelising Matrix recently, although we did get out to <a href="/blog/2016/02/03/fosdem-16-retrospective/">FOSDEM 2016</a> and <a href="/blog/2016/02/09/matrix-in-japan/">TADHack Mini Japan and WebRTC Conference</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/706916982960967680">Enterprise Connect 2016</a> where we showed off Matrix &amp; Vector in the WebRTC Real World Innovation showcase.</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="gsoc">GSoC</h3>
<p>We are incredibly grateful to have been accepted as an organisation into Google Summer of Code 2016!  The last two weeks have been the window for students to propose projects to us that they could work on over the course of the summer, and it's been fascinating to meet the GSoCers and see a whole new community pop up on Matrix and advise and mentor applicants through their proposals.  At the last count we've received 35 proposals, many inspired by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/IDEAS.md">our list of ideas</a>, including some really impressive candidates - many thanks to all the students who have applied to us.  We don't know yet how many slots Google will allocate to us, but one way or another we're really looking forward to helping the GSoCers make the most out of their summer of Matrix!  All GSoC discussion is happening in <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#gsoc:matrix.org">#gsoc:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h3>
<p>In no particular order, the urgent stuff that still remains includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing to polish synapse and build out dendron-based clustering</li>
<li>Building as many bridges, bots and other integrations as possible</li>
<li>The matrix.to URL-handler service: having client-agnostic https://matrix.to/#matrix:matrix.org URLs to help with sharing matrix room aliases etc</li>
<li>End-to-end crypto.  No progress since December; we need to get back to it asap.</li>
<li>Exiting Vector from beta</li>
<li>Finishing the server-to-server API specification</li>
<li>Improving the security model for access_tokens</li>
<li>Editable messages</li>
<li>Pinned, tagged, and 'liked' messages</li>
<li>Threading</li>
<li>Decentralised accounts</li>
<li>Decentralised reputation</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, Bridging and E2E crypto is likely to get the most attention first (beyond the standard ongoing polishing).  There's obviously a significant amount of work there, but we expect to see benefits pretty quickly throughout Matrix - especially from bridging.  Hopefully it's true to say that the next few months should be quite transformational :D</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for reading this sprawling update and for supporting Matrix.  And please come say hi in <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a> if you have any questions :)</p>

<p>The idea is to make it very easy for anyone to add or update a project entry. All you need to do is to submit a PR with the project details; feel free to start with the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/supporting-docs/projects/template.md">template</a>, and you can also add images (thumbnail and/or a main picture for the project page) to the images subfolder (just use the same relative URL that is in the template). Any kind of project using Matrix is welcome; if you are unsure which category to use, just use &quot;other&quot;.</p>
<p>Jekyll requires a date in the project filename; we use the date to sort the various project lists (newest projects first). It might be best to submit new entries with a date like 2015-01-01.</p>

                <p>So, you've installed an configured synapse and started chatting from your very own Matrix home server? What's the next step? Well, right now you're probably accessing your new home server over plaintext HTTP, which is bad, particularly because you'll be sending your password over this connection when you log in. You could connect to Synapse's secure HTTP port, but your browser won't trust it by default because you'd normally need to pay for a certificate that your browser would recognise. That is, until recently!</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a> is a new initiative that issues SSL certificates free of charge, in an effort to make SSL universal on the Internet. In this blog post, we'll be walking through an example of how we can use this service to get ourselves a securely hosted Synapse.</p>
<p>We're going to assume you have a Synapse installed and listening on the standard ports, 8008 and 8448. If not, follow the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/README.rst" target="_blank">Synapse README</a> and come back here when you're done. Everybody ready? Okay, good.</p>
<p>So, in order to get a certificate from Let's Encrypt, we need to prove that we own our domain. The simplest way to do this is to host some special files on our web server. Now, Synapse won't do this. We could use a separate web server, but then we'd have to stop Synapse and start the other web server every time we renewed our certificate, and that means downtime. Instead, let's put our Synapse behind a proper web server and let that serve the files. This has added advantages, including that we can host our Matrix home server on the standard port 443 without having to run Synapse as root.</p>
<p>For this example, we're going to use NGINX, so start by installing NGINX in whatever way your Linux distribution of choice recommends.</p>
<p>Now, you should have a webroot for your new web server somewhere. Hopefully your helpful Linux distribution has started you off with a config file - let's see:</p>
<pre># nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</pre>
<p>We're looking for the 'server' section of that file. We need to make it look something like this:</p>
<pre>    server {'{'}
        # Make sure this is 0.0.0.0: no use listening on 127.0.0.1 or we'll only be
        # serving to ourselves! There's no port here, which means we'll listen on
        # port 80
        listen 0.0.0.0;

        server_name example.com www.example.com;

        access_log /var/log/nginx/example.com.access_log main;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/example.com info;

        # This is where we put the files we want on our site
        root /var/www/examplecom/htdocs;

        # Here's where it gets interesting: This will send any path that starts
        # with /_matrix to our Synapse!

        location /_matrix {'{'}
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8008;
        {'}'}
    {'}'}
</pre>
<p>When you're happy with the look of that file, let's restart the server:</p>
<pre># nginx -s reload
</pre>
<p class="p1">Before we go any further, let's test our new configuration:</p>
<pre>$ curl http://example.com/_matrix/key/v2/server/auto
{'{'}"old_verify_keys":{'{'}{'}'},"server_name":"example.com","signatures":{'{'}"example.com":{'{'}"ed25519:auto":"RWb+w6vHUUokoDgElwG6Cg50ezZvBrzXtJmJIH8jEwI5x0JQ7prn3FwjhbgKTH5jE7J8Ily3HEc4COn4JCCvCA"{'}'}{'}'},"tls_fingerprints":[{'{'}"sha256":"DMbzSZ5Uj7/6p/RT/UtQYJLHm5o0TwBSVYXsqpDdVDs"{'}'}],"valid_until_ts":1455203001035,"verify_keys":{'{'}"ed25519:auto":{'{'}"key":"1YiTDjmE86AlmrbIYE2lyqauV9wPo8jw2kxZAZFfl/Q"{'}'}{'}'}{'}'}
</pre>
<p class="p1">Those are your server's public keys! Now we have a web server running, we can get our SSL certificate. Let's Encrypt have their own client which will automate everything including rewriting your NGINX config file, however that means it has a large number of dependencies and needs to be run as root. For this example, we're going to use the much simpler <a href="https://github.com/diafygi/acme-tiny" target="_blank">acme_tiny.py</a>. I'm going to assume you have a user called, 'letsencrypt', so, as root, let's set up the place for it to write its challenge files:</p>
<pre># mkdir /var/www/examplecom/htdocs/.well-known/acme-challenge
# chown letsencrypt:users /var/www/examplecom/htdocs/.well-known/acme-challenge
</pre>
<p class="p1">Now let's switch to our letsencrypt user:</p>
<pre>$ ssh letsencrypt@example.com
</pre>
<p class="p1">We'll start by getting ourselves a copy of acme_tiny.py:</p>
<pre>$ git clone https://github.com/diafygi/acme-tiny.git
</pre>
<p class="p1">Now let's set up a directory structure (let's say we might want to manage more than one domain someday):</p>
<pre>$ mkdir examplecom
$ cd examplecom
$ ln -s /var/www/examplecom/htdocs/.well-known/acme-challenge challenges
</pre>
<p class="p1">Now, we'll need to generate two keys for Let's Encrypt, and account key and a domain key. The former is what we use to identify ourselves to Let's Encrypt and the latter is the key we use to do the actual SSL.</p>
<pre>$ openssl genrsa 4096 &gt; letsencrypt_examplecom_account.key
Generating RSA private key, 4096 bit long modulus
..++
.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
$ chmod 600 letsencrypt_examplecom_account.key
$ openssl genrsa 4096 &gt; letsencrypt_examplecom_domain.key
Generating RSA private key, 4096 bit long modulus
.............++
.............................................................................................................................................................................................++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
$ chmod 600 letsencrypt_examplecom_domain.key
</pre>
<p class="p1">Now, store those keys somewhere safe! After you've done that, let's generate a certificate request for our domain. Note that we're requesting one for both example.com and www.example.com: this isn't strictly necessary for Matrix but could be useful if we want to host a website too.</p>
<pre>$ openssl req -new -sha256 -key letsencrypt_examplecom_domain.key -subj "/" -reqexts SAN -config &lt;(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf &lt;(printf "[SAN]\\nsubjectAltName=DNS:example.com,DNS:www.example.com")) &gt; examplecom.csr
</pre>
<p class="p1">Okay, we have our keys, our certificate request, and somewhere to host our challenge files, so we're ready to request a certificate! Be careful about this part and make sure you've got everything right, because Let's Encrypt enforce strict rate limits on the number of certificates you can request for one domain. Here we go:</p>
<pre>$ python ~/acme-tiny/acme_tiny.py --account letsencrypt_examplecom_account.key --csr examplecom.csr --acme-dir challenges/ &gt; examplecom.crt
Parsing account key...
Parsing CSR...
Registering account...
Registered!
Verifying example.com...
example.com verified!
Verifying www.example.com...
www.example.com verified!
Signing certificate...
Certificate signed!
</pre>
<p class="p1">Is that it, did it work? Well, let's see:</p>
<pre>$ openssl x509 -in examplecom.crt -noout -text
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)

        Subject: CN=example.com
        Subject Public Key Info:
[etc]
</pre>
<p class="p1">Congratulations, you have an official, signed certificate for your domain! Now, before we can use it, we need to add the Let's Encrypt certificate to it, because our web server needs to send both:</p>
<pre>$ wget https://letsencrypt.org/certs/lets-encrypt-x3-cross-signed.pem
--2016-02-06 23:38:55--  https://letsencrypt.org/certs/lets-encrypt-x3-cross-signed.pem

$ cat examplecom/examplecom.crt lets-encrypt-x3-cross-signed.pem &gt;examplecom/examplecom_cert_chain.crt
</pre>
<p class="p1">Now's let's symlink it in place, along with the domain key, so we can renew it easily later. We'll need to be root again for this:</p>
<pre>$ ssh root@example.com
# ln -s /home/letsencrypt/examplecom/examplecom_cert_chain.crt /etc/ssl/nginx/examplecom_cert.pem
# ln -s /home/letsencrypt/examplecom/letsencrypt_examplecom_domain.key /etc/ssl/nginx/examplecom_key.pem
</pre>
<p class="p1">Now, one more crucial thing we have to do before using our SSL is to give NGINX some Diffie Hellman parameters. This is a good thing to do for any SSL configuration (it will increase your score on <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/" target="_blank">SSL Labs</a>) but it's absolutely crucial for us because Synapse will only negotiate forward secret connections, so otherwise other Matrix home servers will refuse to talk to us! (Technically, Synapse also support elliptic curve Diffie Hellman, which doesn't need DH parameters, but not all Synapses will support this.) You'll already have some Diffie Hellman parameters from you existing Synapse, so you could use them:</p>
<pre># cp /home/synapse/synapse/matrix.example.com.tls.dh /etc/ssl/nginx/examplecom_dhparams.pem
</pre>
<p class="p1">...or you can generate your own. You'll probably want to do this on your desktop or laptop if you have OpenSSL installed, it will be much faster:</p>
<pre>$ openssl dhparam -out examplecom_dhparams.pem 2048
Generating DH parameters, 2048 bit long safe prime, generator 2
This is going to take a long time
........................................................+................[etc, etc]
$ scp examplecom_dhparams.pem root@example.com:/etc/ssl/nginx/examplecom_dhparams.pem
</pre>
<p class="p1">Now, let's get our new certificate in action! Open up your NGINX config file again, and add another server block that look like this:</p>
<pre>    server {'{'}
        listen 0.0.0.0:443;
        server_name example.com www.example.com;
        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/nginx/examplecom_crt.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/nginx/examplecom_key.pem;
        ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/nginx/examplecom_dhparams.pem;

<p class="p2">It looks pretty similar to our previous server block, except for all that stuff about SSL in the middle. We're pointing NGINX at our certificate, key and Diffie Hellman parameter files and specifying what protocols and ciphers we want our server to talk. The long list here is taken from <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS" target="_blank">Mozilla's Server Side TLS guidelines</a> and is their 'Intermediate' list. See that page for more information on what that means, and choose a different list of ciphers if you prefer: just remember we must support at least the ephemeral Diffie Hellman ciphers, or other home servers won't talk to us!</p>
<p class="p2">Now let's restart our NGINX and see if it works:</p>
<pre># nginx -s reload
</pre>
<p class="p2">...and that command again, this time with https:</p>
<pre>$ curl https://example.com/_matrix/key/v2/server/auto
{'{'}"old_verify_keys":{'{'}{'}'},"server_name":"example.com","signatures":{'{'}"example.com":{'{'}"ed25519:auto":"RWb+w6vHUUokoDgElwG6Cg50ezZvBrzXtJmJIH8jEwI5x0JQ7prn3FwjhbgKTH5jE7J8Ily3HEc4COn4JCCvCA"{'}'}{'}'},"tls_fingerprints":[{'{'}"sha256":"DMbzSZ5Uj7/6p/RT/UtQYJLHm5o0TwBSVYXsqpDdVDs"{'}'}],"valid_until_ts":1455203001035,"verify_keys":{'{'}"ed25519:auto":{'{'}"key":"1YiTDjmE86AlmrbIYE2lyqauV9wPo8jw2kxZAZFfl/Q"{'}'}{'}'}{'}'}
</pre>
<p class="p1">Hooray! You should now be able to open a browser to https://example.com/matrix/ and log in securely over SSL!</p>
<h2 id="renewing-your-certificate">Renewing Your Certificate</h2>
<p class="p1">Now, there's one important step left, and that's to set up renewal for the certificate, otherwise we'll find our shiny new SSL will stop working in three months time. We can use the same acme_tiny command to do this:</p>
<pre>$ python ~/acme-tiny/acme_tiny.py --account letsencrypt_examplecom_account.key --csr examplecom.csr --acme-dir challenges/ &gt; examplecom.crt

</pre>
<p class="p1">Synapse will automatically pick up the new certificate, but we'll need to tell NGINX to reload:</p>
<pre># nginx -s reload
</pre>
<p class="p1">Setting up a cronjob to automate this is left as an exercise to the reader!</p>
<h2 id="federation-behind-the-http-proxy">Federation behind the HTTP Proxy</h2>
<p class="p1">If you like, you can stop reading now: our clients can access our home server securely but other home server are still talking to our Synapse directly on port 8448. This is fine, and if you're happy with this, you can stop reading now. But remember how we made sure other Synapses could talk to our NGINX? Well, why not put federation behind our new web server too?</p>
<p class="p1">Now, we need to do a couple of things to make this work: were you looking carefully at the JSON those curl commands returned? If you were, you might have noticed a key called, 'tls_fingerprints'. Our home server serves up a fingerprint of the TLS certificate its using from this API, and we've just given our web server a different certificate, so we need to give Synapse our new certificate.</p>
<p class="p1">How are we going to tell other home servers to talk to our NGINX instead? Well, ultimately we're going to change our DNS SRV record to point at port 443 instead of port 8448, but that change could take a while to propagate through caches, so let's test it by having our NGINX listen on port 8448 temporarily. We can do this by copying that same block from above, but with a different port:</p>
<pre>    server {'{'}
        listen 0.0.0.0:8448;
        server_name example.com www.example.com;
    [etc]
</pre>
<p class="p2">Don't restart NGINX just yet: we need to tell our Synapse to stop listening on that port first, so lets do that and give it our new certificate:</p>
<pre>$ nano /home/synapse/synapse/homeserver.yaml
</pre>
<p class="p2">Now we'll want to find and edit the following lines:</p>
<pre>tls_certificate_path: "/etc/ssl/nginx/examplecom_crt.pem"
# We can comment this out, as long as we set no_tls to true below
# tls_private_key_path: "/whatever/path/synapse/generated"
# PEM dh parameters for ephemeral keys
tls_dh_params_path: "/whatever/path/synapse/generated"
# Turn off TLS everywhere (this overrides the listeners section below)
no_tls: True
  - port: 8008
    tls: false
    # We can bind to only localhost since only the local nginx needs to hit this
    bind_address: '127.0.0.1'
    type: http
    # Set this so that Synapse obeys nginx's X-Forwarded-For headers, then IP addresses will be correct in Synapse's logs
    x_forwarded: true
    resources:
      - names: [client, webclient]
        compress: true
      - names: [federation]
        compress: false
</pre>
<p class="p2">Note: if you have an old enough config file that you have 'bind_host' and 'bind_port' directives, now is the time to remove them.</p>
<p class="p2">Now let's restart Synapse and our web server to swap over what's listening on our port 8448:</p>
<pre>$ synctl restart
# nginx -s reload
</pre>
<p class="p2">Now let's try that test again on port 8448:</p>
<pre>$ curl https://example.com:8448/_matrix/key/v2/server/auto
{'{'}"old_verify_keys":{'{'}{'}'},"server_name":"example.com","signatures":{'{'}"example.com":{'{'}"ed25519:auto":"bdca31805e4209f6ff4d644251a29d0cb1dc828a4d6131c57cf8305288f337c0"{'}'}{'}'},"tls_fingerprints":[{'{'}"sha256":"1d9ec66599e229654a79f28e26675fdeb585027553af6d581926e821a6b6527c"{'}'}],"valid_until_ts":1455203001035,"verify_keys":{'{'}"ed25519:auto":{'{'}"key":"1YiTDjmE86AlmrbIYE2lyqauV9wPo8jw2kxZAZFfl/Q"{'}'}{'}'}{'}'}
</pre>
<p class="p1">Notice anything different? The tls_fingerprints part has changed because we now have a different certificate. The signatures/example.com/ed25519:auto value has changed too: that's because that part is a signature of the rest of JSON object, so changing the tls_fingerprints has caused this to change too.</p>
<p class="p1">And that's it! If you're happy everything is working, you can then change your DNS SRV record to point at port 443 instead of 8448, then after leaving a few days for the change to propagate through caches, remove the extra server block from your nginx.conf and restart to stop your nginx listening on port 8448.</p>

<p>Matrix is on its way to Japan where Kegan is attending the <a href="http://tadhack.com/2016/mini-japan/">TADHack-mini</a> (Feb 13th and 14th) and <a href="http://webrtcconference.jp/">WebRTC Conference</a> (Feb 16th and 17th).</p>
<p>Kegan will help hackers with their projects during the TADHack, but first, he will give a talk on Matrix and how it can be used. We are again awarding a <a href="http://www.trossenrobotics.com/">trossen robot</a> to the best hack using Matrix, and we are as always curious to see what kind of cool and crazy ideas people will come up with!</p>
<p>A couple of days later, Kegan will be giving a talk during the <a href="http://webrtcconference.jp/session/#">WebRTC Conference</a>: &quot;The missing signalling layer for WebRTC&quot;. </p>
<p>Both of the talks will be live-translated, and there will also be a translator available during the events, so please come and say hello to Kegan-san! As always, we are also available in the Matrix HQ room, via a client like <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">Vector</a> or <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/try-matrix-now/">any other client</a>!</p>

Matrix will be represented at the 32nd Chaos Computer Club, Dec 27th-30th, 2015. We hope to be arranging an <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Assembly:Matrix">assembly</a>, where people can come along to learn about Matrix and our recent work on end-to-end encryption, find out what they can use Matrix for - and also do some hacking at the same time!</p>
<p><b>UPDATE: We've snagged a table for the assembly at: &quot;hackcenter room with C-base, a table along the pathway&quot;. In practice only Mjark is there from Matrix and may be moving around, so may be easiest to coordinate meetups via #32C3:matrix.org</b></p>
<p>The session is free of charge, although you do need a ticket to the Congress itself.</p>
<p>If you are interested, please register by sending an email to mark@matrix.org. All you need for the session is curiosity - but do bring your own laptop if you want to hack as well!</p>
<p>Anyone is welcome to join - it will basically be a fairly open-ended chat about all things relating to Matrix, and a good chance to do some deep digging into Matrix itself.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>

<p>This release includes a new version of MatrixKit (v0.2.7) that you can take advantage of in your MatrixKit powered app. There are several changes in MatrixKit since the last release, including improved performance, better handling of unrecognized certificates and fixes of reported crash issues. We have also introduced read receipts, improved the chat history display, made room invites more obvious, and fixed a whole lot of JIRA issues.</p>
<p>You can find the full list of changes in the MatrixKit <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-kit/blob/master/CHANGES.rst">CHANGES.rst</a> and the Matrix Console iOS <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-console/blob/master/CHANGES.rst">CHANGES.rst</a> files.</p>
