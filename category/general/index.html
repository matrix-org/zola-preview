                <p>A few weeks ago we found ourselves in Brussels to participate in the second <a href="https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/dma/dma-workshops_en">stakeholder workshop for the Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">DMA</a> is new antitrust/competition regulation from Europe which came into force in November, whose objective is to make digital markets more competitive by forcing gatekeepers (i.e. large tech companies) to reconsider some of their anti-competitive or self-preferencing practices. Gatekeepers are defined as companies which have a clear position of influence in a given market (based on revenue / market cap / number of users thresholds), and “an entrenched and durable position”. The process for designating which companies count as gatekeepers will start in May 2023.</p>
<p>The DMA touches upon different key topics, from self-preferencing behaviour to app store management practices - but most importantly includes interoperability for “number-independent interpersonal communication services” (NIICS), otherwise known as chat and voice/video calling and conferencing services (social media was left out for now). </p>
<p><a href="https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/dma/dma-workshops/interoperability-workshop_en">This particular workshop</a> was focused on the latter: interoperability between messaging services, with the aim of getting the different stakeholders of the industry in the same place to discuss how the legislation could be implemented.  The whole idea is to figure out a practical way in which WhatsApp could interoperate with iMessage, Google Messages and others, creating an interoperable communication network where users are no longer locked into communication silos and pick their preferred service provider without compromising on who they can talk to. </p>
<p>About 900 people participated online, and around 80 people were present in person: the maximum the room could hold. It was particularly fun to see representatives from the whole industry turning up in person, including folks from XMPP, MIMI (the new IETF working group on messaging interoperability), MLS, us from Matrix obviously (alongside Matrix ecosystem representatives from Beeper and NeoChat!) - all together with the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (<a href="https://www.berec.europa.eu/en/berec/what-is-berec">BEREC</a>), civil society representatives (like the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (<a href="https://VZBV.de">VZBV</a>) and European Digital Rights (<a href="https://edri.org">EDRi</a>)), mobile network operators, local network agencies, and obviously some of those who are likely to be designated as gatekeepers, such as Meta, Apple and Google.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-was-discussed">So what was discussed?</h2>
<p>All of the workshop proceeds were livestreamed and archived by European Commission’s <a href="https://webcast.ec.europa.eu/dma-workshop-2023-02-27">webcasting service</a> and <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/legal-notice_en#copyright-notice">released</a> under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence, so we’ve taken the liberty of republishing them split up into chapters so that folks can quickly refer to the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="panel-1-introduction-to-horizontal-interoperability-between-messaging-services-goals-challenges-and-potential-solutions">Panel 1: Introduction to horizontal interoperability between messaging services: goals, challenges and potential solutions</h3>
<p>The first panel focused on setting up the scene and highlighting the challenges expected during the implementation phase, featuring <a href="https://www.soi.unitn.it/staff/simonetta-vezzoso/">Simonetta Vezzoso</a> (Professor of Economics at The University of Trento), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiaracaccinelli">Chiara Caccinelli</a> (Co-chair - Digital Markets WG at <a href="https://www.berec.europa.eu/">BEREC</a>), <a href="https://www.vzbv.de/en/policy-work/experts">Suzanne Blohm</a> (Policy officer at <a href="https://www.vzbv.de/">Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverbands (VZBV)</a>) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-penfrat">Jan Penfrat</a> (Senior Policy Advisor at <a href="https://edri.org/">EDRi</a>). There was a lot of emphasis around the risks of gatekeepers dragging their feet, or choosing the solution which makes it harder for SMEs or self-hosters to interoperate, as well as the challenge of introducing the new paradigm of interoperability for messaging without losing the usability aspect - see below for the full scope:</p>

<h3 id="panel-2-exploring-the-technical-aspects-of-interoperability-part-1-end-to-end-encryption-security-of-the-service">Panel 2: Exploring the technical aspects of interoperability (Part 1): end-to-end encryption, security of the service</h3>
<p>Then, after a quick lunch, the second panel went into the nitty gritty of how end-to-end encrypted interoperable messaging (1:1 messaging is the first milestone to be delivered, hence the focus) could actually be implemented by the gatekeepers. The panel starred <a href="https://www.roeslpa.de/">Paul Rösler</a> from <a href="https://fau.de/">FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg</a>, who gave a great overview of end-to-end encryption in general, <a href="https://alissacooper.com/">Alissa Cooper</a> from Cisco who explained the merits of open interoperable protocols, <a href="https://educatedguesswork.org/about/">Eric Rescorla</a> from Mozilla explaining the merits of standardisation, yours truly from Matrix explaining and demonstrating how one can actually use a standardised open protocol to interoperate without sacrificing privacy (effectively fleshing out our <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/29/how-do-you-implement-interoperability-in-a-dma-world">blog</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/25/interoperability-without-sacrificing-privacy-matrix-and-the-dma">posts</a> from last year) and then finally <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-hurley-24424231">Stephen Hurley</a> from Meta to explain how they are thinking about DMA obligations.</p>
<p>The panel ended up being a relatively exciting tour through the landscape of DMA practicalities, and it was a lot of fun to actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDnUJXzVn3s&amp;t=3715s">demonstrate a minimum viable prototype of client-side bridging</a> thanks to Travis’s work packaging up standalone client-side bridges for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dma-demo-app-bridge-whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dma-demo-app-bridge-googlechat">Google Chat</a> (strictly for demonstration illustrative purposes only). The slides (and demo) were sadly a bit fuzzy on the recording, but you can see our slides below and grab everyone’s presentations from the <a href="https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/document/download/c59e04bc-f96c-49d9-b161-ad9c24d82367_en?filename=20230227_dma_stakeholders_workshop_panelists_material_0.zip">European Commission website</a>:</p>

<br/>
<p>When DMA first became headline news last year, there was a lot of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/28/23000148/eu-dma-damage-whatsapp-encryption-privacy">very vocal concern</a> that it would somehow end up undermining end-to-end encryption (despite the legislation explicitly requiring that E2EE must be preserved when interoperating). Hopefully this session demonstrated that both the European Commission and the various panellists are dead serious about achieving interoperability without sacrificing privacy - whether that’s via the brute-force approach of client-side bridges, or the more sophisticated approach of client-side bridges which bridge to client-side APIs, or by incrementally or entirely adopting a true open standard protocol like Matrix, XMPP, or whatever MIMI comes up with.</p>

<p>Finally, we launched into the third and final session of the day - a second technical panel to dig into questions of identity, usability, data privacy, consent and anti-abuse in a DMA world.  Relative to the second panel, there were more questions than answers here, as the panellists discussed whether users would need to consent or opt-in/opt-out of interoperability, and debated the various data privacy implications of DMA.  The panel starred Stephen Hurley from Meta again, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-verney">Lucas Verney</a> from <a href="https://www.peren.gouv.fr">PEReN</a>, Markus Klein from <a href="https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/">Bundesnetzagentur</a> and <a href="https://rohan.com/">Rohan Mahy</a> from <a href="https://wire.com">Wire</a> introducing the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/mimi">MIMI working group</a> at IETF.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was a fascinating opportunity to have a front-row seat at history being made, as the various key players finally got down to business on the practical implications of DMA interoperability.</p>
<p>We saw the full spectrum of options on the table, from Meta’s implications that they would simply open their existing API complete with the existing Double Ratchet Encryption, to the pragmatic approach of Matrix (“at first we’ll bridge, and then the players should gradually converge on an open standard”) to the more idealistic approach of MIMI (“everyone should natively adopt an entirely new open standard built on MLS”).  The next step is to establish a reference implementation and approach, and in the end it seems likely that the approach that works will be the one which the gatekeepers can actually practically adopt within the punchy timeframes built into the legislation:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/dma.jpg" alt="DMA timeline" /></p>
<p>You can also check out <a href="https://carlschwan.eu/2023/03/02/digital-market-act-workshop-in-brussels/">Carl Schwan’s writeup</a> (from NeoChat), as well as Eric Rescorla’s braindump on <a href="https://educatedguesswork.org/posts/dma-interop/">DMA interoperability</a> that accompanies his talk.</p>
<p>We live in interesting times, and it’s fascinating to see Matrix’s vision of interoperable communication being cemented into regulation by the EU.  Our view is that as long as the gatekeepers open their APIs and add support to model remote users in their systems, then at least the wider world can implement client-side bridges to crack the door of the gatekeepers open - and then as gatekeepers refresh their stacks and new players emerge, they’ll likely implement the common protocol (if it’s fit for purpose) rather than burn time reinventing the wheel on proprietary solutions.  Meanwhile, the DMA provides welcome encouragement to ensure that open protocols like Matrix can rise to the challenge and fill the gap - whether that’s <a href="https://spec.matrix.org">independently</a> or as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ralston-mimi-matrix-framework/">part of IETF’s MIMI</a> initiative. May the best solution win!</p>

<p>As we send off 2022 with a bang, it makes sense to look back on what we did this year and where we want to go next year. In its holiday special post, the Matrix Foundation has been focusing on the core team's work. This post is focusing on the achievements of the community outside of the Matrix Foundation.</p>
<p>I tried to reach out to as many people I have seen do &quot;stuff&quot; on Matrix and have them write something they would see fitting for a year in review. Now, most people have better things to do between christmas and new years, so I hope you can excuse if some projects are missing. Also I probably forgot like half of the interesting people... HOWEVER! I hope you still enjoy what everyone wrote up. And don't forget to check out the official <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-update-2022">Matrix Holiday Update 2022</a> and of course read you weekly <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix">TWIM</a> to keep up to date with any cool projects you find.</p>
<h2>Nheko D-Bus API</h2>
<p>A D-Bus API for the Nheko Matrix client compatible with KRunner and Rofi.</p>
<p>LorenDB tells us</p><blockquote>
<p>As a dedicated user of all things KDE, I make heavy use of KRunner. Naturally, I wondered if KRunner could be extended to join Matrix. This idea led me to create a D-Bus API in nheko for use on Linux. While it currently only supports a few aspects of the full Matrix experience, this API allows external software to make use of some of nheko's functionality, including searching the room list, opening rooms, joining rooms, and creating DMs. Later, I also added support for setting status messages. Now you can write extensions for software such as <a href="https://github.com/LorenDB/nheko-krunner">KRunner</a> or <a href="https://mzte.de/git/LordMZTE/rofi-nheko">rofi</a>. Alternately, you could make a plugin for your favorite game that sets your status message to let your friends know that you are busy (although no known plugins of this sort exist).</p></blockquote>
<h2>Community Moderation Effort</h2>
<p>A collaborative effort to moderate Matrix communities and to fight spam.</p>
<p>Nico mentions</p><blockquote>
<p>Some of you might have heard of us, but we are a few moderators of very
different communities, who have banded together to fight spam and share the
burden of moderating our communities. Different opinions are very hard to align,
so we have one ban list we can agree on, that only includes the most annoying
spam reasons: automated spam, crypto advertisements, gore posting and similar
stuff. This actually works very well against spammers, that just join one room
after the other to send the same content.</p>
<p>You can subscribe to this ban list here:
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23community-moderation-effort-bl%3Aneko.dev">#community-moderation-effort-bl:neko.dev</a></p>
<p>We are sometimes internally discussing moderation rules, tooling and recent
events.  In the long term we hope to improve the tooling situation as well as
provide a second, stricter ban list, but we are also already very busy just
moderating our own little communities, so don't expect much progress.</p>
<p>If you have a community that has been troubled by organized spam recently, maybe
our ban list can help you. You might also be interested in contacting one of us
to join the effort, just be aware that we are very careful in accepting new
members. We hope you have a spam-free and enjoyable 2023!</p></blockquote>

<p>Ananace contributes</p><blockquote>
<p>The release tracking project that has been running basically non-stop since 2018 (barring a few periods of downtime due to complete database crashes), having tracked many millions of releases for <em>at least</em> five people from my personally hosted instance.</p>
<p>2022 saw the addition of plenty of additional release sources, as well as a complete refactor of the codebase to hopefully support even more sources going forwards. It now tracks loose repositories (signed tags, lightweight tags, and/or releases) on GitHub/GitLab/Gitea/plain git, as well as supporting the tracking of entire namespaces and user stars on GitHub/GitLab/Gitea.</p>
<p>2023 should hopefully see even more work roll in, with some code underway for tracking Docker images and Helm Chart updates, as well as rework of the bot component to have it offer more use.</p>

<h2>Self-Host a Matrix Map Tile Server</h2>
<p>FluffyChat implemented location sharing in Matrix last year. More recently, Element announced support for it. Interesting in Element's announcement is not only the mechanism for sharing a location data point, but also how their matrix clients would display a little map to the recipient and how they would support the case where the data for this map display could be self-hosted. This is a blogpost/guide to show how this could be done. <a href="https://wrily.foad.me.uk/self-host-a-matrix-map-server" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">↗</a></p>
<p>JulianF mentions</p><blockquote>

<h2>Matrix ClassDojo Bridge</h2>
<p>This bridges ClassDojo teacher-to-parent messaging facilities to matrix. <a href="https://lab.trax.im/matrix/cdj-to-matrix" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">↗</a></p>
<p>JulianF mentions</p><blockquote>
<p>I began a project to bridge matrix to the teacher-parent messaging silo ClassDojo, which is popular especially in USA and UK schools.</p>
<p><a href="https://lab.trax.im/matrix/cdj-to-matrix">Matrix ClassDojo Bridge</a></p>
<p>I am motivated by my loathing of being coerced into putting my private communications in yet another silo where I am restricted to accessing my messages and photos through the company's own products which subject me to advertising and engagement tactics (&quot;Your child earned a point -- click to see what for!&quot;), where I cannot easily keep my own copy of my own data (&quot;Subscribe now to keep your memories!&quot;), and all the other typical down-sides of a Big Tech silo.</p>
<p>This scenario is of course exactly where Matrix shines. An ideal fit for a school's messaging needs, scrapping the silo business model, putting the organisation in control of its own data and policies.</p>
<p>In the first half of 2022 I got as far as being able to do an offline demo -- manually running the fetching and bridging stages, with the teacher and class names, story text and photos bridged in the to-matrix direction.</p>
<p>My work on this was generously sponsored by my wife.</p>
<p>Since then, the project has been on hold, seeking further funding.</p>
<p>My next step plan for the bridge, when I can get back to it, is to adjust the bridged output to the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#social-matrix:carnot.cc">matrix-for-social-media</a> formats used in <a href="https://circu.li/">FUTO Circles</a> (previously &quot;Circuli&quot;) and <a href="https://app.minestrix.henri2h.fr/">MinesTRIX</a> to present a familiar and beautiful display.</p>

<p>Aine contributes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ohh, I don't even know where to start and what include, to be honest 😁</p>
<p>The most notable changes were:</p>
<ul>
<li>etke.cc/scheduler brings control over maintenance service and running services to customers. It changed our internal workflows a lot</li>
<li>multilingual support of etke.cc - website, guides, order processing, support. Initially we had 3 supported languages (English, German, Russian) and then dropped Russian</li>
<li>a lot of new components in mdad, starting with cinny and Borg backup and finishing with postmoogle</li>
<li>we developed several new bots and matrix-related tools</li>
</ul>
<p>... Actually, a lot of things were done and much more is in progress, not sure if I can speak about upcoming changes</p>
<p>So, 2022 was awful, scary, heartbreaking (in a bad way), but it also was quite productive</p></blockquote>

<h2>Bram's updates on Elm and activism</h2>
<p>A Matrix SDK in Elm. <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/matrix-axelm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">↗</a></p>
<p>Bram mentions</p><blockquote>
<h3>Experience as a digital activist</h3>
<p>At the Matrix Community Summit 2022, I gave a talk on the struggles as a digital activist if trying to explain concepts like Matrix to politicians. The talk went very well!</p>
<p>I was really impressed by the knowledge and passion that many of the attendees at the Matrix Community Summit displayed, and I feel grateful to have had the opportunity to learn from and such an engaged and informed group of people. I am confident that the insights and perspectives shared at the summit will be invaluable to my activism moving forward, and I hope to have the chance to work with many of you in the future as we continue to strive for a more just and equitable world.</p>
<h3>Implementing Matrix in Elm</h3>
<p>For the past year, I have been looking for ways to implement a Matrix SDK in Elm. Elm is a functional programming language that promises to compile to lightweight JavaScript that raises zero runtime exceptions. This has been quite a learning process and I'm hoping to release a beta version early 2023.</p>
<p>From the past year of trying to build a functional language library, I've learned that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Matrix spec is surprisingly easy to implement in a functional programming language;</li>
<li>There are still a lot of ambiguities left in the Matrix spec that aren't that big of a deal for imperative programming languages, but can mess up your codebase if you're a functional programmer;</li>
<li>There appears to be a need for some single-use clients that are very good at doing a single thing. (Sending automated messages to multiple clients, moderating permissions across multiple rooms, auto-sending policies, exploring unknown access tokens).</li>
<li>A lot of SDK development still revolves heavily around Element and Synapse implementation. Some events weren't part of spec yet while already widely implemented because either of those two codebases supported it.</li>
<li>The Elm compiler is VERY strict and unforgiving, which can be annoying at times but creates some very robust results. My hope is that rolling out client implementations will be relatively quick and easy as soon as the SDK implementation is ready.</li>
</ul>
<p>Progress on the Elm SDK can be found over <a href="https://github.com/noordstar/matrix-axelm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a> but will be updated in TWIM as well. You can also view my side project of a custom event type directory over at <a href="https://matrix.directory" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://matrix.directory</a></p>

<h2>Nico's delight initiative</h2>
<p>Random Matrix related updates from Nico.</p>
<p>Nico mentions</p><blockquote>
<p>Nobody enjoys encountering bugs on a platform they use. So one of my goals for 2022 was to fix some of the bugs I hear often about in the hope it improves the reputation Matrix has. This often involves projects or functionality I don't personally use, but that I can still contribute to. I think I made some progress on it. For example I fixed a bug that prevented all calls using Element Web on servers, that were not Synapse. Similarly I opened a pull request to Element Android repo, where users would get pinged by replying to a user whose userid starts with a room ping like @roomba (however that sadly isn't merged yet). I also made various fixes to Synapse, especially related to notifications.</p>
<p>More long term I tried to push dehydrated devices forward (partially because of my day job) by implementing the second iteration of it: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3814">MSC3814: Shriveled Sessions</a> as well as writing MSCs to one day get rid of reply fallbacks (by deprecating it and with support of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3664">MSC3664</a> allow for better control over notifications from replies. Similarly I pushed forward <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3266">MSC3266: Room Summaries</a> to improve the experience when joining rooms via knocking or restricted joins or just previewing rooms in general. (I implemented the federation parts of that MSC in Synapse as well as in several parts of Nheko).</p>
<p>My current work is on improving presence, since that has some fun edge cases. Fingers crossed that works out next year and I find a few more things to drive by fix. Do you have anything you have seen come up often? Maybe 2023 is the year to try to fix one of the bugs you encountered far too often? It is always easier to fix stuff, that has been annoying you, so why not try and make your own life on Matrix a little bit better? Most projects are pretty open to contributors and it also often teaches you some new skills, so there is nothing to lose but lots of time!</p></blockquote>

<h2>Postmoogle</h2>
<p>An Email to Matrix bridge. Postmoogle is an actual SMTP server that allows you to send and receive emails on your matrix server. It can't be used with arbitrary email providers, because it acts as an actual email provider itself, so you can use it to send emails from your apps and scripts as well. <a href="https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/postmoogle" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">↗</a></p>
<p>Aine reports</p><blockquote>
<p>At <a href="https://etke.cc">etke.cc</a> we love matrix, but have to use email as well, especially for some notification things and communication with customers. Let's face it: email ecosystem is awful, there is no really usable and nice looking email clients that allow you to collaborate and use &quot;hivemind&quot; to work on emails, there is no simple backend implementations that will just work with simple configuration, and you have to dig into all that stuff on your own to understand how it works and configure it...</p>
<p>So, we already had experience in bringing stuff into matrix and we decided to do the same for email, that's how Postmoogle was born.</p>
<p>Of course, there was email2matrix, but it's too hard to configure and it's intended only to receive messages.</p>
<p>Our &quot;20 minutes adventure&quot; to develop it was a hell ride with several weeks of nearly full-time working on it even on weekends, and during that time we literally studied SMTP protocol using RFCs, Wikipedia and source code of other mail servers (shoutout to Maddy - you guys did amazing work!).</p>
<p>It was a tough fight, but the result is satisfying - you can get an email server that handles 99% of usual email cases and uses matrix as frontend.</p>
<p>So, what's the result?</p>
<ul>
<li>we use Postmoogle for customer support</li>
<li>we offer it to customers</li>
<li>we have cases when people ditched regular email service (like gmail) and use postmoogle as the only email account</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we have other ideas with it, but even now it's pretty satisfying results</p></blockquote>

<h2>Gwmngilfen's Matrix Year</h2>
<p>Gwmngilfen gives an update about their work on Matrix in 2022.</p>
<p>Gwmngilfen tells us</p><blockquote>
<p>While 2021 was a big year for me in Matrix, 2022 has been one of steady progress on various projects. Being a community architect, much of those projects are &quot;communities on Matrix&quot; rather than code, but hey! We need users 😀. So, here's what I've been up this year...</p>
<h3><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#space:ansible.com">#space:ansible.com</a></h3>
<p>Ansible started on it's Matrix journey <a href="https://emeraldreverie.org/2021/07/08/ansible_and_matrix">last year</a> but the arguments I made then have proven solid. The community has seen steady decline in the number of IRC users, but a steady rise in the number of Matrix users - enough to make a positive trend overall. As of last month, we're now at over 50% of unique MXIDs talking each day coming from Matrix vs IRC. That's a huge milestone to have reached in just over a year!</p>
<p>We also used Matrix as a key part of our message to the wider tech landscape as part of our Keynote at AnsibleFest. I don't want to make this too product-y, but you can check out that video <a href="https://youtu.be/J7YRaPzKw4A?t=1819">here</a> and also the interview my colleagues Adam and Carol <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EQjSaWRWyQ">here</a> (that's worth a look, Adam crowbars Matrix into almost every sentence 😁)</p>
<p>Steady progress isn't eye catching, but I'm so pleased that the move has been a positive one, and I hope it continues in 2023.</p>
<h3><a href="https://matrix.to/#/#rlang:matrix.org">#rlang:matrix.org</a></h3>
<p>Since part of my work involves doing data science, I've also been trying to boost the presence of the Rstats world on Matrix. The community there is small so far, but we're super supportive and trying to build out our presence. My eventual goal is to make it big enough to be worth setting up a bridge to the larger Slack R4DS community (R for Data Science), but we're not there yet. If you use R at all, come see us!</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/GregSutcliffe/ChatStat/">ChatStat for data on your Matrix Rooms</a></h3>
<p>The one Matrix project I did get done this year (although it hasn't been updated in ... a while) is an R library for producing reports on Matrix rooms. I use this for gathering data on the Ansible community regularly, and it comes in two parts. The first part is the API calls to get all the events for a set of rooms over a given time and arrange it in a nice rectangular format. The second part uses this tabular data to produce reports on when people talk, who talks the most, and so on. It's been very useful to me over the past few months to show how the trends I talk about above have developed.</p>

The past two years we decided to run the conference online.</p>
<h3>How did we use matrix?</h3>
<p>We decided to run a homeserver bridged with our discord. We wanted to take careful consideration to users who have never used matrix before, and offer some background information to enable them to use it even if they were feeling unsure. Along with running our own homeserver and element instance, We also made a Space that users can join to automatically see all the rooms available for the conference. When a user creates an account on our homeserver, they are automatically placed in a few key rooms such as the Space, #CTF, #general, and #announcements. Check it out on <a href="https://carolinacon.org/coms.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://carolinacon.org/coms.html</a></p>
<p>We didn't want anyone to feel left out, so all rooms are mirrored. One challenge this faced was getting permissions to work properly with rooms such as #announcements. The usage of a Space was generally positive in terms of increasing room desirability in Matrix. It was also nice to be able to include the local 2600 room into our space, something that we couldn't do with Discord.</p>
<h3>Stats</h3>
<p>We already had a large userbase on discord, but still had good user interaction on both sides. 150 users interacted in the #general chat. Of those users, 113 were from discord. Of the 37 Matrix only users, we had 7 separate homeservers. Its really cool to see that people who where already on Matrix, decided to federate in. Almost all homeservers had more then one person join, which is good to see.</p>
<p>In the future as we go back to in an person conference, we will continue to run the an online portion. The community seemed to really enjoy it, and we consider it a success as we were able to increase our outreach to world wide. Check us out at <a href="https://carolinacon.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://carolinacon.org/</a> , we would love to chat!</p>

<h2>This Year in Trixnity</h2>
<p>Trixnity is a multiplatform Matrix SDK written in Kotlin. You can write clients, bots, appservices and servers with it. This SDK supports JVM (also Android), JS and Native as targets for most modules. Ktor is used for the HTTP client/server and kotlinx.serialization for the serialization/deserialization. <a href="https://gitlab.com/trixnity/trixnity/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">↗</a></p>
<p>Benedict mentions</p><blockquote>
<p>Trixnity made some huge steps towards a fully featured cross platform matrix SDK written in Kotlin.</p>
<p>Starting with version 1.0.0 in January I added support for cross signing, secrets and key backup.</p>
<p>Version 2.0.0 in April included a large refactoring. This allows you to share a lot code between server and client implementations of the Matrix APIs. For example you can now implement a server with Trixnity. Also Olm has been bundled into most release files, push rules are evaluated, there is a new better TimelineEvent retrieving API and many more. JS has been enabled for the last module, so Trixnity is now fully multiplatform capable. With v2.3.0 dependency injection has been added to Trixnity to make it even more configurable.</p>
<p>The next big release 3.0.0 was in November. We added support for realm as database backend (e. g. for iOS), allowed to exchange the MediaStore, calculate power levels and many more. Some APIs in trixnity-client has been purified, because I improved the StateFlowCache. The developer experience has increased even more with 3.1.0 in December. It adds a completely new Timeline abstraction.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Nheko</h2>
<p>The motivation behind the project is to provide a native desktop app for Matrix that feels more like a mainstream chat app (Element, Telegram etc) and less like an IRC client. <a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">↗</a></p>
<p>Nico reports</p><blockquote>
<p>What a year, eh? I don't know if as much happened in your lives as did in mine, but certainly stuff happened! And that certainly was the case for Nheko too! There have been plenty of new and returning faces. Before I go into more detail what happened with Nheko, I'd like to prefix it with a thank you to some specific people, who noticeably contributed to Nheko in the last year on a regular basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>LorenDB, who while causing us a lot of trouble by breaking stuff, also tackles many of the more annoying issues and brings a lot of creativity to problems and their solutions.</li>
<li>MaltE, who despite being usually busy, reworked most of our mobile UI and gave Nheko a pretty bubble mode.</li>
<li>q234rty, who seems to have a solution to every issue and even upstreamed some of those patches to the KDE Qt collection, so that some of the annoying Wayland bugs won't bother many users anymore.</li>
<li>Linerly, Priit and many of the other translators, who tirelessly keep our translations up to date, even if they have to re-translate whole paragraphs after I fixed a single comma...</li>
<li>And many of the other contributors and the community, who report and fix issues as well as just make the whole journey more enjoyable!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now with that out of the way, where are we going?</p>
<p>Nheko got plenty of new features, even though some of them I tried hard to avoid for a long time! For example you can now send confetti. I prefer to toggle that off, because I think it can be distracting, but it is undeniable, that it looks very fun and fun is very important!</p>
<p>Another one is threads. Nheko now supports them, but I would have liked for threads to work differently. Some features, like notification counts for each thread, we skip out on, since it seems very hard to support well. Instead we integrate threads into the timeline and you can filter them out. Ideally threads would behave like dynamic subrooms, with titles and listed below the room list entry, but that seems not doable with the current design of threads in the specification. So we chose a design, that is still useful, but doesn't run into such limitations.</p>
<p>Apart from that we really started investing into our communities support (which is how we call our UX for spaces). While showing communities as a filter is already useful, you can now also modify those filters. Nheko now shows you notification counts, suggests you to join the space for a community (if possible) and allows you to apply permission changes across the whole community.</p>
<p>Speaking of permissions, we invested a lot into improving our management and moderation tooling. With this you can now fine tune join rules for a room (with toggles for knocking, restricted joins and more), edit the permissions using a role-like interface, edit the addresses for a room, edit your sticker packs and more. You can also knock on rooms now, which is a way to request access to a room without it having to be public or manually messaging someone for an invite and we can now show policy lists.</p>
<p>Oh, one thing that definitely deserves a mention, we had our first official CVE! Now, you might think that is not worth celebrating, but it does feel like Nheko is growing up. Partially this is thanks to Github making it easy to file CVEs for security issues though. Who would have thought we ever would have our own CVE entry? We certainly need to improve our test coverage and hardening against such issues, though to be fair in this case I pretty much already wrote a comment about what the problem would be, but just didn't fix it properly... We however are also constantly improving our encryption in general, so hopefully it only becomes more secure from now on. Part of that is fallback keys, which make it easier to come back after a long period away.</p>
<p>Nheko now also evaluates notifications locally. This is especially great for encrypted rooms, since before the server mostly guessed what should notify or not. But it also means you get highlighted when mentioned now, which makes it much easier to find where you were notified. We also now have a line where you last left off reading the room, which is much more useful than I initially wanted to admit and I use it a lot. We also have experimental support for MSC3664, which allows us to hopefully eventually get rid of reply fallbacks, by evaluating the reply relation instead of relying on every message to include the name of who you replied to for highlight purposes...</p>
<p>We also improved performance, however as always anytime you do, you end up adding features, that slow you down again. However current Nheko should still start up significantly faster than 2021 Nheko.</p>
<p>Speaking of improvements, we have made a few for macOS this year. Apple Silicon is now natively supported, so Rosetta is no longer needed to run Nheko. This means improved battery life and performance! At least on Apple Silicon, launching Nheko on macOS should now be roughly as fast as Alt+Tab-ing to another window. Additionally, you can now reply to messages straight from the notification in the Notification Center.</p>
<p>One thing I didn't imagine we would ever have is a D-Bus API. This means you now can do some limited interactions with Nheko via the D-Bus API, like switching rooms using KRunner or Rofi! For FOSDEM we also added some support for widgets, because I wanted to be able to participate in the online FOSDEM without running a second client. This however is an incomplete experience, since... why run a browser in Nheko, if you have a perfectly capable browser client you can use for widgets? Nheko just shows you how to open a widget in a browser.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, we also significantly improved our support for the PinePhone. We now have a bubble layout, which looks better on mobile than the normal layout without bubbles. There has been significant work to make dialogs fit on mobile screens as well as allowing interaction using touch in almost all places. If you want to play with a PinePhone, definitely give Nheko a try and tell us, how you like it!</p>
<p>You might have noticed that we spent a lot of work on moderation tooling and that is probably something we will continue. I have a lot of ideas on how to integrate policy lists with spaces as well as using them to auto-decline invites, automatically ban people and more. How cool would it be if you could ban people community wide using a &quot;banned members&quot; editor in Nheko that is compatible with Mjolnir? And have permissions in spaces apply globally, maybe with some tweaks based on room types? There are a lot of cool ideas out there and we will certainly be experimenting with them.</p>
<p>Another topic will be building out our call support. I want to be able to use Nheko for my gaming sessions. Just drop into a voice chat room and talk to each other. Maybe do my work conference calls, including presentations as well or do remote help for my parents and grandparents over Matrix! We also really need to support calls on other platforms.</p>
<p>Which brings us on the last big goal: We do want to eventually switch to Qt6. We did have a branch testing out how difficult that would be and it was doable, but we were mostly blocked on GStreamer not supporting Qt6 yet. This is fixed in GStreamer 1.24, which should be out soon, so this is probably the time we can start looking into finalizing the port. Qt6 will fix A LOT of Wayland issues and give us a lot of new optimization opportunities. Maybe that is the year we can get below 100MB RAM usage on my ever growing account and make every room switch feel instant.</p>
<p>Well... this was a bit of a long one? Certainly it wasn't the work of one person. The Nheko community seems to just be constantly growing and there are so many people contributing, that it really makes me love open source! Thank you! All of you! It has been a great year (Nheko wise) and I hope 2023 becomes even greater! Have a great year!</p>

<h2>Timo Kösters' year in Matrix</h2>
<p>Timo gives an update about Conduit and their year on Matrix. <a href="https://conduit.rs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">↗</a></p>
<p>Timo on Conduit ⚡️ tells us</p><blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone, I am the maintainer of the Conduit Matrix project and this year my goal was to make Conduit more reliable. I've released three major updates this year, going from v0.2 to v0.5:</p>
<p>For example, the admin room received a lot of love this year. It's a Conduit-specific way of controlling the Matrix server using a chat bot. Commands are parsed using <code>clap</code> and perform actions like creating or deactivating users, adding appservices or listing rooms.</p>
<p>Conduit now supports RocksDB as the database, which is better than the previous ones, but still has some problems. I have worked on a new database abstraction layer that would allow using PostgreSQL in the future.</p>
<p>I have also worked on all sorts of bug fixes. End-to-end encrypted chats work reliably, Server ACLs are respected, the user directory hides private users and so on.</p>
<p>These and many, many other fixes allow me to use Conduit for most of my Matrix interactions now and most of the issues I encounter are client and not server bugs, see <a href="https://conduit.rs/issues" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://conduit.rs/issues</a></p>
<p>My goal for 2023 is adding all the modern features we need to be competitive with Synapse, like threading, space exploration, registration tokens and so on.</p>
<p>I also want to contribute to the Matrix spec and implement my ideas in Conduit, for example changing state resolution to speed up room joining.</p>
<p>I can't promise to finish all of this next year. I will finish my Bachelor's degree next year and for now I'm a full time student working on these things in the remaining time.</p>
<p>Thanks to all my individual sponsors this year and to FUTO ( <a href="https://futo.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://futo.org/</a> ) for making this worth it financially as well. <a href="https://liberapay.com/timokoesters" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://liberapay.com/timokoesters</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>Sticker/emoji pack collection</h2>
<p>Tastytea maintains a collection of MSC2545 sticker pack rooms and gives an update about how the experience has been so far. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23stickers-and-emojis%3Atastytea.de" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">↗</a></p>
<p>tastytea mentions</p><blockquote>
<p>At the end of 2021 i made a room with a Blobcat emoji pack, and since i could
not find a place to announce it, i started <a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23stickers-and-emojis%3Atastytea.de">a space to collect rooms with
sticker/emoji packs</a>.
It began with 3 rooms and under 500 images, but with
<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2545">MSC2545</a> getting
implemented in more and more clients in 2022, the space quickly grew and we're
now at 7 rooms with more than 30 packs containing over 2000 stickers and emojis!
<img data-mx-emoticon height="32" src="/blog/img/pixie.town_i2OfzCDAFTltAQ1BlFLITwjx.png" alt="Blobcat tooting a party horn" style="height: 2em;"/></p>
<p>One thing i didn't anticipate was that people started to request new stickers
and sometimes submitted their own. We're not just collectors anymore but also
the prime source for Blobcats on Matrix!<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
If you have a sticker room too, please drop by our lobby and tell us
about it so we can list it and make it known to more people! Do you make your
own Blobcats or want to learn how to? Visit <a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23tastytea_emojis%3Atastytea.de">my
room</a>
so we can spread the blobby joy together! <img data-mx-emoticon height="32" src="/blog/img/pixie.town_A5gZTcUCMSFX0H2ag1kOVkgw.png" alt="Blobcat holding heart in its paws" style="height: 2em;"/></p></blockquote>
<h2>Meetups in Berlin</h2>
<p>Berlin has a vivid Matrix community with not only one, but two Matrix meetups.</p>
<p>jaller94 tells us</p><blockquote>
<p>Berlin has a vivid Matrix community with not only one, but two Matrix meetups.</p>
<p>Once a month, the Matrix User Meetup Berlin (MUMB) invites people to chat about Matrix and meet other users.<br/>In summer this exchange of ideas and starting points into Matrix was sometimes combined with food from the BBQ grill.<br/>For their upcoming events in 2023, check out the room <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#mumb:c-base.org">#mumb:c-base.org</a>. It takes place at c-base on the first Wednesday of a month.<br/>Thanks to the organiser <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@saces:c-base.org">saces</a> for bringing people together!</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have the Berliner Matrix Salon 🍷 (previously called Matrix Meetup Berlin, which made it hard to tell apart from the MUMB).<br/>In the first half of 2022 we had regular meetups for developers and server admins to talk about their Matrix projects. This meetup eventually led to the Matrix Community Summit in August.<br/>We still meet infrequently to discuss our projects and what public events we could host next. We'd love to host a series of presentations at various offices which also appeal to an audience outside the Matrix community (e.g. education, public sector and health care which have a growing Matrix adoption in Germany). Ping me or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@yan:datanauten.de">Yan</a>, if you want to help by being a presenter, have access to an office or know of a particular audience in Berlin to bring Matrix to.<br/>The room is <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-berlin:matrix.org">#matrix-berlin:matrix.org</a>. Feel free to ask when we're meeting next.</p>

<h2>This year in NeoChat</h2>
<p>NeoChat is a client for Matrix, the decentralized communication protocol for instant messaging. It is a fork of Spectral, using KDE frameworks, most notably Kirigami, KConfig and KI18n. <a href="https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">↗</a></p>
<p>Tobias Fella mentions</p><blockquote>
<p>It's been an interesting year, that's for sure :)</p>
<p>Let's start with some statistics:</p>
<p>Some quick git magic shows 689 commits for this year so far; Roughly 200 of those were for translations.</p>
<p>On the topic of translations, NeoChat is currently (almost) fully translated into 17 languages, with 17 others being in progress.</p>
<p>One of the major areas of work this year - like last year - has been end-to-end-encryption, which, as of last week, is released in libQuotient and NeoChat. This means that you can now read new messages and verify your session with other devices. You won't yet be able to recover from (most) undecryptable messages, we're working on implementing those parts of the matrix specification.</p>
<p>NeoChat's user interface saw major improvements this year:</p>
<p>The message list has been improved to be less buggy, adapt better to different form-factors and the different appearance options NeoChat offers, like the &quot;compact&quot; message style.</p>
<p>The compact style also recently gained a sibling in the equivalent style for the room list, which makes the list more compact by not showing the last message of the room.</p>
<p>Input handling has been overhauled, as a result user mentions are now highlighted while writing a message, making them more reliable and appear less magic to the user.</p>
<p>More new features include basic support for room search, improved emoji and reaction handling (including better emoji data, search and a skin tone selector), basic developer tools, support for showing and responding to polls and an improved account switcher. One of my personal highlights is support for collapsing large amounts of state events, which makes low-activity rooms significantly more pleasant to use.</p>
<p>On the moderation side, we've implemented support for reporting messages to the homeserver administrators and improved the kicking and banning support.</p>
<p>Progress on the space support has unfortunately been slower than hoped, with the only result of the GSoC project being the space list that is shown at the top of the room list. Space support will be one of the areas to work on in 2023.</p>
<p>Plasma users have gained some nice integration points with their desktop: File uploads and downloads will now be shown in plasma's job tracker, there is now a D-Bus runner for opening rooms, and you can share messages with purpose-enabled apps.</p>
<p>Finally, we've been working on improving NeoChat's settings. Visually, the application and room settings have been ported to newer components that look significantly nicer, especially on mobile devices. We've also added settings for configuring room visibility, join rules and notifications and added support for configuring a proxy to use when connecting to a homeserver.</p>
<p>In terms of contributors, this year was better than last year, with several people becoming active in development and bug reporting. We're especially excited about having been able to add James Graham as a third maintainer for NeoChat after all his work, focusing mostly on NeoChat's front-end and settings.</p>

<h2>imbev's year in Matrix</h2>
<p>imbev gives an update about what they have been up to this year.</p>
<p>imbev tells us</p><blockquote>
<p>This past year I have worked on several projects using Matrix:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/imbev/matrix-rss-bridge">matrix-rss-bridge</a>
<ul>
<li>This is a bot that can be configured to watch RSS/Atom feeds and relay to Matrix rooms. It is written in Python, configured with a single <code>config.toml</code>, and licensed under the GPLv3.</li>
<li>I don't actively work on it, however I will review and merge contributions that improve the project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/imbev/matrix-debate-bot">matrix-debate-bot</a>
<ul>
<li>This is a bot that &quot;moderates&quot; discussion in Matrix rooms. It does nothing more than provide a signal every 2 minutes. Also in Python, interacted with via &quot;command&quot; messages, and licensed under the GPLv3.</li>
<li>Same thing as the previous project :)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/imbev/matrix-quicksetup">matrix-quicksetup</a>
<ul>
<li>This is a docker compose file and a few config files to help setup a Matrix homeserver and client. The homeserver setup is Conduit, and the client is Cinny. I don't advise that anyone use this in a serious deployment, but if you want to quickly test Matrix entirely on your local machine, this may be useful.</li>
<li>Same as previous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://codeberg.org/imbev/simplematrixbotlib">simplematrixbotlib</a>
<ul>
<li>This is an easy to use bot library for the Matrix ecosystem written in Python. Having taken ownership of the project, I maintain the project with help from @kim:sosnowkadub.de, @moanos:hyteck.de, and others. Thank you for your contributions!</li>
<li>While I anticipate releasing version 3 of simplematrixbotlib, this next project has captured my focus recently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://codeberg.org/imbev/matrix-social">matrix-social</a>
<ul>
<li>matrix-social is a Matrix &quot;Social Media&quot; client. It is a webapp written in Rust using WASM, Yew, and the Matrix Rust SDK. Inspired by the design of Reddit, matrix-social will provide a similar experience, but based entirely upon Matrix. By providing seamless interoperability with Matrix chat clients, matrix-social will extend the Matrix ecosystem without dividing it. matrix-social currently lacks crucial features that will be added soon.</li>
<li>I actively develop matrix-social and will be doing so for the foreseeable future. At the moment, I am porting the styling from the Bulma CSS framework to TailwindCSS for greater control. If you'd like to try out the current state of matrix-social, <a href="https://imbev.codeberg.page/matrix-social/">https://imbev.codeberg.page/matrix-social/</a> is available.

<h2>Kitsune's year in Matrix</h2>
<p>Kitsune, one of the Spec Core Team members and maintainer of the Quotient client for Matrix, gives an update about their work this year as well as some new projects.</p>
<p>kitsune mentions</p><blockquote>
<p>This year hasn't been very productive for me (not in Matrix at least) but a few things are worth a mention.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/quotient-im">Quotient</a></h3>
<p>This year I finally got to diving into the (new) E2EE code for libQuotient that NeoChat fellows started writing back in 2021, and was quite happy to end up collaborating with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tobiasfella:kde.org">Tobias Fella</a> on making it even better, all the way to merging and releasing way overdue libQuotient 0.7.0. The best news for me in all this was not even getting E2EE to its first actually usable release but the fact that libQuotient is no more a one man show. And now that there's yet another libQuotient-based client (with much more solid traction than any client before), there's hope that the project will move on at a somewhat steadier pace.</p>
<h3>Spec Core Team</h3>
<p>I did my share of MSC reviews (much fewer than I'd like to) and carried on with my role of ensuring Element doesn't throw too much weight behind its contributions (although there are a few other people in SCT who seriously push for neutrality in things we work on; so that role is rather formal). One thing that I unfortunately did not find enough time to help with this year but I'm sure we'll make it happen in 2023 is to move our API definitions from Swagger (v2) to OpenAPI v3, ditching all the Swagger extensions we had to add - thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zecakeh">Kevin</a> for driving this home.</p>
<h3>CLUP.chat</h3>
<p>About a year ago I was contacted by folks who wanted to use Matrix as a backend to bridge WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram for scout (and other) communities in Germany and asked me to be their technical advisor. Less than a year later we went live (you can connect the groups <a href="https://clup.chat/">here</a>), soon after ran into rate-limiting issues <em>outside</em> of Matrix (centralised networks, heh...), did the homework, and now busy making the whole thing worth charging money for. The backend is almost entirely vanilla code for Synapse and Mautrix-based bridges, plus a small website and a non-Matrix bot to onboard people.</p>

<h2>Jae's year of Matrix</h2>
<p>Jae gives an update about what they worked on this year.    <a href="From" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">↗</a></p>
<p>Jae (Beep) shares</p><blockquote>
<p>Yet another year well spent on Matrix, which was a bit more <em>dynamic</em> than the previous ones.<br/>
From mitigating spam attacks to creating brand-new projects and also contributing to others, there's no shortage of news.</p>
<h3><a href="https://sr.ht/~jae/cert-monitor/">cert-monitor</a></h3>
<p><code>cert-monitor</code> is a small program made entirely in vanilla Python that checks the validity of your SSL certificates and warn you when they are about to expire.<br/>
The idea for it originated in a Matrix room in which the other administrator would usually forget to renew SSL (bringing down their homeserver).<br/>
The software can send notifications to e-mails and Matrix and other methods are in the works like NTFy (but a bit on stale since Matrix support was the main goal).</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3868">MSC3868: Room Contribution</a></h3>
<p>The MSC3868 (currently still a draft) is a spec proposal by me and Aminda to add a way for rooms to advertise easily official links like code repositories, ways to contribute to translations, donations and more but only showing to users inside the room.<br/>
The start of it is that we noticed that usually users don't even bother reading the topic/MOTD of the room, which renders putting links inside of it just about useless in most cases.<br/>
The proposal is still being refined, but the big lines are there already!</p>
<h3><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jae/gh-bot">gh-bot</a></h3>
<p><code>gh-bot</code> is a small bot made to be used with the webhook function of various Git forges (namely GitHub, GitLab and Gitea/Forgejo).<br/>
The bot itself is pretty simple and will just output new commits, new stars and build statuses in all the rooms the bot is.</p>
<h3><a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jae/hsl-matrix-notifier">hsl-matrix-notifier</a></h3>
<p><code>hsl-matrix-notifier</code> has a bit of an exotic use case: it is made to track problems with the Helsinki public transports company and warn about potential disruptions.<br/>
For now, it is very basic and is still being worked on to have a better version (like if no news, it will still post old stuff when I would like in term something more like an RSS feed).<br/>
When I move, I'll probably spin off this bot to make a local version or even build something, so it can be configured by city.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In the end, this year has been a very dynamic one in the Matrix world, and I can't wait to see what is coming next.<br/>
For my part, I don't intend to stop there, and I have even more Matrix related projects, so stay tuned!<br/>
Oh also, I almost forgot, happy new year Matrixians, stay awesome!</p>

<h2>Ement</h2>
<p>Ement or ement.el is a Matrix client for GNU Emacs, the classic-yet-ever-new text editor and Lisp environment. <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">↗</a></p>
<p>alphapapa contributes</p><blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el">Ement</a> is a Matrix client for <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a>, the classic-yet-ever-new text editor and Lisp environment.  After a couple of years of off-and-on development, 2022 saw the first versioned release, published to <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/">GNU ELPA</a>, the official Emacs package repository (so it's installable into Emacs "out-of-the-box," without any additional configuration).
</p>
<p>
This development was enabled by the maturation and publishing of Ement's underlying HTTP library, <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el">plz</a>, also to ELPA.  And another library, <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/taxy.el">taxy</a>, used in Ement for organizing rooms into meaningful groups for the UI, was also released to ELPA.
</p>
<p>
Along the way, Ement gained useful features like a helpful command menu based on the <a href="https://github.com/magit/transient">Transient</a> library (the one used in <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a>, the popular Emacs frontend to git), the ability to show and send images, files, and reactions, read receipts, room directories and searching, an improved notification system, fancy, configurable room grouping provided by <code>taxy</code>, and many other improvements and fixes.
</p>
<p>
As well, although Ement doesn't support E2EE natively, users have successfully used it via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon">Pantalaimon</a>, the E2EE proxy daemon, allowing Ement to be used with encrypted rooms.

Altogether, Ement now provides a stable, reliable client for Emacs users to "jack in" to the Matrix.  Users and interested parties are invited to join the chat room, <code>#ement.el:matrix.org</code>, where users help each other and announcements are made.
</p>
<p>
Looking forward to 2023, it's planned to improve support for newer versions of the client-server spec.  Sliding-sync support will be especially helpful for improving initial sync times, and the new event-to-timestamp endpoints will aid in searching room events and paging back in history by date.  As well, the next stable release of Emacs, version 29, will include native SQLite support, and the author looks forward to investigating how that might be helpful for Ement (e.g. caching events locally, similar to Element).
</p>
<p>
And as always, like Emacs, Ement is Free Software, so contributions are welcome.  Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, and other feedback on the repo's issue tracker and in the chat room.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Matrix Highlight</h2>
<p>Matrix Highlight is a web annotation tool based on Matrix. It allows you to select and highlight text on webpages, as well as comment on it.

<p>This year, Matrix Highlight switched to manifest V2. This is a browser extension version format supported by Firefox (Chrome too, but not for the web store). Now, you can highlight pages from Firefox! In addition to this, the project switched to using a shadow DOM for styling its UI elements, which makes it significantly less likely to be affected by the style and design of the webpage it's running on.</p>
<p>You can find Matrix Highlight on its <a href="https://github.com/DanilaFe/matrix-highlight">GitHub page</a> or read about it in the <a href="https://danilafe.com/blog/introducing_highlight/">introductory blog post</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Slavi tells us</p><blockquote>
<p>For <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a>, 2022 started with <strong>breaking the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> monopoly</strong> by <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#dendrite-support">adding support</a> for the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a> Matrix homeserver in early January. This required various internal changes so that the <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> playbook would not be Synapse-centric anymore. This groundwork paved the way for continuing in this direction and we <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#conduit-support">added support</a> for <a href="https://conduit.rs/">Conduit</a> in August.</p>
<p>When it comes to the <code>matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</code> Ansible playbook, 2022 was the year of the non-Synapse homeserver implementation. In practice, none of these homeserver implementations seem ready for prime-time yet and there is no migration path when coming from Synapse. Having done our job of adding support for these alternative homeserver implementations, we can say that we're not getting in the way of future progress. It's time for the Dendrite developers to push harder (development-wise) and for the Synapse developers to take a well-deserved long (infinite) break, and we may get to see more people migrating away from Synapse in the next year(s).</p>

</ul>
<p>Besides these major user-visible changes, a lot of work also happened <strong>under the hood</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>we made <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#potential-backward-compatibility-break-major-improvements-to-synapse-workers">major improvements to Synapse workers</a> - adding support for stream writers and for running multiple workers of various kinds (federation senders, pushers, background task processing workers, etc.)</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>we started <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#the-playbook-now-uses-external-roles-for-some-things">splitting various Ansible roles out of the Matrix playbook and into independent roles</a> (e.g. <code>matrix-postgres</code> -&gt; <a href="https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.postgres">com.devture.ansible.role.postgres</a>), which could be included in other Ansible playbooks. In fact, these roles already power a few <strong>interesting other sibling playbooks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/gitea-docker-ansible-deploy">gitea-docker-ansible-deploy</a>, for deploying a <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a> (self-hosted <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> service) server</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These sibling playbooks co-exist nicely with one another due to using <a href="https://traefik.io/">Traefik</a> for reverse-proxying, instead of trying to overtake the whole server by running their own <a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a> reverse-proxy. Hopefully soon, the Matrix playbook will follow suit and be powered by Traefik by default.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, to optimize our <a href="https://etke.cc/">etke.cc managed Matrix server hosting service</a>'s performance (but also individual Ansible playbook runs for people self-hosting by themselves using the playbook), we've <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2x-5x-performance-improvements-in-playbook-runtime">improved playbook runtime 2-5x</a> by employing various Ansible tricks.</p>

<h2>MTRNord's Journey of Matrix 2022</h2>
<p>MTRNord is known for starting way too many interesting projects. Definitely worth checking out!</p>
<p>MTRNord tells us</p><blockquote>
<p>Since I worked on so many projects this year, I am trying to group these here.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-art/pull/121">Matrix-Art</a></h3>
<p>Matrix Art was meant to be a Deviantart or Art Station style image gallery using Matrix. This project, as many others of mine, is currently on ice.</p>
<p>It offered profiles, uploading images and comments using Spaces as FS.</p>
<p>You can see the latest version of it at <a href="https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-art/pull/121">https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-art/pull/121</a></p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-moderation-widget">Matrix Moderation Widget for Mjolnir</a></h3>
<p>A widget made to be a companion to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir">Mjolnir</a>. It offers a form input and lists to view the policy lists.</p>
<p>For 2023 this effort is going into the Moderation bot I am currently developing as part of the Matrix Spam ML project. While not being a widget, similar UX decisions are used.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-fuzz">Matrix Fuzz</a></h3>
<p>A simple fuzzer written in rust to fuzz some endpoints of Synapse.<br/>A Fuzzer is essentially a bruteforce approach to finding bugs. Usually by sending pseudo random characters.</p>
<p>As part of running this, I found a few minor verification issues at Synapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/13510</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/13511</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/13512</li>
<li>https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/13664</li>
</ul>
<p>For 2023 the goal is to fuzz more endpoints, especially within the rooms using fuzzed events.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/MTRNord/mrsbfh">MRSBFH - Matrix-Rust-SDK-Bot-Framework-Helper</a></h3>
<p>In 2022, I also worked on further updating <a href="https://github.com/MTRNord/mrsbfh">https://github.com/MTRNord/mrsbfh</a> which is a command bot framework for the matrix-rust-sdk.</p>
<p>Since then, the SDK massively improved how you interact with the API. Due to this, there are no plans to further develop it as by now the SDK has a sufficient API interface.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/MTRNord/generic-conference-bot/tree/MTRNord/Pretalx">Generic Conference Bot</a></h3>
<p>People likely know the Conference bot from FOSDEM. Back in February, I did work on making it possible to be used more generic without the hard-coded penta integration.</p>
<p>As a result, this branch was created: <a href="https://github.com/MTRNord/generic-conference-bot/tree/MTRNord/Pretalx">https://github.com/MTRNord/generic-conference-bot/tree/MTRNord/Pretalx</a> It offers a way to easily add new backends and adds a pretalx backend. Due to the changes it has, there is currently no way this is possible to upstream, but maybe it will help someone from the community.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-spam-ml">Matrix Spam ML</a></h3>
<p>This project is mainly a project to experiment with using Machine Learning for Moderation as a warning system.</p>
<p>As part of this effort, there is currently an RNN model and a BERT model available. The trainingset is public.</p>
<p>For users, there is both an API endpoint for this available and a Matrix Mod Bot in progress.</p>
<p>You can find more about it at https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-spam-ml or join the chat at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spam-ml:midnightthoughts.space">#matrix-spam-ml:midnightthoughts.space</a></p>
<h3><a href="https://gitlab.nordgedanken.dev/MTRNord/matrix-faq-rasa">Matrix Faq Rasa</a></h3>
<p>This is a RasaX based FAQ Bot project. The goal is to have a NLP based FAQ bot. It currently is very simple and not finished. The goal for 2023 is to continue working on this and getting it to a stable level where people can contribute to.</p>
<h3><a href="https://matrix.turbo.fish">Matrix.org Zola</a></h3>
<p>Last but not least, I did kick off the Zola rewrite of Matrix.org together with Thib and jplatte, and a small team of element devs and designers. Please note that this was initiated by the community and still is a community project.</p>
<p>The goal of this rewrite is to move away from Gatsby and rewrite and redesign matrix.org using the zola static page generator.<br/>We made great progress this year, but sadly it will take a bit longer before it can be deployed. :) If you want to watch progress, I suggest looking at things labeled with &quot;zola&quot; in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/</a></p>
<h3><a href="https://miki.community">Miki - A Matrix Wiki</a></h3>
<p>Miki is a MediaWiki meant for Matrix. It isn't a bridge, but instead the goal is to document projects and history around Matrix. This project aims for 2023 to extend the data, while in 2022 the work was focused around infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's all I know about so far. I hope you had a great year and that the next one will be even better. As you can see, the Matrix community is a riot of colors and seems to grow every year. I absolutely love it!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>2022 has been a rollercoaster of a year for Matrix.</p>
<p>On one hand, the network has doubled in size (44.1M to 80.3M visible matrix IDs). The wider world is having a grand awakening to the importance of decentralisation thanks to the situation at Twitter. We’ve seen an amazing number of major new players entering the Matrix ecosystem: <a href="https://macaw.social/@wongmjane/109529583352532543">Reddit appears to be building out new Chat</a> functionality using Matrix; <a href="https://twitter.com/teamspeak/status/1589621116032585728">TeamSpeak announced</a> Matrix-based chat in TS5; <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/matrix-protocol-for-chat/210780">Discourse</a> is working on adding Matrix support; <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/30/thunderbird_102">Thunderbird</a> launched Matrix support; Governments from <a href="https://gouvernement.lu/en/actualites/toutes_actualites/communiques/2022/11-novembre/16-hansen-lancement.html">Luxembourg</a> to <a href="https://delta.mil.gov.ua/wiki/info/">Ukraine</a> have launched their own Matrix-powered chat infrastructure; and hundreds of other organisations ranging from startups to massive private &amp; public sector entities are betting on the protocol. The European Parliament has used Matrix as a proof-point for the viability for communication interoperability between gatekeepers in the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/29/how-do-you-implement-interoperability-in-a-dma-world">Digital Markets Act</a>. <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/07/hosting-fosdem-2022-on-matrix">FOSDEM 2022</a> ran smoothly via Matrix with over 23,000 attendees, making it the world's largest open source conference (with 70% of attendees using their own servers!). <a href="https://element.io/blog/dsam-och-esam-forordar-matrix-for-saker-och-federerad-kommunikation-inom-sveriges-offentliga-sektor/">Sweden</a> has published case studies on the benefits of Matrix for messaging interoperability. Meanwhile existing players like Germany’s BWI have expanded their scope to providing Matrix messaging to the <a href="https://element.io/blog/bundesmessenger-is-a-milestone-in-germanys-ground-breaking-vision/">whole German State</a>; Automattic is busy building <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/chatrix">Matrix plugins</a> for Wordpress; Rocket.Chat launched <a href="https://rocket.chat/press-releases/rocket-chat-leverages-matrix-protocol-for-decentralized-and-interoperable-communications">federation via Matrix</a>, Gematik has been busy progressing their <a href="https://www.gematik.de/anwendungen/ti-messenger">TI Messenger</a> initiative for interoperable messaging within Germany’s healthcare industry, and <a href="https://element.io/case-studies/tchap">Tchap</a> in France is continuing to expand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, only a handful of these initiatives have resulted in funding reaching the core Matrix team. <strong>This is directly putting core Matrix development at risk.</strong> We are witnessing a classic tragedy of the commons. We’ve released all the foundational code of Matrix as permissively-licensed open source and got it to the point that anyone can successfully run it at scale themselves. The network is expanding exponentially. But in return, it transpires that the vast majority of these commercial deployments fail to contribute financially to the Matrix Foundation - whether by donating directly or supporting indirectly by working with <a href="https://element.io">Element</a>, who fund the vast majority of core Matrix development today.</p>
<p>In short: folks love the amazing decentralised encrypted comms utopia of Matrix.  But organisations also love that they can use it without having to pay anyone to develop or maintain it. <strong>This is completely unsustainable</strong>, and Element is now <em>literally</em> unable to fund the entirety of the Matrix Foundation on behalf of everyone else - and has had to lay off some of the folks working on the core team as a result.</p>
<p>The only viable solution to this is for organisations building on Matrix to contribute to sharing the costs of maintaining Matrix’s core projects.  We made <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/12/01/funding-matrix-via-the-matrix-org-foundation">a proposal</a> to address this a few weeks ago, which we’ll iterate on further in the new year to find an approach which both empowers the community and encourages organisations to participate.  In the interim, if you are an organisation who’s building on Matrix and you want the project to continue to flourish, <strong>please</strong> mail <a href="mailto:funding@matrix.org">funding@matrix.org</a> to discuss how you can support the foundations that you are depending on.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the work the <a href="https://matrix.org/foundation">Foundation</a> does today for the benefit of the Matrix includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing the<a href="https://spec.matrix.org"> Matrix Specification</a></li>

<p>This list is not remotely exhaustive (turns out there are over 240 projects in the matrix.org GitHub org!) but it serves to illustrate the sheer scale of work that the Foundation performs today.  Keeping the core team funded to work on Matrix as our day job is critical for Matrix’s long-term success, and so we <strong>really</strong> hope that organisations depending on Matrix (or passing philanthropists who appreciate Matrix’s value) will drop a line to <a href="mailto:funding@matrix.org">funding@matrix.org</a> and help keep the show on the road.</p>
<h3 id="turbocharging-matrix">Turbocharging Matrix</h3>
<p>Aside from the nightmares of funding open source software, 2022 has very much been a year of building - focusing on implementing a step change in Matrix’s performance and usability: ensuring that the protocol can punch its weight (and more!) against centralised proprietary alternatives. After all, Matrix clients need to be at least as good as the centralised alternatives in order to get widespread uptake.</p>
<p>This work has ended up taking many forms: on the server-side, Synapse sprouted Rust support to accelerate its hot paths, starting with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/13838">push rule evaluation</a>. It’s super exciting to see Synapse performance heading into a new era, building on the foundations of what’s become a very mature and stable homeserver implementation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile work is in the final stages on “<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/rav/proposal/faster_joins/proposals/3902-faster-remote-joins.md">Faster Joins</a>”, finally letting servers rapidly join rooms over federation by synchronising only the minimal subset of state needed to join, rather than proactively synchronising the room’s full current state.  Faster joins became <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/18/testing-faster-remote-room-joins">available for testing</a> in Synapse in October, and since then the team has been <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/milestone/10">working through</a> making it support workers and addressing the various edge cases and bugs that have shown up during testing.  Current join performance is a roughly 25x speedup on large rooms, although we’re confident that we can improve this even more, and we’re aiming to land it in time for FOSDEM at the beginning of Feb.</p>
<p>On the client-side, the work to transform Matrix client performance has centred around “<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/kegan/sync-v3/proposals/3575-sync.md">Sliding Sync</a>” - our entirely new API for synchronising the minimal data to a client needed for it to render its UI, thus making login, launch and sync instant.  Sliding sync (originally called “sync v3”) has been a long time in the making; the API has gone through countless iterations as we worked away throughout 2022 implementing it in real-life clients, and adding all the extensions (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3884">MSC3884</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3885">MSC3885</a>) needed to get to parity with sync v2.  The wait has been well worth it, though: <a href="https://pr9256--matrix-react-sdk.netlify.app/">support</a> in Element Web is in the final stages of development - and moreover the next-generation Element X mobile clients will only speak Sliding Sync.</p>
<p>Element X itself is shaping up to be a showcase of just how snappy and performant Matrix can be: built on matrix-rust-sdk, it uses native Swift UI on iOS/macOS and Jetpack Compose on Android to couple together the best possible platform-native user experience with the ultimate underlying native-code SDK implementation, backed by sliding sync. The goal is to be at least as snappy as Telegram, iMessage or WhatsApp (we’ve taken to counting the frames in screen recordings to compare things like time-to-launch and time-to-load scrollback).  Element X is currently in late alpha on iOS, and the hope is to enter public beta in time for FOSDEM.  You can see a sneak peek here of the iPad-style layout (running under macOS) though!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-12-25-elementx.png" alt="Element X" /></p>
<p>Finally, in terms of usability, there have been leaps and bounds forwards across Matrix - particularly with Element’s mobile UI being <a href="https://element.io/blog/an-unrecognisable-improvement-elements-new-design-is-here/">entirely refreshed</a> by the design team in September as a stepping stone to the forthcoming final Element X design.  Any remaining UX quirks should be flushed out with Element X, but the visuals are already a clear step forwards towards an excellent alternative to the centralised encumbents.</p>

<h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>
<p>We had great plans for E2EE in Matrix this year; starting off in a huge rush to get <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac">vodozemac</a> finished and <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/05/16/independent-public-audit-of-vodozemac-a-native-rust-reference-implementation-of-matrix-end-to-end-encryption">audited</a> as our shiny new native-Rust implementation of Olm/Megolm. The plan was then to integrate vodozemac into matrix-rust-sdk’s crypto crate, and then replace the various old fragmented E2EE implementations across matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk, matrix-android-sdk2 and matrix-rust-sdk itself with One True audited implementation - with audits booked with Least Authority to get further assurance around matrix-rust-sdk-crypto, matrix-rust-sdk itself and finally the full stack (Element X + Synapse).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things went sideways when security researchers from Royal Holloway University London &amp; elsewhere got in touch to explain that they had found some <a href="https://nebuchadnezzar-megolm.github.io/">nasty implementation vulnerabilities</a> in the venerable matrix-js-sdk implementation.  So, we had no choice but to pause “Element R” - the project to converge matrix-{js,ios,android}-sdk on matrix-rust-sdk-crypto, and instead start analysing and addressing the issues across all current shipping Matrix clients in order to resolve them as rapidly as possible.  Ironically, it turned out in the end that only matrix-{js,ios,android}-sdk were affected - all other independent implementations, including matrix-rust-sdk, were okay.  As such, the Element R work would have protected us from these vulnerabilities had it been ready, and failing that it would have let us solve them in a single place.  Instead, Element R ended up getting pushed back for months while we worked through the various issues in triplicate across the legacy SDKs, while also checking all the other client implementations we could find, and dealing with additional issues which the RHUL researchers discovered as they dug deeper.  Eventually we finished the analysis and agreed a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients">coordinated disclosure</a> at the end of September.
(EDIT: to be clear, we are very grateful to the security researchers for discovering and disclosing the vulns responsibly to us. The frustration here stems from the irony that if we'd finished the matrix-rust-sdk-crypto rewrite a few months earlier, we'd have mitigated the severe vulns - but instead, the rewrite got pushed back even further. It's obviously our fault though, not the researchers'.)</p>
<p>Since then, work has been split three ways: firstly, Element R work has resumed - and in fact Element R on iOS is pretty much usable as of today, other than needing some work to support E2EE push notifications (which will also be required for Element X). Element R on Android is very close too, and meanwhile Element R on Web decrypted its first event on Dec 19th! We’re hoping to get Element R in production on all platforms by Feb.</p>
<p>Secondly, we’ve been addressing other points raised by the RHUL researchers to ensure that malicious servers cannot add malicious devices or users to conversations, rather than warning as we do today.  This is not a trivial problem to solve, but we’re making progress via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3917">MSC3917</a> (Cryptographically Constrained Room Membership) and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3834">MSC3834</a> (Opportunistic user key pinning (TOFU)).  However, this work is effectively blocked on Element R landing first, as there’s no way we’re going to fix this in triplicate on the legacy SDKs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we’ve been pushing ahead on implementing Decentralised MLS as a next-generation encryption protocol for Matrix to potentially replace Olm and Megolm.  This work was badly disrupted by RHUL mitigations, but we’re making good progress again - you can follow all the details over at <a href="https://arewemlsyet.com">https://arewemlsyet.com</a>.  Matrix over DMLS is currently in alpha, but the aim is to start beta testing Decentralised MLS in 2023.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve been working hard on completely reworking the overall UX of how E2EE should work in Matrix clients - specifically, requiring users to cross-sign their devices in order to use E2EE, and so end up in a much higher trust world (alongside Trust On First Use). Can’t wait to finally simplify the E2EE UX!</p>
<h3 id="all-new-features">All new features</h3>
<p>It’s not all been performance and stability work this year - there have been some large areas of feature work happening too.</p>
<p>One of the most visible projects has been Threads, which <a href="https://element.io/blog/introducing-threads-in-beta/">launched in beta</a> in April, and subsequently has undergone huge amounts of polish to improve performance, notification semantics, unread behaviour and thread-aware read receipts.  The end result is feeling great now, and threads <a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1605861000296640512">exited beta</a> in Element Mobile on Dec 20th. Web narrowly missed the window due to a final ‘stuck notification’ bug which is still being tracked down, but will follow shortly afterwards and then threads will be finally out of beta!</p>
<p>Another big project in 2022 has been to create a general purpose Rich Text Editor to provide WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) message composition for Matrix clients.  This has ended up being a very ambitious project to define all the core editing semantics in a shared rust library, with platform-specific bindings to link it into the editing UI available on Web, iOS &amp; Android.  The end result lives at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rich-text-editor">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rich-text-editor</a> - and you can play with it by enabling it in labs on Element Web/iOS/Android or experiment with the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-rich-text-editor">live demo</a>. The core behaviour is feeling excellent, although predictably some of the fine detail is very fiddly to get right. It’s almost there, though, and thanks to its built-in rust test harness generator(!) we are confident we’ll catch and control all the edge cases, and this should form an incredibly strong platform for all future rich text editing requirements in Matrix (and beyond!).  This work was very kindly sponsored by one of Element’s public sector customers in order to get Element to parity with Teams - thank you!</p>
<p>Location Sharing was another feature which landed in 2022 - powered by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3488">MSC3488</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3489">MSC3489</a>, and implemented in matrix-{js,ios,android}-sdk in Element Web/iOS/Android, letting users share static and live locations and view them on an OpenStreetMap compatible map tileserver of their server’s choice. The Live Location Sharing is controversial in that it stores location data in the room history (and as such is hidden behind a labs flag on Element), but should eventually be replaced by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3672">MSC3672</a> to share locations are custom ephemeral events instead (once custom EDUs land) in the spec.  Around the same time, Polls also went live thanks to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3381">MSC3381</a> - it’s worth noting that both Location Sharing and Polls are excellent examples of “extensible events” in the wild: ensuring that clients which understand the custom event type will render them appropriately, but letting other clients fall back to showing them as simple timeline events.</p>
<h3 id="open-id-connect">Open ID Connect</h3>
<p>The transition to using Open ID Connect for Matrix authentication has been progressing steadily throughout 2022 - with Third Room being the first OIDC-native Matrix client, closely followed by Element X. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-authentication-service">matrix-authentication-service</a> now exists as a basic OIDC identity provider suitable for being linked into Synapse, and meanwhile Third Room demonstrates how you can integrate Keycloak as a third party IDP (complete with reCAPTCHA and guest access!).  The team also went on a very exciting detour to figure out how to perform login-and-E2EE-setup in a single operation by scanning a QR code (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3906">MSC3906</a>), and how it might integrate into OIDC in future.</p>
<p>Element X looks set to be the showcase for native OIDC in a typical Matrix client going forwards, so watch this space to see how it feels!</p>
<p>You can keep track of the inexorable transition to OIDC over at <a href="https://areweoidcyet.com">https://areweoidcyet.com</a>.</p>
<h3 id="voip">VoIP</h3>
<p>2022 was the year that Matrix finally got native multiparty VoIP.  After launching <a href="https://element.io/blog/introducing-native-matrix-voip-with-element-call/">Element Call Beta 1</a> in March followed by <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-call-beta-2-encryption-spatial-audio-walkie-talkie-mode-and-more/">Beta 2</a> in June, we’ve been busy embedding Element Call as a “matryoshka” widget into Element Web, using it to replace Jitsi in powering video rooms and video calls.  You can read all about this in detail in the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/08/15/the-matrix-summer-special-2022#native-voip-conferencing">summer blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, lots of progress is underway on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/waterfall">Waterfall</a> - the name we picked for the Pion-based decentralised Selective Forwarding Unit (i.e. conferencing focus) contributed by Sean DuBois earlier in the year, including adding simulcast support to support large scale conferences.</p>
<p>There’s only one catch, which is that Element Call is still in (very very late) beta, thanks to a handful of bugs which have been hard to track down, which has in turn kept all the other dependencies (embedded Element Call; video rooms etc) in beta too.  However, we think we’re pretty much there now - which is perfect timing given how Waterfall is coming together, meaning that both stable <em>and</em> scalable native Matrix conferences are on the horizon!</p>
<p>Even better, the plan is for Element X to rely entirely on embedding Element Call for VoIP - so we should be able to jump forwards pretty rapidly to having excellent native multiparty VoIP and video rooms on mobile as well as on Web.  So, once Element Call exits beta, everything should follow.  Just for a change, we’re aiming to get this done by the end of January - but there are a lot of unknown unknowns still flying around, so watch this space…</p>
<h3 id="ietf-mimi">IETF &amp; MIMI</h3>
<p>Another massive new initiative this year has been the process of proposing Matrix to the IETF as a candidate for use in interoperable instant messaging standardisation.  The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/mimi/about/">MIMI (More Instant Messaging Interoperability) working group</a> emerged earlier in the year within IETF as an initiative to define how MLS could be used to interoperate between different instant messaging silos - as shortly to be required by the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/29/how-do-you-implement-interoperability-in-a-dma-world">Digital Markets Act</a>.</p>
<p>One of the things that MIMI aims to do is to define a common application layer protocol to exchange messages. At first <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mahy-mimi-content/01/">CPIM was proposed</a> (an ancient message format that looks a lot like email) - and then an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-rosenberg-mimi-msg-format/">entirely new JSON message format</a> proposal emerged which looks somewhat Matrix (but isn’t). At this point it became obvious that we should throw our hat into the ring and encourage MIMI to use Matrix rather than reinvent it, and so we set about proposing Matrix as at least the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ralston-mimi-matrix-message-format/">message format</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ralston-mimi-matrix-transport/">message transport layer</a> of the stack. It’s quite surreal to see Matrix starting to fly around as IETF Drafts!</p>
<p>The next step here is to re-express the relevant bits of the current Matrix spec as self-contained IETF Drafts (rather than backreferencing the current spec from the drafts).  The idea is that the normal Matrix spec will continue to evolve much as it always has, but we’ll effectively donate a Long Term Supported dialect of it to IETF which can then evolve according to IETF process and be immortalise as RFCs for use in MIMI.  We’ll then backport those changes into spec.matrix.org in order to avoid fragmentation, while retaining the same ability we have to rapidly iterate and extend Matrix with MSCs.  This work is well under way (taking opportunity to use <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/matthew/msc1767/proposals/1767-extensible-events.md">Extensible Events</a> from the outset!), and we should see explosions of further IETF Drafts emanating from Travis as 2023 progresses.</p>
<h3 id="trust-safety">Trust &amp; Safety</h3>
<p>2022 saw a real uptick in spam and abuse across Matrix, and there have been some valiant attempts to improve our moderation tooling over the course of the year.  Unfortunately it hasn’t come together as rapidly as we might have hoped, however, and we’ve seen several large communities give up on Matrix and move back to Discord thanks in part to needing better anti-abuse mechanisms.</p>
<p>In 2023 we’re resetting our trust &amp; safety work, with Mjolnir dev returning to its original development team, and we’ll be working as tactically as possible to ensure that all communities on Matrix can easily block abuse using whatever mechanisms they need.</p>
<h3 id="p2p-dendrite">P2P &amp; Dendrite</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, Dendrite (our second generation homeserver implementation) development has continued at pace throughout the year. According to sytest we are now at 93% client-server API compliance with 577 out of 620 tests passing, and the server-server API compliance is at 97% with 111 out of 114 tests passing! None of the missing tests are showstoppers, so it’s fair to say that Dendrite is very nearly ready for primetime.</p>
<p>The interesting plot twist is that Dendrite development has ended up increasingly focusing on embedded matrix server use cases - particularly to power Peer-to-Peer Matrix, where clients require a server to be embedded within them.  So while Synapse has ended up increasingly focusing on large-scale deployments, Dendrite has ended up pursuing smaller instances (which is ironic, given originally it was meant to be the other way round!).</p>
<p>P2P Matrix work has been progressing well too - you can follow the blow-by-blow updates over at <a href="https://arewep2pyet.com">https://arewep2pyet.com</a>. After a lot of back and forth evaluating hard-state routing versus soft-state routing in Pinecone, we’ve ended up converging on soft-state routing (which is chattier, but easier to reason about in terms of mitigating attacks). However, the chattiness means that it doesn’t scale as well as one might hope - so we’re now working on a “tiered” approach where separate Pinecone networks can be tiered together into one inter-network, giving us scalability at the expense of being slightly less decentralised. It’s fair to say that the journey here has been pretty frustrating in its twists and turns, and sadly Neil Alexander chose to move on a few months ago. However, Devon has stepped up to fill his shoes as primary Pinecone and P2P wrangler, and is making amazing progress on the remaining work - firstly implementing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/2917">Store and Forward relaying</a> in Dendrite so that today’s Pinecone networks can exchange messages even if the recipient node is offline.  Next up will be bridging P2P Matrix with today’s Matrix network - and then working on tiering to provide the scalability we need.  The expectation is that today’s serverside Dendrite instances will effectively turn into static pinecone peers, store and forwarding messages on behalf of P2P nodes, and providing tiering between respective pinecone subnets.</p>
<h3 id="hydrogen-chatterbox">Hydrogen &amp; Chatterbox</h3>
<p>Development on Hydrogen as a super-lightweight progressive-web-app Matrix client has also been progressing throughout the year (with a few detours to help out with end-to-end testing via <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/trafficlight">trafficlight</a> both for the benefit of Hydrogen and other clients).</p>
<p>The biggest change has been Hydrogen sprouting a separate SDK layer, letting the engine be embedded into other webapps in order to add noninvasive Matrix messaging with as minimal a footprint as possible.  This was showcased in Element’s <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-launches-chatterbox/">chatterbox</a> offering in July - providing an open source chatbox which can be trivially embedded into existing sites, and also powers the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/chatrix">Chatrix</a> wordpress plugin that Automattic is working on.</p>
<p>Hydrogen also added independent support for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401">MSC3401</a> multiparty voice/video calling (albeit on a <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/pull/705">branch</a>), letting us showcase heterogeneous Element Call &lt;-&gt; Hydrogen group calling and prove MSC3401 as fit for purpose as a true open interoperable call signalling - and in turn Hydrogen SDK, complete with the multiparty voice/video calling, powers the Matrix engine within Third Room - our metaverse-on-Matrix platform.</p>
<p>We’re looking forwards to Hydrogen continuing to reach full feature parity with Element over the next year, and popping up in increasingly unexpected places as everyone’s favourite embedded Matrix client!</p>
<h3 id="third-room">Third Room</h3>
<p>Finally, it’s hard to believe that <a href="https://thirdroom.io">Third Room</a>, our Matrix-based open platform for decentralised realtime spatial collaboration, barely existed at the beginning of the year.  Third Room serves to demonstrate that Matrix is <em>way</em> more than just chat and VoIP, but can power the spatial communication layer of the open web. This has ended up driving forwards a tonne of new capabilities for Matrix - showcasing native OIDC auth; scalable multiparty VoIP in Hydrogen SDK, efficient binary-diffed file storage, and more recently has been defining how to store extensible behaviour for Matrix rooms as WASM objects stored in the Matrix room itself.</p>
<p>Third Room itself is a Hydrogen-based Matrix client, which lets you view Matrix rooms as interactive multiparty 3D environments (using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3815">MSC3815</a>) - with the world defined as glTF blobs stored in the Matrix room, and the ability to script and customise any aspect of that world using WASM blobs stored in Matrix rooms, which execute on the participating clients, exposing a new scenegraph API called WebSceneGraph in order to manipulate the glTF that makes up the world.  We also expect to see a variant of Matrix’s normal widget API to be exposed to these WASM blobs, introducing the concept of sandboxed clientside widgets, bots or other integrations - letting users customise and extend Matrix without ever having to run serverside bots again.</p>
<p>The intention is to provide a platform which can be used to build <em>any</em> kind of interactive realtime spatial multiparty app in an open standardised, decentralised, end-to-end encrypted way - whether that’s for gaming, social, or professional activity such as building “digital twins” for manufacturing, agriculture, smart cities, search &amp; rescue, etc.  You can read more about the vision at <a href="https://thirdroom.io/preview">thirdroom.io/preview</a>, or via press coverage at <a href="https://thenewstack.io/third-room-teases-user-generated-content-for-the-metaverse/">TheNewStack</a> or <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/third-room-das-open-source-metaverse-von-matrix-2212-170638.html">Golem</a>.  We were also incredibly flattered to be invited to present Third Room at <a href="https://sa2022.siggraph.org/en/presentation/?id=realcur_102&amp;sess=sess143">SIGGRAPH Asia</a> a few weeks ago.  The official recording has yet to emerge, but you can find a <a href="https://twitter.com/o_ob/status/1601442998696677376">cheeky bootleg here</a>.</p>
<p>We launched <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/27/announcing-third-room-tech-preview-1">Tech Preview 1 of Third Room</a> at the end of September, and since then all of the work has been around building out WebSceneGraph and the WASM scripting environment - letting users build their own functionality in JS via QuickJS or C (and in future Rust or Zig too).  We’ve also been working on making the networking (via Matrix WebRTC-negotiated data channels) more robust, switching to an ‘authoritative’ simulation model rather than having each client run its own physics simulation, in order to kick the hard problem of decentralised physics simulations down the road a bit further. We’re also adding in a much-needed ‘discover’ page to help users find new rooms and explore everything that’s possible in the platform.  And finally, we’re adding WebXR support so that folks can use ThirdRoom with VR and AR hardware if they so desire. All this should culminate in Tech Preview 2, due in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>If you want a quick sneak preview of the scripting capabilities on the horizon with a <a href="https://matrix.thirdroom.io/_matrix/media/r0/download/thirdroom.io/qFfvHcXNQkjeDjTpdMfPCniY">very basic script</a> stored in the media repository, head over to <a href="https://thirdroom.io/world/#surprise:thirdroom.dev">https://thirdroom.io/world/#surprise:thirdroom.dev</a> and click on the television ;)</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>So there you have it: it’s been a mixed year for Matrix, but at least the project itself is moving forwards faster than ever, for now. If you look back at the predictions from <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/22/the-mega-matrix-holiday-special-2021#2022">last year’s holiday blog post</a> you’ll see that most of them even came true. This year, we’ll keep the predictions simple: our plans for 2023 are to ensure that the Foundation is well funded, ship all of the step-change improvements in performance and usability which are currently in beta as rapidly as possible - and demonstrate for once and for all that Matrix can indeed punch its weight against the proprietary centralised alternatives.</p>
<p>If you can afford it, please consider donating to the Matrix.org Foundation to support our work. The most efficient way to support us is to <a href="https://donorbox.org/keep-matrix-exciting">donate via donorbox</a>. Our Patreon is not going anywhere, so if you wish to keep supporting it there we're happy to count you in our supporters.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Only two days late for Giving Tuesday (and 4 years late on the Foundation
scale), we are super excited to announce that we are finally expanding the
Matrix Foundation into a fully-fledged non-profit fund-raising organisation to
help support the core Matrix development and the wider open source Matrix
ecosystem!</p>
<p>Has your organisation been using Matrix to communicate via the open source
server and clients and you want to ensure that improvements and features still
keep coming? Become a member, and feed into the roadmap.</p>
<p>Has your company been building on top of Matrix, making the most of its openness
and flexibility, but you’ve never figured out how to contribute back in order
to ensure the resilience of the tech which you rely on for the success of your
business? Become a member, and ensure the core development is funded and that
Matrix is here to thrive.</p>
<p>Are you about to be designated a gatekeeper by the EU, and have to rapidly figure out how to implement <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/29/how-do-you-implement-interoperability-in-a-dma-world">DMA-compliant interoperability</a> (complete with end-to-end encryption compatibility) into your services? Become a member, and discover how Matrix can solve all your problems, while providing your input too. </p>
<p>Are you looking to implement DMA interoperability but don't fall into the gatekeeper designation? Become a member, and help ensure Matrix fits your needs too!</p>
<p>Are you a non-profit organisation with a mission to provide secure and sovereign communications to those who need it the most, providing an alternative to the current players? Become a member, and help us take our mission forward.</p>
<p>Are you an individual who strongly supports the mission of Matrix and wants to see it thrive and become the open backbone of the world’s communications? Become a member, and support the future of Matrix. </p>
<p>In short, this finally gives the wider world a way to contribute concretely to the significant costs of funding folks to work fulltime on core Matrix development - which now covers over 243(!) projects in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org">github.com/matrix-org</a>. Core Matrix work ranges from: </p>
<ul>
<li>managing the Matrix spec itself </li>
<li>maintaining the reference client SDKs and encryption and getting them independently audited</li>
<li>maintaining example server implementations in the form of Synapse and Dendrite</li>
<li>writing the test suite</li>
<li>publishing the matrix.org website</li>
<li>promoting awareness of Matrix</li>
<li>running the matrix.org homeserver</li>
<li>and so much more... </li>
</ul>
<p>In exchange for supporting the Foundation, and beyond providing certainty that our work can continue, organisations and individuals who contribute financially will be able to directly provide input to the trajectory of the core Matrix developments by becoming official members of the Matrix.org Foundation.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-foundation-memberships-and-the-governing-board">Introducing Foundation Memberships and the Governing Board</h2>
<p>Practically speaking, this means that we are going to create a &quot;Governing Board&quot; to the Matrix.org Foundation: a new team, made up of members voted by the overall membership, a subset of the Guardians and a subset of the Spec Core Team. The Governing Board will have the responsibility of determining how Foundation funds are distributed and used, how the Spec Core Team roadmap is prioritised, how to best grow Matrix awareness, etc.</p>
<p>In other words, we are literally expanding the day-to-day steering of the direction of the Matrix Foundation to the wider community. In order to run the Governing Board and the overall work of the Foundation, <strong>we are also hiring an Executive Director</strong>, so please get in touch via <a href="mailto:funding@matrix.org">funding@matrix.org</a> if you’re a non-profit foundation-running expert! In the interim, while this search proceeds, Matthew and Amandine will fill the role with the support of the other Guardians of Matrix. The Guardians themselves retain their existing function as the Foundation's non-executive board - responsible for safeguarding the overall mission of Matrix, appointing the membership of the Spec Core Team, approving membership applications, and defining the overall changes we’re outlining here.</p>
<p>Membership comes at various levels, each with different rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual memberships (i.e. today’s Patreon supporters):
<ul>
<li>Ability to vote in the appointment of up to 2 ‘community representatives’ to the Foundation's governing board.</li>
<li>Name on the Matrix.org website</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Silver member: between £2,000 and £80,000 per year, depending on organisation size
<ul>
<li>Ability to vote on the appointment of up to 2 ‘Silver representative’ to the Foundation's governing board</li>
<li>Supporter logo on the front page of the new Matrix.org website</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gold member: £200,000 / year, adds:
<ul>
<li>Ability to vote on the appointment of up to 3 ‘Gold representatives’ to the Foundation's governing board.</li>
<li>Press release announcing the sponsorship</li>
<li>1 original post on the Matrix.org blog per year</li>
<li>Participation in the internal Spec Core Team room</li>
<li>Larger logo on the front page of Matrix.org</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Platinum member: £500,000 / year, adds:
<ul>
<li>Ability to vote on the appointment of up to 5 ‘platinum representatives’ to the Foundation's governing board.</li>
<li>1 sponsored Matrix Live episode per year</li>
<li>Largest logo on the front page of Matrix.org</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As the activities of the Foundation increase, we expect to add more benefits to this list, for example discounts on sponsoring a future Matrix Conference, or similar.</p>
<p>Governing Board elections will occur yearly, with the first election planned towards the end of this year once we’ve gathered together the first wave of members and candidates have proposed themselves for election.</p>
<p>For anyone building on Matrix, memberships are a no-brainer as they will ensure the perpetuity and future-proof-ness of the standard. But for anyone supporting the mission of Matrix, this membership can be key to define its future. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, with Matrix looking increasingly integral to implementing interoperable communication for compliance with the EU’s Digital Markets Act (whether that’s as pure Matrix, or as part of the IETF <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ralston-mimi-matrix-transport/">MIMI</a> initiative), this is an incredible opportunity for the organisations impacted by DMA to get a front-row seat within the Foundation to ensure that Matrix thrives and solves the challenges posed by the act. To get involved, please apply via the <a href="https://forms.gle/Yy345QkB5pifJJNy6">membership application form</a>.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-is-this-all-happening">So, why is this all happening?</h2>
<p>Since 2017, core Matrix development has been funded primarily by Element - the company founded by the team who created Matrix. Over the years, Element has put tens of millions of dollars into Matrix - which in turn has come from both selling Matrix hosting (EMS), on-premise Matrix solutions, and VC investment in Element. To put it in perspective, even though there are over 5000 contributors to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org">github.com/matrix-org</a> - over 90% of the actual committed lines of code come from Element employees. Similarly, while we are <em>enormously</em> thankful for the past and existing generous donations from the wider Matrix community, today they only come to $6,000 a month, relative to the $400,000 a month that Element has been funding.</p>
<p>Over the last year, we’ve seen a palpable shift within the Matrix ecosystem. Matrix is growing faster than ever. Synapse has improved immeasurably, using less RAM than ever and even sprouting Rust to optimise its hot paths. Element has improved immeasurably too, with an entirely new design on mobile, and tons of new features including threads, voice messages, location share, video rooms and more. Monthly active users reported via Synapse’s phone-home stats have almost doubled and are growing at their fastest ever rate. The number of servers has increased equivalently. We hear about major new commercial Matrix deployments almost every day. However, while usage is going through the roof - we haven’t seen a matching increase in players looking to support the project.</p>
<p>In fact, we’ve seen the opposite: commercial vendors forking the protocol while trying to break up the core team. Matrix tenders lost to “preferred” vendors who know absolutely nothing about Matrix. Vendors selling Matrix hosting or services without contributing anything back to the project at all. Organisations with huge amounts of money (governments, $$B massive enterprises) have enthusiastically launched proprietary Matrix solutions by building on the liberally-licensed Apache reference Matrix implementations… while contributing back nothing. Now, we are enormously grateful for the commercial Matrix deployments who <em>do</em> actually work with Element to fund core development or contribute code themselves - but this is very clearly the minority. Obviously it’s great to see folks building on Matrix - but it’s rather galling if it ends up with insufficient funding trickling down to the core Matrix team to be able to build the foundational technology that everyone else is relying on.</p>
<p>Element in particular has staffed up in order to both support the core Matrix ecosystem (the spec, Synapse, Dendrite, Client SDKs, Encryption implementations etc) as well as Element-specific work (the Element apps, EMS, the Element Enterprise Installer, etc). As a result, Element employs roughly twice as many developers as you might expect, and while Matrix is here to stay, this turns out not to be sustainable for Element unless the wider ecosystem helps support the foundational work</p>
<p>We believe the world needs secure decentralised communication more than ever, and ensuring the Foundation can distribute funding to those contributing to the core platform (be that Element or individuals or other organisations) is key to that. So: please consider this a call to arms - if you believe the world needs Matrix, and particularly if you depend on it for your business, please join the Foundation and participate!</p>
<p>Fill in <a href="https://forms.gle/Yy345QkB5pifJJNy6">the form</a> to apply for membership, or if you are not acting on behalf of an organisation, you can go straight to our <a href="https://donorbox.org/keep-matrix-exciting">donation page</a>.</p>

                <p>This year, the Matrix.org Foundation is excited to host the first ever
Matrix.org Foundation and Community devroom <em>in person</em> at FOSDEM. Half a day of
talks, demos and workshops around Matrix itself and projects built on top of
Matrix.</p>
<p>We encourage people working on the Matrix protocol or building on it in an open
source project to submit a proposal! Note that companies are welcome to talk
about the Matrix details of their open source projects, but marketing talks are
not welcome.</p>
<p>This call for participation is only about the physical devroom. A separate CfP
will be issued for the online devroom once there are more details about it.</p>
<p>Key dates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conference dates 4-5 February, 2023 In person</li>
<li>Matrix Devroom date: Sunday 5 morning in person, online devroom to be
announced</li>
<li>Submission deadline: Monday 5th December</li>
<li>Announcement of selected talks: Thursday 15th December </li>
</ul>
<p>You must be available in person to present your talk for the physical devroom.</p>
<h2 id="talk-details">Talk Details</h2>
<p>The talks can follow one of thee two formats for the physical devroom</p>
<ul>
<li>20 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A, for topics that can be covered briefly</li>
<li>50 min talk + 10 min Q&amp;A for more complex subjects which need more focus</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly encourage you to prepare a demo when it makes sense, so people can 
actually see what your work looks like in practice!</p>
<p>Of course, the proposal must respect the FOSDEM terms as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The conference language is English. All content must relate to Free and Open
Source Software. By participating in the event you agree to the publication of
your recordings, slides and other content provided under the same licence as
all FOSDEM content (CC-BY).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="submitting-a-proposal">Submitting a Proposal</h2>
<p>Proposals must be <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM23">submitted on FOSDEM's conference management system Pentabarf</a>
before <del>December 5</del> December 8 2022. If you are not used to Pentabarf, you can
follow this <a href="https://eyskens.me/beginners-guide-to-pentabarf/">beginners guide to Pentabarf</a>.</p>
<p>We expect to receive more requests than we have slots available. The devroom
organisers will be reviewing the proposals and accepting them based on the
potential positive impact the project has on Matrix (as defined in by the
Mission section of https://matrix.org/foundation).</p>
<p>If a project proposal has been turned down, it doesn't mean we don't believe it
has good potential. Maintainers are invited to join the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a>
Matrix room to give it some visibility.</p>

                <p>As of <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/17/synapse-1-69-released">Synapse 1.69</a>, we consider &quot;faster remote room joins&quot; to be ready for testing by server admins.</p>
<p>There are a number of caveats, which I'll come to, but first: this is an important step in a project which we've been working on for 9 months. Most people who use Matrix will be familiar with the pain of joining a large room over federation: typically you are just faced with a spinner, which is eventually replaced by a cryptic error. If you're lucky, the room eventually pops up in your room list of its own accord. The whole experience is <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1211">one of the longest-standing open issues in Synapse</a>.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>At the end of each year it’s been traditional to do a big review of everything that the Matrix core team got up to that year, and announcing our predictions for the next.  You can see the last edition in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/22/the-mega-matrix-holiday-special-2021">2021 here</a> - and if you’re feeling nostalgic you can head down memory lane with the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-special-2020">2020</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/12/24/the-2019-matrix-holiday-update">2019</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/12/25/the-2018-matrix-holiday-special">2018</a> ones etc too.</p>
<p>This year is turning out to be slightly different, however.  Our plans for 2022 are particularly ambitious: to force a step change in improving Matrix’s performance and usability so that we firmly transition from our historical “make it work” and “make it work right” phases into “<strong>making it fast</strong>”.  Specifically: to succeed, Matrix <strong>has</strong> to succeed in powering apps which punch their weight in terms of performance and usability against the proprietary centralised alternatives of WhatsApp, Discord, Slack and friends.</p>
<p>We’ve seen an absolute tonne of work happening on this so far this year… and somehow the end results all seem to be taking concrete shape at roughly the same time, despite summer traditionally being the quietest point of the year.  The progress is super exciting and we don’t want to wait until things are ready to enthuse about them, and so we thought it’d be fun to do a spontaneous Summer Special gala blog post so that everyone can follow along and see how things are going!</p>
<h2 id="making-it-fast">Making it fast</h2>
<p>We have always focused on first making Matrix “work right” before we make it “work fast” - sometimes to a fault.  After all: the longer you build on a given architecture the harder it becomes to swap it out down the line, and the core architecture of Matrix has remained essentially the same since we began in 2014 - frankly it’s amazing that the initial design has lasted for as long as it has.</p>
<p>Over the years we’ve done a lot of optimisation work on the core team implementations of that original architecture - whether that’s Synapse or matrix-{js,react,ios,android}-sdk and friends: for instance Synapse uses 5-10x less RAM than it used to (my personal federated server is only using 145MB of RAM atm! 🤯) and it continues to speed up in pretty much every new release (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/13522">this PR</a> looks to give a 1000x speedup on calculating push notification actions, for instance!).  However, there are some places where Matrix’s architecture itself ends up being an embarrassingly slow bottleneck: most notably when rapidly syncing data to clients, and when joining rooms for the first time over federation.  We’re addressing these as follows…</p>
<h3 id="sliding-sync-aka-sync-v3">Sliding Sync (aka Sync v3)</h3>
<p>Historically, /sync always assumed that the client would typically want to know about all the conversations its user is in - much as an IRC client or XMPP client is aware of all your current conversations.  This provided some nice properties - such as automatically enabling perfect offline support, simplifying client and server development, and making features like “jump to room” and “tab complete” work instantly given the data is all client-side.  In the early days of Matrix, when nobody was yet a power user, this wasn’t really a problem - but as users join more conversations and join bigger rooms, it’s become one of Matrix’s biggest performance bottlenecks.  In practice, logging into a large account (~4000 rooms) can take ~10 minutes and hundreds of megabytes of network traffic, which is clearly ridiculous. Worse: if you go offline for a day or so, the incremental sync to catch back up can take minutes to calculate (and can even end up being worse than an initial sync).</p>
<p>To fix this, we started work on Sliding Sync (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/kegan/sync-v3/proposals/3575-sync.md">MSC3575</a>) in 2021: a complete reimagining of the /sync API used by Matrix clients to receive data from their homeserver.  In Sliding Sync, we only send the client the data it needs to render its UI.  Most importantly, we only tell it about the subset of rooms which it is visible in the scroll window of its room list (or that it needs to display notifications about).  As the user scrolls around the room list, they slide the window up and down - hence the name “sliding sync”.  Sliding Sync was originally called Sync v3, given it’s our 3rd iteration of the sync API - it got renamed Sliding Sync given the current sync API confusingly ended up with a prefix of /v3.</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/22/the-mega-matrix-holiday-special-2021#sync-v3">Back in December</a> our work on Sliding Sync was still pretty early: we had the initial MSC, an experimental proxy that converted the existing sync v2 API into Sliding Sync, and a simple proof-of-concept web client to exercise it.  Since then, however, there has been spectacular progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSC3575 has undergone some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575/commits/bea7323c0b03dbd46600ce8fe01218d55f0de083">big</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575/commits/a0bf4027bcef278e43a570c6fa94f2b1bef3488b">iterations</a> as we converge on the optimal API shape.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sliding-sync">sliding-sync</a> proxy has matured to be something which we’re now running in stealth against matrix.org for those dogfooding the API</li>
<li>We added the concept of extensions to split out how to sync particular classes of data (to avoid the API becoming a monolithic monster) - specifically:
<ul>
<li>Account Data</li>
<li>End-to-end Encryption</li>
<li>To-device messages</li>
<li>Ephemeral events (to be done)</li>
<li>Presence (to be done)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We added support for spaces!</li>
<li>We implemented it in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/2242">matrix-js-sdk</a> (which merged a few weeks ago!)</li>
<li>…and have a WIP implementation in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/728">matrix-rust-sdk</a> too.</li>
</ul>
<p>But most importantly, we’ve also been busy implementing Sliding Sync in Element Web itself so we can start using it for real.  Now, this is still a work in progress, but as of today it’s <em>just</em> getting to the point where one can experiment with it as a daily driver (although it’s definitely alpha and we’re still squishing bugs like crazy!) - and we can see just how well it really performs in real life.</p>
<p>For instance, here’s a video of my account (4055 rooms, redacted for privacy) logging in on an entirely fresh browser via Sliding Sync - the actual sync takes roughly 1 second (at 00:18 in the video).  And if we’d started the sync operation while the user is setting up E2E encryption, it would have completed in the background before they even got to the main screen, giving instant login(!).  Given my account typically takes ~10 minutes to initial sync (plus even more time for encryption to sync up), this is at least a real-life <strong>600x improvement</strong>.  Moreover, the sync response is only 20KB (a ~5000x improvement) - a huge win for low-bandwidth Matrix situations.</p>

<p>Then, having logged in, the client subsequently launches pretty much instantly, <em>no matter how long you’ve been offline</em>. Total launch time is roughly 4 seconds, most of which is loading the app’s assets - which in turn could well be improved by progressively loading the app.  It could also be sped up even more if we cached state locally - currently the implementation simply reloads from the server every time the app launches rather than maintaining a local cache.</p>
<p>As you can see, this is palpably coming together, but there’s still a bunch of work to be done before we can encourage folks to try it, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switching the RoomList to be fully backed by sliding sync (currently the v2 roomlist is jury-rigged up to the sliding sync API, causing some flakey bugs such as duplicate rooms)</li>
<li>Spec and hook up typing / receipts / presence extensions</li>
<li>Hook up favourites, low_priority, knocked and historical rooms</li>
<li>Adding back in loading room members</li>
<li>Apply quality-of-service to to-device messages so we prioritise ones relevant to the current sliding window</li>
<li>Sync encrypted rooms in the background to search for notifications (and for indexing).</li>
<li>More local caching to speed up operations which now require checking the server (e.g. Ctrl/Cmd-K room switching)</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need to determine whether it’s viable to run the sliding-sync proxy against matrix.org for general production use, or whether we’ll need native support in Synapse before we can turn it on by default for everyone.  But these are good problems to have!!</p>
<h3 id="matrix-rust-sdk-and-element-x">matrix-rust-sdk and Element X</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, over in the land of Rust, we’ve been making huge progress in maturing and stabilising matrix-rust-sdk and exercising it in Element X: the codename for the next generation of native Element mobile apps.  Most excitingly, we literally just got the first (very alpha) cut of Sliding Sync working in matrix-rust-sdk and hooked up to Element X on iOS - you can see Ștefan’s demo from last week here:</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KHQSeJTXm0?start=459" title="Matrix Live S08E04 — Element Demos" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>matrix-rust-sdk itself is now getting a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases">steady stream of releases</a> - including long-awaited official node bindings, providing excellent and performant encryption support via the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/05/16/independent-public-audit-of-vodozemac-a-native-rust-reference-implementation-of-matrix-end-to-end-encryption/">newly audited</a> vodozemac Rust implementation of Olm. It’s also great to see loads of major contributions to matrix-rust-sdk from across the wider Matrix community - particularly from Ruma, Fractal, Famedly and others - thank you!! As a result the SDK is shaping up to be much more healthy and heterogeneous than the original matrix-{js,ios,android}-sdk projects.</p>
<p>On Element X itself: matrix-rust-sdk is being used first on iOS in <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios">Element X iOS</a> - aiming first for launching a stable “barbecue” feature set (i.e. personal messaging) asap, followed by adding on “banquet” features (i.e. team collaboration) such as spaces and threads afterwards. We’ve shamelessly misappropriated the barbecue &amp; banquet terminology from Tobias Bernard’s excellent blog post “<a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2018/05/16/banquets-and-barbecues/">Banquets and Barbecues</a>” - although, ironically, unlike the post, our plan is still to have a single app which incrementally discloses the banquet functionality as the user’s barbecue starts to sprawl.  We’ve just published the brand new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/projects/1">development roadmap</a> for Element X from the rust-sdk perspective on GitHub.  Above all else, the goal of Element X is to be the fastest mobile messenger out there in terms of launch and sync time, thanks to Sliding Sync.  Not just for Matrix - but the fastest messenger, full stop :D  Watch this space to see how we do!</p>
<p>Finally: Element is getting a major redesign of the core UI on both iOS and Android - both for today’s Element and Element X.  I’m not going to spoil the final result (which is looking <em>amazing</em>) given it’ll have a proper glossy launch in a few weeks, but you can get a rough idea based on the earlier design previewed by Amsha back in June:</p>

<p>In addition to the upcoming overall redesign, Element also landed a complete rework of the login and registration flows last week on iOS and Android - you can see all about it over on the <a href="https://element.io/blog/all-aboard-better-ftue-for-less-wtf/">Element blog</a>.</p>
<h3 id="fast-remote-joins">Fast Remote Joins</h3>
<p>In terms of performance, the other area that we’re reworking at the protocol level is room joins. </p>
<p>One of the most glaring shortcomings of Matrix happens when a new server admin excitedly decides to join the network, installs a homeserver, tries to join a large room like #matrix:matrix.org, and then looks on in horror as it takes 10+ minutes to join the room, promptly despairs of Matrix being slow and complains bitterly about it all over HN and Reddit :)</p>
<p>The reason for the current behaviour is that the Matrix rooms are replicated between the servers who participate in them - and in the initial design of the protocol we made that replication atomic. In other words, a new server joining a room picks a server from which to acquire the room (typically the one in the room’s alias), and gets sent a copy of all the state events (i.e. structural data) about the room, as well as the last 20 or so messages.  For a big room like Matrix HQ, this can be massive - right now, there are 79,969 state events in the room - and 126,510 auth_chain events (i.e. the events used to justify the existence of the state events).  The reason there are so many is typically that the act of a user joining or parting the room is described by a state event - and in the naive implementation, the server needs to know all current state events in the room (e.g. including parted users), in order to keep in sync with the other servers in the room and faithfully authorise each new event which they receive for that room.</p>
<p>However, each event is typically around 500 bytes in size, and so the act of joining a big room could require generating, transmitting, receiving, authenticating and storing up to 100MB of JSON 😱. This is why joining big rooms for the first time is so painfully slow.</p>
<p>Happily, there is an answer: much as Sliding Sync lets clients synchronise with the bare minimum of data required to render their UI, we’ve created <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/rav/proposal/partial_state_on_join/proposals/3706-partial-state-in-send-join.md">MSC3706</a> (and its precursor <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/matthew/msc2775/proposals/2775-lazy-loading-over-federation.md">MSC2775</a>) in order to rework the protocol to let servers receive the bare minimum of state needed to join a room in order to participate.  Practically speaking, we only really care about events relevant to the users who are currently participating in the room; the 40,000 other lurkers can be incrementally synced in the background so that our membership list is accurate - but it shouldn’t block us from being able to join or read (or peek) the room.  We already have membership lazyloading in the client-server API to support incrementally loaded membership data, after all.</p>
<p>The problem with this change is that Synapse was written from the outset to assume that each room’s state should be atomically complete: in other words, room state shouldn’t  incrementally load in the background.  So the work for Faster Joins has been an exercise in auditing the entirety of Synapse for this assumption, and generally reviewing and hardening the whole state management system.  This has been <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pulls?q=is%3Apr+%22faster+joins%22+is%3Aclosed+">loads of work</a> that has been going on since the end of last year - but the end is in sight: you can see the remaining issues <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/milestone/8">here</a>.</p>
<p>As of right now, faster joins work (although aren’t enabled by default) - with the main proviso that you can’t speak in the room yet until the background sync has completed, and the new implementation has not yet been optimised.  However, thanks to all the preparation work, this should be relatively straightforward, so the end is in sight on this one too.</p>
<p>In terms of performance: right now, joining Matrix HQ via the unoptimised implementation of faster joins completes on a fresh server in roughly 30 seconds - so a <strong>~25x improvement</strong> over the ~12 minutes we’ve seen previously.  However, the really exciting news is that this only requires synchronising 45 state events and 107 auth_chain events to the new server - a <strong>~1400x improvement</strong>!  So there should be significant scope for further optimising the calculation of these 152 events, given 30 seconds to come up with 152 events is definitely on the high side.  In our ideal world, we’d be getting joins down to sub-second performance, no matter how big the room is - once again, watch this space to see how we do. </p>
<p>Finally, alongside faster remote joins, we’re also working on faster local joins.  This work overlaps a bit with the optimisation needed to speed up the faster remote join logic - given we are seeing relatively simple operations unexpectedly taking tens of seconds in both instances. Some of this is needing to batch database activity more intelligently, but we also have some unknown pauses which we’re currently tracking down.  Profiling is afoot, as well as copious Jaeger and OpenTracing instrumentation - the hunt is on!</p>
<h3 id="ratcheting-up-testing">Ratcheting up testing</h3>
<p>All the work above describes some pretty bold changes to speed up Matrix and improve usability - but in order to land these changes with confidence, avoiding regressions both now and in future, we have really levelled up our testing this year.</p>
<p>Looking at matrix-react-sdk as used by Element Web/Desktop: all PRs made to matrix-js-sdk must now pass 80% unit test coverage for new code (measured using <a href="https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=matrix-js-sdk">Sonarqube</a>, enforced as a GitHub PR check). All matrix-react-sdk PRs must be accompanied by a mix of unit tests, end-to-end tests (via <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a>) and screenshot tests (via <a href="https://percy.io/">percy.io</a>). All regressions (in both nightly and stable) are retro’d to ensure fixed things stay fixed (usually via writing new tests), and we have converted <a href="https://arewetsyet.bit.ovh/">fully to typescript</a> for full type safety.</p>
<p>Concretely, since May, we’ve increased js-sdk unit test coverage by ~10% globally, increased react-sdk coverage by ~17%, and added ever more Cypress integration tests to cover the broad strokes.  Cypress now <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/9104">completely replaces</a> our old Puppeteer-based end-to-end tests, and Sliding Sync work in matrix-react-sdk is being extensively tested by Cypress from the outset (the Sliding Sync PR literally comes with a Cypress test suite).</p>
<p>In mobile land, the situation is more complex given our long-term strategy is to deprecate matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk2 in favour of matrix-rust-sdk. matrix-rust-sdk has always had <a href="https://app.codecov.io/gh/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk">excellent coverage</a>, and in particular, adopting the crypto module in the current matrix-{js,ios,android}-sdk will represent a night and day improvement for quality (not to mention perf!). We’ll also be adopting <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios/pull/50">PR checks</a>, and screenshot testing for the mobile SDKs.</p>
<p>On the backend, we continue to build out test cases for our new integration tester <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a> (in Golang), alongside the original <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/sytest">sytest</a> integration test suite (in Perl). In particular, we can now test Synapse in worker mode. The intention with Complement is that it should be homeserver agnostic so that <em>any</em> homeserver implementation can benefit. Indeed the project was initiated by Kegan wearing his Dendrite hat. </p>
<p>Finally, we’ve had a huge breakthrough with true multi-client end-to-end testing in the form of Michael Kaye’s brand new <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/trafficlight">Traffic Light</a> project. For the first time, we can fully test things like cross signing and verification and VoIP calls end-to-end across completely different platforms and different clients. It’s early days yet, but this really will be a game changer, especially for crypto and VoIP. </p>
<p>Next up, we will turn our attention to a performance testing framework so that we can reliably track performance improvements and regressions in an automated fashion - heavily inspired by Safari’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9844796-don-was-the-one-who-figured-out-how-we-would">Page Load Test</a> approach. This will be essential as we build out new clients like Element X.</p>
<h2 id="a-whole-new-world">A whole new world</h2>
<p>All the stuff above is focused on improving the core performance and usability of Matrix - but in parallel we have also been making enormous progress on entirely new features and capabilities. The following isn’t a comprehensive list, but we wanted to highlight a few of the areas where new development is progressing at a terrifying rate…</p>
<h3 id="native-voip-conferencing">Native VoIP Conferencing</h3>
<p>2022 is turning out to be the year that Matrix finally gets fully native voice/video conferencing. After speccing <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/matthew/group-voip/proposals/3401-group-voip.md">MSC3401</a> at the end of last year, <a href="https://element.io/blog/introducing-native-matrix-voip-with-element-call/">Element Call Beta 1</a> launched as a reference implementation back in March, followed by enabling E2EE, spatial audio and walkie-talkie mode in <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-call-beta-2-encryption-spatial-audio-walkie-talkie-mode-and-more/">Element Call Beta 2</a> in June.</p>
<p>However, the catch was that Element Call beta 1 and 2 only ever implemented “full mesh” conferencing - where every participant calls every other participant simultaneously, limiting the size of the conference to ~7 participants on typical hardware, and wasting lots of bandwidth (given you end up sending the same upstream multiple times over for all the other participants).  Element Call has been working surprisingly well in spite of this, but the design of MSC3401 was always to have “foci” (the plural of ‘focus’ - i.e. conference servers) to optionally sit alongside homeservers in order to aggregate the participating calls, a bit like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-08-15-msc3401.jpg" alt="MSC3401 Architecture" /></p>
<p>With foci, clients only need to send their upstream to their local focus, rather than replicating it across all the other participants - and the focus can then fan it out to other foci or clients as required.  In fact, if no other clients are even watching your upstream, then your client can skip sending an upstream to its focus entirely!</p>
<p>Most importantly, foci are decentralised, just like Matrix: there is no single conference server as a single point of control or failure responsible for powering the group call - users connect to whichever focus is closest to them, and so you automatically get a standards-based heterogeneous network-split-resilient geographically distributed cascading conferencing system with end-to-end-encryption, powered by a potentially infinite number of different implementations.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time someone’s proposed an approach like this for decentralised group calling (watch out, Zoom, we’re coming for you!)</p>
<p>Now, the VoIP team have been busy polishing Element Call (e.g. chasing down end-to-end encryption edge cases and reliability), and also figuring out how to embed it into Element and other Matrix clients as a quick way to get excellent group VoIP (more on that later).  As a result, work on building out foci for scalable conferencing had to be pushed down the line.</p>
<p>But in the last few months this completely changed, thanks to an <strong>amazing</strong> open source contribution from Sean DuBois, project lead over at <a href="https://pion.ly/">Pion</a> - the excellent Golang WebRTC implementation.  Inspired by our <a href="https://2021.commcon.xyz/talks/extending-matrix-s-e2ee-calls-to-multiparty">initial talk</a> about MSC3401 at CommCon, Sean independently decided to see how hard it’d be to build a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) focus that implemented MSC3401 semantics using Pion - and published it at <a href="https://github.com/sean-der/sfu-to-sfu">https://github.com/sean-der/sfu-to-sfu</a> (subsequently donated to github.com/matrix-org).  In many ways this was a flag day for Matrix: it’s the first time that a core MSC from the core team has been first implemented from outside the core team (let alone outside the Matrix community!).  It’s the VoIP equivalent of Synapse starting off life as a community contribution rather than being written by the core team.</p>
<p>Either way: Sean’s SFU work has opened the floodgates to making native Matrix conferencing actually scale, with Šimon Brandner and I jumping in to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/2423">implement SFU support</a> in matrix-js-sdk… and as of a few weeks ago we did the first ever SFU-powered Matrix call - which worked impressively well for 12 participants!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-08-15-sfu.jpg" alt="12 person Element Call" /></p>
<p>Now, this isn’t released yet, and there is still work to be done, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>We actually need to select the subset of streams we care about from the focus</li>
<li>We need to support thumbnail streams as well as high-res streams</li>
<li>We need rate control to ensure clients on bad connections don’t get swamped</li>
<li>We need to hook up cascading between foci (although the SFU already supports it!)</li>
<li>We need E2EE via insertable streams</li>
<li>Faster signalling for switching between streams</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the full todo list for basic and future features over on GitHub.  However, we’re making good progress thanks to Šimon’s work and Sean’s help - but with any luck beta 3 of Element Call might showcase SFU support!</p>
<p>Meanwhile it’s worth noting that Element Call is not the only MSC3401 implementation out there - the Hydrogen team has added native support to Hydrogen SDK too (skipping over the old 1:1 calling), so expect to see Element &lt;-&gt; Hydrogen calling in the near future. The Hydrogen implementation is also what powers Third Room (see below…)</p>
<h3 id="matryoshka-voip-embedding">Matryoshka VoIP Embedding</h3>
<p>Elsewhere on VoIP, we’ve also been hard at work figuring out how to embed Element Call into Matrix clients in general, starting with Element Web, iOS &amp; Android.  Given MSC3401 is effectively a superset of native 1:1 Matrix VoIP calling, we’d ideally like to replace the current 1:1-only VoIP implementation in Element with an embedded instance of Element Call (not least so we don’t have to maintain it in triplicate over Web/iOS/Android, and because WebRTC-in-a-webview really isn’t very different to native WebRTC).  To do this efficiently however, the embedded Element Call needs to share the same underlying Matrix client as the parent Element client (otherwise you end up wasting resources and devices and E2EE overhead between the two).  Effectively Element Call ends up needing to parasite off the parent’s client.  We call this approach “matryoshka embedding”, given it resembles nested Russian dolls. 🪆</p>
<p>In practice, we do this by extending the Widget API to let Matrix clients within the widget share the parent’s Matrix client for operations such as sending and receiving to-device messages and accessing TURN servers (c.f. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/travis/msc/widgets-send-recv-toDevice/proposals/3819-to-device-messages-for-widgets.md">MSC3819</a> and <a href="https://github.com/robintown/matrix-doc/blob/widget-turn-servers/proposals/3846-widget-turn-servers.md">MSC3846</a>).  This in turn has been <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api/pull/57">implemented</a> in the matrix-widget-api helper library for widget implementers - and then a few days ago Robin demonstrated the world’s first ever matryoshka embedded Element Call call, looking like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-08-15-matryoshka.jpg" alt="Matryoshka embedded Element Call" /></p>
<p>Note that the MSC3401 events are happening in the actual room where the widget has been added, sent by the right users from Element Web rather than from Element Call, and so are subject to all the normal Matrix access control and encryption semantics.  This is a <em>huge</em> step forwards from embedding Jitsi widgets, where the subsequent call membership and signalling happens in an entirely separate system (XMPP via Prosody, ironically) - instead: this is proper native Matrix calling at last.</p>
<p>Moreover, the same trick could be used to efficiently embed other exotic Matrix clients such as Third Room or <a href="https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard">TheBoard</a> - giving the user the choice either to use the app standalone or within the context of their existing Matrix client. Another approach could be to use OIDC scopes to transparently log the embedded client in using the parent’s identity; this has the advantage of no code changes being needed on the embedded client - but has the disadvantage that you needlessly end up running two Matrix clients for the same account side by side, and adding another device to your account, which isn’t ideal for a performance sensitive app like Element Call or Third Room.</p>
<p>Matryoshka embedding isn’t live yet, but between scalable calls via SFU and native Element Call in Element Web/iOS/Android, the future is looking incredibly exciting for native Matrix VoIP.  We hope to finish embedding Element Call in Element Web/iOS/Android in Sept/Oct - and if we get lucky perhaps the SFU will be ready too and then Element Call can exit beta!</p>
<p>Finally, we also added Video Rooms to Element Web - adding the user interface for an “always on” video room that you can hop into whenever you want.  You can read about it over on the <a href="https://element.io/blog/drop-in-drop-out-chats-with-video-rooms-and-a-new-search-experience/">Element blog</a> - the initial implementation uses Jitsi, but once Element Call and Matryoshka embedding is ready, we’ll switch over to using Element Call instead (and add Voice Rooms too!)</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-08-15-video-rooms.jpg" alt="Video Rooms" /></p>
<h3 id="third-room">Third Room</h3>
<p>Just as MSC3401 and Element Call natively adds decentralised voice/video conferences to boring old textual Matrix chatrooms, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3815">MSC3815</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/thirdroom/blob/main/README.md">Third Room</a> go the whole enchilada and adds a full decentralised 3D spatial collaboration environment into your Matrix room - letting you turn your Matrix rooms into a full blown interconnected virtual world.</p>
<p>I can’t overstate how exciting this is: one of the key origins of Matrix was back in Oct 2013 when Amandine and myself found ourselves in Berlin after TechCrunch Disrupt, debating why Second Life hadn’t been more successful - and wondering what you’d have to do to build an immersive 3D social environment which would be as positive and successful as a wildly popular chat network.  Our conclusion was that the first key ingredient you’d need would be a kick-ass open decentralised communication protocol to build it on - providing truly open communication primitives that anyone could build on, much like the open web… and that was what got us thinking about how to build Matrix.</p>
<p>Fast forward 9 years, and Third Room is making <em>spectacular</em> progress in building out this dream, thanks to the incredibly hard work of Robert, Nate and Ajay. The goal of Third Room is to be an open platform layered directly on Matrix for spatial collaboration of any kind: effectively a blank canvas to let folks create freeform collaborative 3D (and in future 2D, VR or AR) experiences, either by using existing assets or building their own user-generated content and functionality. Just like the open web itself, this unlocks a literally infinite range of possibilities, but some of the obvious uses include: spatial telepresence, social VR, 3D visualisation of GIS or weather data, 3D simulated environments, search and rescue and disaster response operations (imagine streaming LIDAR from a drone surveying hurricane devastation into Third Room, where you can then overlay and collaborate on GIS data in realtime), and of course 3D gaming in all its various forms.</p>
<p>Now, we’re hoping to give Third Room a proper launch in a few weeks, so I’m not going to spoil too much right now - but the final pieces which are currently coming together include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finalising the initial version of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/thirdroom/tree/main/src/engine">Manifold</a>, the multi-threaded game engine which powers Third Room (built on <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.JS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NateTheGreatt/bitECS">bitECS</a> and <a href="https://rapier.rs/">Rapier</a>), using SharedArrayBuffers as triple-buffers to synchronise between the various threads.  See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/thirdroom/discussions/47#discussion-4033099">this update</a> for a bit more detail on how the engine works.</li>
<li>Finalising the Matrix client interface itself, powered by <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/blob/master/doc/SDK.md">Hydrogen SDK</a> in order to be as lightweight as possible</li>
<li>Adding in full spatial audio and game networking via MSC3401 and Hydrogen SDK (currently full mesh, but will go SFU as soon as SFUs land!)</li>
<li>Adding in animated avatars (currently using <a href="https://www.mixamo.com/">Mixamo</a> animations)</li>
<li>Adding in name tags and object labels</li>
<li>Adding in 3D Tile support in order to incrementally load 3D map tiles à la Google Earth</li>
<li>Building an asset pipeline from Unity and Blender through to the glTF assets which Third Room uses.</li>
<li>Initial framework for an in-world direct-manipulation <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1550534909089189888">editor</a></li>
<li>Lightmap support for beautiful high-performance static lighting and shadows</li>
<li>Full post-processing pipeline (bloom, depth-of-field, anti-aliasing etc)</li>
<li>Integrating with OIDC for login, registration, and account management (see OIDC below)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a quick teaser - here’s an example of a <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/3d-scifi-kit-vol-3-121447">Unity asset</a> exported into Third Room, showing off lightmaps (check out the light and shadows cast by the strip lighting inside, or the shadow on the ground outside).  Ignore the blurry HDR environment map of Venice in the background, which is just there to give the metals something to reflect.  Check out the stats on the right-hand side: on Robert’s M1 Macbook Pro we’re getting a solid 60fps at 2000x1244px, with 13.12ms of unused gametime available for every 16.67ms frame, despite already showing a relatively complicated asset!</p>

<p>And don't forget, it's just a Matrix client - with no infrastructure required other than a normal Matrix server:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2022-08-15-thirdroom-overlay.jpg" alt="Third Room Overlay" /></p>
<p>As you can see, we are rapidly approaching the point where we’ll need support from technical artists to help create beautiful scenes and avatars and assets in order to make it all come to life - especially once the Blender and Unity pipelines, and/or the Third Room editor are finished.

<h3 id="wysiwyg">WYSIWYG</h3>
<p>Back in the real world, a recent new project that we haven’t spoken about much yet is adding consistent WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editing to the message composer in matrix-{react,ios,android}-sdk as used by Element Web/iOS/Android - as well as publishing the resulting WYSIWYG editor for the greater glory of the wider ecosystem.</p>
<p>This is a bit of a contentious area, because we’ve tried several times over the years to add a rich text editor to matrix-react-sdk - firstly with the <a href="https://draftjs.org/">Draft.js</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/292">implementation</a> by Aviral (which we abandoned after Facebook de-staffed Draft), and then later with a <a href="https://www.slatejs.org">Slate</a> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/1890">implementation</a> by me (which we abandoned thanks to the maintenance burden of keeping up with Slate’s API changes).  Finally, burnt by the experience with third party solutions, Bruno wrote his own editor called <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/blob/develop/docs/ciderEditor.md">CIDER</a>, which was a great success and is what Element Web uses today to author messages including ‘pills’ for structured rooms/users etc… but this deliberately didn’t provide full WYSIWYG functionality.  Meanwhile, Slack added WYSIWYG, forced it on, and <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2019/11/20/slack-rich-text-box/">screwed it up</a> - and apps like WhatsApp and Discord seem to get by fine without WYSIWYG. </p>
<p>However, given that users are now used to WYSIWYG in Teams and Slack, we’ve now decided to have another go at it, inspired by CIDER’s success - and with the novel twist that the heavy lifting of modelling and versioning the document and handling Unicode + CJK voodoo will be provided by a cross-platform native library written in Rust, ensuring that matrix-{react,ios,android}-sdk (and in future matrix-rust-sdk-based apps like Element X) all have precisely the same consistent semantics, and we don’t spend our lives fixing per-platform WYSIWYG bugs unless it really is a platform-specific issue with the user interface provided on that particular platform.</p>
<p>The project is fairly young but developing fast, and lives over at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-wysiwyg">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-wysiwyg</a> (better name suggestions welcome ;) - we’re aiming to get it into clients by the end of October.  The editor itself is not Matrix specific at all, so it’ll be interesting to see if other projects pick it up at all - and meanwhile, if we’ve done a good job, it’ll be interesting to see if this can be used to power Matrix-backed collaborative-editing solutions in future…</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: we should have mentioned that the WYSIWYG editor project is being built out by staff at Element, who very kindly have been sponsored to work on it by one of Element's Big Public Sector Customers in order to get to parity with Teams.  Thank you!!</p>
<h3 id="are-we-oidc-yet">Are We OIDC Yet?</h3>
<p>On the other hand, a project we recently <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/08/10/areweoidcyet-com-matrix-and-open-id-connect">yelled about</a> a lot is Matrix’s transition to Open ID Connect for standards-based authentication and account management.  We announced this at the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/22/the-mega-matrix-holiday-special-2021#openid-connect">end of the year</a> and the project has built up huge momentum subsequently, culminating with the release of <a href="https://areweoidcyet.com">https://areweoidcyet.com</a> last week to track the progress and remaining work.</p>
<p>Our plan is to use native OIDC in production for the first time to provide all the login, registration and account management for Third Room when it launches in a few weeks (using a branded Keycloak instance as the identity provider, for convenience).  After all, the last thing we wanted to do was to waste time building fiddly Matrix-specific login/registration UI in Third Room when we’re about to move to OIDC!  This will be an excellent case study to see how it works, and how it feels, and inform the rest of the great OIDC experiment and proposed migration.</p>
<h3 id="dendrite-p2p">Dendrite + P2P</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, the Next Generation team has continued to focus on their mission to make Dendrite as efficient and usable as possible. Within recent months, Dendrite has matured dramatically, with a considerable list of bugs fixed, performance significantly improved and new features added - push notifications, history visibility and presence to name a few notable additions.</p>
<p>Neil Alexander, Kegan and Till have continued to streamline the Dendrite architecture and to refactor areas of the codebase which have long needed attention, as well as moving from Kafka to NATS JetStream, an all-new caching model and some other fairly major architectural changes. We’ve also seen an increase of code contributions from the community and outside organisations, which is exciting, and the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/gomatrixserverlib">gomatrixserverlib</a> library which underpins much of Dendrite is also seeing more active development and attention thanks to its use in the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/complement">Complement</a> integration testing suite.</p>
<p>With the most recent <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases">0.9.3 release</a>, we are proud to announce that <strong>Dendrite now</strong> <strong>passes 90% of Client-Server API tests and 95% of Server-Server API tests</strong> and has support for all specced room versions in use today. We have a growing community of users who are (quite successfully) trialling using Dendrite homeservers day-to-day, as well as our own public <code>dendrite.matrix.org</code> homeserver, which is open to the public for registration for anyone who wants to experiment with Dendrite without running their own deployment.</p>
<p>Dendrite plays an important role in our future strategy as it is also the homeserver implementation used for embedded homeservers, P2P development and experimentation. In addition to being able to scale up, we have also successfully scaled down, with the Element P2P demos proving that an embedded Dendrite homeserver can run comfortably on an iOS or Android device.</p>
<p>Research on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone/">Pinecone</a> overlay network for P2P Matrix has also continued, with Devon and Neil having experimented with a number of protocol iterations and spent considerable time bringing the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone/tree/main/cmd/pineconesim">Pinecone Simulator</a> up to scratch to help us to test our designs more rapidly. Our work in this area is helping us to form a better direction and strategy for P2P Matrix as a whole, which is moving more towards a hybridised model with the current Matrix federation — a little different to our original vision, but will hopefully result in a much smoother transition path for existing users whilst solving some potential scaling problems. The <a href="https://arewep2pyet.com">arewep2pyet.com</a> site is a living page which contains a high level overview of our goals and all the progress being made.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-left">What’s left?</h2>
<p>Comparing all of the above with the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/12/22/the-mega-matrix-holiday-special-2021#2022">predictions for 2022</a> section of the end-of-year blog post, we’re making very strong progress in a tonne of areas - and the list above isn’t comprehensive.  For instance, we haven’t called out all the work that the Trust &amp; Safety team are doing to roll out advanced moderation features by default to all communities - or the work that Eric has been doing to close the remaining gap between Gitter and Matrix by creating new static archives throughout Matrix.  Hydrogen has also been beavering away to provide a tiny but perfectly formed web client suitable for embedding, including the new embeddable Hydrogen SDK. We haven’t spoken about the work that the Cryptography team have been doing to adopt vodozemac and matrix-rust-sdk-crypto throughout matrix-{js,ios,android}-sdk, or improve encryption stability and security throughout.  We’ve also not spoken about the new initiative to fix long-term chronic bugs (outside of the work above) in general - or all the work being done around <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/30/technical-faq-on-the-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act interoperability</a>…</p>
<p>Other things left on the menu for this year include getting Threads out of beta: we’ve had a bit of an adventure here figuring out how to get the right semantics for notification badges and unread state in rooms with threads (especially if you use a mix of clients which support and don’t support threads), and once that’s done we’ll be returning to Spaces (performance, group permissions etc).</p>
<h2 id="matrix-2-0">Matrix 2.0?</h2>
<p>Looking through this post (and congratulations if you’re still reading it at this point ;P), it really feels that Matrix is on the verge of shifting into a new phase.  Much as MacOS X started off as a promising but distinctly unoptimised operating system, and then subsequently got unrecognisably faster year by year (even on the same hardware!) as Apple diligently worked away optimising the kernel… similarly: we are now landing the architectural changes to completely transform how Matrix performs.</p>
<p>Between protocol changes like Sliding Sync, Faster Joins, native OIDC and native VoIP conferencing all landing at roughly the same time - and alongside new implementations like matrix-rust-sdk and vodozemac, let alone Third Room - it feels unquestionably like we have an unrecognisable step change on the horizon.  Our aim is to land as much of this as possible by the end of the year, and if we pull it off, I’m tempted to suggest we call the end result Matrix 2.0.</p>
<p>To the future! 🚀</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole core team.</p>

                <p>TL;DR: we’ve just launched <a href="https://areweoidcyet.com">areweoidcyet.com</a> to track the project to adopt OpenID Connect (OIDC) as <em>the</em> authentication method used by Matrix. It has a load of useful resources (<a href="https://areweoidcyet.com/#faqs">FAQs</a>, <a href="https://areweoidcyet.com/#when">status</a> etc.) so do please check it out!</p>
<p>Hey folks,</p>
<p>As you may know, there is a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861">proposal</a> and project afoot to change the way authentication is done in Matrix…</p>
<p>Currently Matrix uses a <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/client-server-api/#client-authentication">custom authentication protocol</a> baked into the Matrix spec. This poses a number of drawbacks. To overcome these drawbacks the project proposes migrating to use the industry standard authentication protocol OpenID Connect (OIDC) instead.</p>
<p>In terms of why this is a good idea: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/hughns/delegated-oidc-architecture/proposals/3861-delegated-oidc-architecture.md">MSC3861</a> has all the details - please check it out! </p>
<p>The bottom line is that Matrix should focus on being a decentralised communication protocol - <strong>not</strong> an authentication protocol… and by adopting a dedicated authentication protocol we can benefit from all sorts of goodies such as easy 2FA and MFA, passwordless-auth via WebAuthn, Login via QR-code, alternative CAPTCHAs and so much more.</p>
<p>In support of this the proposal extends to the Matrix.org Foundation joining the OpenID Foundation as a non-profit member to support the work that the OpenID Foundation is doing to build a robust and audited ecosystem for open authentication.</p>
<p>Whilst this project proposes a significant change to the Matrix ecosystem that would take some time to migrate to, we believe that it will better support the continued growth and adoption of Matrix in the years to come.</p>
<p>Today we are launching the <a href="https://areweoidcyet.com/">areweoidcyet.com</a> website which is packed with information and resources on the project:</p>

<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>We just wanted to take a moment to welcome <a href="https://rocket.chat">Rocket.Chat</a> to Matrix, given the <a href="https://rocket.chat/press-releases/rocket-chat-leverages-matrix-protocol-for-decentralized-and-interoperable-communications">recent announcement</a> that they are switching to using Matrix for standards-based interoperable federation!  This is incredible news: Rocket.Chat is one of the leading open source collaboration platforms with <a href="https://rocket.chat/company/about-us">over 12 million users</a>, and they will all shortly have the option to natively interoperate with the wider Matrix network: the feature has already landed (in alpha) in <a href="https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases/tag/4.7.0">Rocket.Chat 4.7.0</a>!</p>
<p>We’d like to thank the whole Rocket.Chat team for putting their faith in Matrix and joining the network: the whole idea of Matrix is that by banding together, different independent organisations can build an open decentralised network which is far stronger and more vibrant than any closed communication platform.  The more organisations that join Matrix, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">more useful and valuable</a> the network becomes for everyone, and the more momentum there is to further refine and improve the protocol.  Our intention is that Matrix will grow into a massive open ecosystem and industry, akin to the open Web itself… and that every organisation participating, be that Rocket.Chat, Element, Gitter, Beeper, Famedly or anyone else will benefit from being part of it. We are stronger together!</p>
<p>Rocket.Chat’s implementation follows the “<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/07/gitter-now-speaks-matrix#how-do-you-make-an-existing-chat-system-talk-matrix">How do you make an existing chat system talk Matrix?</a>” approach we published based on our experiences of linking Gitter into Matrix. Looking at the initial <a href="https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23688">pull request</a>, the implementation lets Rocket.Chat act as a Matrix Application Service, effectively acting as a bridge to talk to an appropriate Matrix homeserver.  From chatting with the team, it sounds like next steps will involve adding in encryption via our upcoming <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/699">matrix-sdk-crypto node bindings</a> - and then looking at ways to transparently embed a homeserver like Dendrite, sharing data as much as possible between RC and Matrix, so Rocket.Chat deployments can transparently sprout Matrix interoperability without having to run a separate homeserver.  Super exciting!</p>
<p>You can see a quick preview of a Rocket.Chat user chatting away with an Element user on matrix.org via Matrix here:</p>
<p><video style="width: 100%" src="/blog/img/164530391-e8b17ecd-a4d0-4ef8-a8b7-81230c1773d3.mp4" controls></video></p>
<p>So, exciting times ahead - needless to say we’ll be doing everything we can to support Rocket.Chat and ensure their Matrix integration is a success.  And at this rate, they might be distinctly ahead of the curve if they start shipping Dendrite!  Meanwhile, we have to wonder who will be next? Nextcloud? Mattermost? Place your bets… ;)</p>
<p>--Matthew</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>It’s been <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last">quite a while</a> since our last independent E2EE review, and so we’re incredibly proud to present an <a href="https://matrix.org/media/Least%20Authority%20-%20Matrix%20vodozemac%20Final%20Audit%20Report.pdf">entirely new independent security audit</a> of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac">vodozemac</a>, our next generation native Rust implementation of Matrix’s <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/blob/master/docs/olm.md">Olm</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/blob/master/docs/megolm.md">Megolm</a> E2EE protocols.  The audit has been conducted by <a href="https://leastauthority.com/">Least Authority</a>, who specialise in <a href="https://leastauthority.com/security-consulting/published-audits/">comprehensive audits</a> of security-sensitive decentralized technologies - and we are very grateful to <a href="https://www.gematik.de/anwendungen/ti-messenger">gematik</a>, who kindly shared the costs of funding the audit as part of their <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/21/germanys-national-healthcare-system-adopts-matrix">commitment to Matrix for healthcare in Germany</a>.</p>
<p>This audit was a bit of a whirlwind, as while we were clearly overdue an audit of Matrix’s E2EE implementations, we decided quite late in the day to focus on bringing vodozemac to auditable production quality rather than simply doing a refresh of the original <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last">libolm audit</a>.  However, we got there in time, thanks to a monumental sprint from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/graphs/contributors">Damir and Denis</a> over Christmas.  The reason we went this route is that vodozemac is an enormous step change forwards in quality over <a href="https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm">libolm</a>, and vodozemac is now the reference Matrix E2EE implementation going forward.  Just as libolm went live with NCC’s security review back in 2016, similarly we’re kicking off the first stable release of vodozemac today with Least Authority’s audit.  In fact, vodozemac just shipped as the default E2EE library in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0">matrix-rust-sdk 0.5</a>, released at the end of last week!</p>
<p>The main advantages of vodozemac over libolm include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native Rust - type, memory and thread safety is preserved both internally, and within the context of larger Rust programs (such as those building on matrix-rust-sdk).  This is particularly important given the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/14/adventures-in-fuzzing-libolm">memory bugs</a> which libolm sprouted, despite our best efforts to the contrary.</li>
<li>Performance - vodozemac benchmarks roughly 5-6x faster than libolm on typical hardware</li>
<li>Better primitives - vodozemac is built on the best practice cryptographic primitives from the Rust community, rather than the generic Brad Conte primitives used by libolm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, we’ve finally fixed one of the biggest problems with libolm - which was that the hardest bit of implementing E2EE in Matrix wasn’t necessarily the encryption protocol implementation itself, but how you glue it into your Matrix client’s SDK.  It turns out ~80% of the code and complexity needed to securely implement encryption ends up being in the SDK rather than the Olm implementation - and each client SDK ended up implementing its own independent state machine and glue for E2EE, leading to a needlessly large attack &amp; bug surface.</p>
<p>To address this problem, vodozemac is designed to plug into <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/tree/main/crates/matrix-sdk-crypto">matrix-sdk-crypto</a> - an SDK-independent Rust library which abstracts away the complexities and risks of implementing E2EE, designed to plug into existing SDKs in any language.  For instance, Element Android already <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/pull/3209">supports</a> delegating its encryption to matrix-sdk-crypto; Element iOS got this working too last week, and we’re <a href="https://github.com/Hywan/matrix-rust-sdk/commits/feat-crypto-wasm">hard at work</a> adding it to Element Web too.  (This set of projects is codenamed Element R).  Meanwhile, <a href="https://youtu.be/chsyOWKvne4">Element X</a> (the project to switch Element iOS and Element Android to use matrix-rust-sdk entirely) obviously benefits from it too, as matrix-rust-sdk now leans on matrix-sdk-crypto for its encryption.</p>
<p>Therefore we highly recommend that developers using libolm migrate over to vodozemac - ideally by switching to matrix-sdk-crypto as a way of managing the interface between Matrix and the E2EE implementation.  Vodozemac does also provides a similar API to libolm with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac-bindings">bindings for JS and Python</a> (and C++ in progress) if you want to link directly against it - e.g. if you’re using libolm for something other than Matrix, for example XMPP, ActivityPub or Jitsi.  We’ll continue to support and maintain libolm for now though, at least until the majority of folks have switched to vodozemac.</p>
<p>In terms of the audit itself - we recommend <a href="https://matrix.org/media/Least%20Authority%20-%20Matrix%20vodozemac%20Final%20Audit%20Report.pdf">reading it yourself</a>, but the main takeaway is that Least Authority identified 10 valid concerns, of which we addressed 8 during the audit process. The remaining two are valid but lower priority, and we’ll fix them as part of our maintenance backlog.  All the issues identified are excellent valid points, and we’re very glad that Least Authority have added huge value here by highlighting some subtle gotchas which we’d missed.  (If you write Rust, you’ll particularly want to check out their zeroisation comments).</p>
<p>So: exciting times!  Vodozemac should be landing in a Matrix client near you in the near future - we’ll yell about it loudly once Element switches over.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please head over to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#e2ee:matrix.org">#e2ee:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks again to gematik for helping fund the audit, and to Least Authority for doing an excellent job - and being patient and accommodating beyond the call of duty when we suddenly switched the scope from libolm to vodozemac at the last minute ;)</p>
<p>Next up: we’re going to get the Rust matrix-sdk-crypto independently audited (once <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/milestone/1">this burndown</a> is complete) so that everyone using the matrix-sdk-crypto state machine for Matrix E2EE can have some independent reassurance too - a huge step forward from the wild west of E2EE SDK implementations today!</p>
