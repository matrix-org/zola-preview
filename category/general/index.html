                <p>Some updates on the conferences Matrix attended over the last 3 weeks: WebRTC Summit in Santa Clara, TAD Summit in Istanbul, WebRTC World West in San José and fOSSa in Rennes. Great shows, ending in lots of interesting discussions and new excitement in Matrix!</p>
<h2>WebRTC Summit (Santa Clara, November 4-6)</h2>
Matrix was a <a href="http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/3242708">sponsor</a> at the Santa Clara <a href="http://webrtcsummit.net/">WebRTC Summit</a> at CloudExpo, and opened the WebRTC track alongside our friends at <a href="http://www.openpeer.org">Open Peer / Hookflash</a>. Matthew presented Matrix as the missing signalling layer for WebRTC and as a good federated complement to MQTT and COAP for IoT use cases: you can find his presentation <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-03-Matrix_Missing-Link_IOT.pdf">here</a>.
<p>Great techie discussions and debates down there, the stand was flooded with interested people and John had a hardtime answering everyone by himself on day 2!</p>
<p>But he still found a few minutes to do a TV interview for SYSCon TV on Tuesday evening! :)</p>
<p>[embed]http://youtu.be/JVq6S9V1Jcg[/embed]</p>
<h2>TAD Summit (Istanbul, November 12-13)</h2>
Matrix was a partner at <a href="http://tadsummit.com/2014/">TAD Summit</a> in Istanbul this year, a great opportunity to meet a very good mix of developers, industry players and mobile networks! TAD mixes conferences and technical workshops where everyone gets involved to create a vibrant ecosystem for Telecom Application Developers. Again really productive discussions and meetings as we continue our search for partners to help support the uptake of Matrix.
<p>Matthew's talk was fully recorded so just watch the video to get the real pitch!</p>

<h2>WebRTC World (San Jose, November 18-20)</h2>
Matrix's attendance at <a href="http://www.webrtcworld.com/conference/west/default.aspx">WebRTC World</a> in San Jose was more rewarding than expected! The team was ready to be part of the expo and give a talk on FOSS WebRTC options... but didn't hesitate to jump at the opportunity when a demo slot opened up! And that was a worthwhile decision as Matrix ended up winning not one but<strong> TWO awards from the demo:</strong> The <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Audience Choice Award</strong></span>
 as the audience's favourite demo of the 10 shown on Tuesday, and also the overall <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Best Social Integration Award</strong> </span>
from the Jury! So a big congrats to the dev team who were rushing to get the fine details ready in time and to Matthew for getting the audience's attention! And of course a even bigger thank you to everyone who voted for us, including in the Jury!
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sj.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-239" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sj-300x168.jpg" alt="Matthew at WebRTC World 2014" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Of course this drew lots of interest, and WebRTC Expo ended up the busiest show ever for the team who pitched solidly at the booth for 2 days in a row!</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Audience_Choice_14.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-240" style="box-shadow: none ! important;" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Audience_Choice_14.png" alt="Audience_Choice_14" width="300" height="229" /></a> <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Best_Social_Integration_14.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-241" style="box-shadow: none ! important;" src="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Best_Social_Integration_14.png" alt="Best_Social_Integration_14" width="300" height="229" /></a></div>
<h2>fOSSa (Rennes, November 20)</h2>
And eventually, while Matthew and John were celebrating in San José (or flying home, more accurately), Amandine was also evangelising at home in Rennes (France), where <a href="https://fossa.inria.fr/">fOSSa </a>was gathering experts from the opensource world for 3 days. Matrix was presented within the Serendipity section on the conférence, "Le Carrefour des Possibles": 6 minutes to pitch an open project that making dreams possible.
<p>So if you speak French or are not afraid to only read from <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-17.2-Matrix.pdf">the slides</a>, check out the video the team made of the pitch. The official one should be available soon!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>There's been loads of work going on in various branches on Synapse (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/federation_authorization">federation_authorization</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/event_signing">event_signing</a>) as we land the final features needed for Synapse to be used in production as a Matrix reference server.  Meanwhile the iOS demo client and SDK has been coming on leaps and bounds too over at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk</a>.</p>
<p>However, stuff has also been happening on the main Synapse development branch too, and we've just released 0.4.2 onto master for lots of various goodies - see release notes below.</p>
<p>Please upgrade your homeservers and play with the new client - the new JSON viewing/editing features are particularly useful and interesting for powerusers and developers!</p>
<p>Matthew</p>
<pre>

            <div>
                
                <p>It's been an incredibly busy few weeks in Matrixland - we've had our heads down rushing to get new stuff ready for today's <a href="http://disrupteuhackathon.challengepost.com">TechCrunch Disrupt London hackathon</a>.</p>
<p>The big news is that we have our first alpha releases of native Mobile SDKs available today for Matrix for iOS &amp; Android! These are entirely new projects - you can check out the SDKs and demo apps (which implement a basic Matrix chatroom client similar to the <a href="http://matrix.org/alpha">webclient demo</a> at:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk</a></li>
</ul>
We still have a lot of polishing and lipstick to apply to these, but it should be a good starting point for folks who'd like to hack on mobile apps for Matrix! We haven't had a chance to generate appledoc/javadoc for these yet, but we'll post them on matrix.org shortly.
<p>There's also been some work going into restructuring our documentation and finalising the spec - all Matrix generic documentation now lives in a new git project at <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc">http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc</a>. We're still working on wrapping all the details of the spec into a single canonical document, but it's getting there and should be locked down shortly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we're also pleased to announce the new Synapse 0.4 release series of the reference Matrix homeserver. Our focus on Synapse over the last few weeks has been on implementing the remaining pieces of the Matrix security model and getting the server to the point where folks can deploy it properly in production environments.</p>
<p><b>Synapse 0.4 deliberately breaks backwards compatibility on the server-server federation protocol</b>, as we now cryptographically sign all federation traffic at the HTTP layer (using Authorization headers) in order to have a strong assertion to the identity of the servers which exchange traffic. We can't really use SSL client/server certificates for this as it's incompatible with Synapse deployments which are hosted behind generic SSL loadbalancers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we have two other major development branches on Synapse which will land shortly - one of which <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/event_signing">cryptographically signs all events</a>, thus preventing tampering with room history, and the other of which performs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/federation_authorization">strict authorization</a> on all traffic received through federation to avoid malicious events being injected and breaking the consistency of the distributed room. These should be landing shortly - at which point the full security model of Matrix will be implemented in Synapse and we can finally remove the &quot;don't use this in production!&quot; warnings!</p>
<p>API developers: be aware that this release also fixes the confusion over timestamps in the client-server (and server-server) API. Events now have only one well-defined timestamp - event.origin_server_ts; the localtime on the homeserver which first receives a message. This replaces the previous confusing event.ts and event.content.hsob_ts timestamps. This should be a trivial change to implement.</p>
<p>Finally, we've also had a detour into <a href="http://trossenrobotics.com/phantomx-ax-hexapod.aspx">robotics</a> to build our new mascot (Sentinel)... pictures forthcoming shortly!</p>
<p>Thanks for supporting Matrix - please let us know how you get on with the new releases at <a href="http://matrix.org/alpha">#matrix:matrix.org!</a></p>

                <p>Matrix.org is a team of around 10 developers working together on the Matrix project, defining the Matrix open standard and developing the opensource reference client and server implementations.  Most of the team has day jobs at <a href="http://amdocs.com">Amdocs</a> or <a href="http://www.openmarket.com">OpenMarket</a> (who kindly sponsor us to work on Matrix), and we gladly welcome contributors from the wider open source community.
</p>
<p>Matrix was started by Matthew Hodgson and Amandine Le Pape whilst building Amdocs Unified Communications, on realising that traditional VoIP and IM standards were insufficient to power featureful apps which can openly federate with one another.  Matrix is designed to support open federation for the current and future state-of-the-art in communication apps using a simple web-friendly HTTP API standard.  Our dream is to break down the walls between today's communication silos, and make VoIP and IM as ubiquitous and open as email.</p>

<p>
Matthew Hodgson is technical co-founder of matrix.org, responsible for defining Matrix's vision with Amandine and moving obstacles out of the way of the team in order to build it.  Matthew has spent the last 15 years mainly designing and building various communication solutions on top of an alarming array of different technologies (IRC, IM, NNTP, IMAP, IAX, SIP/RTP, RTMP, XMPP... and now Matrix).
</p>
<p>Matthew's day job is running the Unified Communications team at Amdocs, creating communication apps for large mobile network operators (e.g. <a href="http://blah.com">Blah</a> for TIM Brasil).  Previously he ran "The Next Generation" telephony/media team at MX Telecom (acquired by Amdocs in 2010), building a highly distributed SIP softswitch and mobile-optimised WebRTC-compatible graph-based media framework and VoIP stack to power MX's voice and video services.  Matthew has also been known to dabble in sysadmin (running MX Telecom's sysadmin team), dubious graphic design and CGI, and wishes he had more time to play piano.  He has a degree in Computer Science and Physics from the University of Cambridge, and has previously worked at Accenture, the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, <a href="http://www.theonering.net">TheOneRing.net</a> as well as misguidedly co-founding a digital marketing startup in Bahrain.

                <p>Hey,</p>
<p>We realized we're missing a high level overview highlighting the key points of the specifications and architecture of Matrix, which could be useful for those who don't feel like going straight into the specs. So here is a <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Introducing-matrix.pdf">quick presentation</a> to fill in some of the gaps!</p>
<p>Please fire away with any questions :)</p>

                <h1>Hello world</h1>
I'm Matthew, and I'm responsible for the techie side of what we're up to with Matrix.
<p>Matrix is the result of a lot of work my team's done over the last 10 years or so (first at <a href="http://www.mxtelecom.com">MX Telecom</a>, then <a href="http://www.openmarket.com">OpenMarket</a>, and then <a href="http://www.amdocs.com/UnifiedCommunications">Amdocs</a>) in developing next-generation IP communication solutions.  First we started with an <a href="http://www.asterisk.org">Asterisk</a>-based platform running basic PSTN IVR services, and then shifted to an in-house IAX-based IVR platform built in Java, and then added circuit-switched (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G-324M">3G-324M</a>) video calling, then switched to SIP/RTP, C++ and a massively-distributed softswitch architecture affectionately called 'The Next Generation'.  Then the iPhone and Android came along, and we realised we didn't have to be constrained by built-in phone capabilities and ported our whole C++ SIP/RTP VoIP stack over to iOS/Android and got writing Video/VoIP calling apps.  This evolved to developing full-blown unified communication apps (e.g. <a href="http://www.blah.com">Blah</a>), using XMPP at first for messaging before switching to our own HTTP-based messaging APIs.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way it became painfully obvious that VoIP and IM hasn't really evolved as well as the rest of the internet.  Back when SIP/RTP first emerged, it simply wasn't mature enough to work on the open internet as well as HTTP or SMTP or even FTP - it needed STUN, ICE, TURN, Opus and many other refinements to be really usable in the wild.  And similarly XMPP hasn't taken over the world quite as much as we once hoped.  Meanwhile, many folks went and built their own proprietary walled-garden solutions (be it Skype, FaceTime, Viber, WhatsApp, or even our own efforts) and we've ended up in the current horrible situation where our online communication is fragmented across hundreds of isolated apps and websites.  It's like a world where email was never unified, and half the world is still stuck on Compuserve.  And it's counter to the whole ethos of the internet as an open platform for collaboration and communication.</p>
<p>We decided that we want to fix this and so we have built and published a new open standard, together with open source (ASLv2) reference server (Python/Twisted) and client (JS/Angular, Python, Perl) codebases, and so provide new building blocks that can be used to build truly interoperable federated IM and VoIP functionality.  We consider this effectively an investment in the industry: by creating a strictly non-profit initiative like Matrix, we both make the world a better place for end users - as well as creating new business opportunities (both opensource and commercial) for the telecoms industry as a whole.</p>
<p>The standard and code are all brand new and very much still in creation at this point, but we're releasing it early to get as much feedback and input from the community as early on as we possibly can. Right now our focus is on fully decentralised federated group messaging, but VoIP and identity management is coming together well too.  You can think of it as &quot;making VoIP/IM as interoperable and flexible as email&quot;, or perhaps &quot;the missing signalling layer for WebRTC&quot;, &quot;XMPP for an HTTP world&quot;, or “what would happen if IRC, XMPP, SIP, SMTP, IMAP and NNTP had kids?” Here are some reasons we think that you should use Matrix:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Simple pragmatic RESTful HTTP/JSON APIs.  No more XMPP or SIP stacks and wrestling XML streams or torture-testing SIP parsers.</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">No single points of control for channels of communication (unless you really want it for moderation or similar). Room state for a room is synchronised with eventual consistency over all participating Matrix servers - no single server controls the room.</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">No more netsplits - history re-heals itself if the matrix fractures</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">All communication is group by default: 1:1 chat is just a subset of group chat.</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Multi-device aware: all state is stored and synchronised in realtime across all devices, and away-state and notifications are aware of multiple devices.</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Uses arbitrary 3rd party identifiers - doesn't rely on JIDs or SIP URIs for identity.</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Share the same simple HTTP signalling channel for messaging and VoIP</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Support more efficient transports if you want (e.g. low-bandwidth/low-roundtrip sync on mobile)</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Built for mobile - e.g. support push notification and low-bandwidth/low-latency client-server transports if needed (in progress)</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">TLS (HTTPS) by default, either with self-signed certs with published public keys or proper SSL CA signed certs (in progress)</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">End-to-end PKI encryption (in progress)</span>
</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">Trusted federation of public identity servers available for publishing your PKI public keys and tracking your validated 3rd party IDs</span>
</li>
</ul>

                <p>Today is a big day for us as we are launching Matrix.org, an open initiative which has the goal of making real-time communication over IP as seamless and interoperable as email.</p>
<p>How do we want to achieve this? Very simply by creating a new federated, open-source ecosystem for VoIP and instant messaging on the internet! Ambitious right? :)</p>
<p>Actually not that much! In practice it's fairly simple: we are publishing the specification of a pragmatic and lightweight open standard, some opensource reference implementations of the servers and clients, and pragmatic RESTful HTTP JSON APIs, all of which are available right now on <a title="Github" href="http://github.com/matrix-org" target="_blank">Github</a>!</p>
<p>What does this mean for the world?</p>
<p>For techies, it gives developers a new way of building and running their own communications functionality, or integrating existing services into the Matrix ecosystem.</p>
<p>For consumers, it means that eventually they may be able to choose to use their favourite app from their trusted app provider, whilst reaching anyone they like given the entire Matrix ecosystem is interoperable.</p>
<p>So this is the very high level description of Matrix, but it misses the reasons why we've started this. We thought that rather than summarizing the main reasons for launching this project in a faceless post it would be interesting to present it from different perspectives, so we've asked some of the core team to give their take on it:</p>

                <h1>Why Matrix?</h1>
Hi, I'm Amandine and I look after the businessy bits of Matrix.org. I have a technical background and have always had the need to see the bigger picture. My motivation in starting Matrix has mainly been to make my dream of ubiquitous real-time communications come true and fix what felt broken in the industry. Here is the story.
<p>When studying telecoms I was fascinated by converging networks, the “Next Generation Network” as we called it. Wow, imagine! Having fixed lines, mobiles and computers able to communicate with each other? Call a number and have the ability to answer seamlessly on any device? And the capability to do video calls and share files? <i>That </i>was definitely Next Generation at the time! Especially given the best we could do with a mobile was bad GSM, MMS and WAP if you were lucky.... A decade later video calling is possible on any device; I can share anything I want with my contacts (pictures, videos, files, random stickers) thanks to hundreds of different apps; sometimes my history is even synced across several devices! And if I choose my mobile provider carefully I can even have a “One Number” service! :)</p>
<p>But still, we're far away from the ubiquitous dream of 10 years ago. None of my apps are talking to each other. One number is more often “one login per app”. My conversation history is scattered across all the apps (who never experienced the “Did you tell me on Facebook, Whatsapp, Skype or SMS???” question followed by 10 minutes of intense fiddling with your phone which of course is running out of battery?). My address book and profile data is stored everywhere by companies like Facebook, Google and random startups, but who knows how much they really value your privacy...</p>
<p>Is the tech not good enough yet? Only partially: most of the features, typically IM, video, VoIP,  are already available and widely used. However it is a reality that no tech has really imposed itself as an interoperability standard. What about economic blockers then? A better bet: what are the incentives for big companies and small startups to share their communities? Most of these corporations choose a business model that locks their users into walled gardens, directly linking their valuation to this user base. But ultimately this is bad for competition and bad for the users.</p>
<p>What about phone networks then? Why don't they do anything? Well, they have tried. It's called RCS (Rich Communication Services), or joyn. It's a good initiative designed by committee and implemented as a functionality deeply embedded in the network rather than a light over-the-top deployment and consequently very expensive and time-consuming to put in place. Similarly as per telco's historical positioning, RCS is more focused on quality of service than quality of user experience. But RCS is facing a few challenges: communications over IP must be free for the user to compete with the Skype &amp; WhatsApp of this world, which limits a lot the return on investment of the deployment of an expensive network update, limiting the adoption of RCS by mobile networks. Besides quality of service is not necessarily what will trigger a success when competing with over the top apps which are 100% focused on providing the best user experience... And despite the GSMA's best efforts implementing interoperability between networks is proving very painful, limiting the growth of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>But ultimately we all know that today success is driven by users. This multitude of minds which decides the exact split of fun and usefulness that will define the value of a product and make it crazily successful overnight. So why are users not pushing for this ubiquity? I see two reasons: first they often don't realize how useful it could be and second: there is nothing to push! Indeed it can easily be considered as handy to have one app per group of people I want to communicate with: Facebook messenger with my school friends, Whatsapp with international friends, Skype with my family, Snapchat with my boyfriend, Voxer with my best friend... But why can't I have only one app, the one <i>I</i> prefer, to get in touch with everyone, whatever they are using? And if I want a fancy Tango-like video experience then I couldstill launch Tango for this scenario and have the whole chat history there. I truly believe that once fragmentation will be over everyone will wonder how we could ever live with it.</p>
<p>And what about privacy? Isn't it bad enough that the second I send an email to my friend asking if he's booked his flights to Madrid I get a flurry of airline adverts for flights to Spain? Even without going into the debate of whether governments should file every citizen, it's a question of principles - I'd rather have my communication history and my contacts stored by someone I trust and avoid useless adverts.  Some of you will say “Oh but you're French. ‘Vive la Révolution!' is your default motto...” - but think about it for a minute:</p>
<p>Imagine: only install the apps <i>you</i> want on your phone for communication. Use the ones you prefer because the UX is great or you love their smileys. Your whole address book is there, correctly merged. All the conversation history with your friends and family is there. And you don't care what app they're using. Or how they logged in: your app discovers them based on any ID (email, phone number, Facebook): you just need to have them in your address book. You know where your data is - perhaps stored by a new startup using renewable energy for their data center, just because you want to save the planet. Or by your geeky brother running his own server under his bed (using end-to-end encryption if you think he might be nosy!). You can still have many apps but each allows you to do different fun stuff: fancy video, crazy pictures, drawings, imaginative stickers. You control your communication.  You decide what to you want to use, who you want to trust. Welcome to Matrix.</p>
