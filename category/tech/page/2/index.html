                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>We released a new version (0.2.3) of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.matrix.androidsdk.alpha">Android Matrix Console</a> application today - this is a decent upgrade over 0.2.2.  Changelog below.</p>
<p>If you're an Android user, please install the app from the Play Store and give it a go and give us some feedback on #android:matrix.org or Google Play.</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

                <p>We just pushed out a major new release of <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse 0.7.0</a>, the python reference server for Matrix, and a minor maintenance update for <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-angular-sdk">matrix-angular-sdk 0.6.2</a>, the reference web client implementation.</p>
<p>The emphasis here has been on federation performance and stability - with all the recent interest from <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/matrix/">FOSDEM</a> and <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/632572">LWN</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8997844">HackerNews</a> we've been getting a lot of traffic on matrix.org and new servers federating up, so we've been busy profiling and fixing performance on some of the hot paths by adding in-memory caches and similar.</p>
<p><b>This release is <em>highly</em> recommended if you are running a federated server, as it fixes many denial-of-service failure modes in the federation implementation, as well as many performance improvements</b></p>
<p>Behind the scenes, there's also lots of work going on for v2 of the Client-Server API (which lets you filter the events your client subscribes to in a room, and combines the 'initial sync' and 'eventstream' APIs into a single simplified '/sync' API) - the alpha of this has landed in 0.7.0, but we don't recommend trying to use it yet. Meanwhile the Application Service API is effectively finished, but hasn't landed on the master branch yet. Synapse also finally has initial support for push notifications for the iOS client now via the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal">sygnal</a> APNS gateway, although we need to actually document how to set this up to be usable in general.</p>
<p>Finally, we have switched to recommending that synapse is installed in a virtualenv rather than into ~/.local, due to various problems with how setup.py's dependency management works. Instructions on setting up a virtualenv can be found in the <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/README.rst">README</a>.</p>
<p>On the clientside: we've improved performance, enabled identicons for unknown users, and now fully support OpenWebRTC for VoIP calling from Safari, Bowser, and other OpenWebRTC-capable browsers!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone running servers - please upgrade, tell your friends, and help us grow Matrix!</p>
<p> </p>
<pre>
Changes in synapse v0.7.0 (2015-02-12)
======================================

* Add initial implementation of the query auth federation API, allowing
  servers to agree on whether an event should be allowed or rejected.
* Persist events we have rejected from federation, fixing the bug where
  servers would keep requesting the same events.
* Various federation performance improvements, including:
  - Add in memory caches on queries such as:
     * Computing the state of a room at a point in time, used for
       authorization on federation requests.
     * Fetching events from the database.
     * User's room membership, used for authorizing presence updates.
  - Upgraded JSON library to improve parsing and serialisation speeds.
* Add default avatars to new user accounts using pydenticon library.
* Correctly time out federation requests.
* Retry federation requests against different servers.
* Add support for push notifications and push rules.
* Add alpha versions of proposed new CSv2 APIs, including ``/sync`` API.

                <p>Happy 2015 from everyone at Matrix.org!</p>
<p>We're excited to kick off the new year with a major performance upgrade for Synapse: having had a chance to do some profiling over the Christmas break, Synapse 0.6.1 improves performance by up to an order of magnitude thanks to optimising the way events are constructed and manipulated, DB optimisations, etc.  Suddenly things are feeling <em>much</em> more snappy and less of a PoC and more of a real system, which hopefully bodes well for 2015!  Please upgrade if you're running a homeserver, or install one if you're not - grab the code from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.</p>
<p>The iOS SDK and demo app has also been improving lots in the last few weeks - grab the latest code from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk</a>.  We have zoomable image support; full support for the new media repository in Synapse 0.6.0; file transfer status UI; offline support; snappy message synchronisation and more...</p>
<p>We also released a new simple Python SDK client library for Python called <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/matrix-client">matrix-client</a>, which is now being used by <a href="https://github.com/Kegsay/Matrix-NEB">NEB</a> (our general-purpose Matrix helper bot).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our (constantly evolving) plan for the beginning of 2015 is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Finish v2 of the client-server API based on all the lessons learnt since launch: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/4">draft in progress here</a></li>	 
        <li>Finish the Application Services API to allow proper gateways and services in and out of Matrix at last:<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/5">draft in progress here</a></li>
        <li>Re-release the spec based on the above</li>
        <li>Build robust gateways (IRC, XMPP, SIP and more) on top of the AS API</li>
        <li>Polish and release the iOS, Android demo clients - including push notification and VoIP support!</li>

                <p>We're proud to announce the new 0.6.0 major release of Synapse: the Python reference implementation of Matrix - as well as 0.6.0 of the AngularJS example Matrix client, as a special early Christmas present from the Matrix team :)</p>
<p>The main priority here has been hunting down stability bugs whilst also adding in a few more features.  The most exciting new feature is the new Media/Content API: this allows every homeserver to replicate, cache and thumbnail any files associated with Matrix rooms, rather than relying on retrieving them from the origin homeserver as was previously the case.  This is really cool, as it effectively makes Matrix a distributed content distribution network and gives the same replication semantics to file attachments as to the rest of JSON in rooms.</p>
<p>We've also landed a major new branch which changes the way events are represented internally in order to make them immutable, and fixes a whole range of minor stability issues.  In other news, performance issues are still a work in progress...</p>

<code>
Changes in synapse 0.6.0 (2014-12-19)
=====================================
<ul>
<li>Add new API for media upload and download that supports thumbnailing.</li>
<li>Replicate media uploads over multiple homeservers so media is always served
to clients from their local homeserver.  This obsoletes the
--content-addr parameter and confusion over accessing content directly
from remote homeservers.</li>
<li>Implement exponential backoff when retrying federation requests when
sending to remote homeservers which are offline.</li>
<li>Implement typing notifications.</li>
<li>Fix bugs where we sent events with invalid signatures due to bugs where
we incorrectly persisted events.</li>
<li>Improve performance of database queries involving retrieving events.</li>
</ul>
</code>
<code>
Changes in Matrix Angular SDK 0.6.0 (2014-12-19)
================================================
<p>Breaking changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uploading files in the web client will now hit the new content repository URL
introduced in Synapse 0.6, and be incompatible with previous Matrix clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused the event stream to become wedged when the computer is asleep.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused the recents to update but not the message window.</li>
</ul>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typing notifications will now be sent.</li>
<li>Typing notifications will now be displayed for other users.</li>
<li>Use the new content repository introduced in Synapse 0.6 when uploading files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display more error dialogs rather than silently failing.</li>
<li>Display loading spinners on signup.</li>
<li>Display feedback when joining a room.</li>
<li>CTRL + clicking on a recents entry will now open that room in a new tab.</li>
<li>Clicking on links in messages will now open them in a new tab.</li>
<li>Provide a progress dialog when uploading files.</li>
<li>Display a red bar when the event stream connection is lost for an extended period of time.</li>
</ul>

                <p>Since we exited alpha and released Synapse 0.5.0 last week there's been a flurry of bug fix releases as we ran around firefighting some of the more exciting problems which popped up thanks to merging the federation-auth and event-signing branches.</p>
<p>We released 0.5.3a on Nov 27, which seems to now be pretty stable - if you were holding off on upgrading your homeserver and trying to federate with the new 0.5 release branch, now would be a great time to press the button!</p>
<p>Most excitingly, we believe we have <strong>finally fixed the PyNaCL dependency problems</strong> which have plagued pretty much anyone setting up a homeserver.  This was a problem in PyNaCL itself - huge thanks to Mark for hunting it down and sending the PyNaCL team <a href="http://git.io/1Rr5OA">pull</a> <a href="http://git.io/SUHmBA">requests</a> to get it fixed.  As a result, installing synapse as of 0.5.3a really should be a one-liner at last (please let us know if it isn't!):</p>
<p><code>pip install --user --process-dependency-links https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tarball/master</code></p>
<p>The full changelog of what's been going on since 0.5.0 is as follows:</p>
<pre>
Changes in synapse 0.5.3a (2014-11-27)
=====================================

 * Depend on a fixed version of PyNaCL
 * Fix bug that caused joining a remote room to fail if a single event was not
   signed correctly.
 * Fix bug which caused servers to continuously try and fetch events from other
   servers.

Changes in synapse 0.5.2 (2014-11-26)
=====================================

 * Fix major bug that caused rooms to disappear from people's initial sync.

Changes in synapse 0.5.1 (2014-11-26)
=====================================
See UPGRADES.rst for specific instructions on how to upgrade.

 * Fix bug where we served up an Event that did not match its signatures.
 * Fix regression where we no longer correctly handled the case where a
   homeserver receives an event for a room it doesn't recognise (but is in.)

                <p>We're really excited to release the biggest update yet to Synapse (the python/twisted reference Matrix homeserver implementation) - version 0.5.0 is out!</p>
<p>This effectively concludes our alpha testing phase - Synapse's security model is now feature complete and we are now cautiously encouraging people to run their own Synapse installation on the 'net; federate up; and help us squash all and any bugs as we get beta testing.</p>
<p>Synapse 0.5.0 has huge database schema changes from previous versions as we have landed both the event-signing and federation-authorisation branches and so added full cryptographic signing of all matrix events and unified the client-server and server-server model of events/PDUs.  As a result, migrating history is Hard - we recommend a clean start if possible; if not, come talk to us in #matrix:matrix.org.  UPGRADE.rst has the details.</p>
<p>The full changelog is as per below - please upgrade your homeserver or install a new one if you're new here and join Matrix and help us create a robust open distributed messaging fabric for the web!</p>
<pre>
Changes in synapse 0.5.0 (2014-11-19)
=====================================
This release includes changes to the federation protocol and client-server API
that is not backwards compatible.

This release also changes the internal database schemas and so requires servers to
drop their current history. See UPGRADES.rst for details.

Homeserver:
 * Add authentication and authorization to the federation protocol. Events are
   now signed by their originating homeservers.
 * Implement the new authorization model for rooms.
 * Split out web client into a separate repository: matrix-angular-sdk.
 * Change the structure of PDUs.
 * Fix bug where user could not join rooms via an alias containing 4-byte
   UTF-8 characters.
 * Merge concept of PDUs and Events internally.
 * Improve logging by adding request ids to log lines.
 * Implement a very basic room initial sync API.
 * Implement the new invite/join federation APIs.

Webclient:
 * The webclient has been moved to a separate repository.

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Synapse 0.3.4 is out! The main changes here are a huge fleet of bugfixes to the webclient, and the addition of TURN support for VoIP relaying. This makes VoIP/Video call setup much more reliable (although the UI still needs some love).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we set an IRC bridge (<a href="https://github.com/tm604/Matrix-IRCBridge">https://github.com/tm604/Matrix-IRCBridge</a>) running linking #matrix:matrix.org and #matrix-dev:matrix.org to their Freenode counterparts (#matrix &amp; #matrix-dev respectively) - much fun to see innocent IRC users assimilated up into Matrix, and for us to now be using Matrix for /all/ our development chat and interaction (whether it's through a Matrix client or an IRC client).</p>
<p>To upgrade to the latest homeserver, just <code>git pull &amp;&amp; ./synctl restart</code>.  If you want to start playing with VoIP in earnest on your own homeserver, you'll need to install a TURN server - see <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/turn-howto.rst">docs/turn-howto.rst</a> for details on how to set one up.</p>
<p><a href="http://matrix.org/alpha">http://matrix.org/alpha</a> has already been upgraded to 0.3.4, so feel free to play with all the new stuff there.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Matthew</p>
<h1 id="changes-in-synapse-0-3-4-2014-09-25">Changes in synapse 0.3.4 (2014-09-25)</h1>

                <p>Hello world,</p>
<p>Synapse 0.3.3 was released today, concentrating on both feature &amp; stability improvements on the webclient.  The big news is that 1:1 video calling via WebRTC is implemented (although we're still working on some stability issues, and Synapse doesn't support TURN yet.  This will be coming in the next few days however!).</p>
<p>Play with the demo server at http://matrix.org/alpha, or update your own homeserver with a <code>git pull &amp;&amp; ./synctl restart</code> or by cloning a new checkout with <code>git clone https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse.git</code></p>
