                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Just realised that the release of Synapse 0.10.0 on Sept 3rd 2015 was precisely one year from the <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/2014/09/03/welcome-to-the-matrix-blog/">initial launch of Matrix</a>. As such, it feels only right to have a quick update on where we've got to so far, and where we expect things to go from here!</p>
<p>Back at the original launch, all we had was a <em>very</em> rough and ready Synapse homeserver, an early draft of the spec, and precisely one client - the Angular webclient, much of which was mainly written at the last minute on the plane to TechCrunch Disrupt SF (and has never quite recovered :S). From this initial seed it's been incredibly exciting and slightly scary to see how much things have advanced and grown - the big headlines for the past year (in roughly chronological order) include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Making Federation Work:
<ul>
	<li>Switching all of federation over to SSL, using perspectives for key management</li>
	<li>Crypto-signing all the events in a room's message graph to assert integrity</li>
	<li>Sorting out 'power levels' and 'auth events' to allow totally decentralised kicks/bans/etc to work in an open federated environment</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Decentralised content repository and thumbnailing</li>
	<li>Reference mobile "Matrix Console" clients for iOS and Android</li>
	<li>Official client SDKs for iOS and Android - both at the API wrapping layer and the reusable UI component layer</li>
	<li>Push notifications for APNS and GCM (both on server &amp; clients)</li>
	<li>Official client SDKs for JavaScript, Python and Perl</li>
	<li>Typing notifications</li>
	<li>The sytest integration test harness</li>
	<li>Proper WebRTC support for VoIP, including TURN.</li>
	<li>Application Services and Bots - actually letting Matrix defragment communications :)
<ul>
	<li>Bridging to all of Freenode, Moznet and other IRC networks</li>
	<li>Matrix&lt;-&gt;SMS bridge from OpenMarket</li>
	<li>SIP bridges via FreeSWITCH and Verto</li>
	<li>Parrot Bebop Drone &lt;-&gt; Matrix bridge via Janus</li>
	<li>ODB2 telemetry &lt;-&gt;  Matrix bridge via Android SDK</li>
	<li>Reusable bridging framework in Node</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Many iterations and refinements to the spec, including designing v2 of the client SDK</li>
	<li>Switching from Angular to React for all of our web-client development</li>
	<li>Customisable skins and embedding support for the matrix-react-sdk</li>
	<li>End-to-end encryption (not quite formally released yet, but it's written, specced and it works!)</li>
	<li>VoIP support on mobile (landed in Android; still experimenting with different WebRTC stacks on iOS)</li>
	<li>History ACLs</li>
	<li>Delivery reports</li>
	<li>Switching from access_tokens to macaroons for authentication (not yet released)</li>
	<li>Lots and lots of performance work on Synapse, as we've tried to get the most out of Twisted.</li>
</ul>
...and last but not least, the evolution of the #matrix:matrix.org community - including loads of 3rd party clients, SDKs and application services, synapse packaging and even experimental home servers :)
<p>Overall the last year was an exercise in actually fleshing out the whole ecosystem of Matrix and getting it to a stable usable beta acceptable to early adopters. The plan for the next 12 months is then to make the transition from stable beta to a properly production grade environment that can be used to run large scale services used by normal end-users. In practice, this means:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A major rearchitecture of Synapse.
<ul>
	<li>Synapse currently has no support for horizontal scaling or clustering within a single instance, and many will have seen the performance problems we've hit with a relatively monolithic Twisted app architecture. Profiling deferreds in Twisted has been a particular nightmare.</li>
	<li>During September we are starting the process of splitting Synapse apart into separate services (e.g. separating reading eventstreams from writing messages) both to allow horizontal scalability and to experiment with implementing the services in more efficient languages than Python/Twisted.</li>
	<li>We will continue the normal Synapse release process in parallel with this work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Ensuring Matrix can support a genuinely excellent UX for normal end-users on glossy clients, and supporting glossy client development as required.  The days of Matrix being just for powerusers are numbered... :)</li>
	<li>Switching to use 3rd party IDs as the primary means of referring to users in Matrix, hiding matrix IDs as a feature for powerusers and developers.</li>
	<li>Finishing the spec. You may have noticed the spec has been quietly evolving over the last few months - finally gaining a versioning system, and with larger chunks of it being automatically generated from formal API spec descriptions. We will be finishing off and filling in the remaining holes.</li>
	<li>Improving the documentation (and FAQ!) on matrix.org in general by switching to a git-backed jekyll system for all the staticish content</li>
	<li>Replace the Angular-based reference webapp bundled with Synapse entirely with a matrix-react-sdk based reference app, and providing better examples and documentation for using it to embed Matrix functionality into existing websites.</li>
	<li>Moving to v2 of the client-server API. This fixes some significant limitations in the v1 API that everyone's been using all year, and should improve performance significantly for many use cases (especially when launching apps). The v1 API will hang around for a very very long time for backwards compatibility.</li>
	<li>Writing *lots* more bridges and integrations to other protocols, now we have a nice framework for rapidly developing them.</li>
	<li>General security audits and double-checking the security model.</li>
	<li>New features, including:
<ul>
	<li>Multiway VoIP and Video conferencing, most likely using FreeSWITCH's new conferencing capabilities via an Application Service bridge (should be ready very shortly!)</li>
	<li>Getting E2E crypto reviewed/audited and putting it live across the board.</li>
	<li>Adding VoIP to iOS</li>
	<li>Implementing delivery reports in all clients</li>
	<li>Improving how invites work (ability to reject them; metadata about where they came from)</li>
	<li>Search API</li>
	<li>Improved file management</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>...and an awful lot of bug fixing as we work through the backlog we've accumulated on JIRA.</li>
</ul>
Hopefully this won't take up all year(!) and is just a beginning - there's a huge list of interesting ideas beyond this baseline which we'll be looking at assuming the core stuff above is on track. For instance, we need to work out how to decentralise the identity services that mapping 3rd party IDs to matrix IDs. We need to work out how to avoid spam. And it could be fascinating to start bridging more internet-of-things devices and ecosystems into Matrix, or decentralising user accounts between homeservers, or perhaps using Matrix for synchronising more sophisticated data structures than timelines and key-value state dictionaries...
<p>Finally, we also want to save as much time as possible to help support the wider community in building out clients, services and servers on top of Matrix. Just like the web itself, Matrix is only as useful as the content and services built on top of it - and we will do everything we can to help the pioneers who are interested in colonising this brave new world :)</p>
<p>Huge thanks to everyone over the last year who have supported us - whether that's by creating an account and using the system, running a homeserver, hacking on top of the platform, contributing to the core project, enduring one of our presentations, or even paying for us to work on this. The coming year should prove incredibly interesting, and we hope you'll stay and bring along all your friends, family and colleagues for the ride as the adventure continues!</p>
<p>Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix.org team.</p>

                <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Whilst the blog has been a bit quiet, we've actually had an incredibly busy summer refining Synapse, building the new matrix-react-sdk and example apps, building an entirely new matrix-appservice-bridge framework for rapidly creating Matrix&lt;-&gt;other-protocol bridges, getting end-to-end encryption ready for primetime and lots more fun stuff as we keep chipping away to take Matrix out of beta.  We'll write about all of these once they're ready, but right now the big news is that after 6 release candidates we have a major new update for Synapse out today - version 0.10.0.  This also includes 0.9.4, which we never quite got around to releasing and ended up skipping from 0.9.4-rc1 straight to 0.10.0-rc1.</p>
<p>The release focuses mainly on performance, bugfixes, and infrastructure work to support forthcoming features like end-to-end encryption, read receipts, etc.  Some of the more exciting new features include preset ACLs for room creation; history visibility ACLs; SAML2 single-sign-on login (courtesy of Ericsson, thanks guys!), filename support when sending files, support for specifying a canonical alias for a room, support for intermediary SSL certificates, etc.</p>
<p>The full changelog is below.</p>

                <p>I was at <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/2015/Edinburgh">IndieWebCamp Edinburgh</a> last week and during the hack day I <a href="https://github.com/Kegsay/matrix-as-micropub">created a Matrix Application Service</a> (AS) which could act as an IndieWeb <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/Micropub">Micropub</a> client. Any Matrix message sent to the AS (<code>@micropub:domain</code>) would be converted to a request to a Micropub endpoint.</p>
<p>This required the AS to support <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a> - which it does by sending <code>!indieauth http://yourdomain.dom</code> to <code>@micropub:domain</code> which then returns an OAuth2 URL to login via. Currently, the AS just supports a 1:1 mapping from <code>m.text</code> to <code>h:entry</code> but in the future, it can be expanded to include categories and potentially the reverse mapping (where Micropub clients can act as Matrix users!).</p>
<p>Overall, it was a <a href="http://rhiaro.co.uk/2015/07/indiewebcamp-edinburgh-closes">great weekend</a> and I look forward to adding more support for IndieWeb protocols in the future.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We seem to have done that thing again where we were too busy writing new stuff (E2E crypto, all-new React-based Web SDK, long-awaited iOS Console update) to remember that we'd released a new version of Synapse - sorry!</p>
<p>Synapse 0.9.3 was released on July 1st (actually on June 23rd as 0.9.3-rc1, but was released without changes).  It's a fairly minor release but does provide some performance improvements and bug fixes - see below for details.  Get it from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a> if you haven't already.</p>
<code>

                <p>We've been running an IRC gateway from Matrix to Freenode almost since day 1 - originally it was a <a href="/blog/project/perl-matrix-ircbridge/">simple perl bot</a> written by tm604 using Net::Async::Matrix; later it was rewritten by LeoNerd to be a bit more modular, and nowadays it's a full <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">IRC/Matrix Application Service</a> written in Node.js by Kegan.</p>
<p>Up until the end of last week the bridge was limited to synchronising a fixed number of channels between Freenode and Matrix (#matrix, #matrix-dev, #openwebrtc, #vuc and #hypothes.is, to be precise), as well as any PMs.  But as of Friday, with huge thanks to the admins over at Freenode, we can now bridge <em>any</em> channel in Freenode through to Matrix.</p>
<p>Doing this is trivial - you just <code>/join #freenode_#channelname:matrix.org</code> from a typical Matrix client - e.g. <code>/join #freenode_#Node.js:matrix.org</code> will give you access to all of #Node.js via Matrix, effectively using Matrix as a great big distributed IRC bouncer in the sky ;)</p>
<p>There are a few limitations in the current setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>We only incrementally synchronise the membership lists when folks speak in either IRC or Matrix.  This is to avoid flooding either IRC or Matrix with lurkers when the bridge initially joins a channel.  We have some plans to improve this in future - see <a href="/jira/browse/BOTS-53">BOTS-53</a> for some of the sordid details.</li>
<li>We don't synchronise joins/parts currently to avoid flooding Matrix with lots of IRC join/part spam.  Again, this will improve in future.</li>
<li>You can't join +k channels.</li>
<li>Kicks/bans/invites and other ACLs currently don't propagate between IRC &amp; Matrix.  (I.e. a Matrix user can be kicked from IRC, but it'll continue to sit in Matrix unless also kicked for there).  +i chanmode supported however.</li>
<li>Bridged public IRC rooms are not yet advertised in the public room list on matrix.org.</li>
<li>It should be possible to change the nickname of your IRC user by messaging <code>!nick irc.freenode.net MrFlibble</code> to @appservice-irc:matrix.org.  (This isn't actually turned on right now, but should be fixed shortly.  See <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/blob/master/HOWTO.md#changing-nicks">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/blob/master/HOWTO.md#changing-nicks</a> for details.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll keep chipping away at making the IRC&lt;-&gt;Matrix mapping perfect, but in its current state it's still really usable.  It's obviously beta still, but please give it a go and let us know in #matrix:matrix.org how you get on with it!</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>If things seem a bit quiet here at the moment it's because most of the Matrix team is in the 'build' phase across the board on a bunch of major new projects - including the long-awaited reusable UI component library for the Web, end-to-end encryption support, stable VoIP on mobile and a few other surprises.  The first wave of all this new work landed today in the form of a new major version release (0.1.0) of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">matrix-js-sdk</a>: our javascript SDK library.</p>
<p>The history of JS client support on Matrix is that in the original rush to get a PoC webclient out the door back in September, we jumped straight to talking to the Matrix HTTP API from Angular controllers in 'syweb'.  This then got split into an Angular SDK (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-angular-sdk">matrix-angular-sdk</a>) containing a bunch of services for handling the Matrix client state with the actual webapp sitting alongside as an example of the SDK.  This then in turn got split into a basic matrix-js-sdk (wrapping the Matrix client-server HTTP API) and matrix-angular-sdk (handling the clientside state and exposing it as Angular services) - and this is how the current demo Angular webapp works at <a href="http://matrix.org/beta">http://matrix.org/beta</a>.</p>
<p>However, this poses a major problem if you want a richer client SDK but don't want to use Angular - e.g. if you prefer another framework (or no framework at all), or are using the SDK in an Application Service or similar.  So, this has prompted a major upgrade to the matrix-js-sdk in order to extend it to act both as a simple wrapper of the Matrix Client-Server HTTP API, but also expose a full object and event model to describe the state of a Matrix client together with all the higher level functions to drive it.  To quote from the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/blob/master/README.md">README</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
This SDK provides a full object model around the Matrix Client-Server API and emits events for incoming data and state changes. Aside from wrapping the HTTP API, it:
<ul>
<li>Handles syncing (via /initialSync and /events)</li>
<li>Handles the generation of "friendly" room and member names.</li>
<li>Handles historical RoomMember information (e.g. display names).</li>
<li>Manages room member state across multiple events (e.g. it handles typing, power levels and membership changes).</li>
<li>Exposes high-level objects like Rooms, RoomState, RoomMembers and Users which can be listened to for things like name changes, new messages, membership changes, presence changes, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Later versions of the SDK will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically retry requests to send messages due to network errors.</li>
<li>Automatically retry requests to send messages due to rate limiting errors.</li>
<li>Mark events' sent status (e.g. 'not sent').</li>
<li>Handle "local echo" of messages sent.</li>
<li>Handle queueing of messages.</li>
<li>Handle pagination.</li>
<li>Expose a RoomSummary which would be suitable for a recents page.</li>
<li>Provide different pluggable storage layers (e.g. local storage, database-backed)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It also is designed to provide an API that abstracts both version 1 of the client-server API and the upcoming version 2 (which fixes various thinkos we've discovered along the way in v1).</p>
<p>This is incredibly exciting stuff as it now gives a really robust yet lightweight API for client-side and application-service development in JavaScript.  Predictably enough we're using it to develop our new reusable web UI components, and I suspect we'll see new Node-based application services making use of in the near future.  Meanwhile, it's more than topical as it should run straight on top of the <a href="http://tessel.io">Tessel</a> JavaScript hardware modules we're giving away this weekend as our prize for the best hack built on Matrix at <a href="/blog/2015/06/05/global-tadhack-hackathon/">TADHack</a> - letting the little Tessel ARM system-on-a-chip speak a very rich and native Matrix dialect!</p>
<p>The new matrix-js-sdk comes with comprehensive jsdoc detailing the new API which you can find at <a href="http://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-js-sdk/global.html">http://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-js-sdk/global.html</a>.  There are also some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/tree/master/examples">basic examples</a> available, including a new simple node-powered command-line client designed for testing the SDK.  Finally, if you're interested in reading the design process by which we've converged on the current API, all the details may be found in JIRA on <a href="/jira/browse/SYJS-5">SYJS-5</a>.</p>
<p>So: if you've been itching to get your hands on a much more powerful pure-JS Matrix SDK, now's your chance!  It's very early days for the new API so we expect to see a few incompatible changes on the horizon, but we encourage you to have a play and <a href="http://matrix.org/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">tell us what you think!</a>.</p>
<p>To find out more, go check out the project at <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk</a>, or if you're feeling daring just grab the library with <code>npm install matrix-js-sdk</code> and get hacking!</p>

                <p>In the excitement of KamailioWorld last week we completely forgot to mention that we released Synapse 0.9.1.</p>
<p>This is a pretty important performance and stability update of all the new stuff that landed in 0.9.0, as well as landing a major new feature in the form of 'backfill': we finally have the ability to correctly sync in historical conversation history over federation for newly federated rooms.  In other words, if you join a remote room you should be able to navigate its history as intended.</p>
<p>We highly recommend upgrading to 0.9.1 for all the performance improvements and backfill support - get it now from <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>.</p>
<code>
Changes in synapse v0.9.1 (2015-05-26)
======================================
<p>General:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add support for backfilling when a client paginates. This allows servers to
request history for a room from remote servers when a client tries to
paginate history the server does not have - SYN-36</li>
<li>Fix bug where you couldn't disable non-default pushrules - SYN-378</li>
<li>Fix <code>register_new_user</code> script - SYN-359</li>
<li>Improve performance of fetching events from the database, this improves both
initialSync and sending of events.</li>
<li>Improve performance of event streams, allowing synapse to handle more
simultaneous connected clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>Federation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix bug with existing backfill implementation where it returned the wrong
selection of events in some circumstances.</li>
<li>Improve performance of joining remote rooms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add support for changing the bind host of the metrics listener via the <code>metrics_bind_host</code> option.</li>
</ul>

Whilst cosmetically it looks almost identical to 0.3.x, the architecture is completely different given the app is now built using <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-kit">MatrixKit</a> - and stability has improved considerably as a result.  Please install and let us know how you get on!</p>

<p>Like a lot of open source projects, we use IRC a lot. Naturally, we also use Matrix to communicate with each other. For some time now we've had an IRC bot sitting on specific channels to &quot;bridge&quot; together IRC and Matrix. This bot simply sent IRC messages when it received Matrix messages and vice versa. As we started to rely on it more and more though, we realised that there were things that were impossible for simple client-side bots to do by themselves. This spurred the development of Application Services which <a href="/blog/2015/03/02/introduction-to-application-services/">I introduced in my previous post</a>. In this blog post, I want to outline some of the features and techniques of the IRC application service which we've been working on over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Specific channel-to-matrix room bridging</strong> : This is what the original IRC bot did. You can specify specific channels and specific room IDs, and messages will be bridged.</li>
	<li><strong>Dynamic channel-to-matrix room bridging</strong> : This allows Matrix users to join any channel on an IRC network, rather than being forced to use one of the specific channels configured.</li>
	<li><strong>Two-way PM support</strong> : IRC users can PM the virtual "M-" users and private Matrix rooms will be created. Likewise, Matrix users can invite the virtual "@irc_Nick:domain" user IDs to a room and a PM to the IRC nick will be made.</li>
	<li><strong>IRC nick changing support </strong>: Matrix users are no longer forced to use "M-" nicks and can change them by sending "!nick" messages directly to the bridge.</li>
	<li><strong>Ident support</strong> : This allows usernames to be authenticated for virtual IRC clients, which means IRC bans can be targeted at the Matrix user rather than the entire application service.</li>
</ul>
The use of the Application Services API means:
<ul>
	<li>The bot can reserve user IDs. This prevents humans from registering for @irc_... user IDs which would then clash with the operation of the bot.</li>
	<li>The bot can reserve room aliases. This prevents humans from register for #irc_... aliases which would then clash with the operation of the bot.</li>
	<li>The bot can trivially manage hundreds of users. Events are pushed to the application service directly. If you tried to do this as a client-side bot, you would need one event stream connection per virtual user.</li>
	<li>The bot can lazily create rooms on demand. This means Matrix users can join non-existent room aliases and have the application service quickly track an IRC channel and create a room with that alias, allowing the join request to succeed.</li>
</ul>
Implementation details:
<ul>
	<li>Written in Node.js, designed to be run using <code>forever</code>.</li>
        <li>Built on the generic <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-node">matrix-appservice-node</a> framework.</li>
	<li>Supports sending metrics in statsd format.</li>
	<li>Uses matrix-appservice-node to provide a standardised interface when writing application services, rather than an explicit web framework (though under the hood matrix-appservice-node is using Express).</li>
</ul>
At present, the IRC application service is in beta, and is being run on #matrix and #matrix-dev. If you want to give it a go, <a title="Matrix-IRC Application Service" href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">check it out on Github</a> - it is not currently released on npm. <b>N.B. it requires features from the develop branch of synapse; either run your own synapse off the develop branch or wait a few days for us to release Synapse 0.9.0</b>.
<p>Needless to say, we look forward to this being the first of many full network&lt;-&gt;network bridges into Matrix - come chat on <a href="/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a> if you'd like to write or run your own!  Next up is Lync and XMPP...</p>
