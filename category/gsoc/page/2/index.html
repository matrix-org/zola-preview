                <p>The Google Summer of Code 2019 is coming to an end for me, so it means that it’s time for the final report.</p>
<h2 id="the-work-done">The work done</h2>
<p>I’ve been taking care of the project “Matrix Visualisations” during these past months. This project aimed at initiating the development of a tool which allows the real-time visualisation of the events DAG of a given Matrix room, as seen from the perspective of one or more homeservers (HS’s).</p>
<p>Regarding my initial proposal, I’ve completed every task proposed and even implemented some additional functionalities. The application is not finished yet and there could be a lot of improvements added to it (especially regarding the design of the UI) but the core functionalities have been implemented.<br/>
I am going to precise what has been accomplished and then give some ideas of features to improve.</p>
<p>During GSoC, I have used two separate repositories for <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations">the frontend</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend">the backend</a>. I will keep both of them because I’m referencing PRs from them (as PRs are easier to link than lengthy lists of commits).<br/>
However, this is <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-complete">the repository</a> regrouping these two parts and this one will be moved to matrix-org for the continuation of this project.</p>
<h3 id="complete-the-implementation-of-the-cs-api-backend">Complete the implementation of the CS API backend</h3>
<p>During the application period, I wrote a prototype for this project. This prototype implemented some requests to the CS API (like <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-login">/login</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#post-matrix-client-r0-logout">/logout</a> or <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-sync">/sync</a>) but there were more requests to implement in order to be able to fully use this API:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order for the application to automatically join (and leave at the end) a room if the provided account hasn’t already joined it, I implemented the requests to <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-joined-rooms">/joined_rooms</a>, <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#post-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-join">/join</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#post-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-leave">/leave</a>.</li>
<li>The request <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-rooms-roomid-messages">/messages</a> has been implemented to allow the application to fetch previous messages.</li>
<li>For retrieving in real-time new events, I used the field <code>from</code> in the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.5.0#get-matrix-client-r0-sync">/sync</a> request.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also did a lot of clean up in the source code from the prototype during this task. You can have more details in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/1">this PR</a>.</p>
<h3 id="implement-the-first-ui-to-interact-with-the-dag">Implement the first UI to interact with the DAG</h3>
<p>First of all, a lot of work had to be made in order to properly update the displayed DAG when adding new events to it. At this point, I previously used the <code>setData</code> method of the <code>Network</code> object of <a href="https://visjs.org/">the visjs library</a> (which is used for displaying the graph and interacting with it) each time a node was added, but it was resetting the display each time it was called.<br/>
The proper solution was to progressively add nodes and edges to the <code>DataSet</code> object passed to the constructor of the network (see the documentation of <a href="https://visjs.github.io/vis-data/data/index.html">DataSet</a> and <a href="https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/">Network</a> for more details).</p>
<p>The DAG has been set to be displayed vertically, the events with the same depth are at the same level, the deepest events are at the bottom. The events which origin is the HS on which we are making the observation are in green, those which are coming from other servers are in orange.
Here is a picture of what it looks like:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/events_display.png" alt="Events display" title="Events display" /></p>
<p>In the graph, there is a special node just after the earliest event which allows us to ask the application to load more events. Here is what it looks like:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/more_events_button.png" alt="More Events button" title="More Events button" /></p>
<p>When you double click on the node of an event, there is a text area on the right which displays its complete JSON body, like this:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/body_display.png" alt="JSON body display" title="JSON body display" /></p>
<p>I’ve also implemented the possibility to choose which particular fields of the event can be directly displayed in the labels of the nodes of the displayed graph:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/fields_selection.png" alt="Fields selection" title="Fields selection" /></p>
<h3 id="synapse-postgresql-backend">Synapse PostgreSQL backend</h3>
<p>Next, I implemented a backend for retrieving events from the PostgreSQL database of a Synapse HS. It is a small HTTP server which receives requests from the frontend application and then makes queries to the Synapse database to get the requested events.<br/>
You can find details about the API for using this backend in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/blob/master/README.md">this readme</a>, in the “HTTP REST API” section.<br/>
You can find more details about this initial implementation: <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/1">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/2">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/3">here</a> (my mentor helped me on this one, thanks to him), and <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/5">here</a>.<br/>
I’ve added the support of this backend in the frontend application, as well as a way to choose which backend to use (between this one and the CS API) in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/4">this PR</a>.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-views">Multiple views</h3>
<p>I implemented the ability to observe the same DAG of a room from multiple HS’s. This is done with “views”.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/backend_selection.png" alt="View selection" title="View selection" /></p>
<p>In the picture above, you can see that there is a drop down menu from which you can select the view. The fields under this line are used to control the selected view: indicate where it will be connecting, for which room (you could as well observe a different room in a different view), etc…<br/>
By default, there is only one view but you can add as many as you want by clicking “Add a view”.</p>
<p>All the DAGs from the different views are displayed side-by-side within the same canvas, like this:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/multiple_dags.png" alt="Multiple DAGs" title="Multiple DAGs" /></p>
<p>You can have a look at the details of the implementation in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/6">this PR</a>.</p>
<h3 id="add-federation-api-support">Add Federation API support</h3>
<p>The next major task I had to do was the implementation of a backend for retrieving events via the Federation API. I thought a lot about the possible options for the location of this backend and I decided to extend the web server created for the PostgreSQL Synapse backend, so that we could launch it in a “postgres mode” or “federation mode”. But the backend would offer the same HTTP API in both modes.</p>
<p>The backend uses <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3">the Federation API</a> in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before being able to retrieve events from a certain room, the backend must join it with <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#get-matrix-federation-v1-make-join-roomid-userid">/make_join</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#put-matrix-federation-v1-send-join-roomid-eventid">/send_join</a> requests, it creates an “imaginary user” in this room. The join event created during this process will be the one returned by the endpoint <code>/deepest</code>.</li>
<li>To get earlier events, the backend uses <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#get-matrix-federation-v1-backfill-roomid">/backfill</a> requests.</li>
<li>In order to get new events, the backend listens for pushed events from other HS’s with the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#put-matrix-federation-v1-send-txnid">/send</a> request.</li>
<li>When the observation is done, the backend makes the “imaginary user” leave the room by sending <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#get-matrix-federation-v1-make-leave-roomid-userid">/make_leave</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.3#put-matrix-federation-v1-send-leave-roomid-eventid">/send_leave</a> requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full details of the implementation are in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/8">this PR</a>. My mentor also helped me get the usage of the <code>Future</code>s  right thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/7">this PR</a>.<br/>
There has been a small modification in the frontend too, because of the addition of the <code>/stop</code> endpoint in the backend’s HTTP API, these modifications are in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/7">this PR</a>.</p>
<h3 id="display-the-state-of-the-room-for-a-given-event">Display the state of the room for a given event</h3>
<p>For each event, there is a state of the room associated with it, which describes what was the state of the room at the moment this event was accepted (the name of the room, its topic, its members and parameters, etc…).<br/>
So I’ve added a way to display this: when you have selected and displayed the JSON body of a given event, you can also request the associated room’s state. I have made it possible to use this feature with every backends: the CS API, the PostgreSQL database and the Federation API. You can have the full details of the implementation <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations-backend/pull/9">here</a> (for the backend) and <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/8">here</a> (for the frontend).</p>
<p>You can see the result of this feature in the picture below (there is a button “Room state at the selected event”, which allows to ask the application to fetch the state, and the text area under this button where the state is displayed):
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kagamihime/gsoc-2019-final-report/master/room_state.png" alt="Room's state display" title="Room's state display" /></p>
<h3 id="additional-fixes">Additional fixes</h3>
<p>Lastly, I’ve applied small fixes to the code of the backend, you can see them in <a href="https://github.com/Kagamihime/matrix-visualisations/pull/9">this PR</a>.</p>
<h2 id="possible-improvements">Possible improvements</h2>
<p>The objective of this project was to develop the core functionalities of this application, however there are a lot of improvements to bring to it, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding the possibility to start the observation of a room from any events (provided that we have the ID of this events) instead of the latest one.</li>
<li>These hasn’t been any UI/UX work design, the CSS style sheet is minimal and the overall look isn’t beautiful or correctly organised. So there would be a lot of work to be done in this area by people with better knowledge in this field than me.</li>
<li>The timestamps of the events are not displayed in a human readable format and would be written as dates and hours to greatly improve the readability.</li>
<li>The application has been tested a lot, especially in situations of misusage. I’ve fixed some bugs which occurred when I was testing it but it was far from being an exhaustive testing, so there could be many improvements regarding the overall robustness of this software.</li>
<li>The backend supports HTTPS connections but has no mechanism for controlling the access of the data behind it (in particular, it means that if you should not run on a production database as it would basically allow anyone to access any data on it). So more work would be needed to make it secure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This experience has been really rewarding for me. I could discover more about the Matrix community and how the Matrix ecosystem works (on a technical point of view). I want to thank my mentor, Erik Johnston, for his guidance during these past months, and the people in this community who gave me advice.</p>
<p>GSoC has also allowed me to further improve my programming skills in general and discover many various things: the WASM technology, how to use Rust in this context thanks to the various existing libraries/frameworks available, the practical usage of SQL requests as well as TLS certificates and how to apply cryptographic signatures.<br/>
It was sometimes challenging to use such experimental technologies (due to the lack of clear documentation) but also very exiting!</p>
<p>Mid-September, I will start my class for my second and final year of my master degree (software engineering, specialised in distributed systems and applications) at Sorbonne Université so I will definitely have less free time. So I don’t think I’ll be able to actively continue to contribute but I will do my best to help other people to continue the work I’ve initiated.</p>

                <p>It’s that time of year again! Matrix.org is once again participating in the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> program. We have been allocated four student slots by Google this year, and narrowing the 18 proposals we received down to just four was a very difficult task.</p>
<p>In the end, we have decided on the following four students and their proposed projects:</p>
<p>Alexey Andreyev’s proposal involves adding end-to-end encryption to <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> for future support in Qt/libQMatrixClient-based clients such as <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral/">Spectral</a>. They will be mentored by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>, lead developer of libQMatrixClient, and our own end-to-end encryption expert, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg:matrix.org">uhoreg</a>.</p>
<p>Kai Hiller’s proposal for more reliable third-party protocol <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/bridges">bridges</a> includes adding the ability to notify the user when a message fails to reach its final destination despite being accepted by the bridge. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@half-shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>.</p>
<p>Eisha Chen-yen-su’s proposal for Matrix Visualisations aims to “develop a tool which will visualise the event Directed Acyclic Graph data structure which describes the conversation history in a room. It will be a real-time visualisation of the DAG of a given Matrix room, as seen from the perspective of one or more HomeServers (HSes).” They state that “this tool will be useful for debugging or administration of Matrix HSes by making people able to easily see how the federation process works”. They have already posted prototypes of their tool in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gsoc:matrix.org">#gsoc:matrix.org</a>, and it’s all written in Rust! Which makes their mentor, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@erikj:jki.re">erikj</a>, very happy.</p>
<p>And finally, Cnly’s proposal for working towards completion of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>’s Client-Server API. The proposal also touches on general improvements to the codebase and increasing test coverage. Cnly will be mentored by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">babolivier</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the selected students. We look forward to participating with you on completing your project over the course of the summer holidays.</p>
<p>If your proposal was not selected, do not give up hope! Being an active member of the Matrix community and having a deep understanding of the ecosystem and its projects is a big part of what we look for when choosing candidates. If you stick around, you have a strong chance of being chosen in a subsequent year. </p>
<p>We will not be sharing individual’s proposal documents, but students are free to share them as they please.</p>

<h4 id="riot-web">Riot/Web</h4>
<ul>
<li>We're committing to 2-weekly releases come what may, to avoid another massive gap like the one between 0.13 and 0.14.</li>
<li>RCs will get cut starting from Wednesday; actual release then happens on the Monday having given folks a chance to test the RC on /staging (and to iterate on the RCs).</li>
<li>Obviously this is flexible if we need to rush out fixes sooner.</li>
<li>On that note, 0.14.2-rc1 was cut on Wednesday!  Please test it at riot.im/staging. It's mainly bugfixes but also the full relayering between riot-web and matrix-react-sdk.</li>
<li>Dave's working on finally hooking in Jitsi as the default conferencing system</li>
<li>t3chguy's been working on Replies, which continue to look awesome</li>
<li>Next up: E2E cross-signing (at last!!!!)</li>

<h4 id="riot-mobile">Riot/Mobile</h4>
<ul>
<li>New releases are out! Mainly preparing for sticker viewing and trying to fix the Android push notification situation.  PLEASE TELL US IF YOU ARE STILL HAVING ANDROID PUSH NOTIFICATION PROBLEMS!</li>
<li>Lots of review of Android by Benoit - adding in Kotlin support as of today and establishing a formal roadmap for Android work (we'll show the blog post when we have it)</li>
<li>Lots of Matrix-for-French-Government stuff.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="synapse">Synapse</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/2018/04/27/synapse-0-28-0-released/">Synapse 28.0 was released!</a> A major bump mainly thanks to lots and lots of contributions from the wider community.</li>
<li>Massive experimental work on GDPR in progress - doing the thought experiment of pseudonymising MXIDs throughout Matrix on a per-room basis so that it's possible to redact MXIDs in the event of a “right-to-erasure” GDPR event.  Rich vdH is leading the work.</li>
<li>The good news is that introducing an MXID abstraction layer like this could help us enormously with some of Matrix's longest-term architectural issues - i.e. account migration and portability; improving on PERSPECTIVEs for managing server identity; future support for P2P Matrix; solving the domain name reuse problem; etc.</li>
<li>The bad news is that it would obviously be a very significant change to the Matrix spec, although we'd be doing it in such a way which minimises impact to client implementers and keep the CS API looking as similar as possible.</li>
<li>We're not sure whether we need to rush this through or not yet; still waiting for final GDPR clarification from lawyers, but it feels like this might be a good opportunity to force us to finally tackle some of these harder problems.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Erik's Delta State Resolution algorithm work is continuing well; we're hoping to finish & merge it asap in order to get back headroom on the server.</li>
<li>Thankfully the matrix.org synapse itself has been relatively stable this week, other than being completely overloaded causing Freenode to be almost unusable.</li>
<li>We've started using Ansible in production, although the playbooks need some iteration before we're fully happy to announce them & recommend folks use them as an official way of running Synapse in production.</li>

<p>Last year we had two students working on Matrix-projects over the summer - you can read the <a href="/blog/2016/11/12/the-matrix-autumn-special/">retrospective here</a> - and now we are again offering students to work on Matrix as part of GSoC! Currently we are in the <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline">stage</a> where students can propose interesting project ideas to any of the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/">open source organisations</a> picked by Google. Of course, we encourage students to get in touch with us and discuss their ideas before writing their application - please come say hi in the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gsoc:matrix.org">#gsoc:matrix.org</a> room!</p>
<p>We are very eager to see what ideas students come up with. We have added our own ideas <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/IDEAS.md">here</a>, but students are expected to do some research and come up with their own ideas for projects. We have also written down some <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/README.md#how-do-i-write-my-gsoc-application">general tips</a> on what to include in the application.</p>
<p>Applications can be submitted from March 20th, so there's still plenty of time to have a play with Matrix and come up with a cool project idea!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

                <p>Another season has passed; the leaves are dropping from the trees in the northern hemisphere (actually, in the time it's taken us to finish this post, most of them have dropped :-/) and once again the Matrix team has been hacking away too furiously to properly update the blog. So without further delay here's an update on all things Matrix!</p>
<h3 id="synapse-0-18">Synapse 0.18</h3>
<p>Back in September, we forgot to properly announce the 0.18 release of Synapse! This is a major oversight given that 0.18 was a huge update with some critical performance improvements, but hopefully everyone has upgraded by now anyway. If not, there's never been a better time to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">run your own homeserver</a>! The main improvement is that the Matrix room state updates are now stored as deltas in the database rather than snapshots, which reduces the size of the database footprint by around 5 - 7x. The first time you run synapse after upgrading to 0.18 it will go through your database deleting all the historical data, after which you can VACUUM the db to reclaim the freed diskspace.</p>
<p>You can tell when it's finished based on whether it's stopped logging about the 'background_deduplicate_state' task. There was a bug in 0.18.0 that meant this process was very slow (weeks) on sqlite DBs and chewed 100% CPU; this was fixed in 0.18.1, and subsequently we've also had 0.18.2 (various perf and bug fixes, and a new modular internal API for authentication) and the current release: 0.18.3 to address a <a href="/blog/2016/11/08/synapse-debian-pacakge-security-announcement/">major vulnerability</a> on deployments using LDAP with obsolete versions (0.9.x) of the python ldap3 library - e.g. Debian Stable. <strong>Folks using the Debian Stable packages must upgrade immediately.</strong></p>
<p>Other big changes in Synapse 0.18 were:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Adding the final APIs required to support end-to-end encryption: specifically, a new store-and-forward API called "to device messaging", which lets messages be passed between specific devices outside the context of a room or a room DAG. This is used for exchanging authentication tokens and sensitive end-to-end key data between devices (e.g. when a new device joins a room and needs to be looped in) and is not intended for general messaging.</li>
 	<li>Changing how remote directory servers are queried. Rather than constantly spidering them via the secondary_directory_servers option (which was causing a load crisis on the matrix.org server, as everyone else in Matrix kept polling it for directory updates), clients can now set a 'server' parameter on the publicRooms request to ask their server to proxy the request through to a specific remote server. Element (the app formally known as Riot/Web) implements this already. This is a stopgap until we have a proper global room discovery database of some kind.</li>
 	<li>Adding pagination support to the room directory API. We now have enough rooms in Matrix that downloading the full list every time the user searches for a room was getting completely untenable - we now support paginating and searching the list. Riot (now Element) and Riot-Android (now Element Android) are using the new APIs already.</li>
 	<li>Basic support for 'direct room' semantics. When you create a room you can now state the intent for that room to be a 1:1 with someone via the is_direct parameter.</li>
 	<li>Making the /notifications API work - this lets clients download a full list of all the notifications a user has been recently sent (highlights, mentions etc)</li>
</ul>
Spec for all of these new APIs are currently making their way into the official matrix spec; you can see the work in progress at <a href="/speculator">https://matrix.org/speculator</a>. Meanwhile, we're waiting for the last bits of the end-to-end encryption APIs to land there before releasing 0.3 of the Matrix spec, which should happen any day now.
<p>To find out more and get upgraded if you haven't already, please check out <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.18.3">the full changelog</a>.</p>
<h3 id="synapse-scalability">Synapse scalability</h3>
<p>Something which we've been quietly adding over the last 6 months is support for running large synapse deployments like the Matrix.org homeserver. Matrix.org has around 500K accounts on it, 50k rooms, and relays around 500K messages per day and obviously the community expects it to have good performance and availability (even though we'd prefer if you ran your own server, for obvious reasons!)</p>
<p>The current scaling approach for this is called 'Workers' - where we've split out a whole bunch of different endpoints from the main Synapse process into child 'worker' processes which replicate their state from the master Synapse process. These workers are designed to scale horizontally, adding as many as you like to handle the traffic load. It's not full active/active horizontal scalability in that you're still limited by the performance of the master process and the database master you're writing to, but it's a great way to escape Python's global interpreter lock limiting processes effectively to a single core, and in practice it's a huge improvement and works pretty well as of Synapse 0.18.</p>
<p>You can read more about the architecture and how to run your Synapse in worker-mode over at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/workers.rst">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/workers.rst</a>.</p>
<h3 id="starting-a-riot-now-element">Starting a Riot (now Element)</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, the biggest news in Matrixland has probably been the renaming of Vector as Riot (now Element) and the 'mass market' launch of Riot as a flagship Matrix client at the <a href="http://pulverhwc.evolero.com/monage">MoNage</a> conference on Sept 19th in Boston. The reasons for renaming Vector have been done to death by now and hopefully folks have got over the shock, but the rationale is to have a more distinctive and memorable (and controversial!) name, which is more aligned with the idea of returning control of communication back to the people :) Amandine has the full story over at the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/lets-riot-f5b0aa99dc8e">Riot blog</a>.</p>
<p>Riot (now Element) itself is a fairly thin layer on top of the official client Matrix SDKs, and so 95% of the work for Riot (now Element) took the form of updates to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk">matrix-js-sdk</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk">matrix-react-sdk</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">matrix-ios-sdk</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-kit">matrix-ios-kit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">matrix-android-sdk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">synapse</a> itself. There's been a tonne of changes here since June, but the main highlights are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>End-to-end encryption support landed in matrix-js-sdk and matrix-react-sdk (and thus Riot/Web (now Element)) and in dev on matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk using the Olm and Megolm ratchets. More about this later.</li>
 	<li>Hosted integrations, bots and bridges! More about this later too.</li>
 	<li>Direct Message UI landed in Riot/Web (now Element) to tag rooms which exist for contacting a specific user. These get grouped now as the 'People' list in Riot (now Element). It's in dev on Riot/iOS (now Element (iOS)) & Android (now Element Android).</li>
 	<li>Entirely new UI for starting conversations with people - no more creating a room and then inviting; you just say "i want to talk with Bob".</li>
 	<li>Entirely new UI for inviting people into a room - no more confusion between searching the membership list and inviting users.</li>
 	<li>FilePanel UI in Riot/Web (now Element) to instantly view all the attachments posted in a room</li>
 	<li>NotificationPanel UI in Riot/Web (now Element) to instantly view all your missed notifications and mentions in a single place</li>
 	<li>"Volume control" UI to have finer grained control over per-room notification noisiness</li>
 	<li>Entirely re-worked Room Directory navigator - lazy-loading the directory from the server, and selecting rooms via bridge and remote server</li>
 	<li>It's very exciting to see a wider audience discovering Matrix through Riot (now Element) - and Riot (now Element)'s usage stats have been growing steadily since launch, but there's still a lot of room for improvement.</li>
</ul>
Stuff on the horizon includes:
<ul>
 	<li>Formal beta-testing the full end-to-end encryption feature-set.</li>
 	<li>Performance and optimisation work on all platforms - there are huge improvements to be had.</li>
 	<li>Long-awaited poweruser features: 'dark' colour scheme; more whitespace-efficient layout; collapsing consecutive joins/parts...</li>
 	<li>"Landing page" to help explain what's going on to new users and to show deployment-specific announcements and room lists.</li>
 	<li>Support for arbitrary profile information.</li>
 	<li>Threading.</li>
</ul>
Riot (now Element) releases are announced on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#riot:matrix.org">#riot:matrix.org</a>, the <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat">Riot blog</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/@RiotChat">Twitter</a> - keep your eyes peeled for updates!
<h3 id="end-to-end-encryption">End to End Encryption</h3>
<p>Full cross-platform end-to-end encryption is incredibly close now, with the develop branches of iOS &amp; Android SDKs and Riot (now Element) currently in internal testing as of Nov 7 - expect a Big Announcement very shortly.  We're very optimistic based on how the initial implementation on Riot/Web (now Element)has been behaving so far.</p>
<p>When E2E first landed on Riot/Web (now Element) in September we were missing mobile support, encrypted attachments, encrypted VoIP signalling, and the ability to retrieve encrypted history on new devices - as well as a formal audit of the underlying <a href="/docs/spec/olm.html">Olm</a> and <a href="/docs/spec/megolm.html">Megolm</a> libraries. Since then things have progressed enormously with most of the core team working since September on filling in the gaps, as well as getting audited and fixing all the weird and wonderful edge cases that the audit showed up. All the missing stuff has been landing on the develop branches over the last few weeks, with encrypted attachments landing on web on Nov 10; encrypted VoIP landing on Nov 11; etc. Watch this space for news on the upcoming cross-platform public beta!</p>
<h3 id="hosted-integrations-and-introducing-go-neb">Hosted Integrations and introducing go-neb</h3>
<p>One of the new features which arrived in Riot (now Element) is the ability to add &quot;single click&quot; integrations (i.e. bots, bridges, application services) into rooms from Riot/Web (now Element) by clicking the &quot;Manage Integrations&quot; button in Room Settings. These integrations are hosted for free by Riot (now Element) in its production infrastructure (codenamed Scalar), but all the actual bots/bridges/services themselves are normal opensource Matrix apps and you can of course run them yourself too.</p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1827" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-12-at-11.47.29-1024x913.png" alt="screen-shot-2016-11-12-at-11-47-29" width="894" height="797" />
<p>The Bot integrations are all provided by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb">go-neb</a> - a complete rewrite in Golang and general reimagining of the old <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/Matrix-NEB">python NEB bot</a> which old-timers will recall as the very first bot written for the Matrix ecosystem. Go-neb has effectively now become a general purpose golang bot/integration framework for Matrix, with the various different services implemented as plugins for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb/tree/master/src/github.com/matrix-org/go-neb/services/github">Github</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb/tree/master/src/github.com/matrix-org/go-neb/services/jira">JIRA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb/tree/master/src/github.com/matrix-org/go-neb/services/giphy">Giphy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb/tree/master/src/github.com/matrix-org/go-neb/services/guggy">Guggy</a> etc. Critically it supports <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb#configuring-realms">authenticating Matrix users through to the remote service</a>, letting normal Matrix users interact with Github and friends using their actual Github identity rather than via a bot user - this is a huge huge improvement over the original naive python NEB.</p>
<p>If you like Go and you like Matrix, we'd strongly suggest having a go (hah) at adding new services into go-neb: anything implemented against go-neb will also magically be hosted and available as part of the &quot;Manage Integrations&quot; interface in Riot (now Element), as well as being available to anyone else running their own go-nebs. For full details of the architecture and how to implement new plugins, go check out the full <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/go-neb">README</a>.</p>
<p>If Matrix is to provide a good FOSS alternative to systems like Slack it's critical to have a large array of available integrations, so we really hope that the community will help us grow the list!</p>
<h3 id="building-bridges">Building Bridges</h3>
<p>There have been vast improvements to bridging over the last few months, including the ability to &quot;plumb&quot; bridges into arbitrary rooms (letting you link a single Matrix room through to multiple remote networks). Like go-neb, Riot (now Element) is providing free bridge hosting with the ability to add to rooms with a &quot;single click&quot; via the Manage Integrations button in Room Settings. For now, Riot (now Element) is hosting any bridges built on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> codebase.</p>
<p>In short, this means that any user can go and take an existing Matrix room and link it through to Slack, IRC, Gitter, and more.</p>
<h4 id="matrix-appservice-irc">matrix-appservice-irc</h4>
<p>Huge amounts of work have gone into improving the IRC bridge - both adding new features to try to give the most IRC-friendly experience when bridging into IRC, as well as lots of maintenance and performance work to ensure that the matrix.org hosted bridges can scale to the large amounts of traffic we're seeing going through Freenode and others. We've also added hosted bridges for OFTC and Snoonet, and turned on connecting via IPv6 by default for networks which support it.</p>
<p>You can read the full changelogs for 0.5.0 and 0.6.0 at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md</a>, but the main highlights are:</p>
<p>matrix-appservice-irc 0.6.0</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Debouncing quits and netsplits: if IRC users quit there can be a window where they are shown as just offline rather than leaving the room, avoiding join/part spam and creating unnecessary state events in Matrix.</li>
 	<li>Topic bridging: IRC topics can now be bridged to Matrix!</li>
 	<li>Support custom SSL CAs (thanks to @Waldteufel)</li>
 	<li>Support custom media repository URLs</li>
 	<li>Support the ability to quit your IRC user from the network entirely</li>
 	<li>Fix rate limiting for traffic from privileged IRC users and services</li>
</ul>
matrix-appservice-irc 0.5.0:
<ul>
 	<li>Support throttling reconnections to IRC servers to avoid triggering abuse thresholds</li>
 	<li>Support "Third party lookup": mapping from IRC users & rooms into Matrix IDs for discovery purposes</li>
 	<li>Support rate-limiting membership entries to avoid triggering abuse thresholds</li>
 	<li>Require permission of an IRC chanop when plumbing an IRC channel into a Matrix room</li>
 	<li>Prevent routing loops by advisory m.room.bridging events</li>
 	<li>Better error messages</li>
 	<li>Sync chanmode +s correctly</li>
 	<li>Fix IPv6 support</li>
</ul>
Next up is automating NickServ login, and generally continuing to make the IRC experience as good as we possibly can.
<h4 id="matrix-appservice-slack">matrix-appservice-slack</h4>
<p>Similarly, the Slack bridge has had loads of work. The main changes include:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Ability to dynamically bridge ("plumb") rooms on request</li>
 	<li>Add Prometheus monitoring metrics</li>
 	<li>Ability to discover slack team tokens via OAuth2</li>
 	<li>Sync avatars both ways</li>
</ul>
We're currently looking at shifting over to Slack's RTM (Real Time Messaging) API rather than using webhooks in order to get an even better fit with Slack and support bridging DMs, but the current setup is still very usable. For more details: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack</a>.
<h4 id="matrix-appservice-gitter">matrix-appservice-gitter</h4>
<p>The Gitter bridge has provided a lot of inspiration for the more recent work on the Slack bridge. Right now it provides straightforward bridging into Gitter rooms, albeit proxied via a 'matrixbot' user on the Gitter side. We're currently looking at letting also users authenticate using their Gitter credentials so they are bridged through to their 'real' Gitter user - watch this space. For more details: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter</a>.</p>
<h3 id="community-updates">Community updates</h3>
<h4 id="matrix-ircd">matrix-ircd</h4>
<p>matrix-ircd is a rewrite of the old PTO project (<a href="http://pto.im">pto.im</a>): a Rust application that turns Matrix into a single great big decentralised IRC network. PTO itself has unfortunately been on hiatus and is rather bitrotted, so Erik from the core Matrix Team picked it up to see if it could be resurrected. This ended up turning into a complete rewrite (switching from mio to tokio etc), and the new project can be found at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd</a>.</p>
<p>matrix-ircd really is an incredibly promising way of getting folks onto Matrix, as it exposes the entirety of Matrix as a virtual IRC network. This means that IRC addicts can jack straight into Matrix, talking native IRC from their existing IRC clients - but interacting directly with Matrix rooms as if they were IRC channesls without going through a bridge. Obviously you lose all of the features and semantics which Matrix provides beyond IRC, but this is still a great way to get started.</p>
<p>The project is currently alpha but provides a good functioning base to extend, and Erik's explicitly asking for help from the Rust and Matrix community to fill in all the missing features. If you're interested in helping, please come talk on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-ircd:matrix.org">#matrix-ircd:matrix.org</a>!.</p>
<h4 id="matrix-appservice-gitter-twisted">matrix-appservice-gitter-twisted</h4>
<p>Not to be confused with the Node-based <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter">matrix-appservice-gitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/remram44/matrix-appservice-gitter-twisted">matrix-appservice-gitter-twisted</a> is an entirely separate project written in Python/Twisted by Remram (Remi Rampin) that has the opposite architecture: rather than bridging existing rooms into Matrix, matrix-appservice-gitter-twisted lets you provide your Gitter credentials and acts instead as a Gitter client, bridging your personal view of a Gitter room into a private Matrix room just for you.</p>
<p>This obviously has some major advantages (your actions on Gitter use your real Gitter account rather than a bot), and some disadvantages too (you can't use Matrix features when interacting with other Matrix users in the same room, and the Gitter channel itself is not decentralised into Matrix). However, it's a really cool example of how the other model can work - and within the core team, we've been arguing back and forth for ages now on whether normal bridges or &quot;sidecar&quot; bridges like this one are a more preferable architecture. Thanks to Remram's work we can try both side by side! Go check it out at <a href="https://github.com/remram44/matrix-appservice-gitter-twisted">https://github.com/remram44/matrix-appservice-gitter-twisted</a>.</p>
<h4 id="telematrix">telematrix</h4>
<p>Telematrix is Telegram&lt;-&gt;Matrix bridge, written by Sijmen Schoon using python3 and asyncio. Right now it's a fairly early alpha hardcoded to bridge a specific Telegram channel into a specific Matrix room, but it works and in use and could be an excellent base for folks interested in a more comprehensive Matrix/Telegram bridge. Go check it out at <a href="https://github.com/SijmenSchoon/telematrix">https://github.com/SijmenSchoon/telematrix</a>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1832" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/telematrix-1024x828.png" alt="telematrix" width="641" height="518" /></p>
<h4 id="ruma">Ruma</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ruma project to write a Matrix homeserver in Rust has been progressing steadily, with more and more checkboxes appearing on the <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/blob/master/STATUS.md">status page</a>, with significant new contributions from mujx and farodin91. The best way to keep track of Ruma is to read Jimmy's excellent <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/">This Week in Ruma</a> updates and of course hang out on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<h4 id="nachat">NaChat</h4>
<p>An entirely new client on the block since the last update is <a href="http://github.com/ralith/nachat">NaChat</a>, written by Ralith. NaChat is a pure cross-platform Qt/C++ desktop client written from the ground up, supporting local history synchronisation, excellent performance, native Qt theming, and generally being a lean and mean Matrix client machine. It's still alpha, but it's easy to build and a lot of fun to play with.</p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1828" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-12-at-12.01.03-1024x664.png" alt="screen-shot-2016-11-12-at-12-01-03" width="1009" height="654" />
<p>Please give a spin, encourage Ralith to finish the <a href="https://github.com/ralith/nachat/tree/timeline-view-rewrite">timeline-view-rewrite</a> branch (which is probably the one you want to be running!), and come hang out on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nachat:matrix.org">#nachat:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<h4 id="quaternion">Quaternion</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://github.com/fxrh/quaternion">Quaternion</a> Qt/QML desktop client and its <a href="https://github.com/fxrh/libqmatrixclient">libqmatrixclient</a> library has been making sure and steady progress, with fxrh, kitsune, maralorn and others working away at it. The difference with NaChat here is using QML rather than native Qt widgets, and a focus on more advanced UX features like a custom infinite-scrolling scrollbar widget, unread message notifications, and read-up-to markers.  Recent developments include the <a href="https://github.com/Fxrh/Quaternion/releases/tag/v0.0.1">first official release (0.0.1)</a> on Sept 12, official Windows builds, lots of work on implementing better Read-up-to Markers, scrolling behaviour etc. Again, it's worth keeping a checkout of Quaternion handy and playing with the client - it's loads of fun!</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1829" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-12-at-12.12.48-1024x535.png" alt="screen-shot-2016-11-12-at-12-12-48" width="1024" height="535" />
<h3 id="google-summer-of-code-2016-retrospective">Google Summer of Code 2016 Retrospective</h3>
<p>The summer is long gone now, and along with it Google Summer of Code. This was the first year we've <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/organizations/6552738187968512/">participated in GSoC</a>, and it was an incredible experience - both judging all the applications, and then working with Aviral Dasgupta and Will Hunt (Half-Shot) who joined the core team as part of their GSoC endeavours.</p>
<p>Aviral's work has been widespread throughout Riot (now Element): adding consistent Emoji support throughout the app via Emoji One, implementing the beta Rich Text Editor (RTE) and all-new autocompletion UI, as well as a bunch of spec proposals for rich message semantics and an initial Slack Webhooks application service. You can read his wrap up at <a href="http://www.aviraldg.com/p/gsoc-2016-wrapup">http://www.aviraldg.com/p/gsoc-2016-wrapup</a> and use the code in Riot/Web (now Element) today. We're currently working on fixing the final issues on RTE and auto-complete and hope to enable them by default real soon now!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Half-Shot's work ended up focusing on bridging through to Twitter and working on the Threading spec proposal for Matrix. You can find out all about the Twitter bridge at <a href="https://half-shot.github.io/matrix-appservice-twitter">https://half-shot.github.io/matrix-appservice-twitter</a>; it works incredibly well (arguably too well, given the amount of traffic it can bridge into Matrix! :S) - and we're currently working on hosting a version of it on matrix.org for all your tweeting needs. You can see Half-Shot's wrapup blog post over at <a href="https://half-shot.uk/gsoc16_evaulation">https://half-shot.uk/gsoc16_evaulation</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, as a bit of a wildcard, we discovered the other day that there was also another GSoC project using Matrix by Waqee Khalid, supported by the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/organizations/6488734048452608/">Berkman Center for Internet and Society</a> at Harvard to <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/5749069813121024/">switch Apache Wave (formerly Google Wave) over to using Matrix rather than XMPP</a> for federation!  The implementation looks a little curious here, as Wave used XMPP as a blunt pubsub layer for synchronising protobuf deltas - and it looks like this implementation uses Matrix similarly, thus killing any interop with the rest of Matrix, which is a bit of a shame.  If anyone knows more about the project we'd love to hear though!</p>
<p>Either way, it's been a pleasure to work with the GSoC community and we owe Aviral and Half-Shot (and Waqee!) a huge debt of gratitude for spending their summers (and more!) hacking away improving Matrix. So, thanks Google for making GSoC possible and thanks to the GSoCers for all their contributions, effort &amp; enthusiasm! Watch this space for updates on RTE, new-autocomplete and the twitter bridge going live...</p>
<h3 id="matrix-in-the-news">Matrix in the news</h3>
<p>Just in case you missed them, there have been a couple of high profile articles flying around about Matrix recently - we made the <a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2016/189/Matrix">front cover of Linux Magazine in August</a> with a comprehensive review of Matrix and Vector (now Riot (now Element)). Then when we launched Riot (now Element) itself we got a cautiously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/riot-wants-to-be-like-slack-but-with-the-flexibility-of-an-underlying-open-source-platform/">positive write-up from Mike Butcher at Techcrunch</a>. We also wrote an guest column for Techcrunch about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/09/a-decentralized-web-would-give-power-back-to-the-people-online/">importance of bringing power back to the people via decentralisation</a>, which got a surprising amount of attention on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12670958">HackerNews</a> and elsewhere.</p>
<p>More recently, we were lucky enough to get an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhCfI-xdvlE">indepth video interview with Bryan Lunduke</a> as part of his 'Linux &amp; Whatnot' series, and also a <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/3140014/open-source-tools/down-the-rabbit-hole-part-5-secure-and-private-instant-messaging.html#tk.twt_nww.">write-up in NetworkWorld</a> alongside Signal &amp; Wire as part of Bryan's journeys in the land of encrypted messaging.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhCfI-xdvlE"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1830 size-large" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-12-at-12.31.34-1024x571.png" alt="screen-shot-2016-11-12-at-12-31-34" width="1024" height="571" /></a></p>
<p>Huge thanks to everyone who's been nice enough to spread the word of Matrix!</p>
<h3 id="matrix-in-real-life">Matrix In Real Life</h3>
<p>Finally, we've been present at a slew of different events. In August we attended FOSSCON again in Philadelphia to give a general update on Matrix to the Freenode community...</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It's <a href="https://twitter.com/fossconNE">@fossconNE</a> time! Dave will be talking about Matrix at 1pm today. Come & say hi! <a href="https://t.co/KtfTVRnAVn">pic.twitter.com/KtfTVRnAVn</a></p>

<p>...chatting to FireChat's CTO, catching up with Dan York from the Internet Society, etc.</p>
<p>Then in October we spoke about scaling Python/Twisted for Matrix at PyCon France in Rennes - this was really fun, albeit slightly embarrassing to be the only talk about Python/Twisted in a track otherwise entirely about Python 3 and asyncio :D That said, the talk seemed to be well received and it was fantastic to meet some of the enthusiastic French Python community and see folks in the audience who were already up and running on Matrix!</p>

<p>The same weekend also featured TADHack Global - we were present at the London site; you can read all about it in our <a href="/blog/2016/10/20/tadhack-global-2016/">earlier blog post</a>. There was a really high standard of hacks on Matrix this year, and it was incredibly hard to judge the hackathon. In most ways this is a good problem to have though!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, coming up on the horizon we have TADSummit in Lisbon next week, where we'll be giving an update on Matrix to the global Telco Application Developer community, and then the week after we'll be in Israel as part of the Geektime Techfest, Devfest and Chatbot Summit. So if you're in Lisbon or Tel Aviv do give us a ping on Matrix and come hang out!</p>
<h3 id="matrixing-for-fun-and-profit">Matrixing for fun and profit!</h3>
<p>If you've read this far, we're guessing you're hopefully quite interested in Matrix (or just skipping to the end ;).  Something we don't talk about as much as we should is that if you're interested in being paid to work on Matrix full time, we're always interested in expanding the core team.  Right now we're particularly looking for:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Experienced front-end developers who can help build the next generation of matrix-react-sdk and vector-web</li>
 	<li>Professional tech-writers to help keep <a href="/docs/spec">The Spec</a> and tutorials and other docs updated and as kick-ass as possible</li>
 	<li>Backend Python/Twisted or Golang wizards to help us improve and evolve Synapse</li>
 	<li>Mobile developers (especially Android) to help keep the mobile SDKs and apps evolving as quickly as possible</li>
 	<li>Integration fiends who'd like to be paid to build more bridges, bots and other integrations for the overall ecosystem!</li>
</ul>
Most of the core team hangs out in London or Rennes (France), but we're also open to remote folks where it makes sense.  If this sounds interesting, please shoot us a mail to jobs@matrix.org.  Obviously it helps enormously if we already know you from the Matrix community, and you have a proven FOSS track record.
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Apologies once again for an overdue and overlong update, but hopefully this gives a good taste of how Matrix is progressing. Just to give a different datapoint: this graph is quite interesting - showing the volume of events per day sent by native (i.e. non-bridged) Matrix users visible to the matrix.org homeserver since we turned the service on back in 2014:</p>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1833" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-04-at-11.02.58-1-1024x778.png" alt="screen-shot-2016-11-04-at-11-02-58-1" width="958" height="728" />
<p>As you can see, things are accelerating quite nicely - and this is ignoring all the traffic in the rest of the Matrix ecosystem that happens not to be federated onto the matrix.org HS, not to mention the <em>huge</em> amounts of traffic due to bridging.</p>
<p>Our plans over the next few months are going to involve:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Turning on end-to-end encryption by default for any rooms with private history - whilst ensuring it's as easy to write Matrix clients, bots and bridges as it ever was.</li>
 	<li>Yet more scalability and performance work across the board, to ensure Synapse and the client SDKs can handle the growth curve we're seeing here</li>
 	<li>Releasing 0.3.0 of the matrix spec itself.</li>
 	<li>Making Riot (now Element)'s UX excellent.</li>
 	<li>Editable messages.</li>
 	<li>Threading.</li>
 	<li>User groups, for applying permissions/invites etc to groups of users as well as individuals.</li>
 	<li>Formalising the federation spec at last</li>
 	<li>As many bots, bridges and other integrations as possible!</li>
 	<li>Making VoIP/Video conferencing and calling awesome.</li>
 	<li>More experiments with next-generation homeservers</li>
 	<li>Starting to really think hard about decentralised identity and reputation/spam management</li>
 	<li>...and a few new things we don't want to talk about yet ;)</li>
</ul>
If you've got this far - congratulations! Thanks for reading, and thank you for supporting the Matrix ecosystem.
<p>Now more than ever before we believe that it is absolutely critical to have a healthy and secure decentralised communications ecosystem on the 'net (whether that's Matrix, XMPP, Tox or whatever) - so thank you again for participating in our one :)  And if you don't already run your server, please <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">grab a Synapse</a> and have fun!</p>

                <p>Hi folks - another few months have gone by and once again the core Matrix team has ended up too busy hacking away on the final missing pieces of the Matrix jigsaw puzzle to have been properly updating the blog; sorry about this. The end is in sight for the current crunch however, and we expect to return to regular blog updates shortly! Meanwhile, rather than letting news stack up any further, here's a quick(?) attempt to summarise all the things which have been going on!</p>
<h3 id="synapse-0-16-1-released">Synapse 0.16.1 released!</h3>
<p>This one's a biggy: in the mad rush during June to support the public debut for <a href="https://vector.im">Vector</a>, we made a series of major <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> releases which apparently we forgot to tell anyone about (sorry!). The full changelog is at the bottom of the post as it's huge, but the big features are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Huge performance improvements, including adding write-thru event caches and improving caching throughout, and massive improvements to the speed of the room directory API.</li>
 	<li>Add support for inline URL previewing!</li>
 	<li>Add email notifications!</li>
 	<li>Add support for LDAP authentication (thanks to Christoph Witzany)</li>
 	<li>Add support for JWT authentication (thanks to Niklas Riekenbrauck)</li>
 	<li>Add basic server-side ignore functionality and abuse reporting API</li>
 	<li>Add ability to delegate /publicRooms API requests to a list of secondary homeservers</li>
 	<li>Lots and lots and lots of bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
If you haven't upgraded, please do asap from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse</a>!
<p>There's also been a huge amount of work going on behind the scenes on horizontal scalability for Synapse.  We haven't drawn much attention to this yet (or documented it) as it's still quite experimental and in flux, but the main change is to add the concept of application-layer replication to Synapse - letting you split the codebase into multiple endpoints which can then be run in parallel, each replicating their state off the master synapse process.  For instance, right now the Matrix.org homeserver is actually running off three different processes: the main synapse; another specific to calculating push notifications and another specific to serving up the /sync endpoint.  These three are then abstracted behind the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendron">dendron</a> layer (which also implements the /login endpoint). The idea is that one can then run multiple instances of the /sync and pusher (and other future) endpoints to horizontally scale.  For now, they share a single database writer, but in practice this has improved our scalability and performance on the Matrix.org HS radically.</p>
<p>In future we'll actually document how to run these, as well as making it easy to spin up multiple concurrent instances - in the interim if you find you're hitting performance limits running high-traffic synapses come talk to us about it on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev:matrix.org</a>.  And the longer term plan continues to be to switch out these python endpoint implementations in future for more efficient implementations.  For instance, there's a golang implementation of the media repository currently in development which could run as another endpoint cluster.</p>
<h3 id="vector-released">Vector released!</h3>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@Vector/2d33b23a787">Much has been written</a> about this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11871527">elsewhere</a>, but Web, iOS and Android versions of the <a href="https://www.vector.im">Vector</a> clients were finally released to the general public on June 9th at the <a href="http://www.decentralizedweb.net/">Decentralised Web Summit</a> in San Francisco.  Vector is a relatively thin layer on top of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk">matrix-react-sdk</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">matrix-ios-sdk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">matrix-android-sdk</a> Matrix.org client SDKs which showcases Matrix's collaboration and messaging capabilities in a mass-market usable app.  There's been huge amounts of work here across the SDKs for the 3 platforms, with literally thousands of issues resolved.  You can find the full SDK changelogs on github for <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">React</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-kit/blob/master/CHANGES.rst">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.rst">Android</a>.  Some of the more interesting recent additions to Vector include improved room notifications, URL previews, configurable email notifications, and huge amounts of performance stability work.</p>
<p>Future work on Vector is focused on showcasing end-to-end encryption, providing a one-click interface for adding bots/integrations &amp; bridges to a room, and generally enormously improving the UX and polish.  Meanwhile, there's an F-Droid release for Android landing <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=im.vector.alpha">any day now</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't checked it out recently, it's really worth a look :)</p>
<p><a href="https://vector.im"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1658" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-04-at-12.18.10-1024x591.png" alt="Vector" width="1024" height="591" /></a></p>
<h3 id="matrix-spec-0-1-0">Matrix Spec 0.1.0</h3>
<p>In case you didn't notice, we also released <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/">v0.1.0 of the Matrix spec</a> itself in May - this is a fairly minor update which improves the layout of the document somewhat (thanks to a PR from Jimmy Cuadra) and a some bugfixes.  You can see the <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.1.0.html#changelog">full changelog here</a>. We're overdue a new release since then (albeit again with relatively minor changes).</p>
<h3 id="google-summer-of-code">Google Summer of Code</h3>
<p>We're in the middle of the second half of GSoC right now, with our GSoC students Aviral and Half-Shot hacking away on Vector and Microblogging projects respectively.  There's a lot of exciting stuff coming out of this - Aviral contributing Rich Text Editing, Emoji autocompletion, DuckDuckGo and other features into Vector (currently on branches, but will be released soon) and Half-Shot building a Twitter bridge as part of his Matrix-powered microblogging system.  Watch this space for updates!</p>
<h3 id="ruma">Ruma</h3>
<p>Lots of exciting stuff has been happening recently over at <a href="https://ruma.io">Ruma.io</a> - an independent Matrix homeserver implementation written in Rust.  Over the last few weeks Jimmy and friends have got into the real meat of implementing e<a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma/commit/8a2fe269196dfd5b629c6e301e8d78e19ae6d279">vents</a> and the core of the Matrix CS API, and as of the time of writing they're the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12028475">topmost link</a> on HackerNews!  There's a lot of work involved in writing a homeserver, but Ruma is looking incredibly promising and the feedback from their team has been incredibly helpful in keeping us honest on the Matrix spec and ensuring that it's fit for purpose for 3rd party server implementers.</p>
<p>Also, Ruma just released some <a href="https://www.ruma.io/docs/matrix">truly excellent documentation</a> as a high-level introduction to Matrix (thanks to Leah and Jimmy) - much better than anything we have on the official Matrix.org site.  Go check it out if you haven't already!</p>
<h3 id="end-to-end-encryption">End to End Encryption</h3>
<p>There has been <em>LOADS</em> of work happening on End to End encryption: finalising the core 1:1 &quot;<a href="/git/olm">Olm</a>&quot; cryptographic ratchet; implementing the group &quot;<a href="http://matrix.org/git/olm/tree/src/megolm.c">Megolm</a>&quot; ratchet (which shares a single ratchet over all the participants of a room for scalability); fully hooking Olm into matrix-js-sdk and Vector-web at last, and preparing for a formal and published-to-the-public 3rd party security audit on Olm which will be happening during July.</p>
<p>This deserves a post in its own right, but the key thing to know is that Olm is almost ready - and indeed the work-in-progress E2E UX is even available on the <a href="https://vector.im/develop">develop branch of vector</a> if you enable E2E in the new 'Labs' section in User Settings.  Olm itself is usable only for 'burn after reading' strictly PFS messages, but Megolm integration with Vector &amp; Synapse will follow shortly afterwards which will finally provide the E2E nirvana we've all been waiting for :)</p>
<h3 id="decentralised-web-summit">Decentralised Web Summit</h3>
<p>Matrix had a major presence as a sponsor at the first ever <a href="http://www.decentralizedweb.net/">Decentralised Web Summit</a> hosted by the Internet Archive in San Francisco back in June.  This was a truly incredible event - with folks gathering from across the world to discuss, collaborate and debate on ensure that the web is not fragmented or trapped into proprietary silos - with the likes of Tim Berners-Lee, Vint Cerf and Brewster Kahle in attendance.  We ran a long 2 hour workshop on Matrix and showed off Vector to anyone and everyone - and meanwhile the organisers were kind enough to promote Matrix as the main decentralised chat interface for the conference itself (bridged with their Slack).  A full writeup of the conference really merits a blog post in its own right, but the punchline is that you could genuinely tell that this is the beginning of a new era of the internet - whether it's using Merkle DAGs (like Matrix) or Blockchain or similar technologies: we are about to see a major shift in the balance of power on the internet back towards its users.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend checking out the videos which have all been published at <a href="http://www.decentralizedweb.net/">Decentralised Web Summit</a>, including <a href="https://archive.org/details/DWebSummit2016_Lightning_Talks_Session_B">lightning talks introducing both Matrix and Vector</a>, and digging into as many of the projects advertised as possible.  It was particularly interesting for us to get to know Tim Berners-Lee's latest project at MIT: <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid</a> - which shares quite a lot of the same goals as Matrix, and subsequently seeing Tim pop up on <a href="https://vector.im/develop/#/room/#decentralizedweb-general:matrix.org/$146549767249761pyAQF:matrix.org">Matrix via Vector</a>.  We're really looking forward to working out how Matrix &amp; Solid can complement each other in future.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/parkan/status/740324969884700672"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1660 size-large" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/timbl-768x1024.jpg" alt="Matthew, Tim Berners-Lee and Matrix" width="384" height="512" /></a></p>
<h3 id="matrix-to">Matrix.to</h3>
<p>Not the most exciting thing ever, but heads up that there's a simple site up at <a href="https://matrix.to">https://matrix.to</a> to provide a way of doing client-agnostic links to content in Matrix.  For instance, rather than linking specifically into an app like Vector, you can now say <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org">https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org</a> to go there via whatever app you choose.  This is basically a bootstrapping process towards having proper mx:// URLs in circulation, but given mx:// doesn't exist yet, https://matrix.to hopefully provides a useful step in the right direction :)</p>
<p>PRs very welcome at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bridges-and-bots">Bridges and Bots</h3>
<p>Much of the promise of Matrix is the ability to bridge through to other silos, and we've been gradually adding more and more bridging capabilities in.</p>
<p>For instance, the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">IRC bridge</a> has had a complete overhaul to add in huge numbers of new features and finally deployed for Freenode a few weeks ago:</p>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Nicks set via <code>!nick</code> will now be preserved across bridge restarts.</li>
 	<li>EXPERIMENTAL: IRC clients created by the bridge can be assigned their own IPv6 address.</li>
 	<li>The bridge will now send connection status information to real Matrix users via the admin room (the same room <code>!nick</code>commands are issued).</li>
 	<li>Added <code>!help</code>.</li>
 	<li>The bridge will now fallback to <code>body</code> if the HTML content contains <em>any</em> unrecognised tags. This makes passing Markdown from Matrix to IRC much nicer.</li>
 	<li>The bridge will now send more metrics to the statsd server, including the join/part rate to and from IRC.</li>
 	<li>The config option <code>matrixClients.displayName</code> is now implemented.</li>
</ul>
Bug fixes:
<ul>
 	<li>Escape HTML entities when sending from IRC to Matrix. This prevents munging occurring between IRC formatting and textual &lt; element &gt; references, whereby if you sent a tag and some colour codes from IRC it would not escape the tag and therefore send invalid HTML to Matrix.</li>
 	<li>User IDs starting with <code>-</code> are temporarily filtered out from being bridged.</li>
 	<li>Deterministically generate the configuration file.</li>
 	<li>Recognise more IRC error codes as non-fatal to avoid IRC clients reconnecting unnecessarily.</li>
 	<li>Add a 10 second timeout to join events injected via the <code>MemberListSyncer</code> to avoid HOL blocking.</li>
 	<li>'Frontier' Matrix users will be forcibly joined to IRC channels even if membership list syncing I-&gt;M is disabled. This ensures that there is always a Matrix user in the channel being bridged to avoid losing traffic.</li>
 	<li>Cache the <code>/initialSync</code> request to avoid hitting this endpoint more than once, as it may be very slow.</li>
 	<li>Indexes have been added to the NeDB .db files to improve lookup times.</li>
 	<li>Do not recheck if the bridge bot should part the channel if a virtual user leaves the channel: we know it shouldn't.</li>
 	<li>Refine what counts as a "request" for metrics, reducing the amount of double-counting as requests echo back from the remote side.</li>
 	<li>Fixed a bug which caused users to be provisioned off their <code>user_id</code> even if they had a display name set.</li>
</ul>
Meanwhile, a <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter">Gitter bridge</a> is in active development (and in testing with the Neovim community on Gitter/Matrix/Freenode), although lacking documentation so far.
<p>Finally, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/Matrix-NEB">NEB</a> - the Matrix.org bot framework is currently being ported from Python to Golang to act as a general Go SDK for rapidly implementing new bot capabilities.</p>
<p>There's little point in all of the effort going into bridges and bots if it's too hard for normal users to deploy them, so on the Vector side of things there's an ongoing project to build a commercial-grade bot/bridge hosted service offering for Matrix which should make it <em>much</em> easier for non-sysadmins to quickly add their own bots and bridges into their rooms.  There's nothing to see yet, but we'll be yelling about it when it's ready!</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I'm sure there's a lot of stuff missing from the quick summary above - suffice it to say that the Matrix ecosystem is growing so fast and so large that it's pretty hard to keep track of everything that's going on.  The big remaining blockers we see at this point are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>End-to-end Encryption roll-out</li>
 	<li>Polishing UX on Vector - showing that it's possible to build better-than-Slack quality UX on top of Matrix</li>
 	<li>Bots, Integrations and Bridges - making them absolutely trivial to build and deploy, and encouraging everyone to write as many as they can!</li>
 	<li>Improving VoIP, especially for conferencing, especially on Mobile</li>
 	<li>Threading</li>
 	<li>Editable messages</li>
 	<li>Synapse scaling and stability - this is massively improved, but there's still work to be done.  Meanwhile projects like <a href="https://ruma.io">Ruma</a> give us hope for light at the end of the Synapse tunnel!</li>
 	<li>Spec refinements - there are still a <a href="/jira/browse/SPEC">lot of open spec bugs</a> which we need to resolve so we can declare the spec (and thus Matrix!) out of beta.</li>
 	<li>More clients - especially desktop ones; helping out with <a href="https://github.com/Fxrh/Quaternion">Quaternion</a>, <a href="https://github.com/davidar/tensor">Tensor</a>, <a href="https://pto.im">PTO</a>, etc.</li>
</ul>
...and then all the pieces of the jigsaw will finally be in place, and Matrix should hopefully fulfil its potential as an invaluable, open and decentralised data fabric for the web.
<p>Thanks, once again, to everyone who's been supporting and using Matrix - whether it's by hanging out in the public chatrooms, running your own server, writing your own clients, bots, or servers, or just telling your friends about the project.  The end of the beginning is in sight: thanks for believing in us, and thank you for flying Matrix.</p>

                <p>Congratulations to Aviral Dasgupta and Will &quot;Half-Shot&quot; Hunt who will be working with Matrix for their Google Summer of Code projects!</p>
<p>As <a href="/blog/2016/04/22/gsoc-update/">mentioned</a>, picking two projects out of all our proposals was no easy task. However, we now look forward to getting started, and we are sure Aviral and Half-Shot will help make Matrix even better over the next few months!</p>
<p>Aviral will be developing a flexible plugin system to facilitate integrating various services such as github/trello/duckduckgo with Matrix. Meanwhile, Half-Shot will be looking at adding features on top of Matrix - infact, he's already built a <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/projects/other/mpd-dj.html">MPD DJ bot</a> and started working on a <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/projects/sdk/matrix-dotnet-sdk.html">.NET SDK</a>. Aviral too, has been <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Aaviraldg">committing</a> various <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Aaviraldg">enhancements</a> already.</p>
<p>According to Google's GSoC timeline we are currently in the &quot;Community Bonding&quot; phase, which lasts till May 22, 2016 - which is when the projects formally kick off. </p>
<p>We're looking forward to seeing what awesome things Aviral and Half-Shot come up with!</p>

                <p>As <a href="/blog/2016/03/08/matrix-in-google-summer-of-code/">previously announced</a>, Matrix is participating in <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> (GSoC) 2016. We have had a <em>lot</em> of interest: lots of people joining Matrix to talk to us about their project ideas and a total of 38 project proposals. We have even had some code contributions to our various projects from people who discovered Matrix via GSoC! </p>
<p>It's our first year as a GSoC mentoring organisation and we were only allocated two project slots. This means that we had the tough decision of choosing between some really good projects - and that means a lot of you who applied will unfortunately be left feeling disappointed. Selecting our two projects was very difficult, and we talked it over until we all agreed. Please remember that not being picked does not mean that your proposal was bad.</p>
<p>If you missed out on a GSoC slot this year, that doesn't have to stop you from contributing, either by hacking on your own project or contributing to an existing Matrix project. It's a great way to hone your programming skills and we'll be more than happy to help out and support you - find us in <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a> and <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#matrix-dev:matrix.org">#matrix-dev:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<p>All the best from the Matrix team and good luck to everyone in their summer projects, whether GSoC or not!</p>

                <p>It's been 3 months since the <a href="/blog/2015/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-special/">Matrix Holiday Special</a> and once again we've all been too busy writing code to put anything that detailed on the blog.  So without further a do here's a quick overview of how things have progressed so far in 2016!</p>
<h3 id="home-servers">Home servers</h3>
<br/>
<h4 id="synapse">Synapse</h4>
<p>Work on <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse">Synapse</a> (our reference homeserver) has been primarily focused on improving performance.  This may sound boring, but there's been a huge amount of improvement here since synapse 0.12 was released on Jan 4. Synapse 0.13 on Feb 10 brought huge CPU savings thanks to a whole fleet of caching and other optimisation work - the best way of seeing the difference here is to look at the load graph of the server that hosts matrix.org's synapse+postgres over the last few months:</p>
<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/matrix-org-load.png" alt="matrix-org-load" width="497" height="173" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1563" />
<p>Ignoring the unrelated blip during March, you can see an enormous step change in system load (which had a matching decrease in actual CPU usage) at the beginning of Feb when the 0.13 optimisations landed on matrix.org :)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Synapse 0.14 is due any day now with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.14.0-rc2">0.14.0-rc2</a> released on Wednesday.  Here, the focus has been all about memory optimisation - anyone who's run a Synapse seriously will be aware that it can be a memory hog thanks to aggressively caching as much state and history in RAM as possible to avoid hitting the database and keeping everything responsive.  0.14 should improve memory usage just as dramatically as 0.13 improved CPU utilisation - introducing a quick-and-dirty SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR environment variable that lets admins dial down the aggressiveness of the caching (at the expense of performance), but more interestingly implementing string interning and ensuring that events are cached by ID rather than duplicated across multiple caches in order to make memory usage more efficient.  It's too early to have impressive looking graphs, and there are still a few memory spikes being tracked down before we release 0.14, but we're hoping for at least a 50% reduction in memory footprint.</p>
<p>Featurewise the highlights include: server-generated unread notification &amp; highlight counts and push badge support, lots of support and refinements for guest access and 3rd party ID invites.  Meanwhile we've finally fixed some of the most embarrassing long-standing missing features such as letting folks logout serverside(!), delete aliases and determine whether rooms should be published in the room directory or not. </p>
<p>Finally, Synapse is now part of <a href="http://www.freshports.org/net/py-matrix-synapse/">FreeBSD Ports</a> thanks to Brendan Molloy, and <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/nixos/modules/services/misc/matrix-synapse.nix">NixOS</a> thanks to Robin Lambertz!  Huge thanks to them for contributing the packages to the respective OSes and to all the other synapse package maintainers out there!</p>
<p>It's incredibly exciting to see Synapse's maturity improving and hitting the optimisation stage of its life; huge kudos to Erik for spearheading the optimisation work.  We strongly recommend folks upgrade to 0.14 when it's available; it's never been a better time to run a homeserver! :D</p>
<br/>
<h4 id="dendron">Dendron</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendron">Dendron</a> (our next generation homeserver) development has been progressing interestingly: we finished an initial spike to get a Golang skeleton server in place, albeit one that delegates most of the endpoints through to Synapse.  In fact, matrix.org itself has been running via Dendron since February!</p>
<p>The whole point of Dendron is to provide an architecture where we can split apart the various endpoints that Synapse provides today, re-implementing them where appropriate in Golang, and critically letting the endpoints scale horizontally with clusters of backend servers abstracted by the single Dendron API facade.  As a result, most of the Dendron work has actually ended up going into restructuring Synapse such that multiple Synapses can be run in a cluster behind a single Dendron, allowing us to horizontally scale API endpoints at last.  This takes the form of adding <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/1acc319070c0390d2330003bdc1e71cc66383dbb">cluster replication support</a> to Synapse.  This is still work-in-progress as we go through fixing up more and more state to be replicable (replicatable?) between synapses - hopefully it should land in the Synapse 0.15 timeframe.  And then we enter a very very interesting new world of horizontally scalable homeservers...</p>
<br/>
<h4 id="ruma">Ruma</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.ruma.io/">Ruma</a> has also seen some progress over the last few months - Ruma is an independent Rust language homeserver project led by Jimmy Cuadra, and whilst in early development still (currently focusing on the user login and registration system) shows a lot of promise.  Lots of work has ended up going into the required Rust dependencies rather than the Matrix code itself, but if you're interested in Rust then please drop by <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#ruma:matrix.org">#ruma:matrix.org</a> or #ruma on Freenode and say hi!</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="clients">Clients</h3>
<p>Whilst homeserver development is mainly all about performance and scaling work currently, the client side of the Matrix ecosystem is the polar opposite - with lots of rapid progress on exciting new clients happening from all over the community.</p>
<br/>
<h4 id="perpetually-talking-online-pto">Perpetually Talking Online (PTO)</h4>
<p><a href="http://pto.im/">PTO</a> has evolved enormously since Torrie Fischer first revealed it at the end of 2015.  PTO is an independent project that acts as a Matrix client that exposes an IRC server interface - effectively turning any Matrix homeserver into an ircd; letting folks hook their favourite IRC clients directly into Matrix and use it as an enormous decentralised IRC network.  (N.B. this is not to be confused with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">matrix-appservice-irc</a>, which acts as a server-side bridge between Matrix rooms and IRC channels.)  Obviously you lose some of the Matrix specific features (read receipts, typing notifs, VoIP, etc) but there's clearly a huge benefit for the IRC community to be able to use Matrix as if it were an IRC network.</p>
<p>There have been three releases so far, with the <a href="https://github.com/tdfischer/pto/releases">v0.3.0 (&quot;Carburetor&quot;) release</a> in March being tantalisingly close to being usable for everyday purposes.  We actually have pto.matrix.org all set up and ready to go as an IRC frontend for the matrix.org homeserver and once <a href="https://github.com/tdfischer/pto/issues/60">issue #60</a> is resolved we'll be turning it on :)</p>
<p>There's one catch though - XChat was never quite built to handle the hundreds of rooms that we've got used to Matrix supporting... :D</p>
<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-26-at-00.17.08-988x1024.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-03-26 at 00.17.08" width="988" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1565" />
<p>Come hang out in <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#pto:oob.systems">#pto:oob.systems</a> if you're interested in PTO!</p>
<br/>
<h4 id="quaternion">Quaternion</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Fxrh/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> is a new Qt/QML/C++ desktop client created by Felix Rohrbach.  It's a fairly early alpha but still quite usable and in very active development. <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#quaternion:matrix.org">#quaternion:matrix.org</a> is the place to talk all things Quaternion :)</p>
<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/quaternion-1024x702.png" alt="quaternion" width="1024" height="702" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1566" />
<br/>
<h4 id="matrix-glib-sdk">matrix-glib-sdk</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, over on the GTK side of the world, Gergely Polonkai has been been making great progress on his <a href="https://github.com/gergelypolonkai/matrix-glib-sdk">matrix-glib-sdk</a> Glib client SDK for Matrix.  The end goal here is to implement a full <a href="https://telepathy.freedesktop.org">Telepathy</a> plugin for Matrix on top of the SDK.  Originally written in C, but now shifted to Vala, the SDK is in very active development and now implements all(?) of the Matrix client-server API - a snapshot of the work-in-progress SDK API docs can be found at <a href="http://gergely.polonkai.eu/matrix-glib-sdk/">http://gergely.polonkai.eu/matrix-glib-sdk</a>.  Next up is a formal release and building out clients on top!</p>
<br/>
<h4 id="matrix-react-sdk-matrix-ios-sdk-matrix-android-sdk-and-vector">matrix-react-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk, matrix-android-sdk and Vector</h4>
<p>Finally, huge amounts of time and effort have continued to be pumped into the official <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk">matrix-react-sdk</a>, <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk">matrix-ios-sdk</a> and <a href="http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk">matrix-android-sdk</a> - driven substantially by requirements for <a href="http://vector.im">Vector</a>, the <a href="http://github.com/vector-im">FOSS</a> Matrix-powered collaboration app that we've been helping with:</p>
<br/>

</p>
<br/>
<p>The best way of seeing what's been going on here is probably by considering Vector itself, which is currently in formal beta (0.4.1 for web, 0.1.2 for iOS and #116 on Android).  The big news includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beta iOS and Android apps.  These are early beta but feedback is very much appreciated - the Android beta can be downloaded from <a href="http://matrix.org/jenkins/job/VectorAndroidDevelop/">Jenkins</a>; if you want to help beta iOS via TestFlight, come ask on <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#ios:matrix.org">#ios:matrix.org</a>.</li>
<li>Guest access.  Anyone can jump straight into Matrix by going to http://vector.im without even having to sign up for an account.  Guests are quite restricted on what they can do (and can only join rooms which explicitly have guest access enabled), but this is a *huge* improvement in getting folks using Matrix.</li>
<li>Ability to jump to any message ever - e.g. when clicking through search results or when permalinking a message... using precisely the same UI that you use when chatting.  Permalinks are awesome.  If you want to <a href="https://vector.im/develop/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org/$1416420724004tADpi:matrix.org">randomly jump back in time</a> to the first weeks of #matrix:matrix.org, now you can...</li>
<li>Read Markers, scrolling that remembers the scroll offset per-room, and the ability to jump to unread messages</li>
<li>Synchronised missed notification and missed highlighted notification information per-room</li>
<li>Badge counts for unread notifications</li>
<li>Entirely reworked Room Settings</li>
<li>Entirely reworked User Settings, including push notification configuration</li>
<li>Entirely reworked Room Directory</li>
<li>Lots of performance improvements</li>
<li>Much improved inviting by email</li>
<li>Much improved reliability on video conferencing</li>
<li>Closing literally <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed">hundreds and hundreds of bugs</a>...</li>
</ul>
<p>All that remains right now is yet more bugfixing and incorporating feedback from the current betas!  Please give as much feedback as possible in <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#vector:matrix.org">#vector:matrix.org</a> :)</p>

<h3 id="bridges-bots">Bridges &amp; Bots</h3>
<p>Bridges, bots, and other integrations and application services have inevitably taken slightly lower priority whilst we've been focusing on the core server and client bits of the ecosystem.  However, as of March we've started a major new project to get these moving again, starting with a big update to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc">IRC Bridge</a>.  This is due to be released next week, but you can get a sneak peek at what's going into the release at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/commits/develop">commit log</a>.  Highlights include the ability to persist nicks; connect via IPv6; improve formatted message handling; actually feed error messages from IRC back to Matrix; and much much more.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-verto">matrix-appservice-verto</a> also got some love, which means that multiway video conferencing powered by FreeSWITCH now works reliably.  The quality still could be improved, but the unreliable call setup that plagued earlier versions is now fixed.</p>
<p>In the next few months we're expecting to see a lot more activity on bridges &amp; bots... watch this space :)</p>
<p><b>Update Sat March 26:</b></p>
<p>Totally forgot to mention a few of the key new bridges which have been contributed by the community this year - particularly interesting are the <a href="https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Federation">Rocket.Chat&lt;-&gt;Matrix bridge</a> written by Sing-Li over at Rocket.Chat which provides basic bridging between the awesome <a href="http://rocket.chat">Rocket.Chat</a> collaboration app and the wider Matrix ecosystem.  It's early days, but this is incredibly promising for 'hardcoded' bridging between specific rooms - it just needs Rocket.Chat to support 'virtual' users and will then be seamless federation.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter">matrix-appservice-gitter</a> is a Gitter&lt;-&gt;Matrix bridge built by Leonerd on top of the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge">matrix-appservice-bridge</a> Node library.  Again, it's early days but is working well for 'hardcoded' bridging - supporting dynamic rooms and users is next on the todo list :)</p>

<h3 id="the-spec">The Spec</h3>
<p>We started our formal release process for the spec just before Christmas with r0.0.0 - and released <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/r0.0.1">r0.0.1</a> in January with <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/r0.0.1/client_server.html#changelog">minor clarifications and updates</a>.  In practice the spec feels quite stable right now, although things have moved on a bit since January and r0.0.2 is definitely overdue at this point.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can always get the very latest bleeding edge copy of the spec via <a href="http://matrix.org/speculator">the speculator</a>.  We've also added an initial cut at a spec for the <a href="http://matrix.org/speculator/spec/HEAD/identity_service.html">Identity Service</a> at last.</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="events">Events</h3>
<p>We've been focusing on writing code than evangelising Matrix recently, although we did get out to <a href="/blog/2016/02/03/fosdem-16-retrospective/">FOSDEM 2016</a> and <a href="/blog/2016/02/09/matrix-in-japan/">TADHack Mini Japan and WebRTC Conference</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/706916982960967680">Enterprise Connect 2016</a> where we showed off Matrix &amp; Vector in the WebRTC Real World Innovation showcase.</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="gsoc">GSoC</h3>
<p>We are incredibly grateful to have been accepted as an organisation into Google Summer of Code 2016!  The last two weeks have been the window for students to propose projects to us that they could work on over the course of the summer, and it's been fascinating to meet the GSoCers and see a whole new community pop up on Matrix and advise and mentor applicants through their proposals.  At the last count we've received 35 proposals, many inspired by <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/IDEAS.md">our list of ideas</a>, including some really impressive candidates - many thanks to all the students who have applied to us.  We don't know yet how many slots Google will allocate to us, but one way or another we're really looking forward to helping the GSoCers make the most out of their summer of Matrix!  All GSoC discussion is happening in <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#gsoc:matrix.org">#gsoc:matrix.org</a>.</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h3>
<p>In no particular order, the urgent stuff that still remains includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing to polish synapse and build out dendron-based clustering</li>
<li>Building as many bridges, bots and other integrations as possible</li>
<li>The matrix.to URL-handler service: having client-agnostic https://matrix.to/#matrix:matrix.org URLs to help with sharing matrix room aliases etc</li>
<li>End-to-end crypto.  No progress since December; we need to get back to it asap.</li>
<li>Exiting Vector from beta</li>
<li>Finishing the server-to-server API specification</li>
<li>Improving the security model for access_tokens</li>
<li>Editable messages</li>
<li>Pinned, tagged, and 'liked' messages</li>
<li>Threading</li>
<li>Decentralised accounts</li>
<li>Decentralised reputation</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, Bridging and E2E crypto is likely to get the most attention first (beyond the standard ongoing polishing).  There's obviously a significant amount of work there, but we expect to see benefits pretty quickly throughout Matrix - especially from bridging.  Hopefully it's true to say that the next few months should be quite transformational :D</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for reading this sprawling update and for supporting Matrix.  And please come say hi in <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a> if you have any questions :)</p>

<p>We are very happy to be one of the companies selected for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/?sp-page=2">Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2016</a>!</p>
<p>GSoC is a great, global opportunity for students to work on open source projects during their university summer break. The idea is for students to propose a project for any of the open source organisations picked by Google, and - if accepted - receive a stipend for working on it. We are very eager to see what projects students will propose - we have written up some ideas <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/IDEAS.md">here</a>, but students are expected to do some research and come up with projects themselves.</p>
<p>If you are a student wanting to participate in GSoC for Matrix, please come talk to us in <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#gsoc:matrix.org">#gsoc:matrix.org</a> - we are happy to discuss project ideas and review application drafts. We have also added some general tips on what to include in the application <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC#how-do-i-write-my-gsoc-application">here</a>.</p>
<p>Applications can be submitted starting <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline">next Monday</a>, so there's still plenty of time to have a play with Matrix and come up with a cool project idea.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
