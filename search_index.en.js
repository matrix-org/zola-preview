specification develops, and\nprovides a safety-net to ensure the project stays independent and true to its\ngoals. The constitution of the project is defined in the Foundation's legal\nArticles of Association and Rules, and is enforced by the Guardians of Matrix:\nthe directors of the Foundation appointed to provide a balance of independent\nexperts and the founding Matrix team to ensure the project stays on track.\nThe Guardians\nThe Guardians are the legal directors of the non-profit Foundation, and are\nresponsible for ensuring that the Foundation (and by extension the Spec Core\nTeam) keeps on mission and neutrally protects the development of Matrix.\nGuardians are typically independent of the commercial Matrix ecosystem and may\neven not be members of today's Matrix community, but are deeply aligned with\nthe mission of the project.

Ross brings a unique perspective as a tech- and decentralisation-savvy lawyer to the Foundation, as well as being one of the first non-developers in the Matrix community to run his own homeserver. Ross has been known to walk around Mozfest clutching a battery-powered Synapse in a box, promoting decentralised communication for all.\n\n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n            Dr. Jutta Steiner\n            As co-founder and CEO of Parity Technologies, Dr. Jutta Steiner is dedicated to building a better internet - Web 3.0 - where users’ privacy &amp; control come first. Parity Technologies is a leader in the blockchain space – known to many as the creator of one of the most popular Ethereum clients, it is also the creator of two ambitious new blockchain technlogies, Polkadot and Substrate, that make it easier to experiment and innovate on scalability, encryption and governance.\n\nParity Technologies have been pioneering Matrix enterprise use since the moment they decided to rely on Matrix for their internal and external communication back in 2016 and now run their own high-volume deployment, with end-to-end encryption enabled by default. Jutta represents organisations who are professionally dependent on Matrix day-to-day, as well as bringing her unique experiences around decentralisation and ensuring that Web 3.0 will be a fair web for all.\n\n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nLegal Details\n\nThe Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C is registered in the UK as Company \n#11648710\nThe official articles of association of the Foundation may be\ndownloaded here\nThe official Rules for the Foundation may be downloaded here\n\nThe Rules of the Foundation\nThe Foundation is governed by two sets of documents - its Articles of\nAssociation, which define its legal structure and processes, and its Rules,\nwhich define the scope and mechanisms of its day-to-day activity.\nThe Rules were originally drafted through the open Matrix Specification Change\nproposal process in order to provide full transparency and review from the \nwider community. The result was MSC1779 -  Proposal for Open Governance of Matrix.org,\nproviding a comprehensive overview of the whole governance process.\nThe Proposal for Open Governance was then formalised into legal form and\nincorporated into the Articles of Association and a matching Rules document,\nwhich is canonically versioned in this Google Doc\n(for ease of use by lawyers). This is the official canonical version of the\nrulebook referred to by the Foundation's Articles.\nThe full history of the rules can be followed via:\n\nhttps://matrix.org/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318 (v1 proposal)\nhttps://matrix.org/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1779\n\nOne of the most important items defined in the Rules are The Guiding Principles\nof the project and the definition of the Spec Core Team, which are reproduced\nbelow from MSC1779 for ease of reference.\nMatrix Manifesto\nWe believe:\n\nPeople should have full control over their own communication.\nPeople should not be locked into centralised communication silos, but instead\nbe free to pick who they choose to host their communication without limiting\nwho they can reach.\nThe ability to converse securely and privately is a basic human right.\nCommunication should be available to everyone as a free and open,\nunencumbered, standard and global network.\n\nMission\nThe Matrix.org Foundation exists to act as a neutral custodian for Matrix and to\nnurture it as efficiently as possible as a single unfragmented standard, for\nthe greater benefit of the whole ecosystem, not benefiting or privileging any\nsingle player or subset of players.\nFor clarity: the Matrix ecosystem is defined as anyone who uses the Matrix\nprotocol. This includes (non-exhaustively):\n\nEnd-users of Matrix clients.\nMatrix client developers and testers.\nSpec developers.\nServer admins.\nMatrix packagers &amp; maintainers.\nCompanies building products or services on Matrix.\nBridge developers.\nBot developers.\nWidget developers.\nServer developers.\nMatrix room and community moderators.\nEnd-users who are using Matrix indirectly via bridges.\nExternal systems which are bridged into Matrix.\nAnyone using Matrix for data communications.\n\n\"Greater benefit\" is defined as maximising:\n\nthe number of Matrix-native end-users reachable on the open Matrix network.\nthe number of regular users on the Matrix network (e.g. 30-day retained\nfederated users).\nthe number of online servers in the open federation.\nthe number of developers building on Matrix.\nthe number of independent implementations which use Matrix.\nthe number of bridged end-users reachable on the open Matrix network.\nthe signal-to-noise ratio of the content on the open Matrix network\n(i.e. minimising spam).\nthe ability for users to discover content on their terms (empowering them to\nselect what to see and what not to see).\nthe quality and utility of the Matrix spec (as defined by ease and ability\nwith which a developer can implement spec-compliant clients, servers, bots,\nbridges, and other integrations without needing to refer to any other\nexternal material).\n\nN.B. that we consider success to be the growth of the open federated network\nrather than closed deployments. For example, if WhatsApp adopted Matrix it\nwouldn't be a complete win unless they openly federated with the rest of the\nMatrix network.\nValues\nAs Matrix evolves, it's critical that the Spec Core Team and Guardians are aligned on the overall philosophy of the project, particularly in more subjective areas. The values we follow are:\n\nSupporting the whole long-term ecosystem rather than individual stakeholder gain.\nOpenness rather than proprietary lock-in.\nInteroperability rather than fragmentation.\nCross-platform rather than platform-specific.\nCollaboration rather than competition.\nAccessibility rather than elitism.\nTransparency rather than stealth.\nEmpathy rather than contrariness.\nPragmatism rather than perfection.\nProof rather than conjecture.\n\nPatent encumbered IP is strictly prohibited from being added to the standard.\nMaking the specification rely on non-standard/unspecified behaviour of other\nsystems or actors (such as SaaS services, even open-sourced, not governed by a\nstandard protocol) shall not be accepted, either.\nThe Spec Core Team\nThe contents and direction of the Matrix Spec is governed by the Spec Core Team;\na set of experts from across the whole Matrix community, representing all\naspects of the Matrix ecosystem. The Spec Core Team acts as a subcommittee of\nthe Foundation.\nMembers of the Spec Core Team pledge to act as a neutral custodian for Matrix on\nbehalf of the whole ecosystem and uphold the Guiding Principles of the project\nas outlined above. In particular, they agree to drive the adoption of Matrix as\na single global federation, an open standard unencumbered from any proprietary\nIP or software patents, minimising fragmentation (whilst encouraging\nexperimentation), evolving rapidly, and prioritising the long-term success and\ngrowth of the overall network over individual commercial concerns.\nSpec Core Team members need to have significant proven domain experience/skill\nand have had clear dedication and commitment to the project and community\nfor &gt;6 months. (In future, once we have subteams a la Rust, folks need to have\nproven themselves there first).\nMembers need to demonstrate ability to work constructively with the rest of the\nteam; we want participation in the Spec Core Team to be an efficient, pleasant\nand productive place, even in the face of inevitable disagreement. We do not\nwant a toxic culture of bullying or competitive infighting. Folks need to be\nable to compromise; we are not building a culture of folks pushing their\npersonal agendas at the expense of the overall project.\nThe team should be particularly vigilant against 'trojan horse' additions to the\nspec - features which only benefit particular players, or are designed to\nsomehow cripple or fragment the open protocol and ecosystem in favour of\ncompetitive advantage. Commercial players are of course free to build\nproprietary implementations, or use custom event types, or even custom API\nextensions (e.g. more efficient network transports) - but implementations must\nfall back to interoperating correctly with the rest of the ecosystem.\nThe current Spec Core Team (and their domain areas) is:\n\nMatthew Hodgson (Lead, Guardian)\nErik Johnston (Servers)\nRichard van der Hoff (Servers, Cryptography)\nDavid Baker (Clients, IS API, Push API, Media)\nHubert Chathi (Cryptography, General)\nAndrew Morgan (Servers, AS API, Spec Process)\nTravis Ralston (Bots and Bridges &amp; AS API, Media)\nAlexey Rusakov (Clients on behalf of Community)\n\n","id":"/about/","title":"About Matrix"},"/blog/":{"body":"","id":"/blog/","title":"Blog"},"/blog/2022/":{"body":"","id":"/blog/2022/","title":""},"/blog/2022/09/":{"body":"","id":"/blog/2022/09/","title":""},"/blog/2022/09/02/synapse-1-66-released/":{"body":"Hey all, we've just released Synapse 1.66! Let's have a\nlook at what's inside this release.\nRemoval of email verification delegation\nBefore Synapse 1.66, homeserver administrators had the possibility to\nconfigure Synapse to delegate verifying email addresses to an identity\nserver (using the account_threepid_delegates.email configuration setting).\nThis feature relied on old APIs from the Matrix specification that have since\nbeen removed from it.\nSynapse 1.64 announced the\ndeprecation of this feature, and the addition of a warning at startup when\nthe configuration setting is in use.\nAs of Synapse 1.66, support for this feature has been fully removed, and\nSynapse will refuse to start if the configuration setting for it is in use.\nIf this has not already been done, administrators of servers that were\npreviously using this feature are encouraged to configure an SMTP server that\nSynapse can use to verify email addresses on its own. See the\nconfiguration guide\nfor more information.\nAlso see the upgrade notes\nfor more information.\nPlanned removal of support for TCP replication\nMost server administrators already know that Synapse can be made to scale\nhorizontally by deploying workers. Workers are\nprocesses running alongside Synapse's main process to allow offloading some\nof the work it would otherwise be doing, load balancing some of the traffic,\netc.\nIn a deployment of Synapse that uses workers, these processes use replication\nto share information between themselves. One of the earliest protocols\nSynapse used for replication was built on top of TCP.\nSynapse 1.18 introduced a new\nRedis-based replication protocol for workers to use and deprecated the\nTCP-based protocol, without specifying a removal date.\nThis week we're announcing that support for TCP replication will be removed\nfrom Synapse in version 1.67, which is expected to come out around Sep 13th.\nSee the release notes for more\ndetails.\nEverything else\nSynapse 1.66 also includes some improvements to validation on endpoints using\nUser-Interactive Authentication.\nThis version of Synapse also adds compression support for federation traffic.\nSee the configuration guide\nfor more information on how to compress HTTP traffic.\nFurthermore, Synapse 1.66 improves the Room Details amin API\nand allows administrators to see if all local users have marked a given room\nas \"forgotten\".\nSee the full\nchangelog for a\ncomplete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the\nupgrade\nnotes\nfor this version.\nSynapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend\nour thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no\nparticular order) Dirk Klimpel and\nAntonin Loubiere, as well as anyone\nhelping us make Synapse better by sharing their feedback and reporting\nissues.\n","id":"/blog/2022/09/02/synapse-1-66-released/","title":"Synapse 1.66 released"},"/blog/2022/09/02/this-week-in-matrix-2022-09-02/":{"body":"Matrix Live 🎙\n\nDept of Spec 📜\n\n    uhoreg reports\n\n    \nHere's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.\nMSC Status\nMerged MSCs:\n\nNo MSCs were merged this week.\n\nMSCs in Final Comment Period:\n\nNo MSCs are in FCP.\n\nNew MSCs:\n\nThere were no new MSCs this week.\n\nSpec Core Team\nIt's been a light week for the spec core team, but we have been looking at MSC3862 and MSC3758.  These are two proposals that try to extend push rules in different ways to be able to match more than just strings.  So we have been discussing the relative merits of both proposals.\nRandom MSC of the Week\nThe random MSC of the week is... MSC3386: Unified Join Rules!\nCurrently, a room can be set so that prospective members can knock to request to join the room, or allow members of a different room to join.  However a room cannot be set up to allow both; MSC3386 proposes a change to the join rules to change this.\n\n\n\nDept of Servers 🏢\nSynapse (website)\nSynapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team\nShay reports\n\nThis week we released Synapse 1.66.0! Some notable features are:\n\nAdding forgotten status to Room Details Admin API.\nAdding an experimental implementation for MSC3852 (Expose user agents on Device).\nAdding org.matrix.msc2716v4 experimental room version with updated content fields. Part of MSC2716 (Importing history)\nAdding support for compression to federation responses.\nImproving performance of sending messages in rooms with thousands of local users.\n\nPlus a host of bugfixes and other changes to make Synapse faster and leaner! Take a look. https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.66.0. In addition, work continues on fast room joins-stay tuned, as we are getting closer to the finish line.\n\nDendrite (website)\nSecond generation Matrix homeserver\nTill says\n\nThis week we released Dendrite 0.9.6 which includes a number of fixes, including a rewrite of the appservice component:\nFeatures\n\nThe appservice API has been refactored for improved performance and stability\n\nThe appservice database has been deprecated, as the roomserver output stream is now used as the data source instead\n\n\nThe generate-config tool has been updated to support additional scenarios, i.e. for CI configuration generation and generating both monolith and polylith skeleton config files\n\nFixes\n\nThe username length check has been fixed on new account creation\nThe length of the type, sender, state_key and room_id fields in events are now verified by number of codepoints rather than bytes, fixing the \"Cat Overflow\" bug\nUTF-16 surrogate handling in the canonical JSON implementation has been fixed\nA race condition when starting the keyserver has been fixed\nA race condition when configuring HTTP servers and routing at startup has been fixed\nA bug where the incorrect limit was used for lazy-loading memberships has been fixed\nThe number of push notifications will now be sent to the push gateway\nA missing index causing slow performance on the sync API send-to-device table has been added (contributed by PiotrKozimor)\nEvent auth will now correctly check for the existence of the \"creator\" field in create events\n\nAs always, please feel free to join us in #dendrite:matrix.org for more Dendrite-related discussion.\n\nHomeserver Deployment 📥️\nHelm Chart (website)\nMatrix Kubernetes applications packaged into helm charts\nAnanace announces\n\nThis week has seen some updates to my Helm Charts, bumping element-web to 1.11.4 and matrix-synapse to 1.66.0 - as well as making the worker configuration more flexible in handling multiple instances of specialised workers.\n\nAnanace says\n\nAnd another quick update on my Helm Charts, bumped my synatainer package to the just released 0.4.2\n\nDept of Bridges 🌉\nPostmoogle (website)\nAn Email to Matrix bridge. 1 room = 1 mailbox.\nAine says\n\nPostmoogle v0.9.0\n\nACLs with wildcards, controlled directly from matrix chat\nAdmin users\nAbility to list all mailboxes and disable/remove them directly from matrix chat\nDisplay options (show/hide sender, show/hide subject, html/text-only parsing, enable/disable email -&gt; matrix threads, enable/disable attachments support)\n\nSource code, matrix room: #postmoogle:etke.cc\n\nmatrix-hookshot (website)\nA multi purpose multi platform bridge, formerly known as matrix-github\nHalf-Shot reports\n\nAnother week, another hookshot release. This release brings support for Arm64 docker builds, a revamped JSON logger and much prettier error reporting in the widget. As always, there is a good chunk of bugfixes too.\nYou can check out version 2.1.1 here!\nCome chat to us in #hookshot:half-shot.uk if you need a hand setting up.\nIn terms of what will be appearing in the near future:\n\nSupport for adding JIRA connections via widgets.\nEncryption support (at long last) so you can bridge in hookshot to encrypted rooms.\nAn experimental new way to share logic between rooms configured with custom JS functions. Possibly utilizing Matrix rooms-as-software-libraries.\n\n\nDept of Clients 📱\nBeeper\nEric Migicovsky says\n\nHey it’s Eric from Beeper! Been a while since our last update. Reminder: Beeper is a universal chat app built on top of Matrix. We've created 12+ open source Matrix bridges and integrated them into an easy to use all-in-one service which does not require setting up your own homeserver.\nSince our last update in February (!) we have been really busy! We published a short-term roadmap back in April and have almost completed all items on the list. \nToday I want to share the improvements we’ve made to Beeper Desktop. Check out the video below for a full demo! \nNew features:\n\nShiny new design and theme (just released yesterday!\nCompletely updated inbox workflow\n\nIt’s designed to make it easier to prioritize the chats that matter most to you, and quickly archive everything else\nActions like archive/pin/mark as unread\nCollapsible archive section\nAuto-archive messages after you reply or a fixed time\nTons of new keyboard shortcuts\nSee a full chat preview without opening chat or marking it read\n\n\nScheduled messages - schedule a message to be sent in any chat. Works on any chat network that Beeper supports, and will send even if your devices are all powered off.\nStart New Chat directly from Beeper Desktop on any bridged chat network\nSent status for bridged messages - get confirmation or a failure alert if the bridge is unable to send a message to the remote network\nTwo-factor verification codes sent via Android SMS or iMessage are automatically copied to clipboard. Just like Safari!\nTons and tons of bugfixes and smaller new features\n\nWe’ve also been working hard on new bridges + features, Beeper Android and Beeper iOS, but I will save those for another post! \nWant to get access to Beeper? Sign up on beeper.com and if you want to jump the line, send us a DM on Twitter. Or chat with the community #beeper:beeper.com \nWant to work with us at Beeper? We are hiring 100% remote backend, iOS and Android developers. Send me a message @eric:beeper.com. And if you want to develop an open source bridge, we will fund it with up to $5,000.\n\n\nNheko (website)\nDesktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.\nNico says\n\nWe now properly inherit the sticker packs from the parent spaces, which gives you the possibility to expose stickers to your whole community by editing them in a single space. The bug that deleted widgets were shown, that sneaked into the last release, should also be resolved. If your server doesn't follow the client server spec on event size limits, Nheko is now stricter when validating the return values and might refuse to show events or room violating such constraints. Before this fix using a non-compliant server could make Nheko fail to properly process the sync response. Forest cleaned up our formatting configuration, Zirnc fixed our misleading bug report template suggesting the version field would be somewhere it isn't and Hiers made the edit button in the room profile match the one in the user profile. Forest also fixed our usage of the Qt colour palette for reactions and made hitting the escape key always return focus to the message input.\nAlso, if you managed to find me on the Matrix Community Summit, you might have had the chance to get one of the rare hardware Nheko patches (contrary to the software ones).\n\nElement Web/Desktop (website)\nSecure and independent communication, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-web:matrix.org!\nDanielle says\n\n🔒 We have a security release: Please update to v1.11.4 ASAP.\nLast weekend we received a report from Val Lorentz (thank you!) that it was possible to create a situation where Element wouldn’t show all of the user’s rooms or Spaces, causing minor (temporary) corruption and Denial of Service (DoS). We’ve fixed this case in v1.11.4 and encourage everyone to update as soon as possible.\nWhile the vulnerabilities themselves are not disclosed yet, there is more information on the element.io blog and the matrix.org blog.\nPlease note that this also affects consumers of the matrix-react-sdk and matrix-js-sdk: updating to v3.53.0 and v19.4.0 respectively should resolve the issue.\n🥼  In labs (you can enable labs features in settings on develop.element.io or on Nightly):\n\nThreads Notification improvements are coming! This week the team met to review all the feedback given by Beta users, alongside our MSCs, and Proof of Concept work to finalise the plan and approach for Threads Notifications. Watch this space!\n\n\nElement iOS (website)\nSecure and independent communication for iOS, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-ios:matrix.org!\nȘtefan says\n\n\nElement 1.9.2 is now available on the AppStore and with it comes a brand new home screen layout. The new view is cleaner, easier to browse, and faster to navigate. We’d love for you to enable the labs setting and try it out.\nThere’s exciting work happening in other areas as well: we’re working hard on deferring DM creation until the first message is sent and the new rich text editor is quickly taking shape. \nOn the ElementX front we have made very good progress on integrating the new sync mechanism and the new Rust Timeline API is proving to be quite a treat.\nAnd, as always, we fixed some big bugs and some not so big ones. Enjoy!\n\n\nElement Android (website)\nSecure and independent communication for Android, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-android:matrix.org!\nManu announces\n\n\nComing soon on Element Android is the new app layout. The home page of the app has been redesigned. The new view is cleaner, easier to browse, and faster to navigate. Keep an eye out on twitter for our teaser trailers! \nThe team has been working on deferring DM creation until after the first message has been sent. So you’ll no longer invite another person to an empty room, instead they’ll see your message and a new invite all at once.\nAlong with these exciting improvements we’ve fixed several bugs, including improving the speed of the app when you resume it.\n\n\nElement (website)\nEverything related to Element but not strictly bound to a client\nkittykat says\n\nCommunity testing\n\nWe’d love to hear your feedback on the new composer redesign, including an all new WISYWIG editor: sign up to take part in testing!\nFor more info on our next testing sessions, you can join us at #element-community-testing:matrix.org!\n\n\nCinny (website)\nCinny is a Matrix client focused on simplicity, elegance and security\najbura reports\n\nSecurity update\nThis release address the vulnerability found this week in matrix-js-sdk &lt;19.4.0, so please update to Cinny v2.1.3 at your earliest convenience.\nIf you are using our hosted version then it is already up-to-date and all you need is a refresh and clear cache (if you were hit by the vulnerability).\nYou can read more about the vulnerability at Security releases: matrix-js-sdk 19.4.0.\nFind more about Cinny at https://cinny.in/\nJoin our space at: https://matrix.to/#/#cinny-space:matrix.org\nGithub: https://github.com/ajbura/cinny\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/@cinnyapp\n\nDept of Non Chat Clients 🎛️\nCircles (website)\nE2E encrypted social networking built on Matrix. Safe, private sharing for your friends, family, and community.\ncvwright reports\n\nThe Circles project is now Circuli.  F-Droid users can get a sneak peek at the new Android beta by installing our beta repo.  Coming soon on Google Play!\n\nDept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰\nTrixnity (website)\nMultiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix\nBenedict says\n\nTrixnity 2.3.0 is out. We've done a large refactoring in trixnity-client making it even more modular by using dependency injection. This theoretically allows you to disable modules (e. g. E2EE) or add custom functionality. We've also made some improvements in the *api-server modules APIs to enable implementing just a few and not all endpoints (e. g. in proxies).\nMoreover, you can now play with Trixnity without building the whole SDK by using the new Trixnity examples repository. The examples are running on the JVM, in your Browser, NodeJS environment or as native binary on your host. It's pretty fun, except for the fact that you don't need something like a ping bot with E2EE in the browser 😄\n\nmatrix-rust-sdk (website)\nNext-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM\nben announces\n\nAfter merging the types into ruma a few weeks back, now the Sliding Sync PR has been handed in for review on the Rust SDK, too. With its own jack-in test client and Element-X iOS being build on it, the authors are pretty confident with the current state of that API, which will still only be available behind a feature-flag after merge (which is on by default for FFI though). That said, work isn't done here, extensions aren't even fully specified yet and many other aspects, like v3-fallback, aren't even started. Once this is reviewed and merged a tracking issue will be initiated documenting the missing pieces and allow the work to be more spread out (if you are interested in helping out, ping us in our matrix channel!).\nSimilarly, the new Timeline API is making progress as well, to that point that fractal has a PR trying it out. Same goes for the crypto for web-js bindings, which have seen some further planning and coordination effort and minor fixes and exposing of further functions as a result of that. Aside from the usual clean ups and API improvements, we have found one significant problem during last weeks workshops at Matrix Summit Berlin: a recent change in the API lead to some functions now stalling if you await on some within a sync-callback or -handler. A fix has been merged to the examples, but the team has agreed to revisit the API and change the return type to prevent this foot-gun from breaking existing code elsewhere - stay tuned for that update.\n️👉️ Wanna hack on matrix rust? Go check out our help wanted tagged issues and join our matrix channel at Matrix Rust SDK.\n\nMatrix Dart SDK (website)\nMatrix SDK written in pure Dart.\nNico announces\n\nWe released version 0.13.0, which includes some small breaking changes, but also cools stuff like support for MSC3814, Dehydrated Devices V2 aka Shrivelled Sessions and key requests in more cases. Fixes for group calls and properly updating of the last message in a room. And for better performance on web a migration to Hive Box Collections.\n\nDept of Ops 🛠\nSynatainer (website)\nSynapse Maintenance Container – Docker container with tools for synapse &amp; postgres database maintenance\nsaces announces\n\nNew in v0.4.2\n\nMXPASSFILE - like PGPASSFILE, but for matrix tokens.

This week, I created a public Matrix room that is exclusive for people called Bram: everyone can join, but only people called Bram can send messages.\nThe room can be found at #all:brams.dev and everyone's allowed to take a look at it. The process is not yet automated but that might change either through spec functionality of with the use of a simple bot.\n\nEffektio (website)\nThe one mobile-first, decentralized community organizing app\nben reports\n\nFor the first time, at Matrix Summit Berlin last Saturday, we have presented Effektio to, its goals, ambitions and plans to a wider audience and we couldn't be more ecstatic about the response. Even though the presentation didn't quite go as planned, as we decided on a highly engaged audience and discussed various aspects, the overall feedback was great- with many people asking for access and sharing useful ideas and contacts. Unfortunately the presentation wasn't recorded (the quality of our own recording isn't really sufficient) and the slides alone will not be enough, but we are working on making something along it available.\nThat has given the team another motivational boost, before as well as the feedback after, to get something usable out there. While the task-lists and news features presented have now properly mocked, other features on the chat side have fully materialized: like real time updates, typing notifications and cross device verification (so you can share your existing keys) and general things like switching to a event-handlers rather than overloading the sync-callback. Unfortunately we have also seen quite a few set backs, mainly around using ffi-gen as the intermediate between rust and dart, which makes us wonder if switching to uniffi and share back more of our work in effektio upstream might even be easier in the long run.\nEither way, we are motivated than ever before to build it out and get it into the hands of the first real users than ever.\n📰 You want updates more frequently and closer to when they actually happen? Join our Effektio Matrix News room or hangout and discuss with the team in our public foyer Matrix channel.\n\nBeeper beeper\nEric Migicovsky says\n\nOh and as a fun side project we are building a real Beeper beeper.

MSC2730: Verifiable forwarded events!\nEver noticed how when you forward an event in Matrix today, it simply looks like you've just copy/pasted the message and sent it yourself? Other messengers will often include some metadata with the forwarded message to inform the room that it's a message originally from another room and/or user, rather than being originally authored by yourself.\nThis MSC attempts to optionally add that metadata to messages, with the crucial goal of preventing that metadata from being faked (which could be dangerous). Check if out if that's something that interests you!\n\n\nDept of Servers 🏢\nSynapse (website)\nSynapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team\nBrendan Abolivier reports\n\nThis week the team released Synapse 1.67.0rc1! This first release candidate includes a few features, a bunch of notable performance improvements and bugfixes, and also removes the long-deprecated TCP replication. We thank everyone who help us test this RC by running it ahead of the release next week, and reporting any bug or feedback on the Synapse repo or in #synapse:matrix.org, respectively.\nAnother very exciting thing that happened this week is the merge of the base code infrastructure to support running Rust code in Synapse! You can find more about this in the pull request, but what this means is we can now replace some bits of Synapse written in Python with code written in Rust to make it more efficient. This is not a rewrite of Synapse in Rust, but rather a way for us to optimise some specific hot paths. Currently there's some more work going on with implementing push rules support in Rust, as well as converting some caching code. Watch this space for more info!\n\nDendrite (website)\nSecond generation Matrix homeserver\nneilalexander announces\n\nThis week we released Dendrite 0.9.7 with quite a few bug fixes and performance improvements. It's a recommended upgrade, so if you have a Dendrite installation, please upgrade! Changes include:\n\nInitial supporting code to enable full-text search has been merged (although not ready for use yet)\nNewly created rooms now have higher default power levels for enabling encryption, setting server ACLs or sending tombstone events\nIncoming signing key updates over federation are now queued in JetStream for processing, so that they cannot be dropped accidentally\nA race condition between the roomserver output events being generated, forward extremities being updated and room info being updated has been fixed\nAppservices will no longer receive invite events which they are not interested in, which caused heavy load in some cases or excessive request sizes in others\nA bug in state resolution v2 where events could incorrectly be classified as control events has been fixed\nA bug in state resolution v2 where some specific events with unexpected non-empty state keys are dropped has been fixed\nA bug in state resolution v2 when fetching auth events vs partial state has been fixed\nStale device lists should now be handled correctly for all user IDs, which may help with E2EE reliability\nA number of database writer issues have been fixed in the user API and sync API, which should help to reduce database is locked errors with SQLite databases\nDatabase migrations should now be detected more reliably to prevent unexpected errors at startup\nA number of minor database transaction issues have been fixed, particularly for assigning NIDs in the roomserver, cleaning up device keys and cleaning up notifications\nThe database query for finding shared users in the sync API has been optimised, using significantly less CPU time as a result\n\nAs always, please feel free to join us in #dendrite:matrix.org for more Dendrite-related discussion.\n\nDept of Bridges 🌉\nPostmoogle (website)\nAn Email to Matrix bridge. 1 room = 1 mailbox.\nAine reports\n\nPostmoogle v0.9.1\n\"Are we bridge yet?\" - Yes.

As a result, opening the Trixnity project does not need any C-Library-Building-Tools, because the binaries are just downloaded. On the one hand this speeds up building Trixnity significantly and on the other hand contributing to Trixnity is much easier (especially on Windows machines). Just do ./gradlew build.\n\nmatrix-rust-sdk (website)\nNext-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM\nben reports\n\nThis week saw the merge of PR/Issue #1000, a milestone, that, though random, marks the continuous progress and pace this project has taken up. 🥂 to the next 1000!\nFurther more we saw the merge of make create_dm_room public, allowing any developer using the SDK to use it as well saw the first review of the sliding sync PR, which now also has a tracking issue explaining what remains to be done (and when) once the PR has landed. Other than that we had several refactorings, clean ups and minor fixes merged, in anticipation of the upcoming release of 0.6, which we expect to land before the end of the month. If all goes will that release will contain both sliding sync and the new timeline API behind feature flags to use and play with. 🫰 Fingers crossed.\n👉 Wanna hack on matrix rust?

Synapse\n1.67 is fresh out\nof the oven, let's have a look at what's inside.\nRemoval of TCP replication\nAs announced in the Synapse 1.66 release\nannouncement, Synapse 1.67 removes support for the legacy TCP replication protocol.\nAs a reminder, Synapse can be configured to use workers to spread its load over\nmultiple processes, or even multiple machines. These workers communicate between\neach other (and with the main Synapse process) using something we call\n\"replication\".\nSynapse 1.18\ndeprecated its TCP-based replication protocol, and replaced it with a brand new\none using Redis. As of Synapse 1.67, this Redis-based\nprotocol is now the only protocol that can be used.\nSee the upgrade\nnotes\nfor more information.\nChanges for installations using a source checkout\nServer admins who installed Synapse using a source checkout might already be\nfamiliar with Poetry. This is a tool we use\nto better manage dependencies within Synapse. As of this version, we have\nupdated Synapse's dependency on Poetry to require Poetry 1.2, which was recently\nreleased.\nIt is also worth noting that Synapse 1.68, which is due to release on the 27th\nof September, will require a Rust compiler when installed from a source\ncheckout. This is because we are in the process of introducing Rust in Synapse's\ncode base, in order to make some hot code paths more efficient. See the upgrade\nnotes\nfor more information.\nThese two changes should not impact installations that use pip install matrix-synapse, Debian packages from packages.matrix.org or the\nmatrixdotorg/synapse Docker image to manage and run Synapse.\nEverything else\nSynapse 1.68 (due on the 27th of September) will also require SQLite v3.27.0 or\nhigher when run with SQLite.

But feel free to check out both in the meantime if you're interested.\n\n\nDept of Servers 🏢\nSynapse (website)\nSynapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team\nBrendan Abolivier announces\n\nThis week we've released Synapse 1.67! This Synapse release is the first one to use Poetry 1.2, and also removes the long-deprecated TCP-based replication protocol. Synapse workers are now required to use the Redis-based protocol which we introduced back in 2020. If this isn't already the case for your deployment of Synapse, see the documentation for workers as well as the upgrade notes, to update your configuration.\nIn other news, Synapse 1.68 (which is due to release on the 27th of September) will introduce a couple of changes in dependencies. The minimum supported SQLite version will be raised to 3.26, meaning that Synapse 1.67 is the last version of Synapse supporting SQLite versions 3.22 to 3.26. In addition to this, a Rust compiler will be required for source checkouts, as we are starting to introduce Rust code in Synapse (as I mentioned last week). This latter change should not impact installations that use pip install matrix-synapse, Debian packages from packages.matrix.org or the matrixdotorg/synapse Docker image to manage and run Synapse. See the upgrade notes for more information about these two changes.\n\nHomeserver Deployment 📥️\nHelm Chart (website)\nMatrix Kubernetes applications packaged into helm charts\nAnanace announces\n\nThis week sees some of the usual updates to my Helm Charts, with element-web being updated to 1.11.5 and matrix-synapse to 1.67.0.\n\nDept of Bridges 🌉\nPostmoogle (website)\nAn Email to Matrix bridge. 1 room = 1 mailbox.\nAine announces\n\nPostmoogle v0.9.2\n\nbugfixes\nspeed up email delivery\nStartTLS enabled automatically if TLS cert and key are provided\nset msgtype by attachment's mime-type (received image -&gt; got rendered image in your matrix client; received audio -&gt; got audio player in your matrix client; etc)\n\nSource code, say hi in the #postmoogle:etke.cc room\n\nmatrix-hookshot (website)\nA multi purpose multi platform bridge, formerly known as matrix-github\nHalf-Shot says\n\nmatrix-hookshot 2.2.0 arrives with fewer bugs and more features!\nHello gang. This week, another hookshot release. They do come fast!\nWe've fixed a bug which had the potential to cause crashes when JSON logging is enabled, and written a whole torture test for the logger to ensure it won't do that again. We've also made some quality of life improvements to the GitLab connection type :)\nThe highlights are:\n\nReady/draft state changes for GitLab merge requests are now reported. (#480)\nMerge GitLab MR approvals and comments into one message. (#484)\n\nYou can get the latest release here\n\nBut I have a bit more for you this week, we're working on a few new features to hopefully improve the lives of developers out there building webhook integrations.\nFirst, we are adding the ability to view requests and logging from within the widget UI. This means you can now debug why your webhooks might not be working without\nhaving to leave your client. This includes the ability to log debug messages and read them back later!\n\nSecondly, we're adding some new sci-fi functions to the scripting environment. The first of which will allow you to embed images / videos into the message output, with a\nfunction to to create matrix content URLs from a regular URL.\nFinally, and this is probably the most sci-fi. We're working on a feature for you to load scripts from other rooms for use in your webhook. This means developers will be able to build\nwhole webhook handling libraries within rooms, and then share those libraries across the federation. At the moment, this looks a bit like:\nconst resultOfScript = await loadMatrixScript(\"matrix:r/my-room-alias:domain/$my-event-id\");\n// ... mutate the result\nreturn = resultOfScript\n\nWe're still thinking about how to ensure it's both performant, and safe but the initial results are looking quite good.\nThat's all we have for you in bridging corner today, have a good weekend 👋\n\nmatrix-appservice-kakaotalk (website)\nA Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.\nFair announces\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that the KakaoTalk service has been updated to block older clients, and unfortunately this bridge is affected.  As of this writing, using the bridge may get your KakaoTalk account banned!  It has happened to both me and at least one other person, so this isn't just a hypothetical risk.\nTo be clear about this, I've updated the master branch to throw an error on startup, which must be manually removed from source code if you wish to continue using the bridge at your own risk.\nIt's currently unknown what it takes to log in safely, but discussion about it is ongoing (albeit intermittently) in the discussion channel (linked below).\nOnce the bridge is safe to use again, I'll post a TWIM update about it 🙂\n\n\nDiscussion: #matrix-appservice-kakaotalk:miscworks.net \nTesting room: #kakaotalk-bridge-testing:miscworks.net / https://open.kakao.com/o/gjGQFuae\nIssue page: https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-appservice-kakaotalk/issues\n\n\nDept of Clients 📱\nQuadrix (website)\nA Minimal, simple, multi-platform chat client for the Matrix protocol.\nJFA says\n\nQuadrix v1.3.3 has been released! It's available for mobiles and desktops in the respective app stores. This release introduces:\n\n\na new menu structure making it easier to add new functions without affecting the main UI,\n\n\nnew page animations in the \"wide\" app layout (on desktops and tablets) when switching between rooms or going back to the home screen, and\n\n\nfor PinePhone enthusiasts, Wayland display on KDE and SXMO UI's (it was already available on Phosh).\n\n\nPlease leave feedback/comments at #quadrix:matrix.org or in the issues at https://github.com/alariej/quadrix (stars welcome :-)\n\nNeochat (website)\nA client for matrix, the decentralized communication protocol\nTobias Fella reports\n\n\nWill now show you the exact time a message was sent at when hovering over a message's timestamp (Thanks to James Graham)\nContext Menus will now open more reliably\nYou will also no longer see useless horizontal scrollbars\nThanks to the GSoC work by Snehit, NeoChat now has some support for spaces: at the top of the room list, you can select a space to make the room list only show rooms of that space\nAudio playback has been fixed\nA few problems relating to message input have been fixed, most notable that reply and edit texts will now only be visible in the correct room when multiple rooms are opened at the same time (Thanks to James Graham)\nQuitting NeoChat now is less crashy\nAdding custom emojis has been fixed (Thanks to Jan Bidler)\nLinks in spoilers will now be correctly hidden\nYou can now edit notification settings for each room (Thanks to James Graham)\nNeoChat will now better follow Kirigami's style of progress indicator and the system's color for text selection (Thanks to Bharadwaj Raju)\n\n\n\nEment.el (website)\nMatrix client for Emacs\nalphapapa announces\n\nEment.el, a Matrix client for GNU Emacs, has finally been published on the official GNU ELPA package repository. Now the current stable release can be installed by any Emacs user by simply using the command M-x package-install RET ement RET.  More improvements to come.

Come talk with us in #element-web:matrix.org!\nDanielle reports\n\n\nOn Web we’ve been working on perfecting the app and fixing bugs\nAlso in the roadmap and currently in development:\n\nUpdates to the composer. We’re working on improving the composer and creating a WYSIWYG version (What You See Is What You Get). Keep your eyes peeled for more info in the coming weeks!\nThere are also improvements to the ‘forgot password’ flow on their way. We made these same improvements to the mobile apps some weeks ago and received great feedback.\n\n\n\nIn labs (you can enable labs features in settings on develop.element.io or on Nightly):\n\nThreads work continues as 2 of our 3 MSCs make their way into their FCP (Final Comment Period). We’re excited to bring improvements to you and will be dropping them straight into the product as soon as they’re ready.\n\n\nElement iOS (website)\nSecure and independent communication for iOS, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-ios:matrix.org!\nȘtefan reports\n\n\nFollowing this week’s release of the new app layout we’re heads down reading feedback and looking for improvements. We hope you’re enjoying it as much as we are - use the Feedback button in the top-left to let us know! \nThe team is also making improvements on the next generation of the Element app for iOS (Element X). \n\nWe’re experimenting with merging together the sliding sync mechanism and the new timeline API. \nWe’ve added support for reactions, redactions, permalinks and replying, we have a new log out mechanism and soft logout, and we’ve also overhauled the UI.\n\n\n\n\nElement Android (website)\nSecure and independent communication for Android, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-android:matrix.org!\nDanielle reports\n\n\n\nNot only are we hard at work smashing bugs but we’re also working on 2 big updates for the coming releases:\n\nThe new app layout! While you can currently access this via Labs, we’re closing bugs and addressing feedback that will allow us to make it the default layout for all users. Check out more info here\nAlso coming up, starting a DM when the first message is sent. No more waiting around for the room to be created before you say hi to the recipients - your invite and message will be received together. Yey! :ta_da:\n\n\n\nWe’re also working on a fix for the bug that’s making verifying others difficult.\n\n\n\nDept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰\nmatrix-rust-sdk (website)\nNext-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM\nben reports\n\nMajor Milestone: yesterday Sliding Sync was merged into main, now available behind the sliding-sync-feature flag and enabled by default for matrix-sdk-ffi for your convenience. This, too, means the jack-in sliding sync-test client is merged and part of our labs section - go out and have a try! Furthermore the key verification for crypto-js has been merged, as well as support for logging out, including tracking the soft-logout state in FFI, and support for sending markdown from FFI,\nSimilarly the new Timeline API, is making big leaps forward, we expecting it to land, too. It will also be available behind a feature-flag replacing the previous experimental-timeline-feature. If you were using that, please pay close attention to what is going on, as it will replace most of if not all of the previous API and data store.\nBoth will be available, also together, in the upcoming release 0.6 of matrix-sdk, which we expect to land before the end of the month. It was slightly pushed back as the sync event changes turned out to be more of a rabbit hole than anticipated.\n👉 Wanna hack on matrix rust?

The counter of violations is also displayed as a reaction under each user message in the form: \"N ❗️\", where N is the number of violations.\nThe bot captures who added the signature or violation, when it happened and for what reason (description). All this can be asked from the bot by any member of the room\nThe user can add his own description, which the bot will report to any member of the room on the appropriate request.\nThe moderator can switch the language that the bot speaks in this room.

The study consists of a short questionnaire and a 30-60 minute interview about experiences with cross-app messaging (for example, privacy concerns related to differences between clients). The results will contribute an interpersonal perspective to the design of messaging interoperability and potentially influence future policy making.\nInterested in participating? Eligible participants should live within the EU and either:\na) Have frequent conversations on a Matrix.org client with contacts that use different Matrix.org clients (such as Element-FluffyChat) or\nb) Frequently use bridges between Matrix.org and other platforms (for example, using Beeper, or Element with bridges to Telegram, IRC, etc.) \nReach out directly to @lalider:matrix.org for questions and arranging an interview.

Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.\nMSC Status\nNew MSCs:\n\nMSC3895: Federation API Behaviour of Partial-State Resident Servers\n\nMSCs in Final Comment Period:\n\nMSC3856: Threads List API (merge)\nMSC3771: Read receipts for threads (merge)\n\nMerged MSCs:\n\nMSC3773: Notifications for threads\nMSC3715: Add a pagination direction parameter to /relations\n\nSpec Updates\nThe next major release of the spec is now just around the corner! The Spec Core Team expects to release Matrix v1.4 next week, so be on the look out for the announcement and blog post then! Highlights for v1.4 include Threads and Message Edits!\nReview this week from the Spec Core Team has once again mainly focused on Threads as we work towards getting it over the line (and to see client and homeserver implementations stablise). With fixes for notification issues and increased support for querying threads in a room for clients, we expect to see it land in v1.4!\nIn addition, MSC2676 has been merged to the spec (finally)! This means that it is now available in the unstable space and will be available in the next spec release. Congrats to all involved as it's been a particularly long-running MSC, and especially richvdh for pushing it over the line and writing up the spec bits, and TravisR for reviewing them.\nRandom MSC of the Week\nThe random MSC of the week is... MSC3265: Login and SSSS with a Single Password!\nThis MSC actually has a fairly detailed description right in the PR, so I encourage you to click through and see what it's all about!\n\n\nDept of GSoC 🎓️\nmatrix-cerberus\nkuries announces\n\nThe Google Summer of Code 2022 has officially ended this week and I'm proud to present the matrix-cerberus!\nIt's an application that has the ability to delegate membership of a room based on a user’s interaction with other third-party services.\nSome of the use cases could be:\n\nIf you have a \"team\" of developers under an organisation in GitHub and would like to create a room just for them. Then instead of sending manual invites or making the room public, you can just add the condition under a room in the matrix-cerberus admin panel and the app will invite all of them for you!\nManaging memberships for rooms where patrons belonging to a particular tier in a campaign have access.\n\n\nNote: Both of the cases would require the user to log in with matrix and the respective third-party service in our app.\n\nThe application is built using React (frontend), FastAPI (backend) and matrix-nio for the bot. The entire application is containerized with docker compose to reduce the effort required to set up all the services.\nCurrently, it has support for the following third-party services:\n\nGitHub\nPatreon\n\nThere's also an interesting feature in this app - Room External URL Invites. If you have one of these room external url invites you can just log in as a matrix user with our app and relevant invites will be issued.\nYou can find documentation related to the usage, installation and hosting over here.\nIf you want to play around with the app and see how it works you can check out the demo version of the app hosted here: https://cerberus.cadair.dev/\nAnd finally, if you have any queries and issues related to setting up or just want to discuss the app then feel free to join: https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-cerberus:cadair.com\n\nCadair adds\n\nWorth noting that the demo version of the app should only be used for experimenting, I make 0 promises for how long it will stay online for!\n\nDept of Servers 🏢\nConstruct\nJason Volk reports\n\nConstruct 0.8 has been rolling out with a set of performance improvements courtesy of the new io_uring(7) backend added to Boost ASIO on Linux platforms. These improvements were not truly necessary since Construct is already backed by a custom aio(7) implementation on Linux, but there's still a significant all-around improvement with io_uring. Users building on systems with boost 1.78+ will benefit from io_uring replacing the core epoll(2) event loop and networking. This has a significant impact for certain operations like sending messages to large rooms with lots of servers by greatly reducing the number of system calls. Users with boost 1.79+ get the added benefit of some local filesystem operations using the io_uring rather than aio. If your distribution ships an older version of Boost, rebuild Construct with the option --with-included-boost=1.80.0 to ./configure so you too can enjoy these benefits.\nFor questions or support don't forget to idle and perform #construct:zemos.net\n\nSynapse (website)\nSynapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team\nBrendan Abolivier reports\n\nThis week we've released not one, but two release candidates for Synapse 1.68. This Synapse version will be the first one to require a Rust compiler for installations from a source checkout. 1.68.0rc2 fixes an issue the previous RC had related to this change - so if you were bitten by Rust-related issues when trying out rc1, please try rc2! The minimum required version of Rust has also been set to 1.58 to make it easier for third-party packagers to package Synapse (it previously was 1.61).\nThanks a lot to everyone who help us by testing Synapse RCs and catching these issues early! Please report any feedback or bug in #synapse:matrix.org or the issue tracker, respectively 🙂\nIn other news, Synapse 1.68 will also be raising the minimum required version of SQLite to 3.27. If you're running a Synapse instance with SQLite, please make sure your environment is up to date!\n\nDendrite (website)\nSecond generation Matrix homeserver\nneilalexander reports\n\nThis week we released Dendrite 0.9.9 which contains some bug fixes and performance improvements — if you are running Dendrite then it is recommended to upgrade! Changes include:\n\nDendrite will now try to keep HTTP connections open to remote federated servers for a few minutes after a request and attempt to reuse those connections where possible\n\nThis should reduce the amount of time spent on TLS handshakes and often speed up requests to remote servers\nThis new behaviour can be disabled with the federation_api.disable_http_keepalives option if needed\n\n\nA number of dependencies have been updated\nA bug where the roomserver did not correctly propagate rewritten room state to downstream components (like the federation API and sync API) has been fixed, which could cause issues when performing a federated join to a previously left room\nEvent auth now correctly parses the join_authorised_via_users_server field in the membership event content\nDatabase migrations should no longer produce unique constraint errors at Dendrite startup\nThe origin of device list updates should now be populated correctly\nSend-to-device messages will no longer be dropped if we fail to publish them to specific devices\nThe roomserver query to find state after events will now always resolve state if there are multiple prev events\nThe roomserver will now return no memberships if querying history visibility for an event which has no state snapshot\nThe device list updater will now mark a device list as stale if a requesting device ID is not known\nTransactions sent to appservices should no longer have accidental duplicated transaction IDs (contributed by tak-hntlabs)\n\nAs always, please feel free to join us in #dendrite:matrix.org for more related discussion.\n\nDept of Bridges 🌉\nPostmoogle (website)\nAn Email to Matrix bridge. 1 room = 1 mailbox.\nAine announces\n\nPostfix Postmoogle v0.9.4\nalmost Postfix. The biggest change: you can use postmoogle to send emails from your apps, scripts and other tools using standard SMTP protocol (or Matrix Client Server API, if you wish so)\n\nsend emails in UTF-8 👋\nfix options descriptions\nadd SMTP auth\nallow sending emails from your apps and scripts using postmoogle as email provider\n\nSource code, say hi in #postmoogle:etke.cc \nPS: now I'm wondering - can you use postmoogle as SMTP server/relay in synapse? Send emails from matrix, using matrix backend, using matrix.... 😵‍💫\n\nDept of Clients 📱\nNheko (website)\nDesktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.\nNico reports\n\nWe completely redesigned how you can modify the access rules in a room. You now have a list of toggles to allow public access to a room, knocking and/or joining via a different room. You can also now edit what rooms you can access the current room via. By default the parent communities are in that list and you can enable joining via those using a toggle button, but you can also add other rooms in. This is helpful when you have a welcome room in a private community, but you still want people to be able to join the other community rooms after you explained the rules in the main room. We are still working on restructuring the room settings though, so that the new rules UI doesn't seem as out of place between the other settings.\n\nNheko now also shows you what community a room is in and allows you to switch to that community or join it if you haven't yet. This should make it easier to discover communities and related rooms. In this case too, we built the feature, but I am not happy yet with how it looks, so it might change in the future.\n\nq234rty also fixed sending messages using the Enter key, when an input method is active. We significantly shrunk our flatpak images (to almost a third) by using the upstream gstreamer again (which is recent enough in the recent runtimes now). Thanks to Forest users now have significantly more control over what Nheko logs when troubleshooting an issue and Hiers added an unread line to make it easier to find where you left off. (The blue line is the unread indicator, the names and avatars are just replaced with color boxes to protect the innocent.)\n\nAs you can see there were lots of new features that might need some time to figure out the UI, so feedback is welcome as always in #nheko:nheko.im.\n\nNeochat (website)\nA client for matrix, the decentralized communication protocol\nTobias Fella says\n\nThis week, Bharadwaj implemented showing link previews. While working on E2EE, support for showing stickers broke a while ago, which James now fixed. I (Tobias) finished the work on basic device verification; it will start working once libQuotient officially supports it. I also implemented support for reporting messages to the server admins.\n\n\n\nElement (website)\nEverything related to Element but not strictly bound to a client\nMatthew announces\n\nupcoming critical security update for matrix-{js,ios,android}-sdk on Wednesday Sept 28 at 16:00 UTC: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/23/pre-disclosure-upcoming-critical-security-release-of-matrix-sd-ks-and-clients\n\nElement Web/Desktop (website)\nSecure and independent communication, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-web:matrix.org!\nRobin says\n\nHi 👋 It's just the VoIP team this week, but we're excited to share that Element Call is on its way into the app! We've added an experimental implementation of Element Call video rooms in Labs, which you can try out on develop.element.io and Nightly, and are working on bringing native group calls to text rooms as well. Thanks to everyone who contributed to last week's community testing session, and please keep the feedback coming.\n\nElement iOS (website)\nSecure and independent communication for iOS, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-ios:matrix.org!\nȘtefan reports\n\n\nThis was a busy week in iOS land. Version 1.9.6 is now available on the AppStore and brings with it a lot of significant improvements: \n\nCrash fixes when logging out, previewing rooms or displaying the keyboard\nNew layout tweaks for when logging out and back in again\n\n\nWe also have made a lot of progress on ElementX:\n\nWe have successfully merged the sliding sync mechanism with the new timeline API\nWe have redesigned the home screen, the settings, the timeline bubbles, the message composer and more\nWe received support for local echoes\nWe have also had our first look at encryption working through sliding sync and the Rust SDK and it’s even more magical than expected\n\n\n\n\n\nElement Android (website)\nSecure and independent communication for Android, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-android:matrix.org!\nbenoit reports\n\n\nElement Android 1.5.0 will land on the stores soon. We finally decided to postpone the activation of the new App Layout by default, to give us some time to fix the remaining bugs. In this version there will be deferred DM creation on the first message, i.e. the DM will be created and the invite sent only when a first message is sent to the room.\nWe are working to fix our flaky tests.

Synapse\n1.68 just dropped,\nlet's have a look at what's inside.\nDependency changes\nAs announced in the Synapse 1.67 release\nannouncement, Synapse\n1.68 raises the minimum supported version of SQLite to version v3.27.0. This\nmeans that, if your installation of Synapse is using SQLite to manage its\ndatabase, and the SQLite version used is lower than 3.27, you will need to\nupgrade to a more recent version before updating to Synapse 1.68. This change does not impact deployments using the matrixdotorg/synapse Docker image. \nSynapse 1.68 also introduces the requirement of a Rust compiler for source\ncheckouts. The minimum required version of Rust is 1.58.1. Installations that\nuse pip install matrix-synapse, Debian packages from packages.matrix.org or\nthe matrixdotorg/synapse Docker image to manage and run Synapse, are not\nimpacted by this change.\nSee the upgrade\nnotes for more information.\nAdmin API improvements\nSynapse 1.68 introduces a new admin API which allows server administrators to\nquery events in a given room that have been sent within a specific time window.\nThis API mirrors the specification's /messages\nendpoint,\nand allows, among other things, paginating through a room's history. See the\ndocumentation for more information.\nThis version of Synapse also introduces a new admin API to help administrator of\nhomeservers using an external authentication provider. This endpoint allows\nlooking up a specific identifier on the authentication provider and resolving it\ninto the identifier of the local user it's associated with, if any. See the\ndocumentation for more information.\nThe user admin\nAPI\nhas also been updated to allow administrator of homeservers requiring agreement\nto the server's terms and\nconditions\nto view and edit the timestamp at which each user has provided their agreement.\nEverything else\nSynapse 1.68 greatly improves the validation of user input on most of the\naccount management API endpoints.\nThis version of Synapse also adds a new request_id_header option to the\nconfiguration of HTTP listeners, which allows tracking the identifier Synapse\ngenerates for each request in that request's response. This can be helpful for\ncorrelating Synapse logs with reverse proxy logs. See the\ndocumentation for more information.\nSee the full\nchangelog for a\ncomplete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the\nupgrade\nnotes\nfor this version.\nSynapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our\nthanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular\norder) Denis Kariakin, Dirk\nKlimpel and Beeper, as\nwell as anyone helping us make Synapse better by sharing their feedback and\nreporting issues.\n","id":"/blog/2022/09/27/synapse-1-68-released/","title":"Synapse 1.68 released"},"/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients/":{"body":"TL;DR:\n\nTwo critical severity vulnerabilities in end-to-end encryption were found in\nthe SDKs which power Element, Beeper, Cinny, SchildiChat, Circuli, Synod.im\nand any other clients based on matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk or\nmatrix-android-sdk2.\nThese have now been fixed, and we have not seen evidence of them being\nexploited in the wild. All of the critical vulnerabilities require\ncooperation from a malicious homeserver to be exploited.\nPlease upgrade immediately in order to be protected against these\nvulnerabilities.\nClients with other encryption implementations (including Hydrogen, ElementX,\nNheko, FluffyChat, Syphon, Timmy, Gomuks and Pantalaimon) are not affected;\nthis is not a protocol bug.\nWe take the security of our end-to-end encryption extremely seriously, and we\nhave an ongoing series of public independent audits booked to help guard\nagainst future vulnerabilities.  We will also be making some protocol changes\nin the future to provide additional layers of protection.\nThis resolves the pre-disclosure issued on September 23rd.\n\n\nHi all,\nRecently we have been hard at work investigating some subtle security\nvulnerabilities in certain implementations of Matrix's end-to-end encryption\nwhich were responsibly disclosed to us by researchers at Royal Holloway\nUniversity London, University of Sheffield and Brave Software. Two of these\nvulnerabilities are critical severity, in that they could allow malicious\nserver admins to attack their users, and are implementation bugs in clients\nusing matrix-js-sdk (e.g. Element Web) or implementations derived from\nmatrix-js-sdk, rather than protocol flaws. matrix-rust-sdk (and other 2nd/3rd\ngeneration SDKs) are not affected by these.  These vulnerabilities are fixed in\ntoday's release, and we are not aware of them having been exploited in the\nwild.\nIf you're using Element or an application that shares the same SDKs (Beeper,\nCinny, SchildiChat, Circuli, Synod.im) then please upgrade now. Do not perform\nverification with new devices until you have upgraded.\nWe'd like to thank the security researchers for investing significant time and\neffort into doing a deep dive to find these issues, and thus contributing\nmaterially to making Matrix more secure for the whole ecosystem.  Despite our\nbest efforts, there is always a risk of security issues in software, and we're\nvery glad to have identified and fixed these issues while also taking the\nopportunity to improve our vulnerability disclosure and coordinated upgrade\nprocess.\nPlease note that the critical severity issues are implementation issues in\nmatrix-js-sdk and derivatives, and are not protocol issues in Matrix. The\nlatest version of the researchers' paper that we've seen incorrectly presents\nElement as 'the reference Matrix client', and confuses the higher severity\nimplementation bugs with lower severity protocol critique.  This is very\nunfortunate, given Hydrogen, ElementX, Nheko, FluffyChat, Syphon, Timmy, Gomuks\nand Pantalaimon and other independent implementations are not affected. In\nfact, every client independently implemented using the Matrix spec seems to\nhave got it right, which speaks well of the protocol.  It's only the first\ngeneration SDK (predating the spec) and its derivatives which had these bugs.\nThe two critical severity issues lead to three attack scenarios, all of which\nare prevented by today's releases:\n\n\n\"Key/Device Identifier Confusion in SAS Verification\" – A bug existed in\nmatrix-js-sdk where it confused together device IDs and cross-signing keys\n(given under the hood, cross-signing keys are represented as devices). This\ncould be exploited by a malicious server admin to break emoji-based\nverification when cross-signing is in use, authenticating themselves rather\nthan the target user being verified. This bug is only present in\nmatrix-js-sdk (not iOS or Android SDKs), tracked as a critical severity CVE:\nCVE-2022-39250.\n\n\n\"Trusted Impersonation\" – matrix-js-sdk (and derived SDKs) suffered from\na protocol-confusion bug where it would incorrectly accept to-device messages\nencrypted by Megolm rather than Olm, attributing them to the Megolm sender\nrather than the actual sender. As a result, an attacker could fake the\ntrusted sender of to-device messages, allowing them to send fake to-device\nmessages to devices - e.g. fake keys to spoof historical messages from other\nusers.  This bug is tracked as a critical severity CVE: CVE-2022-39251\n(matrix-js-sdk), CVE-2022-39255 (matrix-ios-sdk) and CVE-2022-39248\n(matrix-android-sdk2).\n\n\n\"Malicious key backup\" – the above 'trusted impersonation' bug in\nmatrix-js-sdk (and derived SDKs) could be used by a malicious homeserver\nadmin to add a malicious key backup to the user's account under certain\nunusual conditions in order to exfiltrate message keys. While we are not\naware of this being exploited in the wild, out of an abundance of caution we\nrecommend checking your key backup settings. If you are particularly paranoid\nyou may wish to reset your online key backup.  This doesn't have a separate\nCVE, as the root cause is the same as \"Trusted Impersonation\".\n\n\nThree lower priority issues were also identified by the researchers:\n\n\n\"Semi-trusted Impersonation\" – matrix-js-sdk (and derived SDKs) accepted keys\nforwarded by other users, even if your client didn't request them. As\na result, a malicious server admin could fake an encrypted message to look as\nif it was sent from a given user on that server. However, impersonated\nmessages like this are clearly marked  by clients like Element with a clear\n\"The authenticity of this encrypted message can't be guaranteed\" warning\n– which is why we consider this low severity. That said, it's an avoidable\nattack, and we've fixed this by ensuring that clients don't accept 'unsafe'\nkeys (with the exception of keys forwarded when you invite a user to an\nexisting conversation).  In future, in Olm/Megolm v2 we're also linking\nkey-sending events to the underlying recipient Olm identity to ensure that\nkeys cannot be misappropriated.  This issue is tracked as a moderate severity\nCVE: CVE-2022-39249 (matrix-js-sdk), CVE-2022-39257 (matrix-ios-sdk) and\nCVE-2022-39246 (matrix-android-sdk2).\n\n\n\"Homeserver Control of Room Membership\" – A malicious homeserver can fake\ninvites on behalf of its users to invite malicious users into their\nconversations, or add malicious devices into its users accounts.  However,\nwhen this happens, we clearly warn the user: if you have verified the users\nyou are talking to, the room and user will be shown with a big red cross to\nmark if malicious devices have been added.  Similarly, if an unexpected user\nis invited to a conversation, all users can clearly see and take evasive\naction.  Therefore we consider this a low severity issue.  That said, this\nbehaviour can be improved, and we've started work on switching our trust\nmodel to trust-on-first-use (so that new untrusted devices are proactively\nexcluded from conversations, even if you haven't explicitly verified their\nowner) - and we're also looking to add cryptographic signatures to membership\nevents in E2EE rooms to stop impersonated invites.  These fixes will land\nover the coming months.\n\n\n\"IND-CCA break\" – Matrix's usage of AES-CTR to encrypt attachments, secrets\nand symmetric key backups is not \"IND-CCA2 secure\", because it does not\ninclude the AES initialisation vector within the hash used to secure the\npayload from tampering. As a result, if an attacker could observe the result\nof both a given encryption and a given decryption operation, it would be\npossible to extract the encryption private key. However, this is a purely\ntheoretical attack as Matrix does not provide a way to mount the attack. In\nthe future, we will fix our use of AES-CTR to include the IV within the hash.\n\n\nWe'd like to again thank Martin R. Albrecht and Dan Jones from the Information\nSecurity Group at Royal Holloway University London, Benjamin Dowling from\nSecurity of Advanced Systems Group, University of Sheffield and Sofía Celi from\nBrave Software for discovering these issues and responsibly disclosing them to\nus, and then working with us to agree on an extended disclosure window given\nthe amount of work needed to verify and ship fixes throughout Matrix over the\ncourse of the summer period.  We welcome any further formal security analysis\nwork, and hope that it will distinguish clearly between Matrix-the-protocol and\nMatrix implementations like matrix-js-sdk, rather than conflating them. You can\nread their full paper here.\nWe'd also like to thank all the downstream Element package maintainers,\ndownstream forks and other affected clients for working together under time\nconstraints for this coordinated release - your patience and understanding is\nvery much appreciated indeed.\nMeanwhile, we are taking extreme measures to avoid future E2EE vulnerabilities.\nYou will notice that matrix-rust-sdk, hydrogen-sdk and other 2nd and 3rd\ngeneration SDKs were not affected by the bugs at the root cause of the critical\nissues here. This is precisely why we have been working on replacing the\nfirst generation SDKs with a clean, carefully written Rust implementation in\nthe form of matrix-rust-sdk, complete with an ongoing independent public audit.\nWe started the process of auditing matrix-rust-sdk with the Least Authority\nvodozemac audit in May, and we have three more audits agreed\n– covering matrix-rust-sdk-crypto, matrix-rust-sdk, and a whole reference\nMatrix stack.  Ironically, the mitigation work for these vulnerabilities in the\nlegacy SDKs has severely impacted our timelines for finishing\nmatrix-rust-sdk-crypto work (in fact, we had to push back the Least Authority\naudit of matrix-rust-sdk-crypto given the\nburndown has not\nprogressed), but we will be shifting to the new audited codebase as rapidly as\nwe possibly can.\nOver the coming months we will also introduce our first ever major version\nupdate of Olm and Megolm, in order to fix the MAC truncation issue highlighted\nin the vodozemac audit (Issue J), and reduce the risk of further\nkey-forwarding issues (as per the \"Semi-trusted Impersonation\" vulnerability\nabove). New conversations will default to using v2 of Olm/Megolm for security,\nand existing conversations can be optionally upgraded (similar to a 'room\nversion' upgrade in Matrix today). We are also adding extensive end-to-end\ntesting using Polyjuice and Traffic\nLight to stress-test encryption\nand improve reliability.\nFinally, we will continue our research into layering Matrix over Messaging\nLayer Security (MLS) - the IETF proposed standard for interoperable end-to-end\nencrypted group messaging.  This work has been delayed by the mitigation\nactivity above, but otherwise it's making good progress and we're excited to\nsee how Decentralised MLS performs in reality against Olm+Megolm v2.\nWe'd like to apologise to the wider Matrix community for the inconvenience and\ndisruption of these issues, and thank you for your patience while we've\nresolved them.\nMatthew, Denis and the Matrix cryptography &amp; security teams.\n","id":"/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients/","title":"Upgrade now to address E2EE vulnerabilities in matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk2"},"/blog/2022/09/29/matrix-v-1-4-release/":{"body":"Hey all,\nIt’s finally here: threads, edits, and private read receipts. v1.4 has been a little later than usual in the quarter because we wanted to make sure we nailed down all the core MSCs for threads before publishing the spec itself, but we’ve done that now and we’re excited about it.\n\nMatrix 1.3 was just over 3 months ago, though with the relatively large features there and the colossal implementation effort of v1.4 we’re not expecting everyone to have implementations on day 1. Instead, as with all spec releases, we encourage implementations to gradually update over the next few months. We’re additionally planning to make v1.5 (Q4 2022) more of a maintenance update to help make the backlog a bit easier on everyone, though we might prioritize a couple cool features in there too :)\nMatrix 1.4 sees 14 MSCs get merged, but we can’t possibly go into detail on them all here. We’ve instead focused on the 3 major features we’re excited about - check out the changelog at the end for the full picture.\n🧵 Threads\nThreads, a critical feature in terms of parity with other chat systems, have landed thanks to a whopping 6 MSCs: MSC3440, MSC3816, MSC3856, MSC3715, MSC3771, and MSC3773. It’s been a lot of iteration on the reference implementations to get threads this far, and we’re excited to see how the client implementations evolve to provide more structured and less noisy communication for everyone - keep us updated with TWIM posts, please!\nThreads have involved changes to event relationships (which were fixed in v1.3), read receipts, and notification counts, resulting in several different models and ways of solving the problem. We think we’ve reached a point that works for conversational threads, though there’s work on the horizon for threads-only rooms, Twitter-style free-form threads, etc to cover more needs of users.\nCurrently, the demonstration implementation of threads in Synapse and Element is working its way out of the proof-of-concept and beta stages (which were sufficient to validate the MSCs) and are on their way to exiting beta. Keep an eye on the respective blogs for news about production-ready threads!\n📝 Edits\nSimilar to reactions, err, aggregations, MSC2676 and its predecessors have been around for a long while. Edits have existed in the Element clients seemingly forever, and other clients have had troubles trying to implement the same feature: with it now in the spec, it should be a lot easier to bring edits into clients.\nFor edits, we’ve taken the route of making the MSC match reality, for better or worse. MSCs which improve or add functionality to the system are very much welcome - writing an MSC is relatively easy and helps the whole community.\n👥 Private read receipts\nNot everyone wants to broadcast that they’ve read a message, but also with read receipts tied into notifications those same people also probably don’t want stuck notifications. To address the problem, we’ve added a new m.read.private receipt type which behaves exactly like m.read, but is only visible to you.\nWe still have a rework of the notifications system in our long-term plan, but this should hopefully cover the privacy concerns for the time being :)\nThe full changelog\nMSCs are how the spec changes in the way it does - adding, fixing, and maintaining features for the whole ecosystem to use. The blog post can’t cover them all, but that doesn’t make them any less important!

On one hand, we consider it to be a low severity issue because we warn users when unexpected devices or users join an E2EE room (if you have verified users; if you haven’t verified all bets are off anyway). On the other hand, many in the cryptography community consider this a serious misdesign. Eitherway, it’s avoidable behaviour and we’re ramping up work now to address it by signing room memberships so the clients control membership rather than the server.\n\nThib adds\n\nFor a balanced coveraged of the vulnerability, see the following articles:\n\nMatrix.org Foundation — Upgrade now to address E2EE vulnerabilities in matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk2\nThe original paper — Practically-exploitable Cryptographic Vulnerabilities in Matrix\nars technica — Serious vulnerabilities in Matrix’s end-to-end encryption have been patched\n\n\nDept of Spec 📜\nAndrew Morgan (anoa) reports\n\nHere's your weekly spec update!

Check it out!\nRandom MSC of the Week\nThe random MSC of the week is... MSC2596: Proposal to always allow rescinding invites!\nWhen you invite a user to a room in Matrix, you send a membership state event of \"invite\" with their Matrix ID as a state key. This requires a high enough power level to \"invite\" users. If you would like to rescind this invite, you would send a second membership state event of \"leave\". A separate power level is required to the do the latter.\nThere is an edge case whereas if you have the power level required to invite a user, but not set their membership to \"leave\" (aka kicking them), then you wind up not being able to rescind an invite. This can be unwelcome, especially if you accidentally invited a user.\nThis MSC aims to define rescinding an invite as a special case, with separate power level logic from the generic \"set a user's membership to 'leave'\" action - allowing anyone to rescind an invite they sent regardless of their current power level.\nSeems useful to me! If this is something that bothers you, feel free to weigh in on the proposal with feedback.\n\n\njaller94 says\n\nMatrix Spec v1.4 for Dash and Zeal\nI've updated the Dash/Zeal Docset which you can use to read the Matrix Spec offline.\nLink to the new Docset: https://chrpaul.de/dash/Matrix-docset-1.4-1.tgz\nIf you use Dash or Zeal, give it a try. Let me know, if you find pages that are not working. I hope that Matrix will be included in their list of user-contributed docsets.\nProject on Gitlab.com\nNote, this is not an official release distribution of the Matrix Spec. Enjoy at your own risk of this breaking or not getting updated.\n\nDept of Servers 🏢\nSliding Sync Proxy\nKegan says\n\nThe sliding sync proxy has seen a number of massive architectural changes to support horizontal scaling in a kubernetes-like environment. The intention is to run a version of this scalable proxy to support expected user loads on matrix.org.\n\n\nThis is currently a work in progress, but the majority of the work is now complete, so watch this space! To get a high-level overview of the changes, take a look at the scaling design doc.\n\nSynapse (website)\nSynapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team\nShay announces\n\nHello all. Synapse team has been hard at work, and just released v1.68.0. As mentioned last week, this will be the\nfirst version to require Rust. Some other notable features are:\n\nAdd an admin API endpoint to fetch messages within a particular window of time.\nAdd an admin API endpoint to find a user based on their external ID in an auth provider.\nPlus a host of bugfixes, internal changes to speed up Synapse 🚀(including work on faster joins-stay tuned as this is quickly approaching), improvements to the documentation, and more. Check it out here!: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/27/synapse-1-68-released\n\n\nDendrite (website)\nSecond generation Matrix homeserver\nneilalexander reports\n\nThis week we released Dendrite 0.10.0 which contains a number of significant improvements and fixes. If you are running a Dendrite server, please upgrade! Changes include:\n\nHigh performance full-text searching has been added to Dendrite\n\nSearch must be enabled in the search section of the sync_api config before it can be used\nThe search index is stored on the filesystem rather than the sync API database, so a path to a suitable storage location on disk must be configured\n\n\nSync requests should now complete faster and use considerably less database connections as a result of better transactional isolation\nThe notifications code has been refactored to hopefully make notifications more reliable\nA new /_dendrite/admin/refreshDevices/{userID} admin endpoint has been added for forcing a refresh of a remote user's device lists without having to modify the database by hand\nA new /_dendrite/admin/fulltext/reindex admin endpoint has been added for rebuilding the search index (although this may take some time)\nA number of bugs in the device list updater have been fixed, which should help considerably with federated device list synchronisation and E2EE reliability\nA state resolution bug has been fixed which should help to prevent unexpected state resets\nThe deprecated \"origin\" field in events will now be correctly ignored in all cases\nRoom versions 8 and 9 will now correctly evaluate \"knock\" join rules and membership states\nA database index has been added to speed up finding room memberships in the sync API (contributed by PiotrKozimor)\nThe client API will now return an M_UNRECOGNIZED error for unknown endpoints/methods, which should help with client error handling\nA bug has been fixed when updating push rules which could result in database is locked on SQLite\n\nAs always, please feel free to join us in #dendrite:matrix.org for more related discussion.\n\nDept of Clients 📱\nSmallTalk (website)\nMinimal Android messenger powered by Matrix\nadam reports\n\nA lightweight Android matrix client, focused on family and friends messaging.\nIt's been a while since the last TWIM update, development is still progressing and the app is still small (1.84mb~ when delivered via app bundle)!\nSome of the bigger recent highlights -\n\nMaterial You theme\nNotifications overhaul - adding support for UnifiedPush, consistent ping rules and a first pass at invitations.\nAttaching or sharing images.\nA FOSS variant hosted on IzzySoft's F-Droid repository.\nAutomatic Monday &amp; Thursday release trains.\nA separate repository for feature requests\n\nThere's still a few big features missing like room history, verification and a form of markdown support but if you're feeling brave SmallTalk is in the it's kinda usable phase, links below for trying it out!\n| Google Play Beta | F-Droid via IzzySoft | Repository | Matrix room |\n\nQuadrix (website)\nA Minimal, simple, multi-platform chat client for the Matrix protocol.\nJFA reports\n\nQuadrix v1.3.6 has been released and is available for mobiles and desktops in the respective app stores (the iOS version is still awaiting approval).\nThe release brings bug fixes, \"under the hood\" improvements, with upgrades to React 18 and React-Native 0.70, and also two new features:\n\nA floating \"Send\" button just above the virtual keyboard on mobile devices, useful especially on larger phones.\nAn information button on the main screen, for now only used to inform users that a new app version is available.\n\nPlease leave feedback/comments at #quadrix:matrix.org or in the issues at https://github.com/alariej/quadrix (stars welcome :-)\n\nNheko (website)\nDesktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.\nNico reports\n\nNheko version 0.10.2 is out now.\nThis is a security release!\nA malicious homeserver could intercept the secrets requests after a verification or when clicking the button for it in the settings and poison the cached secrets in Nheko. This could in theory be used to mark some devices as cross-signed over federation that weren't or to attack the online key backup as such this is fairly high severity.\nTo protect against this update to 0.10.2 or don't do any verifications of your own devices while on a vulnerable version (and don't hit the request buttons in the settings).\nThanks goes out to the matrix.org team for disclosing this!\n\nNico announces\n\nAs mentionedin the security update earlier, we had a small security release on Wednesday. As part of that we requested our first CVE. While security issues are never something you want to have, this still feels like a major milestone for Nheko. It is certainly not something I even imagined when I started contributing to Nheko and yet here we are. I'd like to thank everyone who made this security release as seamless as it was and I appreciate that all of you were as understanding as you were! I certainly don't take that for granted! But now on to some more fun stuff:\nNheko now has crude support for threading. This means you can start and participate in a thread and replies automatically land in a thread by default. Threads are also now marked in the timeline. Noticeably are ways to filter down the timeline to a specific thread, which will be added at a later date. This now makes Nheko technically implement all new features of Matrix 1.4 in some way or another.\nNheko now also allows you to edit permissions in a community and all the rooms in the community at once as long as you have permission to do so. This should make managing larger communities much easier. As part of that we now also try to handle rate limits more gracefully.\nWe also upgraded our codebase to some subset of C++20. The major blocker there is Apple, who only implements a very tiny subset of C++20 features at this time (even though they default to C++23...). As part of that we also made our Apple codesigning much more robust and widened our build testing matrix.\n\nFractal (website)\nMatrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.\nJulian Sparber announces\n\nThis week we tagged Fractal as 5.alpha1. This is our first release since Fractal has been rewritten to take advantage of GTK 4 and the Matrix Rust SDK. It is the result of eighteen months of work.\nCurrently supported features are:\n\nSending and receiving messages and files\nSending files via Drag-n-Drop and pasting in the message entry\nRendering of rich formatted (HTML) messages, as well as media\nDisplaying edited messages, redacting messages\nShowing and adding reactions\nTab completion of user names\nSending and displaying replies\nSharing the current location\nExploring the room directory\nSorting the rooms by category\nJoining rooms\nSending and accepting invitations\nLogging into multiple accounts at once\nLogging in with Single-Sign On\nSending and reading encrypted messages\nVerifying user sessions using cross-signing\nExporting and importing encryption keys\nManaging the connected devices\nChanging the user profile details\nDeactivating the account\n\nMajor missing features are:\n\nNotifications\nRead markers\n\nAs the name implies, this is still considered alpha stage and is not ready for general use just yet. If you want to give this development version a try, you can get it from the GNOME Apps Nightly flatpak repository.\nA list of known issues and missing features for a 5.0 release can be found in the Fractal v5 milestone on Gitlab.\nWe also published a blogpost about the security quick scan performed by Radically Open Security as part of the NLnet grant https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2022/09/27/fractal-security-audit/\n\n\n\nEment.el (website)\nMatrix client for Emacs\nalphapapa says\n\nEment.el, a Matrix client for GNU Emacs, has been updated to version 0.3.  It can be installed directly from GNU ELPA with the command M-x package-install RET ement RET.\nSince the last announcement on TWIM, the following improvements have been made.  The most notable is the addition of the ement-directory commands that allow listing and searching public room directories.\nAdditions\n\nCommand ement-directory shows a server's room directory.\nCommand ement-directory-search searches a server's room directory.\nCommand ement-directory-next fetches the next batch of rooms in a directory.\nCommand ement-leave-room accepts a FORCE-P argument (interactively, with prefix) to leave a room without prompting.\nCommand ement-forget-room accepts a FORCE-P argument (interactively, with prefix) to also leave the room, and to forget it without prompting.\nOption ement-notify-mark-frame-urgent-predicates marks the frame as urgent when (by default) a message mentions the local user or \"@room\" and the message's room has an open buffer.\n\nChanges\n\nRead receipts are re-enabled.\nWhen determining whether a room is considered unread, non-message events like membership changes, reactions, etc. are ignored.  This fixes a bug that caused certain rooms that had no message events (like some bridged rooms) to appear as unread when they shouldn't have.\nThe ement-taxy-room-list view no longer automatically refreshes the list if the region is active in the buffer.  (This allows the user to operate on multiple rooms without the contents of the buffer changing before completing the process.)\nMinor improvements to date/time headers.\n\nFixes\n\nLinks to only rooms (as opposed to links to events in rooms) may be activated to join them.\nRead receipts mark the last completely visible event (rather than one that's only partially displayed).\nPrevent error when a room avatar image fails to load.\nInfo manual export filename.\nCommand ement-describe-room for rooms without topics.\nImprove insertion of old messages around existing timestamp headers.\nReduce D-Bus notification system check timeout to 2 seconds (from the default of 25).\nCompatibility with Emacs 27.\n\n\nElement Web/Desktop (website)\nSecure and independent communication, connected via Matrix.

Element Call rooms are available on develop.element.io so be sure to check it out.\n\nHead to; Settings → Labs → Enable Video Rooms Beta, and then enable Element Call video rooms.\n\n\nWe’re progressing on a new WYSIWYG composer. You’ll be able to avoid markdown (if you want) to craft and preview messages before sending them.\nUpdates are being made on the new device manager, including the ability to rename sessions. The whole thing’s is a lot simpler\nThere’s also a fix for the missing dot on the notification panel. The bell in the top right should now let you know if you have something new. 🔔\n\n\nElement iOS (website)\nSecure and independent communication for iOS, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-ios:matrix.org!\nȘtefan says\n\n\nWe’ve released a security update this week, more info here. Please make sure to upgrade.\nThere’s been several other bug fixes in iOS this week, including:\n\nFixed the flashing spinner when trying to view media attachments\nFixed crash on iPad when you click sign out or invite to element\n\n\nWe’ve started hearing that performance of the iOS is decreasing - research has started and we’ll be doing what we can!\n\n\nElement Android (website)\nSecure and independent communication for Android, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-android:matrix.org!\nManu says\n\n\nWe’ve released a security update this week, more info here. Please make sure to upgrade.\nThere’s exciting work happening on deferring DM creation until the first message is sent. \nAlso, improvements have been made to the new app layout. It’s available in Labs today but will be the default from the next release so be sure to check it out and let us know what you think?\n\n\nElement (website)\nEverything related to Element but not strictly bound to a client\nDanielle announces\n\nThere have been security releases across our platforms this week; please make sure to upgrade to the following versions:\n\nElement Web/Desktop 1.11.8 or later\nElement Android 1.5.1 or later\nElement iOS 1.9.7 or later\n\nThe upgrades resolve two critical severity vulnerabilities in end-to-end encryption found in the SDKs which power Element, Beeper, Cinny, SchildiChat, Circuli, Synod.im and any other clients based on matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk or matrix-android-sdk2.\nThe issues are fixed by the upgrades. Neither Element or Matrix have seen any evidence of them being exploited in the wild.\nFor the full background on the update, visit the Matrix blog post.\n\nCinny (website)\nCinny is a Matrix client focused on simplicity, elegance and security\nLozenge announces\n\nCinny v2.2.2\n*-----------\nIn this release we have bumped matrix-js-sdk to v20.0.0 as being a user of SDK, Cinny was affected with vulnerabilities found in it. So please make sure you are using Cinny v2.2.2 or higher.\nApart from that, this release also fixes some issues with markdown, crash on leaving space, and improves View source of events.\nSince we are talking about vulnerabilities, since v2 we have also taken zero vulnerable dependency approach and reduced vulnerable npm packages from 18 to just 3. We are working on 3 as well but good thing is that they are just dev dependencies so production builds doesn't include them.\nLastly, if you like you know more about Cinny, join our Matrix space: https://matrix.to/#/#cinny-space:matrix.org or see: https://cinny.in\n\nDept of Non Chat Clients 🎛️\nThirdroom (website)\nA browser-based open metaverse client\nRobert Long says\n\nHey everyone! We just launched Third Room Tech Preview 1! 3D decentralized virtual worlds built on Matrix! Go check it out: https://thirdroom.io\n\nDept of Widgets 🧩\nmatrix-widget-api\nDominik Henneke reports\n\nWe from Nordeck added support for retrieving related events in Widgets into the matrix-widget-api over the last weeks. With the existing APIs we could not reliable read all the data from the room, as the room timeline is lazily loaded in Element. To learn more about the issue, have a look at the related MSC. With this weeks Element release 1.11.6 this feature has now landed. The change improves using the room as a data storage for Matrix Widgets, which allows us to build cool tools. We keep you updated when we publish our widgets as Open Source.\n\nDept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰\nmatrix-rust-sdk (website)\nNext-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM\nben reports\n\nThe Matrix Rust SDK team is proud to announce, that we've released a new version of the SDK to the public: You can get the latest matrix-sdk 0.6.0 (and its subcrates) on crates.io since Wednesday, matrix-sdk-crypto-nodejs 0.1.0-beta.2 via npm since Thursday. Please note that this is a breaking release, with a quite few public API changes, that will probably break your build if you don't change your code for that. You can find broad list and a troubleshooting guide, helping you adapt your code to common errors you'll see in the Upgrade Guide provided. This also marks the first release, we have sliding-sync available behind a feature-flag for testing (note, that it doesn't yet support extensions for to-device messages or E2EE)If you are using latest main, be aware that most deprecated functions are going to be removed soon, as well as the previous experimental-timeline, which will be replaced by the next generation.\nAs you can imagine the release preparation and last minute fixes to bugs have been the main focus for the team that last two weeks. Most notably, we have fixed a nasty deserialization bug in encrypted to-device messages we found while experimenting with the [upcoming sliding sync extensions] and had to revert the changes to have join and leave return full room-types as that caused internal state inconsistencies, which we have to rework our architecture for to support proper.\n️ Wanna hack on matrix rust?

It's about exploring Matrix clients.\nThe concept is simple: For the month of October, only use Matrix clients that you don't normally use.\nI have gotten stuck in my ways - using the same Matrix client for years on end.\nWhen I was at the Matrix Community Summit in Berlin, I discovered that there are actually many mature clients, with distinct differences and advantages.\nSo, in order to break up my habits a little, I'm going to force myself to not use my daily-driver client for the month of October.\nI hope some of you want to join me! To that end, I set up a room for this project, to share our discoveries and frustrations, and compare experiences.\nJoin the room here: #other-clients-october:olli.ng\n\nDept of Guides 🧭\nPaul reports\n\nI wrote a small blog post about a bot that demonstrates the use of polls as menu-driven bot interaction.

This means that Matrix is open to exchanging data and messages with other platforms using an Open Standard. We refer to the connection to other platforms as bridging.\nFor a thorough examination of the different methods of bridging, and a discussion of the terminology involved, check out How do I bridge thee? Let me count the ways...\nPortal rooms: these control chunks of room aliases namespace. For example, #freenode_#channelname:matrix.org corresponds to #channelname on Freenode. In this way, Matrix users can transparently join IRC channels on Freenode. Portal rooms are typically managed by the remote network's side of the room.\nPlumbed rooms: these rooms are \"plumbed\" into one or more specific remote rooms by configuring a bridge (which can be run by anyone). For instance, #matrix:matrix.org is plumbed into #matrix on Freenode, matrixdotorg/#matrix on Slack, etc. Access control for Matrix users is necessarily managed by the Matrix side of the room. This is useful for using Matrix to link together different communities.\nBridgebot-style: in this case, messages in either direction are conveyed by a bot residing on the given platform. This is a sub-optimal experience because metadata is lost. For example, all messages might be sent by the same bot, but with the message text prefixed with the name of the original sender.\nPuppeting: solves the problems of Bot-based bridging by \"puppeting\", meaning controlling, a user on the other side of the bridge. This means that to native users, they see messages as being sent from the correct sender. Double-puppeting means this is done in both directions of the bridge. This is the most preferred way of implementing a Matrix bridge.\n","id":"/ecosystem/bridges/","title":"Bridges"},"/ecosystem/clients/":{"body":"\nClients are needed to chat using Matrix.\nHere is a selection of the most mature ones you can safely use.\n","id":"/ecosystem/clients/","title":"Clients"},"/ecosystem/hosting/":{"body":"","id":"/ecosystem/hosting/","title":"Hosting"},"/ecosystem/sdks/":{"body":"","id":"/ecosystem/sdks/","title":"SDKs"},"/ecosystem/servers/":{"body":"","id":"/ecosystem/servers/","title":"Servers"},"/podcasts/":{"body":"","id":"/podcasts/","title":"Podcasts"},"/try-matrix/":{"body":"To be filled with content\n","id":"/try-matrix/","title":"Try Matrix"}},"docInfo":{"/":{"body":0,"title":0},"/about/":{"body":1084,"title":1},"/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"/blog/2022/":{"body":0,"title":0},"/blog/2022/09/":{"body":0,"title":0},"/blog/2022/09/02/synapse-1-66-released/":{"body":262,"title":3},"/blog/2022/09/02/this-week-in-matrix-2022-09-02/":{"body":2182,"title":5},"/blog/2022/09/09/this-week-in-matrix-2022-09-09/":{"body":1650,"title":5},"/blog/2022/09/13/security-release-of-matrix-appservice-irc-0-35-0-high-severity/":{"body":90,"title":8},"/blog/2022/09/14/synapse-1-67-released/":{"body":232,"title":3},"/blog/2022/09/16/this-week-in-matrix-2022-09-16/":{"body":1724,"title":5},"/blog/2022/09/23/pre-disclosure-upcoming-critical-security-release-of-matrix-sd-ks-and-clients/":{"body":129,"title":9},"/blog/2022/09/23/this-week-in-matrix-2022-09-23/":{"body":1761,"title":5},"/blog/2022/09/27/announcing-third-room-tech-preview-1/":{"body":35,"title":6},"/blog/2022/09/27/synapse-1-68-released/":{"body":262,"title":3},"/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients/":{"body":1061,"title":14},"/blog/2022/09/29/matrix-v-1-4-release/":{"body":770,"title":3},"/blog/2022/09/30/this-week-in-matrix-2022-09-30/":{"body":2298,"title":5},"/docs/":{"body":2,"title":1},"/ecosystem/":{"body":3,"title":2},"/ecosystem/bots/":{"body":0,"title":1},"/ecosystem/bridges/":{"body":156,"title":1},"/ecosystem/clients/":{"body":11,"title":1},"/ecosystem/hosting/":{"body":0,"title":1},"/ecosystem/sdks/":{"body":0,"title":1},"/ecosystem/servers/":{"body":0,"title":1},"/podcasts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"/try-matrix/":{"body":2,"title":2}},"length":28},"lang":"English"};
