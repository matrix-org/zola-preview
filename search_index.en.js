evolution of Matrix is managed through an open governance process, looked\nafter by The Matrix.org Foundation - a non-profit UK Community Interest Company, \nincorporated to act as the neutral guardian of the standard on behalf of the \nwhole Matrix community.\nThe Foundation defines the manifesto, mission and values of the project, the\nopen governance process that determines how the specification develops, and\nprovides a safety-net to ensure the project stays independent and true to its\ngoals. The constitution of the project is defined in the Foundation's legal\nArticles of Association and Rules, and is enforced by the Guardians of Matrix:\nthe directors of the Foundation appointed to provide a balance of independent\nexperts and the founding Matrix team to ensure the project stays on track.\nThe Guardians\nThe Guardians are the legal directors of the non-profit Foundation, and are\nresponsible for ensuring that the Foundation (and by extension the Spec Core\nTeam) keeps on mission and neutrally protects the development of Matrix.\nGuardians are typically independent of the commercial Matrix ecosystem and may\neven not be members of today's Matrix community, but are deeply aligned with\nthe mission of the project. Guardians are selected to be respected and trusted\nby the wider community to uphold the guiding principles of the Foundation and\nkeep the other Guardians honest.\nIn alphabetical order:\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n            Prof. Jon Crowcroft\n            Jon Crowcroft is the Marconi Professor of Communications Systems in the Computer Lab at the University of Cambridge, and the Turing Institute. Jon is a pioneer in the field of decentralised communication, and a fellow of the Royal Society, the ACM, the British Computer Society, the Institution of Engineering and Technology, the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. (He also supervised Matthew on building a pre-Matrix instant messaging system at Cambridge, and complained that it wasn’t decentralised enough!)\n\n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n            Matthew Hodgson\n            Matthew is technical co-founder of Matrix, and CEO/CTO of New Vector - the company formed in 2017 to let the core Matrix dev team work on Matrix full-time as their day job. He came up with the idea of Matrix with Amandine in 2013 while they were running Amdocs’ Unified Communication unit. He has a degree in Physics &amp; Computer Science from the University of Cambridge.\n\n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n            Amandine Le Pape\n            Amandine is co-founder of Matrix, and COO of New Vector. She previously ran the business side of Amdocs’ UC unit with Matthew. She has an engineering degree in Telecoms, Electronics and Computer Science and uses it most to translate the technicalities of Matrix to humans and businesses, and make sure we keep the users at heart when making decisions!\n\n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n            Ross Schulman\n            Ross Schulman is a senior counsel and senior policy technologist at New America’s Open Technology Institute, where he focuses on internet measurement, emerging technologies, surveillance, and decentralization. Prior to joining OTI, Ross worked for Google. Ross brings a unique perspective as a tech- and decentralisation-savvy lawyer to the Foundation, as well as being one of the first non-developers in the Matrix community to run his own homeserver. Ross has been known to walk around Mozfest clutching a battery-powered Synapse in a box, promoting decentralised communication for all.\n\n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n            Dr. Jutta Steiner\n            As co-founder and CEO of Parity Technologies, Dr. Jutta Steiner is dedicated to building a better internet - Web 3.0 - where users’ privacy &amp; control come first. Parity Technologies is a leader in the blockchain space – known to many as the creator of one of the most popular Ethereum clients, it is also the creator of two ambitious new blockchain technlogies, Polkadot and Substrate, that make it easier to experiment and innovate on scalability, encryption and governance.\n\nParity Technologies have been pioneering Matrix enterprise use since the moment they decided to rely on Matrix for their internal and external communication back in 2016 and now run their own high-volume deployment, with end-to-end encryption enabled by default. Jutta represents organisations who are professionally dependent on Matrix day-to-day, as well as bringing her unique experiences around decentralisation and ensuring that Web 3.0 will be a fair web for all.\n\n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nLegal Details\n\nThe Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C is registered in the UK as Company \n#11648710\nThe official articles of association of the Foundation may be\ndownloaded here\nThe official Rules for the Foundation may be downloaded here\n\nThe Rules of the Foundation\nThe Foundation is governed by two sets of documents - its Articles of\nAssociation, which define its legal structure and processes, and its Rules,\nwhich define the scope and mechanisms of its day-to-day activity.\nThe Rules were originally drafted through the open Matrix Specification Change\nproposal process in order to provide full transparency and review from the \nwider community. The result was MSC1779 -  Proposal for Open Governance of Matrix.org,\nproviding a comprehensive overview of the whole governance process.\nThe Proposal for Open Governance was then formalised into legal form and\nincorporated into the Articles of Association and a matching Rules document,\nwhich is canonically versioned in this Google Doc\n(for ease of use by lawyers). This is the official canonical version of the\nrulebook referred to by the Foundation's Articles.\nThe full history of the rules can be followed via:\n\nhttps://matrix.org/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318 (v1 proposal)\nhttps://matrix.org/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1779\n\nOne of the most important items defined in the Rules are The Guiding Principles\nof the project and the definition of the Spec Core Team, which are reproduced\nbelow from MSC1779 for ease of reference.\nMatrix Manifesto\nWe believe:\n\nPeople should have full control over their own communication.\nPeople should not be locked into centralised communication silos, but instead\nbe free to pick who they choose to host their communication without limiting\nwho they can reach.\nThe ability to converse securely and privately is a basic human right.\nCommunication should be available to everyone as a free and open,\nunencumbered, standard and global network.\n\nMission\nThe Matrix.org Foundation exists to act as a neutral custodian for Matrix and to\nnurture it as efficiently as possible as a single unfragmented standard, for\nthe greater benefit of the whole ecosystem, not benefiting or privileging any\nsingle player or subset of players.\nFor clarity: the Matrix ecosystem is defined as anyone who uses the Matrix\nprotocol. This includes (non-exhaustively):\n\nEnd-users of Matrix clients.\nMatrix client developers and testers.\nSpec developers.\nServer admins.\nMatrix packagers &amp; maintainers.\nCompanies building products or services on Matrix.\nBridge developers.\nBot developers.\nWidget developers.\nServer developers.\nMatrix room and community moderators.\nEnd-users who are using Matrix indirectly via bridges.\nExternal systems which are bridged into Matrix.\nAnyone using Matrix for data communications.\n\n\"Greater benefit\" is defined as maximising:\n\nthe number of Matrix-native end-users reachable on the open Matrix network.\nthe number of regular users on the Matrix network (e.g. 30-day retained\nfederated users).\nthe number of online servers in the open federation.\nthe number of developers building on Matrix.\nthe number of independent implementations which use Matrix.\nthe number of bridged end-users reachable on the open Matrix network.\nthe signal-to-noise ratio of the content on the open Matrix network\n(i.e. minimising spam).\nthe ability for users to discover content on their terms (empowering them to\nselect what to see and what not to see).\nthe quality and utility of the Matrix spec (as defined by ease and ability\nwith which a developer can implement spec-compliant clients, servers, bots,\nbridges, and other integrations without needing to refer to any other\nexternal material).\n\nN.B. that we consider success to be the growth of the open federated network\nrather than closed deployments. For example, if WhatsApp adopted Matrix it\nwouldn't be a complete win unless they openly federated with the rest of the\nMatrix network.\nValues\nAs Matrix evolves, it's critical that the Spec Core Team and Guardians are aligned on the overall philosophy of the project, particularly in more subjective areas. The values we follow are:\n\nSupporting the whole long-term ecosystem rather than individual stakeholder gain.\nOpenness rather than proprietary lock-in.\nInteroperability rather than fragmentation.\nCross-platform rather than platform-specific.\nCollaboration rather than competition.\nAccessibility rather than elitism.\nTransparency rather than stealth.\nEmpathy rather than contrariness.\nPragmatism rather than perfection.\nProof rather than conjecture.\n\nPatent encumbered IP is strictly prohibited from being added to the standard.\nMaking the specification rely on non-standard/unspecified behaviour of other\nsystems or actors (such as SaaS services, even open-sourced, not governed by a\nstandard protocol) shall not be accepted, either.\nThe Spec Core Team\nThe contents and direction of the Matrix Spec is governed by the Spec Core Team;\na set of experts from across the whole Matrix community, representing all\naspects of the Matrix ecosystem. The Spec Core Team acts as a subcommittee of\nthe Foundation.\nMembers of the Spec Core Team pledge to act as a neutral custodian for Matrix on\nbehalf of the whole ecosystem and uphold the Guiding Principles of the project\nas outlined above. In particular, they agree to drive the adoption of Matrix as\na single global federation, an open standard unencumbered from any proprietary\nIP or software patents, minimising fragmentation (whilst encouraging\nexperimentation), evolving rapidly, and prioritising the long-term success and\ngrowth of the overall network over individual commercial concerns.\nSpec Core Team members need to have significant proven domain experience/skill\nand have had clear dedication and commitment to the project and community\nfor &gt;6 months. (In future, once we have subteams a la Rust, folks need to have\nproven themselves there first).\nMembers need to demonstrate ability to work constructively with the rest of the\nteam; we want participation in the Spec Core Team to be an efficient, pleasant\nand productive place, even in the face of inevitable disagreement. We do not\nwant a toxic culture of bullying or competitive infighting. Folks need to be\nable to compromise; we are not building a culture of folks pushing their\npersonal agendas at the expense of the overall project.\nThe team should be particularly vigilant against 'trojan horse' additions to the\nspec - features which only benefit particular players, or are designed to\nsomehow cripple or fragment the open protocol and ecosystem in favour of\ncompetitive advantage. Commercial players are of course free to build\nproprietary implementations, or use custom event types, or even custom API\nextensions (e.g. more efficient network transports) - but implementations must\nfall back to interoperating correctly with the rest of the ecosystem.\nThe current Spec Core Team (and their domain areas) is:\n\nMatthew Hodgson (Lead, Guardian)\nErik Johnston (Servers)\nRichard van der Hoff (Servers, Cryptography)\nDavid Baker (Clients, IS API, Push API, Media)\nHubert Chathi (Cryptography, General)\nAndrew Morgan (Servers, AS API, Spec Process)\nTravis Ralston (Bots and Bridges &amp; AS API, Media)\nAlexey Rusakov (Clients on behalf of Community)\n\n","id":"/about/","title":"About Matrix"},"/blog/":{"body":"","id":"/blog/","title":"Blog"},"/blog/2014/":{"body":"","id":"/blog/2014/","title":""},"/blog/2014/09/":{"body":"","id":"/blog/2014/09/","title":""},"/blog/2014/09/03/hello-world/":{"body":"Hello world\nI'm Matthew, and I'm responsible for the techie side of what we're up to with Matrix.\nMatrix is the result of a lot of work my team's done over the last 10 years or so (first at MX Telecom, then OpenMarket, and then Amdocs) in developing next-generation IP communication solutions. &nbsp;First we started with an Asterisk-based platform running basic PSTN IVR services, and then shifted to an in-house IAX-based IVR platform built in Java, and then added circuit-switched (3G-324M) video calling, then switched to SIP/RTP, C++ and a massively-distributed softswitch architecture affectionately called 'The Next Generation'. &nbsp;Then the iPhone and Android came along, and we realised we didn't have to be constrained by built-in phone capabilities and ported our whole C++ SIP/RTP VoIP stack over to iOS/Android and got writing Video/VoIP calling apps. &nbsp;This evolved to developing full-blown unified communication apps (e.g. Blah), using XMPP at first for messaging before switching to our own HTTP-based messaging APIs.\nSomewhere along the way it became painfully obvious that VoIP and IM hasn't really evolved as well as the rest of the internet. &nbsp;Back when SIP/RTP first emerged, it simply wasn't mature enough to work on the open internet as well as HTTP or SMTP or even FTP - it needed STUN, ICE, TURN, Opus and many other refinements to be really usable in the wild. &nbsp;And similarly XMPP hasn't taken over the world quite as much as we once hoped. &nbsp;Meanwhile, many folks went and built their own proprietary walled-garden solutions (be it Skype, FaceTime, Viber, WhatsApp, or even our own efforts) and we've ended up in the current horrible situation where our online communication is fragmented across hundreds of isolated apps and websites. &nbsp;It's like a world where email was never unified, and half the world is still stuck on Compuserve. &nbsp;And it's counter to the whole ethos of the internet as an open platform for collaboration and communication.\nWe decided that we want to fix this and so we have built and published a new open standard, together with open source (ASLv2) reference server (Python/Twisted) and client (JS/Angular, Python, Perl) codebases, and so provide new building blocks that can be used to build truly interoperable federated IM and VoIP functionality.  We consider this effectively an investment in the industry: by creating a strictly non-profit initiative like Matrix, we both make the world a better place for end users - as well as creating new business opportunities (both opensource and commercial) for the telecoms industry as a whole.\nThe standard and code are all brand new and very much still in creation at this point, but we're releasing it early to get as much feedback and input from the community as early on as we possibly can. Right now our focus is on fully decentralised federated group messaging, but VoIP and identity management is coming together well too. &nbsp;You can think of it as \"making VoIP/IM as interoperable and flexible as email\", or perhaps \"the missing signalling layer for WebRTC\", \"XMPP for an HTTP world\", or “what would happen if IRC, XMPP, SIP, SMTP, IMAP and NNTP had kids?” Here are some reasons we think that you should use Matrix:\n\n\tSimple pragmatic RESTful HTTP/JSON APIs. &nbsp;No more XMPP or SIP stacks and wrestling XML streams or torture-testing SIP parsers.\n\n\tNo single points of control for channels of communication (unless you really want it for moderation or similar). Room state for a room is synchronised with eventual consistency over all participating Matrix servers - no single server controls the room.\n\n\tNo more netsplits - history re-heals itself if the matrix fractures\n\n\tAll communication is group by default: 1:1 chat is just a subset of group chat.\n\n\tMulti-device aware: all state is stored and synchronised in realtime across all devices, and away-state and notifications are aware of multiple devices.\n\n\tUses arbitrary 3rd party identifiers - doesn't rely on JIDs or SIP URIs for identity.\n\n\tShare the same simple HTTP signalling channel for messaging and VoIP\n\n\tSupport more efficient transports if you want (e.g. low-bandwidth/low-roundtrip sync on mobile)\n\n\tBuilt for mobile - e.g. support push notification and low-bandwidth/low-latency client-server transports if needed (in progress)\n\n\tTLS (HTTPS) by default, either with self-signed certs with published public keys or proper SSL CA signed certs (in progress)\n\n\tEnd-to-end PKI encryption (in progress)\n\n\tTrusted federation of public identity servers available for publishing your PKI public keys and tracking your validated 3rd party IDs\n\n\nIf this sounds good to you, then please take a look at the spec, or our tutorials, or jump straight into playing with the APIs, or try running your own Matrix homeserver, or sign up to our mailing lists - and whatever else, come swing by #matrix:matrix.org and say hi!\n\n","id":"/blog/2014/09/03/hello-world/","title":"Hello world"},"/blog/2014/09/03/welcome-to-the-matrix-blog/":{"body":"Today is a big day for us as we are launching Matrix.org, an open initiative which has the goal of making real-time communication over IP as seamless and interoperable as email.\nHow do we want to achieve this? Very simply by creating a new federated, open-source ecosystem for VoIP and instant messaging on the internet! Ambitious right? :)\nActually not that much!

I have a technical background and have always had the need to see the bigger picture. My motivation in starting Matrix has mainly been to make my dream of ubiquitous real-time communications come true and fix what felt broken in the industry. Here is the story.\nWhen studying telecoms I was fascinated by converging networks, the “Next Generation Network” as we called it. Wow, imagine! Having fixed lines, mobiles and computers able to communicate with each other? Call a number and have the ability to answer seamlessly on any device? And the capability to do video calls and share files?&nbsp;That&nbsp;was definitely Next Generation at the time! Especially given the best we could do with a mobile was bad GSM, MMS and WAP if you were lucky.... A decade later video calling is possible on any device; I can share anything I want with my contacts (pictures, videos, files, random stickers) thanks to hundreds of different apps; sometimes my history is even synced across several devices! And if I choose my mobile provider carefully I can even have a “One Number” service!&nbsp;:)\nBut still, we're far away from the ubiquitous dream of 10 years ago. None of my apps are talking to each other. One number is more often “one login per app”. My conversation history is scattered across all the apps (who never experienced the “Did you tell me on Facebook, Whatsapp, Skype or SMS???” question followed by 10 minutes of intense fiddling with your phone which of course is running out of battery?). My address book and profile data is stored everywhere by companies like Facebook, Google and random startups, but who knows how much they really value your privacy...\nIs the tech not good enough yet? Only partially: most of the features, typically IM, video, VoIP, &nbsp;are already available and widely used. However it is a reality that no tech has really imposed itself as an interoperability standard. What about economic blockers then? A better bet: what are the incentives for big companies and small startups to share their communities? Most of these corporations choose a business model that locks their users into walled gardens, directly linking their valuation to this user base. But ultimately this is bad for competition and bad for the users.\nWhat about phone networks then? Why don't they do anything? Well, they have tried. It's called RCS (Rich Communication Services), or joyn. It's a good initiative designed by committee and implemented as a functionality deeply embedded in the network rather than a light over-the-top deployment and consequently very expensive and time-consuming to put in place. Similarly as per telco's historical positioning, RCS is more focused on quality of service than quality of user experience. But RCS is facing a few challenges: communications over IP must be free for the user to compete with the Skype &amp; WhatsApp of this world, which limits a lot the return on investment of the deployment of an expensive network update, limiting the adoption of RCS by mobile networks. Besides quality of service is not necessarily what will trigger a success when competing with over the top apps which are 100% focused on providing the best user experience... And despite the GSMA's best efforts implementing interoperability between networks is proving very painful, limiting the growth of the ecosystem.\nBut ultimately we all know that today success is driven by users. This multitude of minds which decides the exact split of fun and usefulness that will define the value of a product and make it crazily successful overnight. So why are users not pushing for this ubiquity? I see two reasons: first they often don't realize how useful it could be and second: there is nothing to push! Indeed it can easily be considered as handy to have one app per group of people I want to communicate with: Facebook messenger with my school friends, Whatsapp with international friends, Skype with my family, Snapchat with my boyfriend, Voxer with my best friend... But why can't I have only one app, the one I prefer, to get in touch with everyone, whatever they are using? And if I want a fancy Tango-like video experience then I couldstill launch Tango for this scenario and have the whole chat history there.&nbsp;I truly believe that once fragmentation will be over everyone will wonder how we could ever live with it.\nAnd what about privacy? Isn't it bad enough that the second I send an email to my friend asking if he's booked his flights to Madrid I get a flurry of airline adverts for flights to Spain? Even without going into the debate of whether governments should file every citizen, it's a question of principles - I'd rather have my communication history and my contacts stored by someone I trust and avoid useless adverts. &nbsp;Some of you will say “Oh but you're French. ‘Vive la Révolution!' is your default motto...” - but think about it for a minute:\nImagine: only install the apps you want on your phone for communication. Use the ones you prefer because the UX is great or you love their smileys. Your whole address book is there, correctly merged. All the conversation history with your friends and family is there. And you don't care what app they're using. Or how they logged in: your app discovers them based on any ID (email, phone number, Facebook): you just need to have them in your address book. You know where your data is - perhaps stored by a new startup using renewable energy for their data center, just because you want to save the planet. Or by your geeky brother running his own server under his bed (using end-to-end encryption if you think he might be nosy!). You can still have many apps but each allows you to do different fun stuff: fancy video, crazy pictures, drawings, imaginative stickers. You control your communication.&nbsp; You decide what to you want to use, who you want to trust.&nbsp;Welcome to Matrix.\n","id":"/blog/2014/09/03/why-matrix/","title":"Why Matrix?"},"/blog/2014/09/06/high-level-tech-overview/":{"body":"Hey,\nWe realized we're missing a high level overview highlighting&nbsp;the key points of the specifications and architecture of Matrix, which could be useful for those who don't feel like going straight into the specs.

These are entirely new projects - you can check out the SDKs and demo apps (which implement a basic Matrix chatroom client similar to the webclient demo at:\n\n\thttp://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk\n\thttp://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk\n\nWe still have a lot of polishing and lipstick to apply to these, but it should be a good starting point for folks who'd like to hack on mobile apps for Matrix! We haven't had a chance to generate appledoc/javadoc for these yet, but we'll post them on matrix.org shortly.\nThere's also been some work going into restructuring our documentation and finalising the spec - all Matrix generic documentation now lives in a new git project at http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc. We're still working on wrapping all the details of the spec into a single canonical document, but it's getting there and should be locked down shortly.\nMeanwhile, we're also pleased to announce the new Synapse 0.4 release series of the reference Matrix homeserver. Our focus on Synapse over the last few weeks has been on implementing the remaining pieces of the Matrix security model and getting the server to the point where folks can deploy it properly in production environments.\nSynapse 0.4 deliberately breaks backwards compatibility on the server-server federation protocol, as we now cryptographically sign all federation traffic at the HTTP layer (using Authorization headers) in order to have a strong assertion to the identity of the servers which exchange traffic. We can't really use SSL client/server certificates for this as it's incompatible with Synapse deployments which are hosted behind generic SSL loadbalancers.\nMeanwhile we have two other major development branches on Synapse which will land shortly - one of which cryptographically signs all events, thus preventing tampering with room history, and the other of which performs strict authorization on all traffic received through federation to avoid malicious events being injected and breaking the consistency of the distributed room. These should be landing shortly - at which point the full security model of Matrix will be implemented in Synapse and we can finally remove the \"don't use this in production!\" warnings!\nAPI developers: be aware that this release also fixes the confusion over timestamps in the client-server (and server-server) API. Events now have only one well-defined timestamp - event.origin_server_ts; the localtime on the homeserver which first receives a message. This replaces the previous confusing event.ts and event.content.hsob_ts timestamps. This should be a trivial change to implement.\nFinally, we've also had a detour into robotics to build our new mascot (Sentinel)... pictures forthcoming shortly!\nThanks for supporting Matrix - please let us know how you get on with the new releases at #matrix:matrix.org!\n\nChanges in synapse 0.4.1 (2014-10-17)\n=====================================\nWebclient:\n\nFix bug with display of timestamps.\n\nChanges in synpase 0.4.0 (2014-10-17)\nThis release includes changes to the federation protocol and client-server API\nthat is not backwards compatible.\nThe Matrix specification has been moved to a separate git repository:\nhttp://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc\nYou will also need an updated syutil and config.

This means that if you want your app or program or website to be able to communicate user to user for example, you can use Matrix. Matrix is the protocol through which your communication packets are sent and received, and we provide HTTP APIs to make it easy to make use of this protocol in your code.\nThe nice thing here is that the user can to talk to any other user anywhere in the Matrix ecosystem, much like email or the web. For example, let's imagine I have an app whose goal is to keep the user updated on anything happening in the football world. Whenever any news drops in, the app is notified and thousands of users check the app for the news. This app could have a communication element where the users can talk in rooms (maybe a #general room and rooms for each football club) - or even between themselves or in groups of friends. Today, a lot of people would use an IM-client to do this, but with Matrix it wouldn't matter if you use a dedicated IM-app or talk inside the football app - since you are using the same Matrix account, you will get the same conversations in both clients!\nIn fact, imagine that later on you are chatting with some (non-football) friends on your Matrix-supporting chat-application. You can then easily check the previous conversation to see if anyone's appreciated the great joke you made earlier - without having to go back into the football app.\nBut Matrix's real potential and ultimate mission is to be a generic messaging and data synchronisation system for the web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other with full history. It's easier to visualise the chat-application because we are used to chat-messages going back and to, but there's nothing stopping you from putting other data instead of chat-messages. For example, you could use the Matrix protocol to exchange moves - encrypted and secured, of course - in your Chess-game. In fact, your Chess-game could use Matrix both for chatting and exchanging payloads of data.\nImagine if you open up your favourite chat-application, and your contacts there include other users of the same app and also other Matrix-users (so the app has exposed itself to Matrix). Your friend, however, much prefers a different app, but he can still talk to you over the Matrix protocol. And if he ever moves to the other app (or any other Matrix-supporting app) - he would still have all the backlog and history of the conversation!\nObviously the problem here is that we can't instantly make the various chat-applications support Matrix. We believe if we can encourage and grow a truly open communication ecosystem, users will get used to the availability and benefits of interoperable services and they will demand it everywhere.\n","id":"/blog/2014/11/05/what-is-the-matrix/","title":"\"What is The Matrix?\""},"/blog/2014/11/13/matrix-on-the-road/":{"body":"Matrix has been showing off in various places these last months.

We participated in the Hackathon as both a sponsor and a competitor (see our live update!), and exhibited at the conference as a Product Sponsor.\nThree teams announced that they were using Matrix to build their hack but eventually only Go Social presented their project: a social network for travelers with a&nbsp;very nice UI! Go Social used Matrix APIs to add chat to their platform. The video of Go Social's presentation is here.\nMatrix team worked on Animatrix: a chat app allowing you to build your own 3D animated cartoon and share it with any other friend using Matrix-compliant app using Unify. We had to hack together&nbsp;a basic Matrix Android client in order to do the&nbsp;demo .... You can see our project's presentation here!\n\nThe three days conference was great in terms of reaching out to devs and getting good feedback on Matrix! We love seeing people's eyes lighting up and people saying \"Eventually someone is doing it!\" when we explain what&nbsp;Matrix is about :) So thank you all for your support!\n&nbsp;\nDisrupt Europe&nbsp;(London, UK - October 18-21)\nAfter getting public in SF, Disrupt London was the next steps to release a more stable version of Matrix and encourage even more people to build on Matrix. Again we&nbsp;sponsored both the Hackathon and the Conference and we brought with us a very cool PhantomX robot from Trossen Robotics which was also the price we gave away during the hackathon.\n\nTwo teams pitched a Matrix project at the Hackathon this time:\nHujambo is a very cool chat app allowing you to chat in your&nbsp;native language to someone&nbsp;who is going to read you in their own native language.\nMovidiam did&nbsp;a very ambitious hack, modelling the trends of conversation in the Matrix ecosystem and displaying them a force-directed graph visualisation using D3.\nMatrix team worked on a MIDI to Matrix bridge allowing to&nbsp;share and display music you play in a chatroom and jam together even if in different places. Here is the demo video:\nhttp://youtu.be/LXDBoHyjmtw\nAnother great time to meet a lot of interesting people and build partnerships!\nWebRTC Summit Europe and Rich Communication Conference&nbsp;(Berlin&nbsp;- October 27-29)\nMatrix was a Silver sponsor at WebRTC Summit and the Rich Communication events&nbsp;and it was a great&nbsp;opportunity to show the multiple ways&nbsp;that Matrix can be considered.\nThe first day was the&nbsp;WebRTC Summit where the focus was on the challenges and next steps of the standard.&nbsp;Matthew presented Matrix explained how it can be used as the missing signaling layer to WebRTC raising lots of questions and interest. You can see&nbsp;the presentation here.\n\nThe&nbsp;two next days were focusing more on Rich Communication Services (RCS)&nbsp;and again Matrix didn't go unnoticed, and not only because of the lightspeed presentation from Matthew waking everyone up on Wednesday morning! This time Matthew addressed Telcos and RCS vendors with the compelling proposition of using Matrix as the bridge between&nbsp;RCS/IMS/PSTN and the world of over-the-top&nbsp;applications. &nbsp;The presentation is downloadable here.\nAgain some great feedback and lots of animated&nbsp;discussions over the future of the IP communication world!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\nWebRTC Summit (Santa Clara - November 4-5)\nBeginning of November Matrix&nbsp;was back on the West Coast &nbsp;to&nbsp;sponsor the WebRTC Summit, collocated with the CloudExpo. Matthew opened the WebRTC track with another presentation again raising a lot of interest and question, and greatly supported by Hookflash in their following session.

The AS APIs should let you perform any arbitrary manipulation on chatroom contents, modulo end-to-end encryption constraints - e.g. machine translation; archiving/searching contents; interactive automated services; conferencing; firing push notifications and other hooks; etc. If you really want to look behind the curtain, the bug tracking the development (somewhat out-of-date) is at SPEC-34.\nHowever, the most obvious use case for this is gatewaying Matrix rooms through to existing communication platforms (XMPP, SIP, non-standardised systems) - which is obviously key to Matrix's overall goal of defragmenting communication. &nbsp;And the good news is that even though the AS APIs don't yet exist, we can still make good progress here through the existing client-server API. &nbsp;Anyone who's hung around chat systems like IRC should be familiar with the idea of bots - non-human users who participate in chatrooms and but perform arbitrary automated functionality - and you can go quite a long way in using the 'bot' idiom to add automatic functionality to Matrix.\n[In fact the first AS API we'll be adding will probably be simply extending the client-server API with some additional privileges to allow homeserver admins to hook up services to their server which are essentially privileged bots (e.g. ability to autojoin rooms created on that server with high power-level; ability to flag themselves as an invisible 'service bot';&nbsp;ability to monitor events from rooms without joining them: useful for read-only services such as sending push notifications, adding search/archive functionality; etc). &nbsp;This should also be familiar to IRC users, as it's similar to&nbsp;the model that IRC Services uses.]\nSo, we already have a few bots hanging around prototyping out bridging to other systems, which hopefully should evolve into full Application Services (where it makes sense; sometimes a bot is good enough). &nbsp;For instance, we have the Matrix/IRC Bridge&nbsp;thanks to tm604 and LeoNerd. &nbsp;The way this works is simply a bot which joins IRC channels and their Matrix room equivalents; watching the messages on both sides of the bridge and relaying them to the other side, creating virtual users as required. &nbsp;In future we can be smarter about having the bridge talk on behalf of actual users, or letting actual users control their virtual users, but it's good enough as a first cut.\nSo for Friday's VUC 517, we decided at the last minute (on Tuesday) to make as much of VUC accessible via Matrix as possible. &nbsp;One side of this was hooking up the Jitsi Video Bridge to be accessible by talking to the underlying XMPP server - the other side was hooking up via SIP to the ZipDX audio bridge&nbsp;that is used for&nbsp;audio-only participants in the conference. &nbsp;Both of these would be done as Matrix bots - a virtual user that you could voice/video call 1:1 over Matrix which would then route your call into VUC appropriately.\nBy Thursday, the Jitsi bot got to the point of being able to place calls and see a single video stream (picked at random), but the&nbsp;video uplink wasn't getting through and actually selecting the right stream to watch (or viewing multiple streams) wasn't in place either. &nbsp;I'm sure there'll be a similar blogpost once it's finished, so I'm not going to talk about it further here. &nbsp;Meanwhile, on Thursday night we hacked together a separate bot to jack into the ZipDX bridge via SIP. &nbsp;Tim Panton's suggestion was to use FreeSWITCH's mod_verto for this, and after Anthony Minesalle and Mike Jerris from FreeSWITCH had popped up on #matrix:matrix.org&nbsp;on Tuesday to find out what we're up to, this seemed like serendipity.\nWe hadn't played with mod_verto before, although had been pointed at it by someone on IRC shortly after we released Matrix - it's a cool project from the FreeSWITCH dev team that exposes a simple JSON-RPC interface for call signalling over websockets, providing a much more suitable way for WebRTC developers to get calls in and out of FreeSWITCH than shoehorning a SIP stack into their browser. &nbsp;In this respect it's quite similar to Matrix, but there are some huge differences:\n\n\tVerto doesn't (yet) do federation - either for message-passing (like XMPP) or history-replication (like Matrix or XMPP FMUCs). &nbsp;In fact, Matrix fundamentally competes more with JSON-RPC at OSI layer 5 by defining a standardised RESTful API for federated state synchronisation - which so happens to define some datatypes for VoIP signalling; whereas Verto currently seems to be focused solely on the application-layer problem of VoIP signalling.\n\tVerto is a generic RPC API with method names like verto.invite, verto.answer, verto.media, verto.bye etc. for handling call signalling. &nbsp;It's obviously readily extensible to any other functionality expressed as an RPC invocation. &nbsp;The Matrix client-server API however passes around event objects within the context of a room - it's message passing rather than RPC.\n\tMatrix's VoIP events support trickle-ICE; announcing ICE candidates from WebRTC as and when they become available. &nbsp;This good is for speedy call-setup (you don't have to wait for all ICE to complete before setting up the call) and to support call continuity when roaming between different IP networks (in theory). &nbsp;However, Verto currently requires ICE candidates to be presented monolithically - it hasn't made sense to implement trickle-ICE as FreeSWITCH's core engine doesn't support it yet.\n        Verto looks to be wired to speak JSON-RPC over Websockets, whereas Matrix deliberately uses plain old HTTP as its baseline for maximum simplicity and compatibility in PUTting and GETting JSON events around\n\tVerto could be an interoperable standard but the API hasn't been documented yet (unless I've totally missed it) - to build the bot we looked at the websockets tab in Chrome's network inspector and drew some inferences from the JSON seen in a call placed using the FreeSWITCH Verto demo site, which was very intuitive and almost self-documenting. &nbsp;Meanwhile, the (minimal) doc for Matrix's events is up at&nbsp;http://matrix.org/docs/spec/#voice-over-ip.\n\nVerto has a huge advantage however, in that FreeSWITCH has a mod_verto today, and doesn't have a mod_matrix - so one can use mod_verto right now as an easy way to get VoIP calls in and out of FreeSWITCH from the web and bridge them to SIP! &nbsp;So, when writing a Matrix&lt;-&gt;SIP bridging bot for VUC, Verto turned out to be a really nice way to quickly get something up and running. &nbsp;The end result is at&nbsp;https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/contrib/vertobot/bot.pl&nbsp;- a (precisely!) 300 line perl script built on LeoNerd's Net-Async-Matrix&nbsp;and Net::Async::Protocol::WebSocket which logs into Matrix and routes any 1:1 audio calls it receives through to the defined mod_verto service. &nbsp;Currently it gleefully hardcodes in the destination extension it calls and the caller-ID, but this could trivially be extended. &nbsp;It also chokes on SSL WebSockets, so your mod_verto needs to be listening unencrypted on port 8081.\nThe task of mapping between Matrix m.call.* VoIP events and Verto verto.* RPC methods was almost entirely trivial (although I hasten to add that Matrix's and Verto's were developed completely independently - it's just that there are only so many ways to express VoIP signalling in JSON!)\n\n\tMatrix's m.call.invite is equivalent to the combination of verto.invite + verto.media (but may lack&nbsp;ICE candidates)\n\tMatrix's m.call.candidates has no direct equivalent, so has to be coalesced and merged into verto.media\n\tMatrix's m.call.answer is equivalent to verto.answer (but may lack ICE candidates)\n\tMatrix's m.room.displayname is equivalent to verto.display (assuming I understand verto.display)\n\tMatrix's m.call.hangup is equivalent to verto.bye\n\t…and these are the only verto RPCs we mapped.\n\nFor the demo itself, we obviously needed a FreeSWITCH with mod_verto all up and running to hook into the ZipDX bridge: our friends at Truphone&nbsp;were good enough to provide one at zero notice (Thanks James, Andy, Giacomo!), and we were up and running.\nUnfortunately we did hit some problems: Net::Async::Matrix has a few quirks which LeoNerd is working out currently; the bot doesn't coalesce the trickle-ICE properly currently causing a race-condition that means ICE setup may fail; Matthew's use of IO::Async was a bit buggy; and moreover we didn't have time to implement DTMF… which was a bit of a shame as you can only unmute yourself on the ZipDX bridge via DTMF *5!\nBut in general, the mini-hackathon was a success and it was great fun to be able to listen into VUC via the bridge and demonstrate the first ever Matrix&lt;-&gt;SIP call! &nbsp;The bot ran as @vucbot:matrix.org, although is turned off now as there's no VUC to listen to, and the FreeSWITCH &amp; bot were only deployed temporarily. &nbsp;Once the kinks mentioned above are sorted out we'll hopefully set it running again permanently! &nbsp;And hopefully this little bot is an exciting precursor to more robust Matrix bridges and application services in the months to come...\nIf you're crazy enough to want to try to run the bot yourself, then it should actually be quite simple to get up and running:\n # grab synapse if you don't have it already\ngit clone https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse.git synapse-develop\ncd synapse-develop\nyou'll need the develop branch, as we haven't released a build with vertobot in it yet\ngit checkout develop\ncd contrib/vertobot\nyou'll need cpanm to install the perl dependencies\ncpan -i App::cpanminus\ncpanm --installdeps .\nmanually install a develop version of Net::Async::Matrix as cpanm can't figure it out, seemingly\ncpanm --force PEVANS/Net-Async-Matrix-0.11_002\n(you may need to also replace the 'croak' for the \"Already have a room with ID\" error with 'warn' in Net::Async::Matrix if the bot crashes with this error)\ncreate a username account for your bot on a Matrix homeserver somewhere at this point\nset up a config file\ncp config.yaml mybot.yaml\nedit mybot.yaml to taste - at the least you must specify the login &amp; password &amp; homeserver for your bot!\nrun it!\n./bot.pl -c mybot.yaml\n\nFinally, huge thanks to everyone to helped make the VUC bridging escapade work out - Emil Ivov at Jitsi, James Body, Andy Smith and Giacomo Vacca at Truphone, Anthony Minesalle &amp; Mike Jerris &amp; Brian West at FreeSWITCH for writing freeswitch and mod_verto, Tim Panton for the VUC intro and suggestion of mod_verto, Randy Resnick &amp; Michael Graves at VUC itself, and of course the Matrix team for glueing our side of it together!\nLooking forward to lots more ambitious cross-protocol gatewaying and federation in future!\n","id":"/blog/2014/11/30/bridging-matrix-sip-via-verto/","title":"Bridging Matrix & SIP via Verto"},"/blog/2014/12/":{"body":"","id":"/blog/2014/12/","title":""},"/blog/2014/12/03/synapse-0-5-4-released/":{"body":"We just pushed a bugfix update to Synapse 0.5, mainly to fix a memory leak where federated events could get leaked whilst retrying to send them to a remote server which is unavailable.

Meanwhile the Application Service API is effectively finished, but hasn't landed on the master branch yet. Synapse also finally has initial support for push notifications for the iOS client now via the sygnal APNS gateway, although we need to actually document how to set this up to be usable in general.\nFinally, we have switched to recommending that synapse is installed in a virtualenv rather than into ~/.local, due to various problems with how setup.py's dependency management works.

The extensions let you register application services as privileged Matrix clients, and create virtual users and virtual rooms in bulk within Matrix (e.g. bridging an entire IRC network into Matrix).

The SMSes will be sent from dynamically assigned numbers so that the recipient is able to respond to your message(s) - and the user will first receive an \"opt-in\" message from the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway to invite them to the conversation (just as they would if you invited them to a conversation in Matrix). Note that there are a finite set of these dynamically assigned numbers: OpenMarket reserves the right to recycle contact numbers if they have not been used to send or receive traffic for more than 2 months.\nSending SMS through the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway will be free during the introductory beta testing period, and users will be warned when&nbsp;that changes -&nbsp;although usage is subject to a per-user fair-usage policy. Despite the free service today, you'll have to associate a valid PayPal account to your account in order to send messages for security purposes. OpenMarket will not (and cannot) charge this account without your consent. You can associate your PayPal account via the settings page of any reference Matrix web client which has been configured to be aware of the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway - for example, the matrix.org webclient.\nYou'll also have to accept the OpenMarket Matrix API End User License Agreement to use the service.\nThe OpenMarket Matrix Gateway is a great example of how the Application Service API can be used to extend Matrix, we're really happy to see it live and hope it's going to give our community lots of ideas! There are a lot of services that could mutually benefit from being integrated with Matrix, and the AS API makes this much easier to accomplish!\nThus, we strongly urge you to have a look at the AS API - and as always we are happy to answer any questions at #matrix:matrix.org!\n","id":"/blog/2015/02/26/welcoming-the-openmarket-matrix-gateway/","title":"Welcoming the OpenMarket Matrix Gateway!"},"/blog/2015/03/":{"body":"","id":"/blog/2015/03/","title":""},"/blog/2015/03/02/introduction-to-application-services/":{"body":"This post has now been edited into a guide - you can find the source in github, and the formatted guide on the matrix.org website!\n\n&nbsp;\nHi everyone. I'm Kegan, one of the core developers on Matrix. I'd like to explain a bit more about one of the upcoming features in Matrix: Application Services. This is an entirely new component in the Matrix architecture which gives great power (along with great responsibility!) to the wielder.\nApplication services are distinct modules which which sit alongside a home server providing arbitrary extensible&nbsp;functionality decoupled from the home server implementation. Just like the rest of Matrix, they communicate via HTTP using JSON. Application services function in a very similar way to traditional clients, but they are given much more power than a normal client. They can reserve entire namespaces of room aliases and user IDs for their own purposes. They can silently monitor events in rooms, or any events directed at any user ID. This power allows application services to have extremely useful abilities which overall enhance the end user experience.\nOne of the main use cases for application services is for protocol bridges. As you may know, we have an IRC bridge bot on matrix.org which resides as a user on #matrix, #matrix-dev, #openwebrtc and #vuc&nbsp;which bridges into freenode. There is nothing special about this bot; it is just treated as a client. However, this limits the things the bot can do. For example, the bot cannot reserve the virtual user IDs it creates, and cannot lazily bridge arbitrary IRC rooms on-the-fly. By using application services, the IRC bot can do both of these things. This would allow any Matrix user to join a room alias which doesn't exist: say #irc.freenode.python:matrix.org, which would then tell the application service to create a new Matrix room, make the alias for it, join #python on freenode and bridge into it. Any IRC user on #python would then be provisioned as a virtual user e.g. @irc.freenode.alice:matrix.org. This also allows PMs to be sent directly to @irc.freenode.alice:matrix.org, no matter what channel Alice is on.\nApplication services have enormous potential for creating new and exciting ways to transform and enhance the core Matrix protocol. For example, you could aggregate information from multiple rooms into a summary room, or create throwaway virtual user accounts to proxy messages for a fixed user ID on-the-fly. As you may expect, all of this power assumes a high degree of trust between application services and home servers. Only home server admins can allow an application service to link up with their home server, and the application service is in no way federated to other home servers. You can think of application services as additional logic on the home server itself, without messing around with the book-keeping that home servers have to do. This makes adding useful functionality very easy.\nExample\nThe application service (AS) API itself uses webhooks to communicate from the home server to the AS:\n\nRoom Alias Query API : The home server hits a URL on your application server to see if a room alias exists.\nUser Query API : The home server hits a URL on your application server to see if a user ID exists.\nPush API : The home server hits a URL on your application server to notify you of new events for your users and rooms.\n\nA very basic application service may want to log all messages in rooms which have an alias starting with \"#logged_\" (side note: logging won't work if these rooms are using end-to-end encryption).\nHere's an example of a very basic application service using Python (with Flask and Requests) which logs room activity:\n# app_service.py:\n\nimport json, requests&nbsp; # we will use this later\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify, request\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/transactions/&lt;transaction&gt;\", methods=[\"PUT\"])\ndef on_receive_events(transaction):\n    events = request.get_json()[\"events\"]\n    for event in events:\n        print \"User: %s Room: %s\" % (event[\"user_id\"], event[\"room_id\"])\n        print \"Event Type: %s\" % event[\"type\"]\n        print \"Content: %s\" % event[\"content\"]\n    return jsonify({'{'}{'}'})\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run()\n\nSet your new application service running on port 5000&nbsp;with:\npython app_service.py\n\nThe home server needs to know that the application service exists before it will send requests to it. This is done via a registration YAML file which is specified in Synapse's main config file e.g. homeserver.yaml. The server admin needs to add the application service registration configuration file as an entry to this file.\n# homeserver.yaml\napp_service_config_files:\n  - \"/path/to/appservice/registration.yaml\"\n\nNB: Note the \"-\" at the start; this indicates a list element. The registration file registration.yaml should look like:\n# registration.yaml\n\n# this is the base URL of the application service\nurl: \"http://localhost:5000\"\n\n# This is the token that the AS should use as its access_token when using the Client-Server API\n# This can be anything you want.\nas_token: wfghWEGh3wgWHEf3478sHFWE\n\n# This is the token that the HS will use when sending requests to the AS.\n# This can be anything you want.\nhs_token: ugw8243igya57aaABGFfgeyu\n\n# this is the local part of the desired user ID for this AS (in this case @logging:localhost)\nsender_localpart: logging\nnamespaces:\n  users: []\n  rooms: []\n  aliases:\n    - exclusive: false\n      regex: \"#logged_.*\"\n\nYou will need to restart the home server after editing the config file before it will take effect.\nTo test everything is working correctly, go ahead and explicitly create a room with the alias \"#logged_test:localhost\" and send a message into the room: the HS will relay the message to the AS by PUTing to /transactions/&lt;tid&gt; and you should see your AS print the event on the terminal. This will monitor any room which has an alias prefix of \"#logged_\", but it won't lazily create room aliases if they don't already exist. This means it will only&nbsp;log messages in the room you created before: #logged_test:localhost. Try joining the room \"#logged_test2:localhost\" without creating it, and it will fail. Let's fix that and add in lazy room creation:\n@app.route(\"/rooms/&lt;alias&gt;\")\ndef query_alias(alias):\n    alias_localpart = alias.split(\":\")[0][1:]\n    requests.post(\n        # NB: \"TOKEN\" is the as_token referred to in registration.yaml\n        \"http://localhost:8008/_matrix/client/api/v1/createRoom?access_token=TOKEN\",\n        json.dumps({'{'}\n            \"room_alias_name\": alias_localpart\n        {'}'}),\n        headers={'{'}\"Content-Type\":\"application/json\"{'}'}\n    )\n    return jsonify({'{'}{'}'})\n\nThis makes the application service lazily create a room with the requested alias whenever the HS queries the AS for the existence of that alias (when users try to join that room), allowing any room with the alias prefix #logged_ to be sent to the AS. Now try joining the room \"#logged_test2:localhost\" and it will work as you'd expect. &nbsp;You can see that if this were a real bridge, the AS would have checked for the existence of #logged_test2 in the remote network, and then lazily-created it in Matrix as required.\nApplication services are powerful components which extend the functionality of home servers, but they are limited. They can only ever function in a \"passive\" way.&nbsp;For example, you cannot implement an application service which censors swear words in rooms, because there is no way to prevent the event from being sent. Aside from the&nbsp;fact that censoring will not work when using end-to-end encryption, all federated home servers would also need to reject the event in order to stop developing an&nbsp;inconsistent event graph. To \"actively\" monitor events, another component called a \"Policy Server\" is required, which is beyond the scope of this post. &nbsp;Also, Application Services can result in a performance bottleneck, as all events on the homeserver must be ordered and sent to the registered application services. &nbsp;If you are bridging huge amounts of traffic, you may be better off having your bridge directly talk the Server-Server federation API&nbsp;rather than the simpler Application Service API.\nI hope this post demonstrates how easy it is to create an application service, along with a few ideas of the kinds of things you can do with them. Obvious uses include build protocol bridges, search engines, invisible bots, etc. For more information on the AS HTTP API, check out the new Application Service API section in the spec, or the raw drafts and spec in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/. &nbsp;The AS API is not yet frozen, so feedback is very welcome!\n","id":"/blog/2015/03/02/introduction-to-application-services/","title":"Introduction to Application Services"},"/blog/2015/03/09/synapse-0-8-0-android-0-2-2-sdk-app-ios-0-3-1-sdk-app-javascript-sdk-0-0-1-released-oh-my/":{"body":"Hi all,\nWhat with the chaos of Mobile World Congress last week we seem to have been hoarding releases - so here's what's been happening!\nSynapse 0.8.0 was released this afternoon.  This is a major performance/stability release, with lots of good stuff going on - especially adding more customisable push notification support APIs for iOS/Android; support for registering accounts from mobile devices; extensions to the new Application Service API and lots of federation improvements and bug fixes.  Please upgrade at your earliest convenience.\nMeanwhile, we quietly released the Matrix Console Android example app to the Google Play last week, alongside v0.2.2 of the Android SDK - release notes below.  There'll be a new version of the Android Console app out tomorrow, but mentioning here for completeness and to share the release notes.  Also, the iOS SDK is now on v0.3.1, with lots of performance and usability improvements.\nFinally, we have a whole new official Matrix client SDK for JavaScript, all packaged up ready for use by Node developers and JS purists alike as an NPM with minimal dependencies.  Meanwhile, the matrix-angular-sdk has been switched to use matrix-js-sdk from now on.  You can use the plain JS API with a npm install matrix-js-sdk and then:\nvar sdk = require(\"matrix-js-sdk\");\nvar client = sdk.createClient(\"https://matrix.org\");\nclient.publicRooms(function(err, data) {'{'}\n    console.log(\"Public Rooms: %s\", JSON.stringify(data));\n{'}'});\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, release notes for all &amp; sundry lie below.\n\n\nChanges in synapse v0.8.0 (2015-03-06)\n======================================\n\nGeneral:\n\n* Add support for registration fallback.

We've called the app \"Matrix Console\" to try to make it clear that it's very much a developer/poweruser tool for experimenting with Matrix and showcasing the Matrix APIs and an example of how to use the iOS SDK - whilst it can be used as a great replacement to IRC, it's by no means meant to be a glossy polished app like Hangouts or Slack.\nMeanwhile you can also get the Android version of Console at the Google Play Store as we mentioned in the last post.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, they're both entirely open-source (Apache license) and you can grab the code from https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk and https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk respectively if you want to play with your own copy.\nThe mobile apps currently act very similarly to the reference web app - providing group chat (text/images/video etc) in decentralised public and private rooms, with room history kept in sync across all your different Matrix-enabled apps.  They don't yet do VoIP, although we're working on it.  Please give the apps a go and file all your bugs and feedback into JIRA or #ios:matrix.org and #android:matrix.org so we can make them even better :)\nThe iOS app in particular showcases one of the coolest new features in Matrix: the ability for homeservers to support highly configurable push notifications, ensuring you never miss messages on Matrix ever again.  The way this works is that when you install the Matrix Console app from iTunes and log in, the app tells your homeserver to send push notifications to a simple push server on Matrix.org running the sygnal codebase (you can also run your own sygnal for your own Matrix apps).  You can then configure some excitingly comprehensive push settings in the settings page of the web client (we haven't exposed the UI to configure these on the mobile apps yet) to configure what events in Matrix should trigger push notifications - and then you will automatically receive the desired pushes even when the app isn't running.\nWe think this is incredibly powerful: there are no longer any client-side notification settings.  Instead, all your notifications are stored server-side - per-room, per-user, per-word and as many other extensible rules as you desire (plus some helpful common special cases).  This means that the rules that determine whether you see notifications on the desktop from the webclient are identical to the notifications you receive push notifications on your mobile devices.  We hope this is a huge improvement over the inflexible notification rules that iMessage, Hangouts etc push onto you (so to speak).\nTo support the new push rules we've just released a new version of the web client - 0.6.5.  This implements the new rule configuration UI - see below for example UI.\n\nThe full list of changes in matrix-angular-sdk 0.6.5 is as per below.  We hope you enjoy the new clients and push settings - thanks for flying Matrix :)\n\nChanges in Matrix Angular SDK 0.6.5 (2015-03-12)\n================================================\nFeatures:\n - Push notifications can now be set up in the Settings page.\n - Text entered into the input box for a room will be preserved across\n   room swaps.\n\nBug fixes:\n - Fixed a bug where auto-scroll for images did not work correctly.\n - Fixed a bug which resulted in a partially populated room when another\n   device joined a room.\n - Fixed a bug which prevented files with the same name being uploaded\n   sequentially.\n - Correctly remove redacted event text from the recent activity list.\n - Firefox: Can now join rooms which have a double ## alias.\n\nImprovements:\n - Modified Settings page layout.\n - Angular SDK now relies on the Javascript SDK for new API features.\n - Transparent images will now be shown on a white background.\n - GIFs are now marked as such on the thumbnail for the image.\n - The web client version is now shown in Settings.\n\n","id":"/blog/2015/03/12/introducing-matrix-console-for-ios-and-android-web-client-0-6-5/","title":"Introducing Matrix Console for iOS (and Android) + Web client 0.6.5"},"/blog/2015/03/14/matrix-at-enterprise-connect-2015/":{"body":"Quick heads up that Matrix.org is going to be at Enterprise Connect next week in Orlando.

Naturally, we also use Matrix to communicate with each other. For some time now we've had an IRC bot sitting on specific channels to \"bridge\" together IRC and Matrix. This bot simply sent IRC messages when it received Matrix messages and vice versa. As we started to rely on it more and more though, we realised that there were things that were impossible for simple client-side bots to do by themselves. This spurred the development of Application Services which I introduced in my previous post. In this blog post, I want to outline some of the features and techniques of the IRC application service which we've been working on over the past few weeks.\nFeatures:\n\n\tSpecific channel-to-matrix room bridging : This is what the original IRC bot did. You can specify specific channels and specific room IDs, and messages will be bridged.\n\tDynamic channel-to-matrix room bridging : This allows Matrix users to join any channel on an IRC network, rather than being forced to use one of the specific channels configured.\n\tTwo-way PM support : IRC users can PM the virtual \"M-\" users and private Matrix rooms will be created. Likewise, Matrix users can invite the virtual \"@irc_Nick:domain\" user IDs to a room and a PM to the IRC nick will be made.\n\tIRC nick changing support : Matrix users are no longer forced to use \"M-\" nicks and can change them by sending \"!nick\" messages directly to the bridge.\n\tIdent support : This allows usernames to be authenticated for virtual IRC clients, which means IRC bans can be targeted at the Matrix user rather than the entire application service.\n\nThe use of the Application Services API means:\n\n\tThe bot can reserve user IDs. This prevents humans from registering for @irc_... user IDs which would then clash with the operation of the bot.\n\tThe bot can reserve room aliases. This prevents humans from register for #irc_... aliases which would then clash with the operation of the bot.\n\tThe bot can trivially manage hundreds of users. Events are pushed to the application service directly. If you tried to do this as a client-side bot, you would need one event stream connection per virtual user.\n\tThe bot can lazily create rooms on demand. This means Matrix users can join non-existent room aliases and have the application service quickly track an IRC channel and create a room with that alias, allowing the join request to succeed.\n\nImplementation details:\n\n\tWritten in Node.js, designed to be run using forever.\n        Built on the generic matrix-appservice-node framework.\n\tSupports sending metrics in statsd format.\n\tUses matrix-appservice-node to provide a standardised interface when writing application services, rather than an explicit web framework (though under the hood matrix-appservice-node is using Express).\n\nAt present, the IRC application service is in beta, and is being run on #matrix and #matrix-dev. If you want to give it a go, check it out on Github&nbsp;- it is not currently released on npm. N.B. it requires features from the develop branch of synapse; either run your own synapse off the develop branch or wait a few days for us to release Synapse 0.9.0.\nNeedless to say, we look forward to this being the first of many full network&lt;-&gt;network bridges into Matrix - come chat on #matrix:matrix.org if you'd like to write or run your own!

Pick a port. prometheus itself defaults to 9090, so starting just above that for locally monitored services seems reasonable. E.g. 9092:\nAdd to homeserver.yaml\nmetrics_port: 9092\nRestart synapse\n\n3: Check out synapse-prometheus-confighttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse-prometheus-config\n4: Add synapse.html and synapse.rulesThe .html file needs to appear in prometheus's consoles directory, and the .rules file needs to be invoked somewhere in the main config file. A symlink to each from the git checkout into the prometheus directory might be easiest to ensure git pull keeps it updated.\n5: Add a prometheus target for synapseThis is easiest if prometheus runs on the same machine as synapse, as it can then just use localhost:\nglobal: {'{'}\n  rule_file: \"synapse.rules\"\n{'}'}\njob: {'{'}\nname: \"synapse\"\ntarget_group: {'{'}\ntarget: \"http://localhost:9092/\"\n{'}'}\n{'}'}\n\n\n6: Start prometheus:./prometheus -config.file=prometheus.conf\n\n\n7: Wait a few seconds for it to start and perform the first scrape,then visit the console:\nhttp://server-where-prometheus-runs:9090/consoles/synapse.html\n\nAnd the end result looks something like...\n\n...amongst many many other system &amp; application metrics.\nYou can grab the latest version of the tutorial at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/metrics-howto.md - thanks to Leo for writing it up.

MatrixKit sits between MatrixSDK and your existing iOS app.\nIt provides customisable UIViewControllers a developer can integrate in their app.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to add to your app a screen to chat in a room, you just need to use the MXKRoomViewController.\nWe made MatrixKit so that the components it provides are easy to integrate but also easy to customise.

With few lines of code we connected it to MatrixKit data models. Yes, data models provided by MatrixKit are reusable too.\nMatrixKit is also highly extensible. If you want to create new table cells to render messages, new views, new view controllers, etc, you will find a place to hook them into the MatrixKit code.\nMatrixKit repository is here:&nbsp;https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-kit&nbsp;and it is available via CocoaPods (the MatrixKit pod).\nIn parallel of MatrixKit, we did some spring-cleaning - the official Matrix.org iOS offerings are now split into three github repos.

The problem here is that the Parrot firmware and C SDK provides H.264 video, but doesn't package it up at all for use with WebRTC - let alone using interoperable signalling like Matrix.

The first wave of all this new work landed today in the form of a new major version release (0.1.0) of matrix-js-sdk: our javascript SDK library.\nThe history of JS client support on Matrix is that in the original rush to get a PoC webclient out the door back in September, we jumped straight to talking to the Matrix HTTP API from Angular controllers in 'syweb'.  This then got split into an Angular SDK (matrix-angular-sdk) containing a bunch of services for handling the Matrix client state with the actual webapp sitting alongside as an example of the SDK.  This then in turn got split into a basic matrix-js-sdk (wrapping the Matrix client-server HTTP API) and matrix-angular-sdk (handling the clientside state and exposing it as Angular services) - and this is how the current demo Angular webapp works at http://matrix.org/beta.\nHowever, this poses a major problem if you want a richer client SDK but don't want to use Angular - e.g. if you prefer another framework (or no framework at all), or are using the SDK in an Application Service or similar.  So, this has prompted a major upgrade to the matrix-js-sdk in order to extend it to act both as a simple wrapper of the Matrix Client-Server HTTP API, but also expose a full object and event model to describe the state of a Matrix client together with all the higher level functions to drive it.  To quote from the README:\n\nThis SDK provides a full object model around the Matrix Client-Server API and emits events for incoming data and state changes. Aside from wrapping the HTTP API, it:\n\nHandles syncing (via /initialSync and /events)\nHandles the generation of \"friendly\" room and member names.\nHandles historical RoomMember information (e.g. display names).\nManages room member state across multiple events (e.g. it handles typing, power levels and membership changes).\nExposes high-level objects like Rooms, RoomState, RoomMembers and Users which can be listened to for things like name changes, new messages, membership changes, presence changes, and more.\n\nLater versions of the SDK will:\n\nAutomatically retry requests to send messages due to network errors.\nAutomatically retry requests to send messages due to rate limiting errors.\nMark events' sent status (e.g. 'not sent').\nHandle \"local echo\" of messages sent.\nHandle queueing of messages.\nHandle pagination.\nExpose a RoomSummary which would be suitable for a recents page.\nProvide different pluggable storage layers (e.g. local storage, database-backed)\n\n\nIt also is designed to provide an API that abstracts both version 1 of the client-server API and the upcoming version 2 (which fixes various thinkos we've discovered along the way in v1).\nThis is incredibly exciting stuff as it now gives a really robust yet lightweight API for client-side and application-service development in JavaScript.  Predictably enough we're using it to develop our new reusable web UI components, and I suspect we'll see new Node-based application services making use of in the near future.  Meanwhile, it's more than topical as it should run straight on top of the Tessel JavaScript hardware modules we're giving away this weekend as our prize for the best hack built on Matrix at TADHack - letting the little Tessel ARM system-on-a-chip speak a very rich and native Matrix dialect!\nThe new matrix-js-sdk comes with comprehensive jsdoc detailing the new API which you can find at http://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-js-sdk/global.html.  There are also some basic examples available, including a new simple node-powered command-line client designed for testing the SDK.  Finally, if you're interested in reading the design process by which we've converged on the current API, all the details may be found in JIRA on SYJS-5.\nSo: if you've been itching to get your hands on a much more powerful pure-JS Matrix SDK, now's your chance!  It's very early days for the new API so we expect to see a few incompatible changes on the horizon, but we encourage you to have a play and tell us what you think!.\nTo find out more, go check out the project at http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk, or if you're feeling daring just grab the library with npm install matrix-js-sdk and get hacking!\n","id":"/blog/2015/06/12/introducing-all-new-matrix-js-sdk-v0-1-0/","title":"Introducing all new matrix-js-sdk v0.1.0"},"/blog/2015/06/12/synapse-0-9-2-released/":{"body":"Happy Friday everyone!\nOver the past two weeks, we have been hunting down some more performance issues in Synapse, as well as fixing a few potential bugs in the new backfill feature that we introduced in 0.9.1.

Some were working from home, and others gathered at one of the 14 official locations. Matrix were physically present at the London and Lisbon locations, and we also handed out two prizes (a massive amount of tessel modules) to the best hacks using Matrix in some way or another.\nAfter a hectic weekend, over 90 different hacks were submitted and presented. There was a live stream available (archive here) so that everyone could watch all the submissions. We were of course particularly interested in Matrix-related hacks, and there were several:\n\n\tMatt Williams continued his Project Clearwater/Matrix integration from TADHack-mini London earlier this year; this time he added support for IM{'&lt;-&gt;'}SIP MESSAGEs. \n\tRob Pickering bridged his company's keevio system to Matrix via the AS API.\n\tSacha Nacar and Mike Dauphinais wrote a sign-language interpreter that uses Matrix for conversations.\n\tIgor Pavlov made it possible for users of Lytespark to be contacted via Matrix and OpenMarket's SMS AS when they are offline.\n\tPhani Pasupula showed a PoC for using Matrix as a platform for starting a Dialogic XMS conference.\n\nIn the end, we had to pick only two of these awesome hacks, which wasn't easy. We are really encouraged by seeing the Matrix ecosystem grow bigger - and more bridges to various existing systems being built; this is exactly what Matrix needs!\nWe awarded our two prizes to Igor for his use of OpenMarket's SMS AS, which adds a new and very wanted feature to Lytespark - and Sacha/Mike for their inventive sign-language -&gt; Matrix translator. Congrats to all of you! We were also happy to see Phani win one of Dialogic's prizes with his hack!\nBelow you can watch our two winners' presentations:\n\n\nThe TADHack blog has a list of all the winners: local winners and global winners.

This is to avoid flooding either IRC or Matrix with lurkers when the bridge initially joins a channel.  We have some plans to improve this in future - see BOTS-53 for some of the sordid details.\nWe don't synchronise joins/parts currently to avoid flooding Matrix with lots of IRC join/part spam.  Again, this will improve in future.\nYou can't join +k channels.\nKicks/bans/invites and other ACLs currently don't propagate between IRC &amp; Matrix.  (I.e. a Matrix user can be kicked from IRC, but it'll continue to sit in Matrix unless also kicked for there).  +i chanmode supported however.\nBridged public IRC rooms are not yet advertised in the public room list on matrix.org.\nIt should be possible to change the nickname of your IRC user by messaging !nick irc.freenode.net MrFlibble to @appservice-irc:matrix.org.

As such, it feels only right to have a quick update on where we've got to so far, and where we expect things to go from here!\nBack at the original launch, all we had was a very rough and ready Synapse homeserver, an early draft of the spec, and precisely one client - the Angular webclient, much of which was mainly written at the last minute on the plane to TechCrunch Disrupt SF (and has never quite recovered :S). From this initial seed it's been incredibly exciting and slightly scary to see how much things have advanced and grown - the big headlines for the past year (in roughly chronological order) include:\n\n\tMaking Federation Work:\n\n\tSwitching all of federation over to SSL, using perspectives for key management\n\tCrypto-signing all the events in a room's message graph to assert integrity\n\tSorting out 'power levels' and 'auth events' to allow totally decentralised kicks/bans/etc to work in an open federated environment\n\n\n\tDecentralised content repository and thumbnailing\n\tReference mobile \"Matrix Console\" clients for iOS and Android\n\tOfficial client SDKs for iOS and Android - both at the API wrapping layer and the reusable UI component layer\n\tPush notifications for APNS and GCM (both on server &amp; clients)\n\tOfficial client SDKs for JavaScript, Python and Perl\n\tTyping notifications\n\tThe sytest integration test harness\n\tProper WebRTC support for VoIP, including TURN.\n\tApplication Services and Bots - actually letting Matrix defragment communications :)\n\n\tBridging to all of Freenode, Moznet and other IRC networks\n\tMatrix&lt;-&gt;SMS bridge from OpenMarket\n\tSIP bridges via FreeSWITCH and Verto\n\tParrot Bebop Drone &lt;-&gt; Matrix bridge via Janus\n\tODB2 telemetry &lt;-&gt; &nbsp;Matrix bridge via Android SDK\n\tReusable bridging framework in Node\n\n\n\tMany iterations and refinements to the spec, including designing v2 of the client SDK\n\tSwitching from Angular to React for all of our web-client development\n\tCustomisable skins and embedding support for the matrix-react-sdk\n\tEnd-to-end encryption (not quite formally released yet, but it's written, specced and it works!)\n\tVoIP support on mobile (landed in Android; still experimenting with different WebRTC stacks on iOS)\n\tHistory ACLs\n\tDelivery reports\n\tSwitching from access_tokens to macaroons for authentication (not yet released)\n\tLots and lots of performance work on Synapse, as we've tried to get the most out of Twisted.\n\n...and last but not least, the evolution of the #matrix:matrix.org community - including loads of 3rd party clients, SDKs and application services, synapse packaging and even experimental home servers :)\nOverall the last year was an exercise in actually fleshing out the whole ecosystem of Matrix and getting it to a stable usable beta acceptable to early adopters. The plan for the next 12 months is then to make the transition from stable beta to a properly production grade environment that can be used to run large scale services used by normal end-users. In practice, this means:\n\n\tA major rearchitecture of Synapse.\n\n\tSynapse currently has no support for horizontal scaling or clustering within a single instance, and many will have seen the performance problems we've hit with a relatively monolithic Twisted app architecture.&nbsp;Profiling deferreds in Twisted has been a particular nightmare.\n\tDuring September we are starting the process of splitting Synapse apart into separate services (e.g. separating reading eventstreams from writing messages) both to allow horizontal scalability and to experiment with implementing the services in more efficient languages than Python/Twisted.\n\tWe will continue the normal Synapse release process in parallel with this work.\n\n\n\tEnsuring Matrix can support a genuinely excellent UX for normal end-users on glossy clients, and supporting glossy client development as required. &nbsp;The days of Matrix being just for powerusers are numbered... :)\n\tSwitching to use 3rd party IDs as the primary means of referring to users in Matrix, hiding matrix IDs as a feature for powerusers and developers.\n\tFinishing the spec. You may have noticed the spec has been quietly evolving over the last few months - finally gaining a versioning system, and with larger chunks of it being automatically generated from formal API spec descriptions. We will be finishing off and filling in the remaining holes.\n\tImproving the documentation (and FAQ!) on matrix.org in general by switching to a git-backed jekyll system for all the staticish content\n\tReplace the Angular-based reference webapp bundled with Synapse entirely with a matrix-react-sdk based reference app, and providing better examples and documentation for using it to embed Matrix functionality into existing websites.\n\tMoving to v2 of the client-server API. This fixes some significant limitations in the v1 API that everyone's been using all year, and should improve performance significantly for many use cases (especially when launching apps). The v1 API will hang around for a very very long time for backwards compatibility.\n\tWriting *lots* more bridges and integrations to other protocols, now we have a nice framework for rapidly developing them.\n\tGeneral security audits and double-checking the security model.\n\tNew features, including:\n\n\tMultiway VoIP and Video conferencing, most likely using FreeSWITCH's new conferencing capabilities via an Application Service bridge (should be ready very shortly!)\n\tGetting E2E crypto reviewed/audited and putting it live across the board.\n\tAdding VoIP to iOS\n\tImplementing delivery reports in all clients\n\tImproving how invites work (ability to reject them; metadata about where they came from)\n\tSearch API\n\tImproved file management\n\n\n\t...and an awful lot of bug fixing as we work through the backlog we've accumulated on JIRA.\n\nHopefully this won't take up all year(!) and is just a beginning - there's a huge list of interesting ideas beyond this baseline which we'll be looking at assuming the core stuff above is on track. For instance, we need to work out how to decentralise the identity services that mapping 3rd party IDs to matrix IDs. We need to work out how to avoid spam. And it could be fascinating to start bridging more internet-of-things devices and ecosystems into Matrix, or decentralising user accounts between homeservers, or perhaps using Matrix for synchronising more sophisticated data structures than timelines and key-value state dictionaries...\nFinally, we also want to save as much time as possible to help support the wider community in building out clients, services and servers on top of Matrix. Just like the web itself, Matrix is only as useful as the content and services built on top of it - and we will do everything we can to help the pioneers who are interested in colonising this brave new world :)\nHuge thanks to everyone over the last year who have supported us - whether that's by creating an account and using the system, running a homeserver, hacking on top of the platform, contributing to the core project, enduring one of our presentations, or even paying for us to work on this. The coming year should prove incredibly interesting, and we hope you'll stay and bring along all your friends, family and colleagues for the ride as the adventure continues!\nMatthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix.org team.\n","id":"/blog/2015/09/07/matrix-one-year-in/","title":"Matrix: One year in."},"/blog/2015/09/10/voip-calling-now-supported-in-android-matrix-console/":{"body":"The Android Matrix Console app has been updated to v0.4.4, and now supports voice and video calling!

Find more information here - and a recording of their presentation here.

When a blog goes quiet it normally means that either the authors have got bored, or they're too busy building cool stuff to keep it updated. I'm happy to say that option 2 is the case here!\nAs a result, there's a huge backlog of really cool stuff we should have talked about. Hopes of writing an Advent Calendar series of blog posts also went out the window as we set Christmas as an arbitrary deadline for loads of work on Synapse, the Matrix Spec and matrix-react-sdk.\nSo, to try to break the impasse, here's a slightly unorthodox whistle-stop tour of all the amazing blogposts we would have written if we'd had time. And perhaps some of them will actually expand into full write-ups when we have more time to spare in the future :)\nEnd to End Encryption Update\nOne of the great promises of Matrix is to provide End-to-end encryption as part of the baseline standard (configurable per-room). In practice, our progress has been a little non-linear - we started writing an Axolotl ratchet implementation in C++14 (with a pure C API) named Olm back in February, and then finished it off and wired a basic 1:1 proof-of-concept implementation into matrix-react-sdk in June. We then announced Olm back at the wonderful Jardin Entropique conference in Rennes:\n\nYou can read the full presentation that we gave at https://matrix.org/~matthew/2015-06-26 Matrix Jardin Entropique.pdf - and you can even play with a very basic test jig at https://matrix.org/~markjh/olm/javascript/demo.html which uses an emscripten compiled version of Olm in the browser to put the ratchet through its paces.\nThings then stalled for a bit, but as of this month they're moving again, and if you're interested in the progress you can read all about it at:\n\nhttps://matrix.org/jira/browse/SPEC-162\nand a full draft spec at http://matrix.org/speculator/spec/drafts%2Fe2e/client_server.html#end-to-end-encryption\nthe Olm git repo at http://matrix.org/git/olm/about/\nand the formal Olm spec at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/olm.html\n\nThe main stuff remaining is basically key management (in Synapse and the matrix spec), group conversation ratchets, and UX for wiring it properly into various Matrix clients.  We expect to make progress on this over the next few months :)\nMeanwhile, huge kudos to Tor who was crazy enough to add the basic 1:1 Olm ratchet to Weechat before we'd even finished writing our test jig!\nLean DUS\nA few days after Jardin Entropique we made it to Lean DUS - a great tech meetup in Düsseldorf organised by Sipgate, who were kind enough to invite us to speak.  This was a chance to give a full update on Matrix (as of July!) and talk some more about Olm and plans for end-to-end encryption.  This one got recorded - and you can see it below.  There's also an official page with full videos, slide deck and photos up at https://www.leandus.de/2015/08/weil-und-hodgson/.\n\nLean Dus #9 - End to end encryption for decentralised communication mit Matthew Hodgson from sipgate on Vimeo.\nNew Matrix Bridges\nSomehow we've failed to blog about the amazing matrix-appservice-bridge Node framework which we've built as general purpose infrastructure for building Matrix Application Services which act as bridges between existing networks and comms solutions and Matrix.  The architecture here looks something like this:\n\n...and the goal is to end up with something like this:\n\nmatrix-appservice-bridge is still in development, but there are a bunch of really cool bridges already using it - and a great howto that shows how you can use it to write a Matrix{'&lt;-&gt;'}Slack bridge in under 100 lines of code.\n\n  the Matrix/Verto Bridge uses it to hook FreeSWITCH up to Matrix - currently used to provide multiway video and voice conferencing for Vector.  It could be easily extended to do generic Matrix{'&lt;-&gt;'}SIP or Matrix{'&lt;-&gt;'}anything-that-FreeSWITCH-can-speak though.\n  a basic Matrix/Slack Bridge, which works well enough for hardcoding bridges between specific Matrix and Slack rooms.\n  matrix-appservice-respoke - a crazy experiment that bridges Asterisk to Matrix by implementing the Respoke API such that Asterisk can connect to Matrix using chan_respoke.\n  matrix-appservice-purple - another crazy experiment that hooks libpurple up to matrix-appservice-bridge such that *any* network that libpurple can talk to can be bridged into Matrix.  So far we've experimented with Lync, Skype and Facebook (and AIM(!)) and it works - but it needs a lot more love to be usable other than as a toy.\n\nMeanwhile, there's also:\n\n the Matrix/IRC Bridge, which doesn't actually use it yet, but will do soon.\n an experimental Golang Matrix/Slack Bridge, which looks at whether we should be doing this all in Golang rather than Node.\n\nAs of right now our work on bridging has been on hiatus for a month or so, and we would love support from the community in advancing and extending the stuff we've built so far.  Otherwise we'll get back to it ourselves in the new year.\nAstricon 2015\nWe had a lot of fun in Orlando in October at Astricon 2015 - we put together matrix-appservice-respoke (see above) for our talk and Dangerous Demo in a desperate 24 hour hack and it even worked!  The judges were kind enough to give us the \"Swan Award\" prize in the dangerous demo shoot-out for the glossiest demo :)\n\n\nThe slides for our 'Bridging Asterisk to the Matrix Ecosystem' talk are downloadable here.\nPidgin!\nWe also implemented a basic libpurple plugin for Matrix - adding Matrix support to any app like Pidgin or Bitlbee that uses libpurple.  (You could in theory even use it with matrix-appservice-purple to bridge from Matrix to Matrix, but that'd be silly :).  It supports basic functionality and uses the new 'v2' APIs for syncing to Matrix.  Adventurous libpurplers can go check it out and experiment with it from https://github.com/matrix-org/purple-matrix - feedback welcome.\nOpenWebRTC Support on iOS\nWe went and hooked OpenWebRTC up to matrix-ios-sdk so that iOS Matrix apps can use the OpenWebRTC stack from Ericsson Research for VoIP and Video.  Apparently we haven't written it up fully yet, but you can find the code at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-openwebrtc-wrapper for those interested in using OWR with Matrix!\nDebian Repository for Synapse\nWe built a 3rd party Debian package repository for Synapse... and then forgot to tell anyone about it, other than buried in the Synapse readme!  Well, it exists, and intrepid debianers should go check it out at http://matrix.org/packages/debian/.\nTADSummit\nIn November we attended TADSummit in Lisbon - a great event for folks hacking on telco applications and the telcos themselves.  Apparently we failed to do a writeup, but we had a wonderful time: highlights included sitting down with Maarten Ectors from Canonical to wrap up Synapse as an Ubuntu Snappy app such that anyone in the Ubuntu Core ecosystem can trivially run a Matrix homeserver, and demoing it as part of the Dangerous Demos track there.  We also gave a 'Matrix: One Year In' talk to summarise what we got up to in 2015.\n\n\nWebRTC Paris\nWhilst on the subject of conferences that we forgot to write up - we just got back from WebRTC Paris, where we demoed the latest &amp; greatest Matrix clients and bridges, hung out with the OpenWebRTC guys and gave another ecosystem update.  You can see the slides at https://matrix.org/~daniel/Matrix- One-year Status Report.pdf.\n\nNew Clients and App Services\nThere have been a flurry of really interesting new clients and other projects which certainly deserve whole blog posts of their own!\nThere's Tensor from David A Roberts - a multiplatform native client written in QML that heavily leverages the matrix-js-sdk:\n\nThere's matrix.el from Ryan Rix - a native Matrix client for Emacs! You can read all about the whys and wherefores here.\n\nThere's also loads of cool stuff that Ryan's been doing with Matrix on his blog - including Polynomial - a decentralised webring built on Matrix (yes, webrings were and are cool, ok!?!), and his Matrix-powered Body Computing System.  Also, some philosophical posts on the benefits of Matrix which give us some hope that we're on the right track!\nThen there's Power Take-Off from Torrie Fischer - an early lets-IRC-clients-connect-to-Matrix project in Rust...\n...and there's Morpheus from Christine Dodrill (Xena) - a Matrix client and bot framework for Haskell; part of a more over-arching IRC{'&lt;-&gt;'}Matrix unification project.  Xena also wrote a great call to arms for Matrix :)\nVery recently there's the Ruma project from Jimmy Cuadra - an ambitious mission to build Matrix components (up to and including a homeserver) in Rust!\nOther stuff includes a Hubot adaptor from davidar, Bender: an Elixir client and bot library from Dylan Griffith, Jon Frederickson's matrix-xmpp-bridge, rzr's guide to installing synapse on a minnowmax, and I'm sure many others we don't know about or have missed!\nFinally, Tor has done an amazing job on weechat-matrix-protocol-script in implementing features like V2 Sync and E2E crypto faster than we've managed to add them in the official client SDKs!\nRelease Zero of the Matrix Specification\nWe have made some major improvements to the spec over the last few months: adding in feature profiles and spec modules to better structure the document, and most recently splitting it up explicitly into separate Client-Server, Server-Server and Application-Server APIs, each with a well-defined single global 'release' number for versioning.  We started this with a 'r0.0.0' release of the Client-Server API, which consolidates the horrible mess of 'v1' and 'v2' APIs we had previously flying around into a single well-defined version of the spec.  Meanwhile the spec is now entirely consolidated into a set of JSON schema and Swagger 2 API descriptors, with a bunch of ReStructured Text for the verbiage - you can find it all at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc.\nThe r0.0.0 changelog is exciting stuff - you can see it in its entirety at http://matrix.org/docs/spec/r0.0.0/client_server.html#changelog.  Synapse itself will support the full r0 API set in 0.12, which will be released any day now.\nWe've also switched the Swagger-based API viewer over to Swagger 2.0: http://matrix.org/docs/api.  We also rejigged the Matrix documentation website entirely, generating it via Jekyll and adding in a new guides section.\nAlso, we should have mentioned the existence of Speculator - a golang helper app (source here) which, as the name suggests, renders out copies of the spec as HTML from different branches and pull requests for ease of previewing.\nDendron\nOver the last few months we've also started an entirely new project, codenamed Dendron.  Dendron is the project to evolve Synapse from the current single-threaded Python/Twisted monolithic homeserver into something with a lot more type-safety, horizontal scalability and high availability.  We've mainly been experimenting with different ways of doing this, but the current plan is to split Synapse itself up into multiple services which can each scale independently, and then rewrite some/all of them in languages with better type safety and/or performance or profiling tools.\nSome folks may remember a survey that we posted a few months ago asking for the community's thoughts on what languages they'd like their ideal homeserver to be written in, from the perspectives of someone running it as well as hacking on it.  Whilst we haven't (at all) based our decisions for Dendron purely on the survey, it was still quite an interesting exercise.  And here are the results (maximum 'score' is 5, not 10):\n\n\nThe basic feedback was that from the existing community: folks dislike running Java or Node servers; are okayish with Python, but would prefer native or near-native code (be that C, Rust or Go). Meanwhile, for contributing code, there's slightly more interest in the (relatively) new shinies of Go and Rust.  And of course, everyone wanted to plug their own special snowflake language in the 'Others' section, which was mainly a mix of Erlang, Elixir, Haskell, Lisp and Perl :)\nThis reinforced the choices we were looking at anyway - either Rust (for its safety), or Go (for its simplicity, python-likeness, and concurrency).  (We'd also consider Java, but have to concede that the FOSS community doesn't like running it.)\nSo we looked at the dependencies that Synapse currently has, and the Rust equivalents, and concluded that the Rust ecosystem unfortunately isn't quite mature enough yet to reliably handle the rather large set of complicated deps that we need in a homeserver.  Also, nobody on the core team is really a Rust guru yet.  Meanwhile, we have at least one ex-Google Go expert in the core team, and in practice it has the edge in terms of maturity.  So, right now, we're looking at switching chunks of Dendron to Go where it makes sense.  (This is subject to change though depending on how we get on).  You should expect to hear a lot more about Dendron in 2016 :)\nmatrix-react-sdk, Vector, and latest Matrix features\nLast but not least: huge amounts of our time over the last year has gone into building matrix-react-sdk - a full set of glossy Web UI components for building super-high quality glossy apps based on Matrix, built on the matrix-js-sdk.  This is basically a reaction against the original matrix-angular-sdk and Matrix Console app that we launched Matrix with back in 2014 - which had minimal attention to UI/UX and suffered from major performance problems; it was built purely as the fastest possible way we knew to prototype and demo Matrix in the first place.  matrix-react-sdk however has been built for both performance and quality of UI/UX, as well as obviously using all the latest and greatest Matrix APIs.  (In fact, the transition from matrix-angular-sdk to matrix-react-sdk is pretty similar to the Synapse to Dendron transition on the horizon - although the latter should be more incremental and less 'rewrite the world').\nMeanwhile, as part of our commercial work at our day job (i.e. not as Matrix.org) we've been helping on a glossy FOSS app called Vector which is layered on top of matrix-react-sdk as a thin 'skin' layer of CSS and a few custom components.  The intention for Vector is to ensure that Matrix has a flagship glossy client: which it clearly needs, in order to gain credibility and drive uptake of the Matrix standard, and also ensure that the Matrix standard actually does indeed fit the needs for a state-of-the-art collaboration tool.\nmatrix-react-sdk (and thus Vector) is still in incredibly heavy development - we're going to start a formal beta fairly soon, but as of right now it's still sprouting features and refinements on a daily basis.  Meanwhile matrix-react-sdk's APIs are not remotely frozen (we entirely refactored it as recently as a few weeks ago), so not yet ready for use as a general purpose building block.\nSome of the stuff going into react-sdk is incredibly cool - recent Matrix stuff that it shows off includes:\n\n Animated read receipts.  If you haven't seen these, you haven't lived.  They are a relatively new addition to the Matrix spec.\n Full server-side search.  We now have full-text search in the Matrix spec, and implemented on synapse both on sqlite and postgres - and now in Vector too.  Having good search over all of your chat history makes Matrix *so* much more usable.\n Video conferencing.  We have full multi-way conferencing in Vector via matrix-appservice-verto and FreeSWITCH.  The intention is to add this to the core Matrix spec (having first made it a bit more generic) - see the draft spec for details.\n 3rd party invites.  You can now invite users into Matrix by email address as well as matrix ID, and it works.  Vector implements this.\n Room tagging.  You can now tag rooms as favourites, low priority, or with arbitrary namespaced metadata.  Vector implements this through a swanky drag &amp; drop UI.\n \"V2\" Sync API.  Now part of the 'r0.0.0' spec, this lets Matrix support much smarter incremental and partial synchronisation patterns.  Vector now implements this, meaning that browser windows sync much faster after being offline for a bit, and no longer hammer the user with stale desktop notifications.\n Accessing 'historical' rooms.  Matrix now lets you keep track of rooms you've left, so you can view and search the conversation logs even after you've left the conversation.  Vector now implements this (as of Monday!)\n Tab-complete that doesn't suck.  This is a purely client-side feature which landed on Thursday!\n Roll-overable animated GIFs.  'nuff said.\n Markdown support. yay!\n Synchronised read and notification history.  This hasn't landed yet (in vector or synapse or even the spec), but finally provides a way to keep read and notification state in sync in realtime across all your clients and a meaningful favicon 'badge' telling you how many notifications you missed!\n Guest access.  This hasn't landed in Vector yet, but it's in the spec and Synapse.  It will let folks use Matrix without having to create an account (at least for rooms which support 'guest access' from the public).\n\nIf you haven't given Vector a spin, it's well worth heading over to https://vector.im and taking a look.\nThere's also an Electron desktop version of Vector in progress, contributed by Steven Hammerton at https://github.com/stevenhammerton/vector-desktop (although it's currently stuck on an old release).\nEpilogue\nOkay, this has got a lot longer than it was meant to be - but hopefully makes up a bit for the lack of comms over the last few months whilst we've been drowning in work on Synapse, Vector, the Spec, Dendron, and everything else mentioned above.\n2015 has been an epic year as we've taken Matrix from a very early beta to the advanced stage that it's at now.  Obviously there's still a lot of stuff to do though.  Right now we expect the focus in 2016 to be:\n\n Vector - making sure the Matrix protocol has a flagship glossy FOSS client that normal (non-geek) users can use.\n  Dendron - making Synapse more reliable, scalable and maintainable.\n Bridging - wiring as much of the rest of the world into Matrix as accurately and efficiently as possible.\n Federation Spec - finishing and releasing the Server-Server API.\n End-to-end crypto - finishing it off.\n\n...and obviously continuing to refine and extend the core of Matrix itself with features like threading, editable messages, and possibly even distributed accounts.\nThere are very fun and exciting times ahead.  We'd just like to say a profound thank you to everyone who's supported Matrix this far and helped make this mission possible - whether it's by running clients/servers/services, or writing your own, or filing bugs and feedback on our code or the spec, or telling folks about the project, or paying us to work on it(!), or just by reading this blog post.  Hopefully 2016 will be the year where online communication starts to open up and interoperate once again, rather than becoming ever more fragmented and closed.\nThanks for reading - and Merry Christmas, for those who celebrate :)\n\nMatthew, Amandine &amp; the Matrix Team.\n\n","id":"/blog/2015/12/25/the-matrix-holiday-special/","title":"The Matrix Holiday Special!"},"/blog/2022/":{"body":"","id":"/blog/2022/","title":""},"/blog/2022/09/":{"body":"","id":"/blog/2022/09/","title":""},"/blog/2022/09/02/synapse-1-66-released/":{"body":"Hey all, we've just released Synapse 1.66! Let's have a\nlook at what's inside this release.\nRemoval of email verification delegation\nBefore Synapse 1.66, homeserver administrators had the possibility to\nconfigure Synapse to delegate verifying email addresses to an identity\nserver (using the account_threepid_delegates.email configuration setting).\nThis feature relied on old APIs from the Matrix specification that have since\nbeen removed from it.\nSynapse 1.64 announced the\ndeprecation of this feature, and the addition of a warning at startup when\nthe configuration setting is in use.\nAs of Synapse 1.66, support for this feature has been fully removed, and\nSynapse will refuse to start if the configuration setting for it is in use.\nIf this has not already been done, administrators of servers that were\npreviously using this feature are encouraged to configure an SMTP server that\nSynapse can use to verify email addresses on its own. See the\nconfiguration guide\nfor more information.\nAlso see the upgrade notes\nfor more information.\nPlanned removal of support for TCP replication\nMost server administrators already know that Synapse can be made to scale\nhorizontally by deploying workers. Workers are\nprocesses running alongside Synapse's main process to allow offloading some\nof the work it would otherwise be doing, load balancing some of the traffic,\netc.\nIn a deployment of Synapse that uses workers, these processes use replication\nto share information between themselves. One of the earliest protocols\nSynapse used for replication was built on top of TCP.\nSynapse 1.18 introduced a new\nRedis-based replication protocol for workers to use and deprecated the\nTCP-based protocol, without specifying a removal date.\nThis week we're announcing that support for TCP replication will be removed\nfrom Synapse in version 1.67, which is expected to come out around Sep 13th.\nSee the release notes for more\ndetails.\nEverything else\nSynapse 1.66 also includes some improvements to validation on endpoints using\nUser-Interactive Authentication.\nThis version of Synapse also adds compression support for federation traffic.\nSee the configuration guide\nfor more information on how to compress HTTP traffic.\nFurthermore, Synapse 1.66 improves the Room Details amin API\nand allows administrators to see if all local users have marked a given room\nas \"forgotten\".\nSee the full\nchangelog for a\ncomplete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the\nupgrade\nnotes\nfor this version.\nSynapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend\nour thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no\nparticular order) Dirk Klimpel and\nAntonin Loubiere, as well as anyone\nhelping us make Synapse better by sharing their feedback and reporting\nissues.\n","id":"/blog/2022/09/02/synapse-1-66-released/","title":"Synapse 1.66 released"},"/blog/2022/09/02/this-week-in-matrix-2022-09-02/":{"body":"Matrix Live 🎙\n\nDept of Spec 📜\n\n    uhoreg reports\n\n    \nHere's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.\nMSC Status\nMerged MSCs:\n\nNo MSCs were merged this week.\n\nMSCs in Final Comment Period:\n\nNo MSCs are in FCP.\n\nNew MSCs:\n\nThere were no new MSCs this week.\n\nSpec Core Team\nIt's been a light week for the spec core team, but we have been looking at MSC3862 and MSC3758.  These are two proposals that try to extend push rules in different ways to be able to match more than just strings.  So we have been discussing the relative merits of both proposals.\nRandom MSC of the Week\nThe random MSC of the week is... MSC3386: Unified Join Rules!\nCurrently, a room can be set so that prospective members can knock to request to join the room, or allow members of a different room to join.  However a room cannot be set up to allow both; MSC3386 proposes a change to the join rules to change this.\n\n\n\nDept of Servers 🏢\nSynapse (website)\nSynapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team\nShay reports\n\nThis week we released Synapse 1.66.0! Some notable features are:\n\nAdding forgotten status to Room Details Admin API.\nAdding an experimental implementation for MSC3852 (Expose user agents on Device).\nAdding org.matrix.msc2716v4 experimental room version with updated content fields. Part of MSC2716 (Importing history)\nAdding support for compression to federation responses.\nImproving performance of sending messages in rooms with thousands of local users.\n\nPlus a host of bugfixes and other changes to make Synapse faster and leaner! Take a look. https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.66.0. In addition, work continues on fast room joins-stay tuned, as we are getting closer to the finish line.\n\nDendrite (website)\nSecond generation Matrix homeserver\nTill says\n\nThis week we released Dendrite 0.9.6 which includes a number of fixes, including a rewrite of the appservice component:\nFeatures\n\nThe appservice API has been refactored for improved performance and stability\n\nThe appservice database has been deprecated, as the roomserver output stream is now used as the data source instead\n\n\nThe generate-config tool has been updated to support additional scenarios, i.e. for CI configuration generation and generating both monolith and polylith skeleton config files\n\nFixes\n\nThe username length check has been fixed on new account creation\nThe length of the type, sender, state_key and room_id fields in events are now verified by number of codepoints rather than bytes, fixing the \"Cat Overflow\" bug\nUTF-16 surrogate handling in the canonical JSON implementation has been fixed\nA race condition when starting the keyserver has been fixed\nA race condition when configuring HTTP servers and routing at startup has been fixed\nA bug where the incorrect limit was used for lazy-loading memberships has been fixed\nThe number of push notifications will now be sent to the push gateway\nA missing index causing slow performance on the sync API send-to-device table has been added (contributed by PiotrKozimor)\nEvent auth will now correctly check for the existence of the \"creator\" field in create events\n\nAs always, please feel free to join us in #dendrite:matrix.org for more Dendrite-related discussion.\n\nHomeserver Deployment 📥️\nHelm Chart (website)\nMatrix Kubernetes applications packaged into helm charts\nAnanace announces\n\nThis week has seen some updates to my Helm Charts, bumping element-web to 1.11.4 and matrix-synapse to 1.66.0 - as well as making the worker configuration more flexible in handling multiple instances of specialised workers.\n\nAnanace says\n\nAnd another quick update on my Helm Charts, bumped my synatainer package to the just released 0.4.2\n\nDept of Bridges 🌉\nPostmoogle (website)\nAn Email to Matrix bridge. 1 room = 1 mailbox.\nAine says\n\nPostmoogle v0.9.0\n\nACLs with wildcards, controlled directly from matrix chat\nAdmin users\nAbility to list all mailboxes and disable/remove them directly from matrix chat\nDisplay options (show/hide sender, show/hide subject, html/text-only parsing, enable/disable email -&gt; matrix threads, enable/disable attachments support)\n\nSource code, matrix room: #postmoogle:etke.cc\n\nmatrix-hookshot (website)\nA multi purpose multi platform bridge, formerly known as matrix-github\nHalf-Shot reports\n\nAnother week, another hookshot release. This release brings support for Arm64 docker builds, a revamped JSON logger and much prettier error reporting in the widget. As always, there is a good chunk of bugfixes too.\nYou can check out version 2.1.1 here!\nCome chat to us in #hookshot:half-shot.uk if you need a hand setting up.\nIn terms of what will be appearing in the near future:\n\nSupport for adding JIRA connections via widgets.\nEncryption support (at long last) so you can bridge in hookshot to encrypted rooms.\nAn experimental new way to share logic between rooms configured with custom JS functions. Possibly utilizing Matrix rooms-as-software-libraries.\n\n\nDept of Clients 📱\nBeeper\nEric Migicovsky says\n\nHey it’s Eric from Beeper! Been a while since our last update. Reminder: Beeper is a universal chat app built on top of Matrix. We've created 12+ open source Matrix bridges and integrated them into an easy to use all-in-one service which does not require setting up your own homeserver.\nSince our last update in February (!) we have been really busy! We published a short-term roadmap back in April and have almost completed all items on the list. \nToday I want to share the improvements we’ve made to Beeper Desktop. Check out the video below for a full demo! \nNew features:\n\nShiny new design and theme (just released yesterday!\nCompletely updated inbox workflow\n\nIt’s designed to make it easier to prioritize the chats that matter most to you, and quickly archive everything else\nActions like archive/pin/mark as unread\nCollapsible archive section\nAuto-archive messages after you reply or a fixed time\nTons of new keyboard shortcuts\nSee a full chat preview without opening chat or marking it read\n\n\nScheduled messages - schedule a message to be sent in any chat. Works on any chat network that Beeper supports, and will send even if your devices are all powered off.\nStart New Chat directly from Beeper Desktop on any bridged chat network\nSent status for bridged messages - get confirmation or a failure alert if the bridge is unable to send a message to the remote network\nTwo-factor verification codes sent via Android SMS or iMessage are automatically copied to clipboard. Just like Safari!\nTons and tons of bugfixes and smaller new features\n\nWe’ve also been working hard on new bridges + features, Beeper Android and Beeper iOS, but I will save those for another post! \nWant to get access to Beeper? Sign up on beeper.com and if you want to jump the line, send us a DM on Twitter. Or chat with the community #beeper:beeper.com \nWant to work with us at Beeper? We are hiring 100% remote backend, iOS and Android developers. Send me a message @eric:beeper.com. And if you want to develop an open source bridge, we will fund it with up to $5,000.\n\n\nNheko (website)\nDesktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.\nNico says\n\nWe now properly inherit the sticker packs from the parent spaces, which gives you the possibility to expose stickers to your whole community by editing them in a single space. The bug that deleted widgets were shown, that sneaked into the last release, should also be resolved. If your server doesn't follow the client server spec on event size limits, Nheko is now stricter when validating the return values and might refuse to show events or room violating such constraints. Before this fix using a non-compliant server could make Nheko fail to properly process the sync response. Forest cleaned up our formatting configuration, Zirnc fixed our misleading bug report template suggesting the version field would be somewhere it isn't and Hiers made the edit button in the room profile match the one in the user profile. Forest also fixed our usage of the Qt colour palette for reactions and made hitting the escape key always return focus to the message input.\nAlso, if you managed to find me on the Matrix Community Summit, you might have had the chance to get one of the rare hardware Nheko patches (contrary to the software ones).\n\nElement Web/Desktop (website)\nSecure and independent communication, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-web:matrix.org!\nDanielle says\n\n🔒 We have a security release: Please update to v1.11.4 ASAP.\nLast weekend we received a report from Val Lorentz (thank you!) that it was possible to create a situation where Element wouldn’t show all of the user’s rooms or Spaces, causing minor (temporary) corruption and Denial of Service (DoS). We’ve fixed this case in v1.11.4 and encourage everyone to update as soon as possible.\nWhile the vulnerabilities themselves are not disclosed yet, there is more information on the element.io blog and the matrix.org blog.\nPlease note that this also affects consumers of the matrix-react-sdk and matrix-js-sdk: updating to v3.53.0 and v19.4.0 respectively should resolve the issue.\n🥼  In labs (you can enable labs features in settings on develop.element.io or on Nightly):\n\nThreads Notification improvements are coming! This week the team met to review all the feedback given by Beta users, alongside our MSCs, and Proof of Concept work to finalise the plan and approach for Threads Notifications. Watch this space!\n\n\nElement iOS (website)\nSecure and independent communication for iOS, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-ios:matrix.org!\nȘtefan says\n\n\nElement 1.9.2 is now available on the AppStore and with it comes a brand new home screen layout. The new view is cleaner, easier to browse, and faster to navigate. We’d love for you to enable the labs setting and try it out.\nThere’s exciting work happening in other areas as well: we’re working hard on deferring DM creation until the first message is sent and the new rich text editor is quickly taking shape. \nOn the ElementX front we have made very good progress on integrating the new sync mechanism and the new Rust Timeline API is proving to be quite a treat.\nAnd, as always, we fixed some big bugs and some not so big ones. Enjoy!\n\n\nElement Android (website)\nSecure and independent communication for Android, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-android:matrix.org!\nManu announces\n\n\nComing soon on Element Android is the new app layout. The home page of the app has been redesigned. The new view is cleaner, easier to browse, and faster to navigate. Keep an eye out on twitter for our teaser trailers! \nThe team has been working on deferring DM creation until after the first message has been sent. So you’ll no longer invite another person to an empty room, instead they’ll see your message and a new invite all at once.\nAlong with these exciting improvements we’ve fixed several bugs, including improving the speed of the app when you resume it.\n\n\nElement (website)\nEverything related to Element but not strictly bound to a client\nkittykat says\n\nCommunity testing\n\nWe’d love to hear your feedback on the new composer redesign, including an all new WISYWIG editor: sign up to take part in testing!\nFor more info on our next testing sessions, you can join us at #element-community-testing:matrix.org!\n\n\nCinny (website)\nCinny is a Matrix client focused on simplicity, elegance and security\najbura reports\n\nSecurity update\nThis release address the vulnerability found this week in matrix-js-sdk &lt;19.4.0, so please update to Cinny v2.1.3 at your earliest convenience.\nIf you are using our hosted version then it is already up-to-date and all you need is a refresh and clear cache (if you were hit by the vulnerability).\nYou can read more about the vulnerability at Security releases: matrix-js-sdk 19.4.0.\nFind more about Cinny at https://cinny.in/\nJoin our space at: https://matrix.to/#/#cinny-space:matrix.org\nGithub: https://github.com/ajbura/cinny\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/@cinnyapp\n\nDept of Non Chat Clients 🎛️\nCircles (website)\nE2E encrypted social networking built on Matrix. Safe, private sharing for your friends, family, and community.\ncvwright reports\n\nThe Circles project is now Circuli.  F-Droid users can get a sneak peek at the new Android beta by installing our beta repo.  Coming soon on Google Play!\n\nDept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰\nTrixnity (website)\nMultiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix\nBenedict says\n\nTrixnity 2.3.0 is out. We've done a large refactoring in trixnity-client making it even more modular by using dependency injection. This theoretically allows you to disable modules (e. g. E2EE) or add custom functionality. We've also made some improvements in the *api-server modules APIs to enable implementing just a few and not all endpoints (e. g. in proxies).\nMoreover, you can now play with Trixnity without building the whole SDK by using the new Trixnity examples repository. The examples are running on the JVM, in your Browser, NodeJS environment or as native binary on your host. It's pretty fun, except for the fact that you don't need something like a ping bot with E2EE in the browser 😄\n\nmatrix-rust-sdk (website)\nNext-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM\nben announces\n\nAfter merging the types into ruma a few weeks back, now the Sliding Sync PR has been handed in for review on the Rust SDK, too. With its own jack-in test client and Element-X iOS being build on it, the authors are pretty confident with the current state of that API, which will still only be available behind a feature-flag after merge (which is on by default for FFI though). That said, work isn't done here, extensions aren't even fully specified yet and many other aspects, like v3-fallback, aren't even started. Once this is reviewed and merged a tracking issue will be initiated documenting the missing pieces and allow the work to be more spread out (if you are interested in helping out, ping us in our matrix channel!).\nSimilarly, the new Timeline API is making progress as well, to that point that fractal has a PR trying it out. Same goes for the crypto for web-js bindings, which have seen some further planning and coordination effort and minor fixes and exposing of further functions as a result of that. Aside from the usual clean ups and API improvements, we have found one significant problem during last weeks workshops at Matrix Summit Berlin: a recent change in the API lead to some functions now stalling if you await on some within a sync-callback or -handler. A fix has been merged to the examples, but the team has agreed to revisit the API and change the return type to prevent this foot-gun from breaking existing code elsewhere - stay tuned for that update.\n️👉️ Wanna hack on matrix rust? Go check out our help wanted tagged issues and join our matrix channel at Matrix Rust SDK.\n\nMatrix Dart SDK (website)\nMatrix SDK written in pure Dart.\nNico announces\n\nWe released version 0.13.0, which includes some small breaking changes, but also cools stuff like support for MSC3814, Dehydrated Devices V2 aka Shrivelled Sessions and key requests in more cases. Fixes for group calls and properly updating of the last message in a room. And for better performance on web a migration to Hive Box Collections.\n\nDept of Ops 🛠\nSynatainer (website)\nSynapse Maintenance Container – Docker container with tools for synapse &amp; postgres database maintenance\nsaces announces\n\nNew in v0.4.2\n\nMXPASSFILE - like PGPASSFILE, but for matrix tokens.

This week, I created a public Matrix room that is exclusive for people called Bram: everyone can join, but only people called Bram can send messages.\nThe room can be found at #all:brams.dev and everyone's allowed to take a look at it. The process is not yet automated but that might change either through spec functionality of with the use of a simple bot.\n\nEffektio (website)\nThe one mobile-first, decentralized community organizing app\nben reports\n\nFor the first time, at Matrix Summit Berlin last Saturday, we have presented Effektio to, its goals, ambitions and plans to a wider audience and we couldn't be more ecstatic about the response. Even though the presentation didn't quite go as planned, as we decided on a highly engaged audience and discussed various aspects, the overall feedback was great- with many people asking for access and sharing useful ideas and contacts. Unfortunately the presentation wasn't recorded (the quality of our own recording isn't really sufficient) and the slides alone will not be enough, but we are working on making something along it available.\nThat has given the team another motivational boost, before as well as the feedback after, to get something usable out there. While the task-lists and news features presented have now properly mocked, other features on the chat side have fully materialized: like real time updates, typing notifications and cross device verification (so you can share your existing keys) and general things like switching to a event-handlers rather than overloading the sync-callback. Unfortunately we have also seen quite a few set backs, mainly around using ffi-gen as the intermediate between rust and dart, which makes us wonder if switching to uniffi and share back more of our work in effektio upstream might even be easier in the long run.\nEither way, we are motivated than ever before to build it out and get it into the hands of the first real users than ever.\n📰 You want updates more frequently and closer to when they actually happen? Join our Effektio Matrix News room or hangout and discuss with the team in our public foyer Matrix channel.\n\nBeeper beeper\nEric Migicovsky says\n\nOh and as a fun side project we are building a real Beeper beeper.

MSC2730: Verifiable forwarded events!\nEver noticed how when you forward an event in Matrix today, it simply looks like you've just copy/pasted the message and sent it yourself? Other messengers will often include some metadata with the forwarded message to inform the room that it's a message originally from another room and/or user, rather than being originally authored by yourself.\nThis MSC attempts to optionally add that metadata to messages, with the crucial goal of preventing that metadata from being faked (which could be dangerous). Check if out if that's something that interests you!\n\n\nDept of Servers 🏢\nSynapse (website)\nSynapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team\nBrendan Abolivier reports\n\nThis week the team released Synapse 1.67.0rc1! This first release candidate includes a few features, a bunch of notable performance improvements and bugfixes, and also removes the long-deprecated TCP replication. We thank everyone who help us test this RC by running it ahead of the release next week, and reporting any bug or feedback on the Synapse repo or in #synapse:matrix.org, respectively.\nAnother very exciting thing that happened this week is the merge of the base code infrastructure to support running Rust code in Synapse! You can find more about this in the pull request, but what this means is we can now replace some bits of Synapse written in Python with code written in Rust to make it more efficient. This is not a rewrite of Synapse in Rust, but rather a way for us to optimise some specific hot paths. Currently there's some more work going on with implementing push rules support in Rust, as well as converting some caching code. Watch this space for more info!\n\nDendrite (website)\nSecond generation Matrix homeserver\nneilalexander announces\n\nThis week we released Dendrite 0.9.7 with quite a few bug fixes and performance improvements. It's a recommended upgrade, so if you have a Dendrite installation, please upgrade! Changes include:\n\nInitial supporting code to enable full-text search has been merged (although not ready for use yet)\nNewly created rooms now have higher default power levels for enabling encryption, setting server ACLs or sending tombstone events\nIncoming signing key updates over federation are now queued in JetStream for processing, so that they cannot be dropped accidentally\nA race condition between the roomserver output events being generated, forward extremities being updated and room info being updated has been fixed\nAppservices will no longer receive invite events which they are not interested in, which caused heavy load in some cases or excessive request sizes in others\nA bug in state resolution v2 where events could incorrectly be classified as control events has been fixed\nA bug in state resolution v2 where some specific events with unexpected non-empty state keys are dropped has been fixed\nA bug in state resolution v2 when fetching auth events vs partial state has been fixed\nStale device lists should now be handled correctly for all user IDs, which may help with E2EE reliability\nA number of database writer issues have been fixed in the user API and sync API, which should help to reduce database is locked errors with SQLite databases\nDatabase migrations should now be detected more reliably to prevent unexpected errors at startup\nA number of minor database transaction issues have been fixed, particularly for assigning NIDs in the roomserver, cleaning up device keys and cleaning up notifications\nThe database query for finding shared users in the sync API has been optimised, using significantly less CPU time as a result\n\nAs always, please feel free to join us in #dendrite:matrix.org for more Dendrite-related discussion.\n\nDept of Bridges 🌉\nPostmoogle (website)\nAn Email to Matrix bridge. 1 room = 1 mailbox.\nAine reports\n\nPostmoogle v0.9.1\n\"Are we bridge yet?\" - Yes.

As a result, opening the Trixnity project does not need any C-Library-Building-Tools, because the binaries are just downloaded. On the one hand this speeds up building Trixnity significantly and on the other hand contributing to Trixnity is much easier (especially on Windows machines). Just do ./gradlew build.\n\nmatrix-rust-sdk (website)\nNext-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM\nben reports\n\nThis week saw the merge of PR/Issue #1000, a milestone, that, though random, marks the continuous progress and pace this project has taken up. 🥂 to the next 1000!\nFurther more we saw the merge of make create_dm_room public, allowing any developer using the SDK to use it as well saw the first review of the sliding sync PR, which now also has a tracking issue explaining what remains to be done (and when) once the PR has landed. Other than that we had several refactorings, clean ups and minor fixes merged, in anticipation of the upcoming release of 0.6, which we expect to land before the end of the month. If all goes will that release will contain both sliding sync and the new timeline API behind feature flags to use and play with. 🫰 Fingers crossed.\n👉 Wanna hack on matrix rust?

Synapse\n1.67 is fresh out\nof the oven, let's have a look at what's inside.\nRemoval of TCP replication\nAs announced in the Synapse 1.66 release\nannouncement, Synapse 1.67 removes support for the legacy TCP replication protocol.\nAs a reminder, Synapse can be configured to use workers to spread its load over\nmultiple processes, or even multiple machines. These workers communicate between\neach other (and with the main Synapse process) using something we call\n\"replication\".\nSynapse 1.18\ndeprecated its TCP-based replication protocol, and replaced it with a brand new\none using Redis. As of Synapse 1.67, this Redis-based\nprotocol is now the only protocol that can be used.\nSee the upgrade\nnotes\nfor more information.\nChanges for installations using a source checkout\nServer admins who installed Synapse using a source checkout might already be\nfamiliar with Poetry. This is a tool we use\nto better manage dependencies within Synapse. As of this version, we have\nupdated Synapse's dependency on Poetry to require Poetry 1.2, which was recently\nreleased.\nIt is also worth noting that Synapse 1.68, which is due to release on the 27th\nof September, will require a Rust compiler when installed from a source\ncheckout. This is because we are in the process of introducing Rust in Synapse's\ncode base, in order to make some hot code paths more efficient. See the upgrade\nnotes\nfor more information.\nThese two changes should not impact installations that use pip install matrix-synapse, Debian packages from packages.matrix.org or the\nmatrixdotorg/synapse Docker image to manage and run Synapse.\nEverything else\nSynapse 1.68 (due on the 27th of September) will also require SQLite v3.27.0 or\nhigher when run with SQLite. Synapse 1.67 is the last version of Synapse to\nsupport SQLite versions 3.22 to 3.26.

The hope is that it'll help spell out the process in a more succinct manner, as well as provide answers to common questions/edge cases.\nThe document's words are still in flux, and still only exist as a PR; so do feel free to leave some suggestions or feedback if you have some!\nRandom MSC of the Week\nThe random MSC of the week is...

Collaborative audio editing anyone?\nAs far as I can tell, this MSC is currently waiting for MSC3574 to progress before it itself moves much further. But feel free to check out both in the meantime if you're interested.\n\n\nDept of Servers 🏢\nSynapse (website)\nSynapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team\nBrendan Abolivier announces\n\nThis week we've released Synapse 1.67! This Synapse release is the first one to use Poetry 1.2, and also removes the long-deprecated TCP-based replication protocol. Synapse workers are now required to use the Redis-based protocol which we introduced back in 2020. If this isn't already the case for your deployment of Synapse, see the documentation for workers as well as the upgrade notes, to update your configuration.\nIn other news, Synapse 1.68 (which is due to release on the 27th of September) will introduce a couple of changes in dependencies. The minimum supported SQLite version will be raised to 3.26, meaning that Synapse 1.67 is the last version of Synapse supporting SQLite versions 3.22 to 3.26. In addition to this, a Rust compiler will be required for source checkouts, as we are starting to introduce Rust code in Synapse (as I mentioned last week). This latter change should not impact installations that use pip install matrix-synapse, Debian packages from packages.matrix.org or the matrixdotorg/synapse Docker image to manage and run Synapse. See the upgrade notes for more information about these two changes.\n\nHomeserver Deployment 📥️\nHelm Chart (website)\nMatrix Kubernetes applications packaged into helm charts\nAnanace announces\n\nThis week sees some of the usual updates to my Helm Charts, with element-web being updated to 1.11.5 and matrix-synapse to 1.67.0.\n\nDept of Bridges 🌉\nPostmoogle (website)\nAn Email to Matrix bridge. 1 room = 1 mailbox.\nAine announces\n\nPostmoogle v0.9.2\n\nbugfixes\nspeed up email delivery\nStartTLS enabled automatically if TLS cert and key are provided\nset msgtype by attachment's mime-type (received image -&gt; got rendered image in your matrix client; received audio -&gt; got audio player in your matrix client; etc)\n\nSource code, say hi in the #postmoogle:etke.cc room\n\nmatrix-hookshot (website)\nA multi purpose multi platform bridge, formerly known as matrix-github\nHalf-Shot says\n\nmatrix-hookshot 2.2.0 arrives with fewer bugs and more features!\nHello gang. This week, another hookshot release. They do come fast!\nWe've fixed a bug which had the potential to cause crashes when JSON logging is enabled, and written a whole torture test for the logger to ensure it won't do that again. We've also made some quality of life improvements to the GitLab connection type :)\nThe highlights are:\n\nReady/draft state changes for GitLab merge requests are now reported. (#480)\nMerge GitLab MR approvals and comments into one message. (#484)\n\nYou can get the latest release here\n\nBut I have a bit more for you this week, we're working on a few new features to hopefully improve the lives of developers out there building webhook integrations.\nFirst, we are adding the ability to view requests and logging from within the widget UI. This means you can now debug why your webhooks might not be working without\nhaving to leave your client. This includes the ability to log debug messages and read them back later!\n\nSecondly, we're adding some new sci-fi functions to the scripting environment. The first of which will allow you to embed images / videos into the message output, with a\nfunction to to create matrix content URLs from a regular URL.\nFinally, and this is probably the most sci-fi. We're working on a feature for you to load scripts from other rooms for use in your webhook. This means developers will be able to build\nwhole webhook handling libraries within rooms, and then share those libraries across the federation. At the moment, this looks a bit like:\nconst resultOfScript = await loadMatrixScript(\"matrix:r/my-room-alias:domain/$my-event-id\");\n// ... mutate the result\nreturn = resultOfScript\n\nWe're still thinking about how to ensure it's both performant, and safe but the initial results are looking quite good.\nThat's all we have for you in bridging corner today, have a good weekend 👋\n\nmatrix-appservice-kakaotalk (website)\nA Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.\nFair announces\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that the KakaoTalk service has been updated to block older clients, and unfortunately this bridge is affected.  As of this writing, using the bridge may get your KakaoTalk account banned!  It has happened to both me and at least one other person, so this isn't just a hypothetical risk.\nTo be clear about this, I've updated the master branch to throw an error on startup, which must be manually removed from source code if you wish to continue using the bridge at your own risk.\nIt's currently unknown what it takes to log in safely, but discussion about it is ongoing (albeit intermittently) in the discussion channel (linked below).\nOnce the bridge is safe to use again, I'll post a TWIM update about it 🙂\n\n\nDiscussion: #matrix-appservice-kakaotalk:miscworks.net \nTesting room: #kakaotalk-bridge-testing:miscworks.net / https://open.kakao.com/o/gjGQFuae\nIssue page: https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-appservice-kakaotalk/issues\n\n\nDept of Clients 📱\nQuadrix (website)\nA Minimal, simple, multi-platform chat client for the Matrix protocol.\nJFA says\n\nQuadrix v1.3.3 has been released!

Come talk with us in #element-web:matrix.org!\nDanielle reports\n\n\nOn Web we’ve been working on perfecting the app and fixing bugs\nAlso in the roadmap and currently in development:\n\nUpdates to the composer. We’re working on improving the composer and creating a WYSIWYG version (What You See Is What You Get). Keep your eyes peeled for more info in the coming weeks!\nThere are also improvements to the ‘forgot password’ flow on their way. We made these same improvements to the mobile apps some weeks ago and received great feedback.\n\n\n\nIn labs (you can enable labs features in settings on develop.element.io or on Nightly):\n\nThreads work continues as 2 of our 3 MSCs make their way into their FCP (Final Comment Period). We’re excited to bring improvements to you and will be dropping them straight into the product as soon as they’re ready.\n\n\nElement iOS (website)\nSecure and independent communication for iOS, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-ios:matrix.org!\nȘtefan reports\n\n\nFollowing this week’s release of the new app layout we’re heads down reading feedback and looking for improvements. We hope you’re enjoying it as much as we are - use the Feedback button in the top-left to let us know! \nThe team is also making improvements on the next generation of the Element app for iOS (Element X). \n\nWe’re experimenting with merging together the sliding sync mechanism and the new timeline API. \nWe’ve added support for reactions, redactions, permalinks and replying, we have a new log out mechanism and soft logout, and we’ve also overhauled the UI.\n\n\n\n\nElement Android (website)\nSecure and independent communication for Android, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-android:matrix.org!\nDanielle reports\n\n\n\nNot only are we hard at work smashing bugs but we’re also working on 2 big updates for the coming releases:\n\nThe new app layout! While you can currently access this via Labs, we’re closing bugs and addressing feedback that will allow us to make it the default layout for all users. Check out more info here\nAlso coming up, starting a DM when the first message is sent. No more waiting around for the room to be created before you say hi to the recipients - your invite and message will be received together. Yey! :ta_da:\n\n\n\nWe’re also working on a fix for the bug that’s making verifying others difficult.\n\n\n\nDept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰\nmatrix-rust-sdk (website)\nNext-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM\nben reports\n\nMajor Milestone: yesterday Sliding Sync was merged into main, now available behind the sliding-sync-feature flag and enabled by default for matrix-sdk-ffi for your convenience. This, too, means the jack-in sliding sync-test client is merged and part of our labs section - go out and have a try! Furthermore the key verification for crypto-js has been merged, as well as support for logging out, including tracking the soft-logout state in FFI, and support for sending markdown from FFI,\nSimilarly the new Timeline API, is making big leaps forward, we expecting it to land, too. It will also be available behind a feature-flag replacing the previous experimental-timeline-feature. If you were using that, please pay close attention to what is going on, as it will replace most of if not all of the previous API and data store.\nBoth will be available, also together, in the upcoming release 0.6 of matrix-sdk, which we expect to land before the end of the month. It was slightly pushed back as the sync event changes turned out to be more of a rabbit hole than anticipated.\n👉 Wanna hack on matrix rust?

The counter of violations is also displayed as a reaction under each user message in the form: \"N ❗️\", where N is the number of violations.\nThe bot captures who added the signature or violation, when it happened and for what reason (description). All this can be asked from the bot by any member of the room\nThe user can add his own description, which the bot will report to any member of the room on the appropriate request.\nThe moderator can switch the language that the bot speaks in this room.

The study consists of a short questionnaire and a 30-60 minute interview about experiences with cross-app messaging (for example, privacy concerns related to differences between clients). The results will contribute an interpersonal perspective to the design of messaging interoperability and potentially influence future policy making.\nInterested in participating? Eligible participants should live within the EU and either:\na) Have frequent conversations on a Matrix.org client with contacts that use different Matrix.org clients (such as Element-FluffyChat) or\nb) Frequently use bridges between Matrix.org and other platforms (for example, using Beeper, or Element with bridges to Telegram, IRC, etc.) \nReach out directly to @lalider:matrix.org for questions and arranging an interview.

Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.\nMSC Status\nNew MSCs:\n\nMSC3895: Federation API Behaviour of Partial-State Resident Servers\n\nMSCs in Final Comment Period:\n\nMSC3856: Threads List API (merge)\nMSC3771: Read receipts for threads (merge)\n\nMerged MSCs:\n\nMSC3773: Notifications for threads\nMSC3715: Add a pagination direction parameter to /relations\n\nSpec Updates\nThe next major release of the spec is now just around the corner! The Spec Core Team expects to release Matrix v1.4 next week, so be on the look out for the announcement and blog post then! Highlights for v1.4 include Threads and Message Edits!\nReview this week from the Spec Core Team has once again mainly focused on Threads as we work towards getting it over the line (and to see client and homeserver implementations stablise). With fixes for notification issues and increased support for querying threads in a room for clients, we expect to see it land in v1.4!\nIn addition, MSC2676 has been merged to the spec (finally)! This means that it is now available in the unstable space and will be available in the next spec release. Congrats to all involved as it's been a particularly long-running MSC, and especially richvdh for pushing it over the line and writing up the spec bits, and TravisR for reviewing them.\nRandom MSC of the Week\nThe random MSC of the week is...

Then instead of sending manual invites or making the room public, you can just add the condition under a room in the matrix-cerberus admin panel and the app will invite all of them for you!\nManaging memberships for rooms where patrons belonging to a particular tier in a campaign have access.\n\n\nNote: Both of the cases would require the user to log in with matrix and the respective third-party service in our app.\n\nThe application is built using React (frontend), FastAPI (backend) and matrix-nio for the bot. The entire application is containerized with docker compose to reduce the effort required to set up all the services.\nCurrently, it has support for the following third-party services:\n\nGitHub\nPatreon\n\nThere's also an interesting feature in this app - Room External URL Invites. If you have one of these room external url invites you can just log in as a matrix user with our app and relevant invites will be issued.\nYou can find documentation related to the usage, installation and hosting over here.\nIf you want to play around with the app and see how it works you can check out the demo version of the app hosted here: https://cerberus.cadair.dev/\nAnd finally, if you have any queries and issues related to setting up or just want to discuss the app then feel free to join: https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-cerberus:cadair.com\n\nCadair adds\n\nWorth noting that the demo version of the app should only be used for experimenting, I make 0 promises for how long it will stay online for!\n\nDept of Servers 🏢\nConstruct\nJason Volk reports\n\nConstruct 0.8 has been rolling out with a set of performance improvements courtesy of the new io_uring(7) backend added to Boost ASIO on Linux platforms. These improvements were not truly necessary since Construct is already backed by a custom aio(7) implementation on Linux, but there's still a significant all-around improvement with io_uring. Users building on systems with boost 1.78+ will benefit from io_uring replacing the core epoll(2) event loop and networking. This has a significant impact for certain operations like sending messages to large rooms with lots of servers by greatly reducing the number of system calls. Users with boost 1.79+ get the added benefit of some local filesystem operations using the io_uring rather than aio. If your distribution ships an older version of Boost, rebuild Construct with the option --with-included-boost=1.80.0 to ./configure so you too can enjoy these benefits.\nFor questions or support don't forget to idle and perform #construct:zemos.net\n\nSynapse (website)\nSynapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team\nBrendan Abolivier reports\n\nThis week we've released not one, but two release candidates for Synapse 1.68. This Synapse version will be the first one to require a Rust compiler for installations from a source checkout. 1.68.0rc2 fixes an issue the previous RC had related to this change - so if you were bitten by Rust-related issues when trying out rc1, please try rc2! The minimum required version of Rust has also been set to 1.58 to make it easier for third-party packagers to package Synapse (it previously was 1.61).\nThanks a lot to everyone who help us by testing Synapse RCs and catching these issues early! Please report any feedback or bug in #synapse:matrix.org or the issue tracker, respectively 🙂\nIn other news, Synapse 1.68 will also be raising the minimum required version of SQLite to 3.27. If you're running a Synapse instance with SQLite, please make sure your environment is up to date!\n\nDendrite (website)\nSecond generation Matrix homeserver\nneilalexander reports\n\nThis week we released Dendrite 0.9.9 which contains some bug fixes and performance improvements — if you are running Dendrite then it is recommended to upgrade! Changes include:\n\nDendrite will now try to keep HTTP connections open to remote federated servers for a few minutes after a request and attempt to reuse those connections where possible\n\nThis should reduce the amount of time spent on TLS handshakes and often speed up requests to remote servers\nThis new behaviour can be disabled with the federation_api.disable_http_keepalives option if needed\n\n\nA number of dependencies have been updated\nA bug where the roomserver did not correctly propagate rewritten room state to downstream components (like the federation API and sync API) has been fixed, which could cause issues when performing a federated join to a previously left room\nEvent auth now correctly parses the join_authorised_via_users_server field in the membership event content\nDatabase migrations should no longer produce unique constraint errors at Dendrite startup\nThe origin of device list updates should now be populated correctly\nSend-to-device messages will no longer be dropped if we fail to publish them to specific devices\nThe roomserver query to find state after events will now always resolve state if there are multiple prev events\nThe roomserver will now return no memberships if querying history visibility for an event which has no state snapshot\nThe device list updater will now mark a device list as stale if a requesting device ID is not known\nTransactions sent to appservices should no longer have accidental duplicated transaction IDs (contributed by tak-hntlabs)\n\nAs always, please feel free to join us in #dendrite:matrix.org for more related discussion.\n\nDept of Bridges 🌉\nPostmoogle (website)\nAn Email to Matrix bridge. 1 room = 1 mailbox.\nAine announces\n\nPostfix Postmoogle v0.9.4\nalmost Postfix. The biggest change: you can use postmoogle to send emails from your apps, scripts and other tools using standard SMTP protocol (or Matrix Client Server API, if you wish so)\n\nsend emails in UTF-8 👋\nfix options descriptions\nadd SMTP auth\nallow sending emails from your apps and scripts using postmoogle as email provider\n\nSource code, say hi in #postmoogle:etke.cc \nPS: now I'm wondering - can you use postmoogle as SMTP server/relay in synapse? Send emails from matrix, using matrix backend, using matrix.... 😵‍💫\n\nDept of Clients 📱\nNheko (website)\nDesktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.\nNico reports\n\nWe completely redesigned how you can modify the access rules in a room. You now have a list of toggles to allow public access to a room, knocking and/or joining via a different room. You can also now edit what rooms you can access the current room via. By default the parent communities are in that list and you can enable joining via those using a toggle button, but you can also add other rooms in. This is helpful when you have a welcome room in a private community, but you still want people to be able to join the other community rooms after you explained the rules in the main room. We are still working on restructuring the room settings though, so that the new rules UI doesn't seem as out of place between the other settings.\n\nNheko now also shows you what community a room is in and allows you to switch to that community or join it if you haven't yet. This should make it easier to discover communities and related rooms. In this case too, we built the feature, but I am not happy yet with how it looks, so it might change in the future.\n\nq234rty also fixed sending messages using the Enter key, when an input method is active. We significantly shrunk our flatpak images (to almost a third) by using the upstream gstreamer again (which is recent enough in the recent runtimes now). Thanks to Forest users now have significantly more control over what Nheko logs when troubleshooting an issue and Hiers added an unread line to make it easier to find where you left off. (The blue line is the unread indicator, the names and avatars are just replaced with color boxes to protect the innocent.)\n\nAs you can see there were lots of new features that might need some time to figure out the UI, so feedback is welcome as always in #nheko:nheko.im.\n\nNeochat (website)\nA client for matrix, the decentralized communication protocol\nTobias Fella says\n\nThis week, Bharadwaj implemented showing link previews. While working on E2EE, support for showing stickers broke a while ago, which James now fixed. I (Tobias) finished the work on basic device verification; it will start working once libQuotient officially supports it. I also implemented support for reporting messages to the server admins.\n\n\n\nElement (website)\nEverything related to Element but not strictly bound to a client\nMatthew announces\n\nupcoming critical security update for matrix-{js,ios,android}-sdk on Wednesday Sept 28 at 16:00 UTC: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/23/pre-disclosure-upcoming-critical-security-release-of-matrix-sd-ks-and-clients\n\nElement Web/Desktop (website)\nSecure and independent communication, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-web:matrix.org!\nRobin says\n\nHi 👋 It's just the VoIP team this week, but we're excited to share that Element Call is on its way into the app! We've added an experimental implementation of Element Call video rooms in Labs, which you can try out on develop.element.io and Nightly, and are working on bringing native group calls to text rooms as well. Thanks to everyone who contributed to last week's community testing session, and please keep the feedback coming.\n\nElement iOS (website)\nSecure and independent communication for iOS, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-ios:matrix.org!\nȘtefan reports\n\n\nThis was a busy week in iOS land. Version 1.9.6 is now available on the AppStore and brings with it a lot of significant improvements: \n\nCrash fixes when logging out, previewing rooms or displaying the keyboard\nNew layout tweaks for when logging out and back in again\n\n\nWe also have made a lot of progress on ElementX:\n\nWe have successfully merged the sliding sync mechanism with the new timeline API\nWe have redesigned the home screen, the settings, the timeline bubbles, the message composer and more\nWe received support for local echoes\nWe have also had our first look at encryption working through sliding sync and the Rust SDK and it’s even more magical than expected\n\n\n\n\n\nElement Android (website)\nSecure and independent communication for Android, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in #element-android:matrix.org!\nbenoit reports\n\n\nElement Android 1.5.0 will land on the stores soon. We finally decided to postpone the activation of the new App Layout by default, to give us some time to fix the remaining bugs. In this version there will be deferred DM creation on the first message, i.e. the DM will be created and the invite sent only when a first message is sent to the room.\nWe are working to fix our flaky tests.

Synapse\n1.68 just dropped,\nlet's have a look at what's inside.\nDependency changes\nAs announced in the Synapse 1.67 release\nannouncement, Synapse\n1.68 raises the minimum supported version of SQLite to version v3.27.0. This\nmeans that, if your installation of Synapse is using SQLite to manage its\ndatabase, and the SQLite version used is lower than 3.27, you will need to\nupgrade to a more recent version before updating to Synapse 1.68. This change does not impact deployments using the matrixdotorg/synapse Docker image. \nSynapse 1.68 also introduces the requirement of a Rust compiler for source\ncheckouts. The minimum required version of Rust is 1.58.1. Installations that\nuse pip install matrix-synapse, Debian packages from packages.matrix.org or\nthe matrixdotorg/synapse Docker image to manage and run Synapse, are not\nimpacted by this change.\nSee the upgrade\nnotes for more information.\nAdmin API improvements\nSynapse 1.68 introduces a new admin API which allows server administrators to\nquery events in a given room that have been sent within a specific time window.\nThis API mirrors the specification's /messages\nendpoint,\nand allows, among other things, paginating through a room's history. See the\ndocumentation for more information.\nThis version of Synapse also introduces a new admin API to help administrator of\nhomeservers using an external authentication provider. This endpoint allows\nlooking up a specific identifier on the authentication provider and resolving it\ninto the identifier of the local user it's associated with, if any. See the\ndocumentation for more information.\nThe user admin\nAPI\nhas also been updated to allow administrator of homeservers requiring agreement\nto the server's terms and\nconditions\nto view and edit the timestamp at which each user has provided their agreement.\nEverything else\nSynapse 1.68 greatly improves the validation of user input on most of the\naccount management API endpoints.\nThis version of Synapse also adds a new request_id_header option to the\nconfiguration of HTTP listeners, which allows tracking the identifier Synapse\ngenerates for each request in that request's response. This can be helpful for\ncorrelating Synapse logs with reverse proxy logs. See the\ndocumentation for more information.\nSee the full\nchangelog for a\ncomplete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the\nupgrade\nnotes\nfor this version.\nSynapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our\nthanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular\norder) Denis Kariakin, Dirk\nKlimpel and Beeper, as\nwell as anyone helping us make Synapse better by sharing their feedback and\nreporting issues.\n","id":"/blog/2022/09/27/synapse-1-68-released/","title":"Synapse 1.68 released"},"/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients/":{"body":"TL;DR:\n\nTwo critical severity vulnerabilities in end-to-end encryption were found in\nthe SDKs which power Element, Beeper, Cinny, SchildiChat, Circuli, Synod.im\nand any other clients based on matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk or\nmatrix-android-sdk2.\nThese have now been fixed, and we have not seen evidence of them being\nexploited in the wild. All of the critical vulnerabilities require\ncooperation from a malicious homeserver to be exploited.\nPlease upgrade immediately in order to be protected against these\nvulnerabilities.\nClients with other encryption implementations (including Hydrogen, ElementX,\nNheko, FluffyChat, Syphon, Timmy, Gomuks and Pantalaimon) are not affected;\nthis is not a protocol bug.\nWe take the security of our end-to-end encryption extremely seriously, and we\nhave an ongoing series of public independent audits booked to help guard\nagainst future vulnerabilities.  We will also be making some protocol changes\nin the future to provide additional layers of protection.\nThis resolves the pre-disclosure issued on September 23rd.\n\n\nHi all,\nRecently we have been hard at work investigating some subtle security\nvulnerabilities in certain implementations of Matrix's end-to-end encryption\nwhich were responsibly disclosed to us by researchers at Royal Holloway\nUniversity London, University of Sheffield and Brave Software. Two of these\nvulnerabilities are critical severity, in that they could allow malicious\nserver admins to attack their users, and are implementation bugs in clients\nusing matrix-js-sdk (e.g. Element Web) or implementations derived from\nmatrix-js-sdk, rather than protocol flaws. matrix-rust-sdk (and other 2nd/3rd\ngeneration SDKs) are not affected by these.  These vulnerabilities are fixed in\ntoday's release, and we are not aware of them having been exploited in the\nwild.\nIf you're using Element or an application that shares the same SDKs (Beeper,\nCinny, SchildiChat, Circuli, Synod.im) then please upgrade now. Do not perform\nverification with new devices until you have upgraded.\nWe'd like to thank the security researchers for investing significant time and\neffort into doing a deep dive to find these issues, and thus contributing\nmaterially to making Matrix more secure for the whole ecosystem.  Despite our\nbest efforts, there is always a risk of security issues in software, and we're\nvery glad to have identified and fixed these issues while also taking the\nopportunity to improve our vulnerability disclosure and coordinated upgrade\nprocess.\nPlease note that the critical severity issues are implementation issues in\nmatrix-js-sdk and derivatives, and are not protocol issues in Matrix. The\nlatest version of the researchers' paper that we've seen incorrectly presents\nElement as 'the reference Matrix client', and confuses the higher severity\nimplementation bugs with lower severity protocol critique.  This is very\nunfortunate, given Hydrogen, ElementX, Nheko, FluffyChat, Syphon, Timmy, Gomuks\nand Pantalaimon and other independent implementations are not affected. In\nfact, every client independently implemented using the Matrix spec seems to\nhave got it right, which speaks well of the protocol.  It's only the first\ngeneration SDK (predating the spec) and its derivatives which had these bugs.\nThe two critical severity issues lead to three attack scenarios, all of which\nare prevented by today's releases:\n\n\n\"Key/Device Identifier Confusion in SAS Verification\" – A bug existed in\nmatrix-js-sdk where it confused together device IDs and cross-signing keys\n(given under the hood, cross-signing keys are represented as devices). This\ncould be exploited by a malicious server admin to break emoji-based\nverification when cross-signing is in use, authenticating themselves rather\nthan the target user being verified. This bug is only present in\nmatrix-js-sdk (not iOS or Android SDKs), tracked as a critical severity CVE:\nCVE-2022-39250.\n\n\n\"Trusted Impersonation\" – matrix-js-sdk (and derived SDKs) suffered from\na protocol-confusion bug where it would incorrectly accept to-device messages\nencrypted by Megolm rather than Olm, attributing them to the Megolm sender\nrather than the actual sender. As a result, an attacker could fake the\ntrusted sender of to-device messages, allowing them to send fake to-device\nmessages to devices - e.g. fake keys to spoof historical messages from other\nusers.  This bug is tracked as a critical severity CVE: CVE-2022-39251\n(matrix-js-sdk), CVE-2022-39255 (matrix-ios-sdk) and CVE-2022-39248\n(matrix-android-sdk2).\n\n\n\"Malicious key backup\" – the above 'trusted impersonation' bug in\nmatrix-js-sdk (and derived SDKs) could be used by a malicious homeserver\nadmin to add a malicious key backup to the user's account under certain\nunusual conditions in order to exfiltrate message keys. While we are not\naware of this being exploited in the wild, out of an abundance of caution we\nrecommend checking your key backup settings. If you are particularly paranoid\nyou may wish to reset your online key backup.  This doesn't have a separate\nCVE, as the root cause is the same as \"Trusted Impersonation\".\n\n\nThree lower priority issues were also identified by the researchers:\n\n\n\"Semi-trusted Impersonation\" – matrix-js-sdk (and derived SDKs) accepted keys\nforwarded by other users, even if your client didn't request them. As\na result, a malicious server admin could fake an encrypted message to look as\nif it was sent from a given user on that server. However, impersonated\nmessages like this are clearly marked  by clients like Element with a clear\n\"The authenticity of this encrypted message can't be guaranteed\" warning\n– which is why we consider this low severity. That said, it's an avoidable\nattack, and we've fixed this by ensuring that clients don't accept 'unsafe'\nkeys (with the exception of keys forwarded when you invite a user to an\nexisting conversation).  In future, in Olm/Megolm v2 we're also linking\nkey-sending events to the underlying recipient Olm identity to ensure that\nkeys cannot be misappropriated.  This issue is tracked as a moderate severity\nCVE: CVE-2022-39249 (matrix-js-sdk), CVE-2022-39257 (matrix-ios-sdk) and\nCVE-2022-39246 (matrix-android-sdk2).\n\n\n\"Homeserver Control of Room Membership\" – A malicious homeserver can fake\ninvites on behalf of its users to invite malicious users into their\nconversations, or add malicious devices into its users accounts.  However,\nwhen this happens, we clearly warn the user: if you have verified the users\nyou are talking to, the room and user will be shown with a big red cross to\nmark if malicious devices have been added.  Similarly, if an unexpected user\nis invited to a conversation, all users can clearly see and take evasive\naction.  Therefore we consider this a low severity issue.  That said, this\nbehaviour can be improved, and we've started work on switching our trust\nmodel to trust-on-first-use (so that new untrusted devices are proactively\nexcluded from conversations, even if you haven't explicitly verified their\nowner) - and we're also looking to add cryptographic signatures to membership\nevents in E2EE rooms to stop impersonated invites.  These fixes will land\nover the coming months.\n\n\n\"IND-CCA break\" – Matrix's usage of AES-CTR to encrypt attachments, secrets\nand symmetric key backups is not \"IND-CCA2 secure\", because it does not\ninclude the AES initialisation vector within the hash used to secure the\npayload from tampering. As a result, if an attacker could observe the result\nof both a given encryption and a given decryption operation, it would be\npossible to extract the encryption private key. However, this is a purely\ntheoretical attack as Matrix does not provide a way to mount the attack. In\nthe future, we will fix our use of AES-CTR to include the IV within the hash.\n\n\nWe'd like to again thank Martin R. Albrecht and Dan Jones from the Information\nSecurity Group at Royal Holloway University London, Benjamin Dowling from\nSecurity of Advanced Systems Group, University of Sheffield and Sofía Celi from\nBrave Software for discovering these issues and responsibly disclosing them to\nus, and then working with us to agree on an extended disclosure window given\nthe amount of work needed to verify and ship fixes throughout Matrix over the\ncourse of the summer period.  We welcome any further formal security analysis\nwork, and hope that it will distinguish clearly between Matrix-the-protocol and\nMatrix implementations like matrix-js-sdk, rather than conflating them. You can\nread their full paper here.\nWe'd also like to thank all the downstream Element package maintainers,\ndownstream forks and other affected clients for working together under time\nconstraints for this coordinated release - your patience and understanding is\nvery much appreciated indeed.\nMeanwhile, we are taking extreme measures to avoid future E2EE vulnerabilities.\nYou will notice that matrix-rust-sdk, hydrogen-sdk and other 2nd and 3rd\ngeneration SDKs were not affected by the bugs at the root cause of the critical\nissues here. This is precisely why we have been working on replacing the\nfirst generation SDKs with a clean, carefully written Rust implementation in\nthe form of matrix-rust-sdk, complete with an ongoing independent public audit.\nWe started the process of auditing matrix-rust-sdk with the Least Authority\nvodozemac audit in May, and we have three more audits agreed\n– covering matrix-rust-sdk-crypto, matrix-rust-sdk, and a whole reference\nMatrix stack.  Ironically, the mitigation work for these vulnerabilities in the\nlegacy SDKs has severely impacted our timelines for finishing\nmatrix-rust-sdk-crypto work (in fact, we had to push back the Least Authority\naudit of matrix-rust-sdk-crypto given the\nburndown has not\nprogressed), but we will be shifting to the new audited codebase as rapidly as\nwe possibly can.\nOver the coming months we will also introduce our first ever major version\nupdate of Olm and Megolm, in order to fix the MAC truncation issue highlighted\nin the vodozemac audit (Issue J), and reduce the risk of further\nkey-forwarding issues (as per the \"Semi-trusted Impersonation\" vulnerability\nabove). New conversations will default to using v2 of Olm/Megolm for security,\nand existing conversations can be optionally upgraded (similar to a 'room\nversion' upgrade in Matrix today). We are also adding extensive end-to-end\ntesting using Polyjuice and Traffic\nLight to stress-test encryption\nand improve reliability.\nFinally, we will continue our research into layering Matrix over Messaging\nLayer Security (MLS) - the IETF proposed standard for interoperable end-to-end\nencrypted group messaging.  This work has been delayed by the mitigation\nactivity above, but otherwise it's making good progress and we're excited to\nsee how Decentralised MLS performs in reality against Olm+Megolm v2.\nWe'd like to apologise to the wider Matrix community for the inconvenience and\ndisruption of these issues, and thank you for your patience while we've\nresolved them.\nMatthew, Denis and the Matrix cryptography &amp; security teams.\n","id":"/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients/","title":"Upgrade now to address E2EE vulnerabilities in matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk2"},"/blog/2022/09/29/matrix-v-1-4-release/":{"body":"Hey all,\nIt’s finally here: threads, edits, and private read receipts. v1.4 has been a little later than usual in the quarter because we wanted to make sure we nailed down all the core MSCs for threads before publishing the spec itself, but we’ve done that now and we’re excited about it.\n\nMatrix 1.3 was just over 3 months ago, though with the relatively large features there and the colossal implementation effort of v1.4 we’re not expecting everyone to have implementations on day 1. Instead, as with all spec releases, we encourage implementations to gradually update over the next few months. We’re additionally planning to make v1.5 (Q4 2022) more of a maintenance update to help make the backlog a bit easier on everyone, though we might prioritize a couple cool features in there too :)\nMatrix 1.4 sees 14 MSCs get merged, but we can’t possibly go into detail on them all here. We’ve instead focused on the 3 major features we’re excited about - check out the changelog at the end for the full picture.\n🧵 Threads\nThreads, a critical feature in terms of parity with other chat systems, have landed thanks to a whopping 6 MSCs: MSC3440, MSC3816, MSC3856, MSC3715, MSC3771, and MSC3773. It’s been a lot of iteration on the reference implementations to get threads this far, and we’re excited to see how the client implementations evolve to provide more structured and less noisy communication for everyone - keep us updated with TWIM posts, please!\nThreads have involved changes to event relationships (which were fixed in v1.3), read receipts, and notification counts, resulting in several different models and ways of solving the problem. We think we’ve reached a point that works for conversational threads, though there’s work on the horizon for threads-only rooms, Twitter-style free-form threads, etc to cover more needs of users.\nCurrently, the demonstration implementation of threads in Synapse and Element is working its way out of the proof-of-concept and beta stages (which were sufficient to validate the MSCs) and are on their way to exiting beta. Keep an eye on the respective blogs for news about production-ready threads!\n📝 Edits\nSimilar to reactions, err, aggregations, MSC2676 and its predecessors have been around for a long while. Edits have existed in the Element clients seemingly forever, and other clients have had troubles trying to implement the same feature: with it now in the spec, it should be a lot easier to bring edits into clients.\nFor edits, we’ve taken the route of making the MSC match reality, for better or worse. MSCs which improve or add functionality to the system are very much welcome - writing an MSC is relatively easy and helps the whole community.\n👥 Private read receipts\nNot everyone wants to broadcast that they’ve read a message, but also with read receipts tied into notifications those same people also probably don’t want stuck notifications. To address the problem, we’ve added a new m.read.private receipt type which behaves exactly like m.read, but is only visible to you.\nWe still have a rework of the notifications system in our long-term plan, but this should hopefully cover the privacy concerns for the time being :)\nThe full changelog\nMSCs are how the spec changes in the way it does - adding, fixing, and maintaining features for the whole ecosystem to use. The blog post can’t cover them all, but that doesn’t make them any less important!

On one hand, we consider it to be a low severity issue because we warn users when unexpected devices or users join an E2EE room (if you have verified users; if you haven’t verified all bets are off anyway). On the other hand, many in the cryptography community consider this a serious misdesign. Eitherway, it’s avoidable behaviour and we’re ramping up work now to address it by signing room memberships so the clients control membership rather than the server.\n\nThib adds\n\nFor a balanced coveraged of the vulnerability, see the following articles:\n\nMatrix.org Foundation — Upgrade now to address E2EE vulnerabilities in matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk and matrix-android-sdk2\nThe original paper — Practically-exploitable Cryptographic Vulnerabilities in Matrix\nars technica — Serious vulnerabilities in Matrix’s end-to-end encryption have been patched\n\n\nDept of Spec 📜\nAndrew Morgan (anoa) reports\n\nHere's your weekly spec update!

Check it out!\nRandom MSC of the Week\nThe random MSC of the week is... MSC2596: Proposal to always allow rescinding invites!\nWhen you invite a user to a room in Matrix, you send a membership state event of \"invite\" with their Matrix ID as a state key. This requires a high enough power level to \"invite\" users. If you would like to rescind this invite, you would send a second membership state event of \"leave\". A separate power level is required to the do the latter.\nThere is an edge case whereas if you have the power level required to invite a user, but not set their membership to \"leave\" (aka kicking them), then you wind up not being able to rescind an invite. This can be unwelcome, especially if you accidentally invited a user.\nThis MSC aims to define rescinding an invite as a special case, with separate power level logic from the generic \"set a user's membership to 'leave'\" action - allowing anyone to rescind an invite they sent regardless of their current power level.\nSeems useful to me! If this is something that bothers you, feel free to weigh in on the proposal with feedback.\n\n\njaller94 says\n\nMatrix Spec v1.4 for Dash and Zeal\nI've updated the Dash/Zeal Docset which you can use to read the Matrix Spec offline.\nLink to the new Docset: https://chrpaul.de/dash/Matrix-docset-1.4-1.tgz\nIf you use Dash or Zeal, give it a try.

The intention is to run a version of this scalable proxy to support expected user loads on matrix.org.\n\n\nThis is currently a work in progress, but the majority of the work is now complete, so watch this space! To get a high-level overview of the changes, take a look at the scaling design doc.\n\nSynapse (website)\nSynapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team\nShay announces\n\nHello all. Synapse team has been hard at work, and just released v1.68.0. As mentioned last week, this will be the\nfirst version to require Rust. Some other notable features are:\n\nAdd an admin API endpoint to fetch messages within a particular window of time.\nAdd an admin API endpoint to find a user based on their external ID in an auth provider.\nPlus a host of bugfixes, internal changes to speed up Synapse 🚀(including work on faster joins-stay tuned as this is quickly approaching), improvements to the documentation, and more. Check it out here!: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/27/synapse-1-68-released\n\n\nDendrite (website)\nSecond generation Matrix homeserver\nneilalexander reports\n\nThis week we released Dendrite 0.10.0 which contains a number of significant improvements and fixes. If you are running a Dendrite server, please upgrade! Changes include:\n\nHigh performance full-text searching has been added to Dendrite\n\nSearch must be enabled in the search section of the sync_api config before it can be used\nThe search index is stored on the filesystem rather than the sync API database, so a path to a suitable storage location on disk must be configured\n\n\nSync requests should now complete faster and use considerably less database connections as a result of better transactional isolation\nThe notifications code has been refactored to hopefully make notifications more reliable\nA new /_dendrite/admin/refreshDevices/{userID} admin endpoint has been added for forcing a refresh of a remote user's device lists without having to modify the database by hand\nA new /_dendrite/admin/fulltext/reindex admin endpoint has been added for rebuilding the search index (although this may take some time)\nA number of bugs in the device list updater have been fixed, which should help considerably with federated device list synchronisation and E2EE reliability\nA state resolution bug has been fixed which should help to prevent unexpected state resets\nThe deprecated \"origin\" field in events will now be correctly ignored in all cases\nRoom versions 8 and 9 will now correctly evaluate \"knock\" join rules and membership states\nA database index has been added to speed up finding room memberships in the sync API (contributed by PiotrKozimor)\nThe client API will now return an M_UNRECOGNIZED error for unknown endpoints/methods, which should help with client error handling\nA bug has been fixed when updating push rules which could result in database is locked on SQLite\n\nAs always, please feel free to join us in #dendrite:matrix.org for more related discussion.\n\nDept of Clients 📱\nSmallTalk (website)\nMinimal Android messenger powered by Matrix\nadam reports\n\nA lightweight Android matrix client, focused on family and friends messaging.\nIt's been a while since the last TWIM update, development is still progressing and the app is still small (1.84mb~ when delivered via app bundle)!\nSome of the bigger recent highlights -\n\nMaterial You theme\nNotifications overhaul - adding support for UnifiedPush, consistent ping rules and a first pass at invitations.\nAttaching or sharing images.\nA FOSS variant hosted on IzzySoft's F-Droid repository.\nAutomatic Monday &amp; Thursday release trains.\nA separate repository for feature requests\n\nThere's still a few big features missing like room history, verification and a form of markdown support but if you're feeling brave SmallTalk is in the it's kinda usable phase, links below for trying it out!\n| Google Play Beta | F-Droid via IzzySoft | Repository | Matrix room |\n\nQuadrix (website)\nA Minimal, simple, multi-platform chat client for the Matrix protocol.\nJFA reports\n\nQuadrix v1.3.6 has been released and is available for mobiles and desktops in the respective app stores (the iOS version is still awaiting approval).\nThe release brings bug fixes, \"under the hood\" improvements, with upgrades to React 18 and React-Native 0.70, and also two new features:\n\nA floating \"Send\" button just above the virtual keyboard on mobile devices, useful especially on larger phones.\nAn information button on the main screen, for now only used to inform users that a new app version is available.\n\nPlease leave feedback/comments at #quadrix:matrix.org or in the issues at https://github.com/alariej/quadrix (stars welcome :-)\n\nNheko (website)\nDesktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.\nNico reports\n\nNheko version 0.10.2 is out now.\nThis is a security release!\nA malicious homeserver could intercept the secrets requests after a verification or when clicking the button for it in the settings and poison the cached secrets in Nheko. This could in theory be used to mark some devices as cross-signed over federation that weren't or to attack the online key backup as such this is fairly high severity.\nTo protect against this update to 0.10.2 or don't do any verifications of your own devices while on a vulnerable version (and don't hit the request buttons in the settings).\nThanks goes out to the matrix.org team for disclosing this!\n\nNico announces\n\nAs mentionedin the security update earlier, we had a small security release on Wednesday. As part of that we requested our first CVE. While security issues are never something you want to have, this still feels like a major milestone for Nheko. It is certainly not something I even imagined when I started contributing to Nheko and yet here we are. I'd like to thank everyone who made this security release as seamless as it was and I appreciate that all of you were as understanding as you were! I certainly don't take that for granted! But now on to some more fun stuff:\nNheko now has crude support for threading. This means you can start and participate in a thread and replies automatically land in a thread by default. Threads are also now marked in the timeline. Noticeably are ways to filter down the timeline to a specific thread, which will be added at a later date. This now makes Nheko technically implement all new features of Matrix 1.4 in some way or another.\nNheko now also allows you to edit permissions in a community and all the rooms in the community at once as long as you have permission to do so. This should make managing larger communities much easier. As part of that we now also try to handle rate limits more gracefully.\nWe also upgraded our codebase to some subset of C++20. The major blocker there is Apple, who only implements a very tiny subset of C++20 features at this time (even though they default to C++23...). As part of that we also made our Apple codesigning much more robust and widened our build testing matrix.\n\nFractal (website)\nMatrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.\nJulian Sparber announces\n\nThis week we tagged Fractal as 5.alpha1. This is our first release since Fractal has been rewritten to take advantage of GTK 4 and the Matrix Rust SDK. It is the result of eighteen months of work.\nCurrently supported features are:\n\nSending and receiving messages and files\nSending files via Drag-n-Drop and pasting in the message entry\nRendering of rich formatted (HTML) messages, as well as media\nDisplaying edited messages, redacting messages\nShowing and adding reactions\nTab completion of user names\nSending and displaying replies\nSharing the current location\nExploring the room directory\nSorting the rooms by category\nJoining rooms\nSending and accepting invitations\nLogging into multiple accounts at once\nLogging in with Single-Sign On\nSending and reading encrypted messages\nVerifying user sessions using cross-signing\nExporting and importing encryption keys\nManaging the connected devices\nChanging the user profile details\nDeactivating the account\n\nMajor missing features are:\n\nNotifications\nRead markers\n\nAs the name implies, this is still considered alpha stage and is not ready for general use just yet. If you want to give this development version a try, you can get it from the GNOME Apps Nightly flatpak repository.\nA list of known issues and missing features for a 5.0 release can be found in the Fractal v5 milestone on Gitlab.\nWe also published a blogpost about the security quick scan performed by Radically Open Security as part of the NLnet grant https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2022/09/27/fractal-security-audit/\n\n\n\nEment.el (website)\nMatrix client for Emacs\nalphapapa says\n\nEment.el, a Matrix client for GNU Emacs, has been updated to version 0.3.  It can be installed directly from GNU ELPA with the command M-x package-install RET ement RET.\nSince the last announcement on TWIM, the following improvements have been made.  The most notable is the addition of the ement-directory commands that allow listing and searching public room directories.\nAdditions\n\nCommand ement-directory shows a server's room directory.\nCommand ement-directory-search searches a server's room directory.\nCommand ement-directory-next fetches the next batch of rooms in a directory.\nCommand ement-leave-room accepts a FORCE-P argument (interactively, with prefix) to leave a room without prompting.\nCommand ement-forget-room accepts a FORCE-P argument (interactively, with prefix) to also leave the room, and to forget it without prompting.\nOption ement-notify-mark-frame-urgent-predicates marks the frame as urgent when (by default) a message mentions the local user or \"@room\" and the message's room has an open buffer.\n\nChanges\n\nRead receipts are re-enabled.\nWhen determining whether a room is considered unread, non-message events like membership changes, reactions, etc. are ignored.  This fixes a bug that caused certain rooms that had no message events (like some bridged rooms) to appear as unread when they shouldn't have.\nThe ement-taxy-room-list view no longer automatically refreshes the list if the region is active in the buffer.  (This allows the user to operate on multiple rooms without the contents of the buffer changing before completing the process.)\nMinor improvements to date/time headers.\n\nFixes\n\nLinks to only rooms (as opposed to links to events in rooms) may be activated to join them.\nRead receipts mark the last completely visible event (rather than one that's only partially displayed).\nPrevent error when a room avatar image fails to load.\nInfo manual export filename.\nCommand ement-describe-room for rooms without topics.\nImprove insertion of old messages around existing timestamp headers.\nReduce D-Bus notification system check timeout to 2 seconds (from the default of 25).\nCompatibility with Emacs 27.\n\n\nElement Web/Desktop (website)\nSecure and independent communication, connected via Matrix.

Please make sure to upgrade.\nThere’s exciting work happening on deferring DM creation until the first message is sent. \nAlso, improvements have been made to the new app layout. It’s available in Labs today but will be the default from the next release so be sure to check it out and let us know what you think?\n\n\nElement (website)\nEverything related to Element but not strictly bound to a client\nDanielle announces\n\nThere have been security releases across our platforms this week; please make sure to upgrade to the following versions:\n\nElement Web/Desktop 1.11.8 or later\nElement Android 1.5.1 or later\nElement iOS 1.9.7 or later\n\nThe upgrades resolve two critical severity vulnerabilities in end-to-end encryption found in the SDKs which power Element, Beeper, Cinny, SchildiChat, Circuli, Synod.im and any other clients based on matrix-js-sdk, matrix-ios-sdk or matrix-android-sdk2.\nThe issues are fixed by the upgrades. Neither Element or Matrix have seen any evidence of them being exploited in the wild.\nFor the full background on the update, visit the Matrix blog post.\n\nCinny (website)\nCinny is a Matrix client focused on simplicity, elegance and security\nLozenge announces\n\nCinny v2.2.2\n*-----------\nIn this release we have bumped matrix-js-sdk to v20.0.0 as being a user of SDK, Cinny was affected with vulnerabilities found in it. So please make sure you are using Cinny v2.2.2 or higher.\nApart from that, this release also fixes some issues with markdown, crash on leaving space, and improves View source of events.\nSince we are talking about vulnerabilities, since v2 we have also taken zero vulnerable dependency approach and reduced vulnerable npm packages from 18 to just 3. We are working on 3 as well but good thing is that they are just dev dependencies so production builds doesn't include them.\nLastly, if you like you know more about Cinny, join our Matrix space: https://matrix.to/#/#cinny-space:matrix.org or see: https://cinny.in\n\nDept of Non Chat Clients 🎛️\nThirdroom (website)\nA browser-based open metaverse client\nRobert Long says\n\nHey everyone! We just launched Third Room Tech Preview 1! 3D decentralized virtual worlds built on Matrix! Go check it out: https://thirdroom.io\n\nDept of Widgets 🧩\nmatrix-widget-api\nDominik Henneke reports\n\nWe from Nordeck added support for retrieving related events in Widgets into the matrix-widget-api over the last weeks. With the existing APIs we could not reliable read all the data from the room, as the room timeline is lazily loaded in Element. To learn more about the issue, have a look at the related MSC. With this weeks Element release 1.11.6 this feature has now landed. The change improves using the room as a data storage for Matrix Widgets, which allows us to build cool tools. We keep you updated when we publish our widgets as Open Source.\n\nDept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰\nmatrix-rust-sdk (website)\nNext-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM\nben reports\n\nThe Matrix Rust SDK team is proud to announce, that we've released a new version of the SDK to the public: You can get the latest matrix-sdk 0.6.0 (and its subcrates) on crates.io since Wednesday, matrix-sdk-crypto-nodejs 0.1.0-beta.2 via npm since Thursday. Please note that this is a breaking release, with a quite few public API changes, that will probably break your build if you don't change your code for that. You can find broad list and a troubleshooting guide, helping you adapt your code to common errors you'll see in the Upgrade Guide provided. This also marks the first release, we have sliding-sync available behind a feature-flag for testing (note, that it doesn't yet support extensions for to-device messages or E2EE)If you are using latest main, be aware that most deprecated functions are going to be removed soon, as well as the previous experimental-timeline, which will be replaced by the next generation.\nAs you can imagine the release preparation and last minute fixes to bugs have been the main focus for the team that last two weeks. Most notably, we have fixed a nasty deserialization bug in encrypted to-device messages we found while experimenting with the [upcoming sliding sync extensions] and had to revert the changes to have join and leave return full room-types as that caused internal state inconsistencies, which we have to rework our architecture for to support proper.\n️ Wanna hack on matrix rust?

It's about exploring Matrix clients.\nThe concept is simple: For the month of October, only use Matrix clients that you don't normally use.\nI have gotten stuck in my ways - using the same Matrix client for years on end.\nWhen I was at the Matrix Community Summit in Berlin, I discovered that there are actually many mature clients, with distinct differences and advantages.\nSo, in order to break up my habits a little, I'm going to force myself to not use my daily-driver client for the month of October.\nI hope some of you want to join me! To that end, I set up a room for this project, to share our discoveries and frustrations, and compare experiences.\nJoin the room here: #other-clients-october:olli.ng\n\nDept of Guides 🧭\nPaul reports\n\nI wrote a small blog post about a bot that demonstrates the use of polls as menu-driven bot interaction.

Just like the rest of Matrix, they communicate via HTTP using\nJSON. Application services function in a very similar way to traditional\nclients, but they are given much more power than a normal client. They can\nreserve entire namespaces of room aliases and user IDs for their own purposes.\nThey can silently monitor events in rooms, or any events directed at any user\nID. This power allows application services to have extremely useful abilities\nwhich overall enhance the end user experience.\nOne of the main use cases for application services is protocol bridges. Our\nMatrix server on Matrix.org links in to various IRC channels and networks. This\nfunctionality was initially implemented as a simple bot which resided as a user\non the Matrix rooms we wanted to link to freenode channels\n(#matrix, #matrix-dev, #openwebrtc and #vuc etc). There was nothing special\nabout this bot; it is just treated as a client. However, as we started to rely\non it more and more though, we realised that there were things that were\nimpossible for simple client-side bots to do by themselves - for example, the\nbot could not reserve the virtual user IDs it wanted to create, and could not\nlazily bridge arbitrary IRC rooms on-the-fly - and this spurred the development\nof Application Services.\nSome of the features of the IRC application service we have since implemented include:\n\nSpecific channel-to-matrix room bridging : This is what the original IRC bot\ndid. You can specify specific channels and specific room IDs, and messages\nwill be bridged.\nDynamic channel-to-matrix room bridging : This allows Matrix users to join any\nchannel on an IRC network, rather than being forced to use one of the\nspecific channels configured.\nTwo-way PM support : IRC users can PM the virtual \"M-\" users and private\nMatrix rooms will be created. Likewise, Matrix users can invite the\nvirtual \"@irc_Nick:domain\" user IDs to a room and a PM to the IRC nick will\nbe made.\nIRC nick changing support: Matrix users are no longer forced to use \"M-\" nicks\nand can change them by sending \"!nick\" messages directly to the bridge.\nIdent support: This allows usernames to be authenticated for virtual IRC\nclients, which means IRC bans can be targeted at the Matrix user rather than\nthe entire application service.\n\nThe use of the Application Services API means:\n\nThe bot can reserve user IDs. This prevents humans from registering\nfor @irc_... user IDs which would then clash with the operation of the bot.\nThe bot can reserve room aliases. This prevents humans from register\nfor #irc_... aliases which would then clash with the operation of the bot.\nThe bot can trivially manage hundreds of users. Events are pushed to the\napplication service directly. If you tried to do this as a client-side bot,\nyou would need one event stream connection per virtual user.\nThe bot can lazily create rooms on demand. This means Matrix users can join\nnon-existent room aliases and have the application service quickly track an\nIRC channel and create a room with that alias, allowing the join request to\nsucceed.\n\nImplementation details:\n\nWritten in Node.js, designed to be run using forever.\nBuilt on the generic matrix-appservice-node\nframework.\nSupports sending metrics in statsd format.\nUses matrix-appservice-node to provide a standardised interface when writing\napplication services, rather than an explicit web framework (though under the\nhood matrix-appservice-node is using Express).\n\nAt present, the IRC application service is in beta, and is being run on #matrix\nand #matrix-dev. If you want to give it a go, [check it out on Github ]\n(https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc)!\nWhat Application services can do for you\nApplication services have enormous potential for creating new and exciting ways\nto transform and enhance the core Matrix protocol. For example, you could\naggregate information from multiple rooms into a summary room, or create\nthrowaway virtual user accounts to proxy messages for a fixed user ID\non-the-fly. As you may expect, all of this power assumes a high degree of trust\nbetween application services and homeservers. Only homeserver admins can allow\nan application service to link up with their homeserver, and the application\nservice is in no way federated to other homeservers. You can think of\napplication services as additional logic on the homeserver itself, without\nmessing around with the book-keeping that homeservers have to do. This makes\nadding useful functionality very easy.\nExample\nThe application service (AS) API itself uses webhooks to communicate from the\nhomeserver to the AS:\n\nRoom Alias Query API : The homeserver hits a URL on your application server to\nsee if a room alias exists.\nUser Query API : The homeserver hits a URL on your application server to see\nif a user ID exists.\nPush API : The homeserver hits a URL on your application server to notify you\nof new events for your users and rooms.\n\nA very basic application service may want to log all messages in rooms which\nhave an alias starting with \"#logged_\" (side note: logging won't work if these\nrooms are using end-to-end encryption).\nHere's an example of a very basic application service using Python (with Flask\nand Requests) which logs room activity:\n# app_service.py:\n\nimport json, requests  # we will use this later\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify, request\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/transactions/&lt;transaction&gt;\", methods=[\"PUT\"])\ndef on_receive_events(transaction):\n    events = request.get_json()[\"events\"]\n    for event in events:\n        print \"User: %s Room: %s\" % (event[\"user_id\"], event[\"room_id\"])\n        print \"Event Type: %s\" % event[\"type\"]\n        print \"Content: %s\" % event[\"content\"]\n    return jsonify({})\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run()\n\nSet your new application service running on port 5000 with:\npython app_service.py\n\nThe homeserver needs to know that the application service exists before it will\nsend requests to it. This is done via a registration YAML file which is\nspecified in Synapse's main config file e.g. homeserver.yaml. The server\nadmin needs to add the application service registration configuration file as\nan entry to this file.\n# homeserver.yaml\napp_service_config_files:\n  - \"/path/to/appservice/registration.yaml\"\n\nNB: Note the \"-\" at the start; this indicates a list element. The registration\nfile registration.yaml should look like:\n# registration.yaml\n\n# An ID which is unique across all application services on your homeserver. This should never be changed once set.\nid: \"something-good\"\n\n# this is the base URL of the application service\nurl: \"http://localhost:5000\"\n\n# This is the token that the AS should use as its access_token when using the Client-Server API\n# This can be anything you want.\nas_token: wfghWEGh3wgWHEf3478sHFWE\n\n# This is the token that the HS will use when sending requests to the AS.\n# This can be anything you want.\nhs_token: ugw8243igya57aaABGFfgeyu\n\n# this is the local part of the desired user ID for this AS (in this case @logging:localhost)\nsender_localpart: logging\nnamespaces:\n  users: []\n  rooms: []\n  aliases:\n    - exclusive: false\n      regex: \"#logged_.*\"\n\nYou will need to restart the homeserver after editing the config file before\nit will take effect.\nTo test everything is working correctly, go ahead and explicitly create a room\nwith the alias #logged_test:localhost and send a message into the room: the\nHS will relay the message to the AS by PUTing to /transactions/&lt;id&gt; and you\nshould see your AS print the event on the terminal. This will monitor any room\nwhich has an alias prefix of #logged_, but it won't lazily create room\naliases if they don't already exist. This means it will only log messages in\nthe room you created before: #logged_test:localhost. Try joining the room\n#logged_test2:localhost without creating it, and it will fail. Let's fix that\nand add in lazy room creation:\n@app.route(\"/rooms/&lt;alias&gt;\")\ndef query_alias(alias):\n    alias_localpart = alias.split(\":\")[0][1:]\n    requests.post(\n        # NB: \"TOKEN\" is the as_token referred to in registration.yaml\n        \"http://localhost:8008/_matrix/client/api/v1/createRoom?access_token=TOKEN\",\n        json.dumps({\n            \"room_alias_name\": alias_localpart\n        }),\n        headers={\"Content-Type\":\"application/json\"}\n    )\n    return jsonify({})\n\nThis makes the application service lazily create a room with the requested alias\nwhenever the HS queries the AS for the existence of that alias (when users try\nto join that room), allowing any room with the alias prefix #logged_ to be sent\nto the AS. Now try joining the room \"#logged_test2:localhost\" and it will work\nas you'd expect.  You can see that if this were a real bridge, the AS would\nhave checked for the existence of #logged_test2 in the remote network, and then\nlazily-created it in Matrix as required.\nApplication services are powerful components which extend the functionality of\nhomeservers, but they are limited. They can only ever function in a \"passive\"\nway. For example, you cannot implement an application service which censors\nswear words in rooms, because there is no way to prevent the event from being\nsent. Aside from the fact that censoring will not work when using end-to-end\nencryption, all federated homeservers would also need to reject the event in\norder to stop developing an inconsistent event graph. To \"actively\" monitor\nevents, another component called a \"Policy Server\" is required, which is beyond\nthe scope of this post.  Also, Application Services can result in a performance\nbottleneck, as all events on the homeserver must be ordered and sent to the\nregistered application services.  If you are bridging huge amounts of traffic,\nyou may be better off having your bridge directly talk the Server-Server\nfederation API rather than the simpler Application Service API.\nI hope this demonstrates how easy it is to create an application service, along with a few ideas of the kinds of things you can do with them. Obvious uses include build protocol bridges, search engines, invisible bots, etc. For more information on the AS HTTP API, check out the new Application Service API section in the spec, or the raw drafts and spec in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/.\n","id":"/docs/legacy/application-services/","title":"Application Services"},"/docs/legacy/client-server-api/":{"body":"How to use the client-server API\nIf you haven't already, get a homeserver up and running on\nhttps://localhost:8448 - e.g. by following the instructions at\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md\nAccounts\nBefore you can send and receive messages, you must register for an account.\nIf you already have an account, you must login into it.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.8.3/matrix-org/matrix.org/tree/master/jekyll/_posts/howtos/jsfiddles/register_login\nRegistration\nThe aim of registration is to get a user ID and access token which you will need\nwhen accessing other APIs:\ncurl -XPOST -d '{\"username\":\"example\", \"password\":\"wordpass\", \"auth\": {\"type\":\"m.login.dummy\"}}' \"https://localhost:8448/_matrix/client/r0/register\"\n\n{\n    \"access_token\": \"QGV4YW1wbGU6bG9jYWxob3N0.AqdSzFmFYrLrTmteXc\",\n    \"home_server\": \"localhost\",\n    \"user_id\": \"@example:localhost\"\n}\n\nNB: If a user is not specified, one will be randomly generated for you. If you\ndo not specify a password, you will be unable to login to the account if you\nforget the access_token.\nImplementation note: The matrix specification does not enforce how users\nregister with a server. It just specifies the URL path and absolute minimum\nkeys. The reference homeserver uses a username/password to authenticate user,\nbut other homeservers may use different methods. This is why you need to\nspecify the type of method.\nLogin\nThe aim when logging in is to get an access token for your existing user ID:\ncurl -XGET \"https://localhost:8448/_matrix/client/r0/login\"\n\n{\n    \"flows\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"m.login.password\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\ncurl -XPOST -d '{\"type\":\"m.login.password\", \"user\":\"example\", \"password\":\"wordpass\"}' \"https://localhost:8448/_matrix/client/r0/login\"\n\n{\n    \"access_token\": \"QGV4YW1wbGU6bG9jYWxob3N0.vRDLTgxefmKWQEtgGd\",\n    \"home_server\": \"localhost\",\n    \"user_id\": \"@example:localhost\"\n}\n\nImplementation note: Different homeservers may implement different methods for\nlogging in to an existing account. In order to check that you know how to login\nto this homeserver, you must perform a GET first and make sure you recognise\nthe login type. If you do not know how to login, you can GET /login/fallback\nwhich will return a basic webpage which you can use to login. The reference\nhomeserver implementation support username/password login, but other\nhomeservers may support different login methods (e.g. OAuth2).\nCommunicating\nIn order to communicate with another user, you must create a room with that\nuser and send a message to that room.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.8.3/matrix-org/matrix.org/tree/master/jekyll/_posts/howtos/jsfiddles/create_room_send_msg\nCreating a room\nIf you want to send a message to someone, you have to be in a room with them. To\ncreate a room:\n    curl -XPOST -d '{\"room_alias_name\":\"tutorial\"}' \"https://localhost:8448/_matrix/client/r0/createRoom?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\n\n    {\n        \"room_alias\": \"#tutorial:localhost\",\n        \"room_id\": \"!asfLdzLnOdGRkdPZWu:localhost\"\n    }\n\nThe \"room alias\" is a human-readable string which can be shared with other users\nso they can join a room, rather than the room ID which is a randomly generated\nstring. You can have multiple room aliases per room.\nSending messages\nYou can now send messages to this room:\ncurl -XPOST -d '{\"msgtype\":\"m.text\", \"body\":\"hello\"}' \"https://localhost:8448/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/%21asfLdzLnOdGRkdPZWu:localhost/send/m.room.message?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\n\n{\n    \"event_id\": \"YUwRidLecu\"\n}\n\nThe event ID returned is a unique ID which identifies this message.\nNB: There are no limitations to the types of messages which can be exchanged.\nThe only requirement is that \"msgtype\" is specified. The Matrix specification\noutlines the following standard types: m.text, m.image, m.audio,\nm.video, m.location, m.emote. See the specification for more information\non these types.\nUsers and rooms\nEach room can be configured to allow or disallow certain rules. In particular,\nthese rules may specify if you require an invitation from someone already\nin the room in order to join the room. In addition, you may also be able to\njoin a room via a room alias if one was set up.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.8.3/matrix-org/matrix.org/tree/master/jekyll/_posts/howtos/jsfiddles/room_memberships\nInviting a user to a room\nYou can directly invite a user to a room like so:\ncurl -XPOST -d '{\"user_id\":\"@myfriend:localhost\"}' \"https://localhost:8448/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/%21asfLdzLnOdGRkdPZWu:localhost/invite?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\n\nThis informs @myfriend:localhost of the room ID\n!CvcvRuDYDzTOzfKKgh:localhost and allows them to join the room.\nJoining a room via an invite\nIf you receive an invite, you can join the room:\ncurl -XPOST -d '{}' \"https://localhost:8448/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/%21asfLdzLnOdGRkdPZWu:localhost/join?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\n\nNB: Only the person invited (@myfriend:localhost) can change the membership\nstate to \"join\". Repeatedly joining a room does nothing.\nJoining a room via an alias\nAlternatively, if you know the room alias for this room and the room config\nallows it, you can directly join a room via the alias:\ncurl -XPOST -d '{}' \"https://localhost:8448/_matrix/client/r0/join/%21asfLdzLnOdGRkdPZWu:localhost?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\n\n{\n    \"room_id\": \"!CvcvRuDYDzTOzfKKgh:localhost\"\n}\n\nYou will need to use the room ID when sending messages, not the room alias.\nNB: If the room is configured to be an invite-only room, you will still require\nan invite in order to join the room even though you know the room alias. As a\nresult, it is more common to see a room alias in relation to a public room,\nwhich do not require invitations.\nGetting events\nAn event is some interesting piece of data that a client may be interested in.\nIt can be a message in a room, a room invite, etc. There are many different\nways of getting events, depending on what the client already knows.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.8.3/matrix-org/matrix.org/tree/master/jekyll/_posts/howtos/jsfiddles/event_stream\nGetting all state\nIf the client doesn't know any information on the rooms the user is\ninvited/joined on, they can get all the user's state for all rooms:\ncurl -XGET \"https://localhost:8448/_matrix/client/r0/sync?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\n\n{\n    \"account_data\": {\n        \"events\": [\n            {\n                ...\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"next_batch\": \"s9_3_0_1_1_1\",\n    \"presence\": {\n        \"events\": [\n            {\n                \"content\": {\n                    \"currently_active\": true,\n                    \"last_active_ago\": 19,\n                    \"presence\": \"online\"\n                },\n                \"sender\": \"@example:localhost\",\n                \"type\": \"m.presence\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"rooms\": {\n        \"invite\": {},\n        \"join\": {\n            \"!asfLdzLnOdGRkdPZWu:localhost\": {\n                \"account_data\": {\n                    \"events\": []\n                },\n                \"ephemeral\": {\n                    \"events\": []\n                },\n                \"state\": {\n                    \"events\": []\n                },\n                \"timeline\": {\n                    \"events\": [\n                        {\n                            \"content\": {\n                                \"creator\": \"@example:localhost\"\n                            },\n                            \"event_id\": \"$14606534990LhqHt:localhost\",\n                            \"origin_server_ts\": 1460653499699,\n                            \"sender\": \"@example:localhost\",\n                            \"state_key\": \"\",\n                            \"type\": \"m.room.create\",\n                            \"unsigned\": {\n                                \"age\": 239192\n                            }\n                        },\n                        {\n                            \"content\": {\n                                \"avatar_url\": null,\n                                \"displayname\": null,\n                                \"membership\": \"join\"\n                            },\n                            \"event_id\": \"$14606534991nsZKk:localhost\",\n                            \"membership\": \"join\",\n                            \"origin_server_ts\": 1460653499727,\n                            \"sender\": \"@example:localhost\",\n                            \"state_key\": \"@example:localhost\",\n                            \"type\": \"m.room.member\",\n                            \"unsigned\": {\n                                \"age\": 239164\n                            }\n                        },\n                        ...\n                    ],\n                    \"limited\": false,\n                    \"prev_batch\": \"s9_3_0_1_1_1\"\n                },\n                \"unread_notifications\": {}\n            }\n        },\n        \"leave\": {}\n    }\n}\n\nThis returns all the room information the user is invited/joined on, as well as\nall of the presences relevant for these rooms. This can be a LOT of data. You\nmay just want the most recent event for each room. This can be achieved by\napplying a filter that asks for a limit of 1 timeline event per room:\ncurl --globoff -XGET 'https://localhost:8448/_matrix/client/r0/sync?filter={\"room\":{\"timeline\":{\"limit\":1}}}&amp;access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'\n\n{\n    ...\n    \"rooms\": {\n        \"invite\": {},\n        \"join\": {\n            \"!asfLdzLnOdGRkdPZWu:localhost\": {\n                ...\n                \"timeline\": {\n                    \"events\": [\n                        {\n                            \"content\": {\n                                \"body\": \"hello\",\n                                \"msgtype\": \"m.text\"\n                            },\n                            \"event_id\": \"$14606535757KCGXo:localhost\",\n                            \"origin_server_ts\": 1460653575105,\n                            \"sender\": \"@example:localhost\",\n                            \"type\": \"m.room.message\",\n                            \"unsigned\": {\n                                \"age\": 800348\n                            }\n                        }\n                    ],\n                    \"limited\": true,\n                    \"prev_batch\": \"t8-8_7_0_1_1_1\"\n                },\n                \"unread_notifications\": {}\n            }\n        },\n        \"leave\": {}\n    }\n}\n\n(additionally we have to ask curl not to try to interpret any {} characters\nin the URL, which is what the --globoff option is for)\nGetting live state\nIn the response to this sync request the server includes a token that can be\nused to obtain updates since this point under the object key next_batch. To\nuse this token, specify its value as the since parameter to another /sync\nrequest.:\ncurl -XGET \"https://localhost:8448/_matrix/client/r0/sync?since=s9_7_0_1_1_1&amp;access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\n\n{\n    \"account_data\": {\n        \"events\": []\n    },\n    \"next_batch\": \"s9_9_0_1_1_1\",\n    \"presence\": {\n        \"events\": [\n            {\n                \"content\": {\n                    \"currently_active\": true,\n                    \"last_active_ago\": 12,\n                    \"presence\": \"online\"\n                },\n                \"sender\": \"@example:localhost\",\n                \"type\": \"m.presence\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"rooms\": {\n        \"invite\": {},\n        \"join\": {},\n        \"leave\": {}\n    }\n}\n\nBy default this request will not wait in the server, always returning a value\neven if nothing interesting happened. However, by applying the timeout query\nparameter, which gives a duration in milliseconds, we can ask the server to\nwait for up to that amount of time before it returns. If no interesting events\nhave happened since then, the response will be relatively empty.:\ncurl -XGET \"https://localhost:8448/_matrix/client/r0/sync?since=s9_13_0_1_1_1&amp;access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\n{\n    \"account_data\": {\n        \"events\": []\n    },\n    \"next_batch\": \"s9_13_0_1_1_1\",\n    \"presence\": {\n        \"events\": []\n    },\n    \"rooms\": {\n        \"invite\": {},\n        \"join\": {},\n        \"leave\": {}\n    }\n}\n\nExample application\nThe following example demonstrates registration and login, live event streaming,\ncreating and joining rooms, sending messages, getting member lists and getting\nhistorical messages for a room. This covers most functionality of a messaging\napplication.\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.8.3/matrix-org/matrix.org/tree/master/jekyll/_posts/howtos/jsfiddles/example_app\n","id":"/docs/legacy/client-server-api/","title":"Client Server API"},"/docs/legacy/client-server-migrating-from-v1/":{"body":"This guide assists developers of API clients that target the v1 version of the\nAPI to migrate their code to the later r0. It does not aim to introduce new\nconcepts that were added in r0 except where these replace things that were\nremoved since v1.\nUpdated Version In Path\nThe new version of the API is r0; this should be used in paths where v1 used\nto appear. Additionally, the /api path component has now been removed. API\nendpoint paths are now:\nPOST /_matrix/client/r0/register\nGET /_matrix/client/r0/login\n\netc...\nNew Registration and Login Endpoints\nThe r0 version of the /register and /login endpoints is different to the\nv1 version. See the updated API documentation for details on how the new API\nworks. In brief, the changes are that the new version returns extra information\nin the form of the params object, and that a sequence of multiple calls may\nbe statefully chained together by the session parameter.\nAdditionally, whereas in v1 the client performed a GET request to discover\nthe list of supported flows for /register, in r0 this is done by sending a\nPOST request with an empty data body. The /login endpoint continues to use\nthe GET method as before.\nDeprecated Endpoints\nThe following endpoints are now deprecated and replaced by the /sync API:\n/initialSync\n/events\n/rooms/:roomId/initialSync\n\nThe new /sync API takes an optional since parameter to distinguish the\ninitial sync from subsequent updates for more events.\nThe return value takes a different structure to that from the previous\n/initialSync API. For full details see the API documentation, but the\nfollowing summary may be useful to compare with v1:\n\n\n/initialSync returned a state key containing the most recent\nstate in the room, whereas the new /sync API's state\ncorresponds to the room state at the start of the returned\ntimeline. This makes it easier for clients to represent state\nchanges that occur within the region of returned timeline.\nIn /events, if more events occurred since the since token than\nthe limit parameter allowed, then events from the start of this\nrange were returned and the client had to perform another fetch to\nincrementally obtain more of them. In the /sync API the result\nalways contains the most recent events, creating a gap if this\nwould be more events than the requested limit. If this occurs then\nthe client can use the prev_batch token as a reference to\nobtaining more.\nThe state contained in the response to a /sync request that\nhas a since parameter will contain only keys that have changed\nsince the basis given in the since parameter, rather than\ncontaining a full set values.\n\n\nThe /initialSync API allowed a parameter called limit to limit the number of\nevents returned. To apply this limit to the new /sync API, you can supply an\nad-hoc filter:\nGET .../sync?filter={\"room\":{\"timeline\":{\"limit:$limit}}}\n\nThere is no direct replacement for the per-room /rooms/:roomId/initialSync\nendpoint, but the behaviour can be recreated by applying an ad-hoc filter using\nthe filter parameter to /sync that selects only the required room ID:\nGET .../sync?filter={\"room\":{\"rooms\":[$room_id]}}\n\nHowever, the way that the new /sync API works should remove any need to do\nthis kind of query, in the situations where the v1 API needed it.\nSpecifically, on joining a new room the initial information about that room is\nsent in the next /sync batch, so it should not be necessary to query that one\nroom specially.\nThe following endpoint is deprecated and has no direct replacement:\n/events/:eventId\n\nHowever, if the client knows the room ID of the room that the event is in, it\ncan use the /rooms/:roomId/context/:eventId request to fetch the event\nitself. By giving the limit parameter of 0 the client can save using extra\nbandwidth by actually returning additional context events around the requested\none.\nRemoved POST Endpoint\nThe room message sending API endpoint in v1 accepted both PUT and POST\nmethods, where the client could specify a message ID in the PUT path for\nde-duplication purposes, or have the server allocate one during POST. In r0\nthis latter form no longer exists. Clients will now have to generate these IDs\nlocally.\nThe following URLs have therefore been removed:\nPOST .../rooms/:roomId/send/:messageType\n\n","id":"/docs/legacy/client-server-migrating-from-v1/","title":"Migrating from Client Server API v1"},"/docs/legacy/client-sso-guide/":{"body":"What is Single Sign-On?\nSingle Sign-On allows users to easily connect to services if they’re already\nsigned into another umbrella account. This document describes how to use the\nSSO client login flow\nto enable SSO in a Matrix Client you are developing.\nWhen to use it\nThe first thing to do, as soon as you have the homeserver for the user, is to\nmake a GET query to /_matrix/client/r0/login on the homeserver. Most\ncommonly, the response will be:\n{\n  \"flows\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"m.login.password\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nIn which case you proceed with password authentication as normal.

For\nexample, on https://chat.mozilla.org the screen looks like:\n\nWhen the user clicks/taps to start, open a browser or in-app browser with the\nurl &lt;homeserver&gt;/_matrix/client/r0/login/sso/redirect?redirectUrl=&lt;your app url&gt;.\nNow, the login process is out of your hands.\n/_matrix/client/r0/login/sso/redirect will trigger a 302 redirect chain\nthrough whatever SSO login mechanism the server offers the user. When they pass\nthrough this successfully, they will be eventually redirected to &lt;your app url&gt;/?loginToken=&lt;some login token&gt;. If the user does not auth successfully,\nthey will be informed in the browser.\nYou will read the loginToken parameter from this response, and use it to login\nwith the token-based login flow\n, thus obtaining\na mxid, access_token and device ID.\n","id":"/docs/legacy/client-sso-guide/","title":"Client Developers' Guide to Supporting SSO"},"/docs/legacy/e2e-implementation/":{"body":"Implementing End-to-End Encryption in Matrix clients\nThis guide is intended for authors of Matrix clients who wish to add support for\nend-to-end encryption. It is highly recommended that readers be familiar with\nthe Matrix protocol and the use of access tokens before proceeding.\nThe libolm library\nEnd-to-end encryption in Matrix is based on the Olm and Megolm cryptographic\nratchets. The recommended starting point for any client authors is with the\nlibolm library, which contains implementations of\nall of the cryptographic primitives required. The library itself is written in\nC/C++, but is architected in a way which makes it easy to write wrappers for\nhigher-level languages.\nDevices\nWe have a particular meaning for \"device\". As a user, I might have several\ndevices (a desktop client, some web browsers, an Android device, an iPhone,\netc). When I first use a client, it should register itself as a new device. If\nI log out and log in again as a different user, the client must register as a\nnew device. Critically, the client must create a new set of keys (see below)\nfor each \"device\".\nThe longevity of devices will depend on the client. In the web client, we create\na new device every single time you log in. In a mobile client, it might be\nacceptable to reuse the device if a login session expires,\nprovided the user is the same. Never share keys between different\nusers.\nDevices are identified by their device_id (which is unique within the scope of\na given user). By default, the /login and /register endpoints will\nauto-generate a device_id and return it in the response; a client is also\nfree to generate its own device_id or, as above, reuse a device, in which\ncase the client should pass the device_id in the request body.\nThe lifetime of devices and access_tokens are closely related. In the simple\ncase where a new device is created each time you log in, there is a one-to-one\nmapping between a device_id and an access_token. If a client reuses a\ndevice_id when logging in, there will be several access_tokens associated\nwith a given device_id - but still, we would expect only one of these to be\nactive at once (though we do not currently enforce that in Synapse).\nKeys used in End-to-End encryption\nThere are a number of keys involved in encrypted communication: a summary of\nthem follows.\nEd25519 fingerprint key pair\nEd25519 is a public-key cryptographic system for signing messages. In Matrix,\neach device has an Ed25519 key pair which serves to identify that device. The\nprivate part of the key pair should never leave the device, but the public part\nis published to the Matrix network.\nCurve25519 identity key pair\nCurve25519 is a public-key cryptographic system which can be used to establish a\nshared secret. In Matrix, each device has a long-lived Curve25519 identity key\nwhich is used to establish Olm sessions with that device. Again, the private\nkey should never leave the device, but the public part is signed with the\nEd25519 fingerprint key and published to the network.\nTheoretically we should rotate the Curve25519 identity key from time to time,\nbut we haven't implemented this yet.\nCurve25519 one-time keys\nAs well as the identity key, each device creates a number of Curve25519 key\npairs which are also used to establish Olm sessions, but can only be used once.\nOnce again, the private part remains on the device.\nAt startup, Alice creates a number of one-time key pairs, and publishes them to\nher homeserver. If Bob wants to establish an Olm session with Alice, he needs\nto claim one of Alice's one-time keys, and creates a new one of his own. Those\ntwo keys, along with Alice's and Bob's identity keys, are used in establishing\nan Olm session between Alice and Bob.\nMegolm encryption keys\nThe Megolm key is used to encrypt group messages (in fact it is used to derive\nan AES-256 key, and an HMAC-SHA-256 key). It is initialised with random data.\nEach time a message is sent, a hash calculation is done on the Megolm key to\nderive the key for the next message. It is therefore possible to share the\ncurrent state of the Megolm key with a user, allowing them to decrypt future\nmessages but not past messages.\nEd25519 Megolm signing key pair\nWhen a sender creates a Megolm session, he also creates another Ed25519 signing\nkey pair. This is used to sign messages sent via that Megolm session, to\nauthenticate the sender. Once again, the private part of the key remains on the\ndevice. The public part is shared with other devices in the room alongside the\nencryption key.\nCreating and registering device keys\nThis process only happens once, when a device first starts.\nIt must create the Ed25519 fingerprint key pair and the Curve25519 identity key\npair. This is done by calling olm_create_account in libolm. The\n(base64-encoded) keys are retrieved by calling olm_account_identity_keys. The\naccount should be stored for future use.\nIt should then publish these keys to the homeserver, which is done by using the\ndevice_keys property of the\n/keys/upload\nendpoint.\nIn order to sign the device_keys payload as described in Signing JSON\n, clients should\ncall olm_account_sign.\nCreating and registering one-time keys\nThe client should keep track of how many one-time keys the homeserver has stored\nfor it, and, if necessary, generate and upload some more.\nThis can be achieved by inspecting the device_one_time_keys_count property of\na /sync/ response.\nThe maximum number of active keys supported by libolm is returned by\nolm_account_max_number_of_one_time_keys. The client should try to maintain\nabout half this number on the homeserver.\nTo generate new one-time keys:\n\n\nCall olm_account_generate_one_time_keys to generate new keys.\n\n\nCall olm_account_one_time_keys to retrieve the unpublished keys. This\nreturns a JSON-formatted object with the single property curve25519, which\nis itself an object mapping key id to base64-encoded Curve25519 key. For\nexample:\n{\n  \"curve25519\": {\n    \"AAAAAA\": \"wo76WcYtb0Vk/pBOdmduiGJ0wIEjW4IBMbbQn7aSnTo\",\n    \"AAAAAB\": \"LRvjo46L1X2vx69sS9QNFD29HWulxrmW11Up5AfAjgU\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nEach key should be signed in the same way as the previous identity keys\npayload, and uploaded using the one_time_keys property of the[/keys/upload]\n(https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#post-matrix-client-r0-keys-upload)\nendpoint.\n\n\nCall olm_account_mark_keys_as_published to tell the olm library not to\nreturn the same keys from a future call to olm_account_one_time_keys.\n\n\nConfiguring a room to use encryption\nTo enable encryption in a room, a client should send a state event of type\nm.room.encryption, and content { \"algorithm\": \"m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2\" }.\nHandling an m.room.encryption state event\nWhen a client receives an m.room.encryption event as above, it should set a\nflag to indicate that messages sent in the room should be encrypted.\nThis flag should not be cleared if a later m.room.encryption event changes\nthe configuration. This is to avoid a situation where a MITM can simply ask\nparticipants to disable encryption. In short: once encryption is enabled in a\nroom, it can never be disabled.\nThe event should contain an algorithm property which defines which encryption\nalgorithm should be used for encryption. Currently only m.megolm.v1-aes-sha2\nis permitted here.\nThe event may also include other settings for how messages sent in the room\nshould be encrypted (for example, rotation_period_ms to define how often the\nsession should be replaced). See the spec for more details.\nHandling an m.room.encrypted event\nEncrypted events have a type of m.room.encrypted. They have a content property\nalgorithm which gives the encryption algorithm in use, as well as other\nproperties specific to the algorithm1.\nThe encrypted payload is a JSON object with the properties type(giving the\ndecrypted event type), and content (giving the decrypted content). Depending\non the algorithm in use, the payload may contain additional keys.\nThere are currently two defined algorithms:\nm.olm.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2\nThe spec gives details on this algorithm\n\nand an example payload\n\n.\nThe sender_key property of the event content gives the Curve25519 identity key\nof the sender. Clients should maintain a list of known Olm sessions for each\ndevice they speak to; it is recommended to index them by Curve25519 identity\nkey.\nOlm messages are encrypted separately for each recipient device. ciphertext is\nan object mapping from the Curve25519 identity key for the recipient device.\nThe receiving client should, of course, look for its own identity key in this\nobject. (If it isn't listed, the message wasn't sent for it, and the client\ncan't decrypt it; it should show an error instead, or similar).\nThis should result in an object with the properties type and body. Messages\nof type '0' are 'prekey' messages which are used to establish a new Olm session\nbetween two devices; type '1' are normal messages which are used once a message\nhas been received on the session.\nWhen a message (of either type) is received, a client should first attempt to\ndecrypt it with each of the known sessions for that sender. There are two steps\nto this:\n\nIf (and only if) type==0, the client should call\nolm_matches_inbound_session with the session and body. This returns a\nflag indicating whether the message was encrypted using that session.\nThe client calls olm_decrypt, with the session, type, and body. If this\nis successful, it returns the plaintext of the event.\n\nIf the client was unable to decrypt the message using any known sessions(or if\nthere are no known sessions yet), and the message had type 0,\nand olm_matches_inbound_session wasn't true for any existing sessions,\nthen the client can try establishing a new session. This is done as follows:\n\nCall olm_create_inbound_session_from using the olm account, and the\nsender_key and body of the message.\nIf the session was established successfully:\n\nCall olm_remove_one_time_keys to ensure that the same one-time-key\ncannot be reused.\nCall olm_decrypt with the new session.\nStore the session for future use.\n\n\n\nAt the end of this, the client will hopefully have successfully decrypted the\npayload.\nAs well as the type and content properties, the plaintext payload should\ncontain a number of other properties. Each of these should be checked as\nfollows2.\n\n\nsender: The user ID of the sender. The client should check that this matches\nthe sender in the event.\n\n\nrecipient: The user ID of the recipient. The client should check that this\nmatches the local user ID.\n\n\nkeys: an object with a property ed25519. The client should check that the\nvalue of this property matches the sender's fingerprint key when marking the\nevent as verified.\n\n\nrecipient_keys: an object with a property ed25519. The client should check\nthat the value of this property matches its own fingerprint key.\n\n\nm.megolm.v1.aes-sha2\nThe spec gives details on this algorithm\n\nand an example payload\n\n.\nEncrypted events using this algorithm should have sender_key, session_id and\nciphertext content properties. If the room_id, sender_key and\nsession_id correspond to a known Megolm session (see below), the ciphertext\ncan be decrypted by passing the ciphertext into olm_group_decrypt.\nIn order to avoid replay attacks a client should remember the megolm\nmessage_index returned by olm_group_decrypt of each event they decrypt for\neach session. If the client decrypts an event with the same message_index as\none that it has already received using that session then it should treat the\nmessage as invalid. However, care must be taken when an event is decrypted\nmultiple times that it is not flagged as a replay attack. For example, this may\nhappen when the client decrypts an event, the event gets purged from the\nclient's cache, and then the client backfills and re-decrypts the event. One\nway to handle this case is to ensure that the record of message_indexes is\nappropriately purged when the client's cache of events is purged. Another way\nis to remember the event's event_id and origin_server_ts along with its\nmessage_index. When the client decrypts an event with a message_index\nmatching that of a previously-decrypted event, it can then compare the\nevent_id and origin_server_ts that it remembered for that message_index,\nand if those fields match, then the message should be decrypted as normal.\nThe client should check that the sender's fingerprint key matches the\nkeys.ed25519 property of the event which established the Megolm session when\nmarking the event as verified.\nHandling an m.room_key event\nThese events contain key data to allow decryption of other messages. They are\nsent to specific devices, so they appear in the to_device section of the\nresponse to GET /_matrix/client/r0/sync. They will also be encrypted, so will\nneed decrypting as above before they can be seen.(These events are generated by\nother clients - see starting a megolm session).\nThe room_id, together with the sender_key of the m.room_key event before\nit was decrypted, and the session_id, uniquely identify a Megolm session. If\nthey do not represent a known session, the client should start a new inbound\nMegolm session by calling olm_init_inbound_group_session with the\nsession_key.\nThe client should remember the value of the keys property of the payload of the\nencrypted m.room_key event and store it with the inbound session. This is\nused as above when marking the event as verified.\nDownloading the device list for users in the room\nBefore an encrypted message can be sent, it is necessary to retrieve the list of\ndevices for each user in the room. This can be done proactively, or deferred\nuntil the first message is sent. The information is also required to allow\nusers to verify or block devices.\nThe client should use the/keys/query\n\nendpoint, passing the IDs of the members of the room in the device_keys\nproperty of the request.\nThe client must first check the signatures on the DeviceKeys objects returned\nby/keys/query\n.\nTo do this, it should remove the signatures and unsigned properties, format\nthe remainder as Canonical JSON, and pass the result into olm_ed25519_verify,\nusing the Ed25519 key for the key parameter, and the corresponding signature\nfor the signature parameter. If the signature check fails, no further\nprocessing should be done on the device.\nThe client must also check that the user_id and device_id fields in the\nobject match those in the top-level map3.\nThe client should check if the user_id/device_id correspond to a device it\nhad seen previously. If it did, the client must check that the Ed25519 key\nhasn't changed. Again, if it has changed, no further processing should be done\non the device.\nOtherwise the client stores the information about this device.\nSending an encrypted message event\nWhen sending a message in a room [configured to use encryption]\n(#configuring-a-room-to-use-encryption), a client first checks to see if it has\nan active outbound Megolm session. If not, it first [creates one as per below]\n(#starting-a-megolm-session). If an outbound session exists, it should check if\nit is time torotate it, and create a new one if\nso.\nThe client then builds an encryption payload as follows:\n{\n  \"type\": \"&lt;event type&gt;\",\n  \"content\": \"&lt;event content&gt;\",\n  \"room_id\": \"&lt;id of destination room&gt;\"\n}\n\nand calls olm_group_encrypt to encrypt the payload. This is then packaged into\nevent content as follows:\n{\n  \"algorithm\": \"m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2\",\n  \"sender_key\": \"&lt;our curve25519 device key&gt;\",\n  \"ciphertext\": \"&lt;encrypted payload&gt;\",\n  \"session_id\": \"&lt;outbound group session id&gt;\",\n  \"device_id\": \"&lt;our device ID&gt;\"\n}\n\nFinally, the encrypted event is sent to the room with\nPUT /_matrix/client/r0/rooms/&lt;room_id&gt;/send/m.room.encrypted/&lt;txn_id&gt;.\nStarting a Megolm session\nWhen a message is first sent in an encrypted room, the client should start a new\noutbound Megolm session. This should not be done proactively, to avoid\nproliferation of unnecessary Megolm sessions.\nTo create the session, the client should call olm_init_outbound_group_session,\nand store the details of the outbound session for future use.\nThe client should then call olm_outbound_group_session_id to get the unique ID\nof the new session, and olm_outbound_group_session_key to retrieve the\ncurrent ratchet key and index. It should store these details as an inbound\nsession, just as it would when [receiving them via an m.room_key event]\n(#handling-an-mroom_key-event).\nThe client must then share the keys for this session with each device in the\nroom. It must therefore download the device list if it hasn't already done\nso. Then it should build a unique m.room_key event, and send it encrypted\nusing Olm to each device in the room which has\nnot been blocked.\nOnce all of the key-sharing event contents have been assembled, the events\nshould be sent to the corresponding devices via\nPUT /_matrix/client/r0/sendToDevice/m.room.encrypted/&lt;txnId&gt;.\nRotating Megolm sessions\nMegolm sessions may not be reused indefinitely. The parameters which define how\noften a session should be rotated are defined in the m.room.encryption state\nevent of a room.\nOnce either the message limit or time limit have been reached, the client should\nstart a new session before sending any more messages.\nEncrypting an event with Olm\nOlm is not used for encrypting room events, as it requires a separate copy of\nthe ciphertext for each device, and because the receiving device can only\ndecrypt received messages once. However, it is used for encrypting key-sharing\nevents for Megolm.\nWhen encrypting an event using Olm, the client should:\n\nBuild an encryption payload as illustrated in the spec\n.\nCheck if it has an existing Olm session; if it does not, start a new one\n. If it has several (as may happen due to races\nwhen establishing sessions), it should use the session from which it last\nreceived a message.\n\nStarting an Olm session\n\nEncrypt the payload by calling olm_encrypt.\nPackage the payload into an Olm m.room.encrypted event.\n\nStarting an Olm session\nTo start a new Olm session with another device, a client must first claim one of\nthe other device's one-time keys. To do this, it should initiate a request to\n/keys/claim\n.\nThe client should check the signatures on the signed key objects in the\nresponse. As with checking the signatures on the device keys, it should remove\nthe signatures and (if present) unsigned properties, format the remainder\nas Canonical JSON, and pass the result into olm_ed25519_verify, using the\nEd25519 device key for the key parameter.\nProvided the key object passes verification, the client should then pass the\nkey, along with the Curve25519 Identity key for the remote device, into\nolm_create_outbound_session.\nHandling membership changes\nThe client should monitor rooms which are configured to use encryption for\nmembership changes.\nWhen a member leaves a room, the client should invalidate any active outbound\nMegolm session, to ensure that a new session is used next time the user sends a\nmessage.\nWhen a new member joins a room, the client should first download the device\nlist for the new member,\nif it doesn't already have it.\nAfter giving the user an opportunity toblock\n\nany suspicious devices, the client should share the keys for the outbound\nMegolm session with all the new member's devices. This is done in the same way\nas creating a new session, except that there is\nno need to start a new Megolm session: due to the design of the Megolm ratchet,\nthe new user will only be able to decrypt messages starting from the current\nstate. The recommended method is to maintain a list of members who are waiting\nfor the session keys, and share them when the user next sends a message.\nHandling new devices\nWhen a user logs in on a new device, it is necessary to make sure that other\ndevices in any rooms with encryption enabled are aware of the new device, so\nthat they can share their outbound sessions with it as they would with a new\nmember.\nThe device tracking process which should be implemented is documentedin the\nspec\n.\nBlocking / Verifying devices\nIt should be possible for a user to mark each device belonging to another user\nas 'Blocked' or 'Verified', through a process detailedin the spec\n.\nWhen a user chooses to block a device, this means that no further encrypted\nmessages should be shared with that device. In short, it should be excluded\nwhen sharing room keys when starting a new Megolm session. Any active outbound\nMegolm sessions whose keys have been shared with the device should also be\ninvalidated so that no further messages are sent over them.\nMarking events as 'verified'\nOnce a device has been verified, it is possible to verify that events have been\nsent from a particular device. See the section on Handling an m.room.encrypted\nevent for notes on how to do this for each algorithm. Events sent from a\nverified device can be decorated in the UI to show that they have been sent\nfrom a verified device.\nEncrypted attachments\nHomeservers must not be able to read files shared in encrypted rooms. Clients\nshould implement a strategy described in the spec\n.\nCurrently, the files are encrypted using AES-CTR, which is not included in\nlibolm. Clients have to rely on a third party library.\nKey sharing\nWhen an event cannot be decrypted due to missing keys, a client may want to\nrequest them from other clients which may have them. Similarly, a client may\nwant to reply to a key request with the associated key if it can assert that\nthe requesting device is allowed to see the messages encrypted with this key.\nThose capabilities are achieved using m.room_key_request and\nm.forwarded_room_key events.\nThe session_key property of a m.forwarded_room_key event differs from the\none of a m.room_key event, as it does not include the Ed25519 signature of\nthe original sender. It should be obtained from\nolm_export_inbound_group_session at the desired message index, and the\nsession can be restored with olm_import_inbound_group_session.\nThe forwarded_room_key property starts out empty, but each time a key is\nforwarded to another device, the previous sender in the chain is added to the\nend of the list. Consider the following example:\n\n\nA -&gt; B : m.room_key\nB -&gt; C : m.forwarded_room_key\nC -&gt; D : m.forwarded_room_key\n\n\nIn the message B -&gt; C forwarded_room_key is empty, but in the message C -&gt; D\nit contains B's Curve25519 key. In order for D to believe that the session came\nfrom A, D must trust the direct sender C and every entry in this chain.\nIn order to securely implement key sharing, clients must not reply to every key\nrequest they receive. The recommended strategy is to share the keys\nautomatically only to verified devices of the same user. Requests\ncoming from unverified devices should prompt a dialog, allowing the user to\nverify the device, share the keys without verifying, or not to share them\n(and ignore future requests). A client should also check whether requests\ncoming from devices of other users are legitimate. This can be done by keeping\ntrack of the users a session was shared with, and at which message index.\nKey requests can be sent to all of the current user's devices, as well as the\noriginal sender of the session, and other devices present in the room. When the\nclient receives the requested key, it should send a m.room_key_request event\nto all the devices it requested the key from, setting the action property to\n\"cancel_request\" and request_id to the ID of the initial request.\n1\nNote that a redacted event will have an empty content, and hence the\ncontent will have no algorithm property. Thus a client should check whether\nan event is redacted before checking for the algorithm property.\n\n2\nThese tests prevent an attacker publishing someone else's curve25519 keys\nas their own and subsequently claiming to have sent messages which they\ndidn't.\n\n3\nThis prevents a malicious or compromised homeserver replacing the keys for\nthe device with those of another.\n\n","id":"/docs/legacy/e2e-implementation/","title":"End-to-End Encryption implementation guide"},"/docs/legacy/e2ee-cross-signing/":{"body":"PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS GUIDE IS STILL A WIP!\nSo, you successfully implemented end-to-end encryption in your matrix client? Congratulations! This\nis a real step to be proud of and reason to celebrate!\nYou might have noticed, however, that some things are still on the rough edge: You have to manually\nverify every other device by comparing the public keys, decryption keys aren't shared between your\ndevices, etc. In comparison, Element has cross-signing so that you have to only verify people in a user-\nfriendly way, and it has things like online key backup. If you want to implement these features into\nyour own client (or only some of them), then this guide is for you!\nThis guide will be using libolm. Of course, the general ideas etc. and process flows behind it will\nbe the same, no matter if you use libolm or not. So, if you use something else than libolm, simply\nsubstitute those parts with whatever other libraries / algorithms you are using.\nHere is a general road map of what is needed in order implement all of the following:\n\nEmoji verification (SAS or Short Authentication Strings)\nDisplay verification status based on cross signing status\nSSSS (Secure Secret Storage and Sharing)\nSigning of other keys\nIn-room verification (Verification through messages in a room)\nMiscellaneous cross-signing things\nBootstrapping SSSS and cross-signing\nOnline key backup\n\nWow, that's a lot of steps... but don't worry, we'll tackle them one at a time. Each step (apart\nfrom perhaps #3) will greatly improve the user experience, so that should be a lot of motivation\nto keep going!\nAs a general warning, at the point of writing this guide (May, June 2020) not everything discussed\nhere is in the spec yet, and some of the information can only be found scattered across multiple MSCs\nand reading through the source code of matrix-js-sdk.\n1. Implement emoji verification (SAS)\nEmoji verification is part of a verification model called SAS, for Short Authentication String. In\naddition to emoji verification, there is also numerical verification. It is expected that all clients\nthat support SAS support at least numerical verification. This is to ensure that clients that may\nnot be able to display emoji (perhaps some CLI application or embedded device display) can still be\nverified. Fortunately, the way these verification methods work is almost identical.\nUnfortunately, due to legacy reasons, there are multiple ways you can receive a verification request\nfor SAS. However, all of the cryptographically methods are already a part of libolm, so if you already\nuse libolm bindings, it will be a breeze to implement!\nThere are two ways to verify other devices (and, by extension, other people): One way is via to_device\nmessages, and the other is via messages in rooms. Verification via to_device messages is typically\ndone to verify devices, while verification via messages in a room is typically done to verify\npeople. While in-room verification will be added in this guide only later on, it is a good idea to\nthink about how to structure your code to already support this from the start.\nA general look at the verification process\nVerification works via two devices sending each other messages, either via to_device messaging or through\nmessages in a room. A device (Alice) that wants to verify another device (Bob) sends a m.key.verification.request\nmessage along with the methods it supports. Bob\nanswers with a m.key.verification.ready, also informing Alice of which methods it support. In the\nclient UI, Bob would get a new verification request popup after receiving a m.key.verification.request\nmessage. After both have accepted to start, either party (Alice and/or Bob) can send a m.key.verification.start,\nwhich is specific to the verification method used. In the case that both Alice and Bob send a\nm.key.verification.start and the verification method does not match, the verification request is\ncanceled. If the verification matches, the m.key.verification.start of the lexicographically smaller\nuser ID is used. If those also match up (as in, if you are verifying your own device), then the\nlexicographically smaller device ID is used. This ensures that it is unambiguous which m.key.verification.start\nis used. From now on, the device whose m.key.verification.start is used is the one who started the\nrequest (This is important as some things in SAS depend on who started the request). After that, some\nverification process happens, which is specific the specified verification method. If all is successful,\nboth send a m.key.verification.done to each other.\nTo make all this work, each verification request has a unique transaction ID, which is an\nopaque string used to identify the specific verification request. In case of room verification, this\nis the event ID of the first sent message (m.key.verification.request). A verification request can\nbe canceled at any time by either party by sending an m.key.verification.cancel, along with some\ninformation on the reason for cancellation.\nAs all messages sent get some common metadata added, it might be a good idea to write a send wrapper\nfunction to send key verification data. This function could also handle sending events as either to_device\nmessages or as room events. The contents of the message differ slightly between to_device and for\nroom verification:\nFor to_device messages, the transaction_id and from_device is simply added to the object sent.\ntransaction_id denotes the unique ID of the transaction, whereas from_device is simply a string\ncontaining your own device ID. A payload such as\n{\n  \"foo\": \"bar\"\n}\n\nwould thus look like:\n{\n  \"foo\": \"bar\",\n  \"transaction_id\": \"some-awesome-id\",\n  \"from_device\": \"DXKKF\"\n}\n\nFor room messages, the transaction ID, which is the event Id of the first event, is added in the\nm.relates_to section of the event. The device ID is the same as to_device massages; it should be\nset to the ID of the sending device. So the above payload becomes:\n{\n  \"foo\": \"bar\",\n  \"from_device\": \"DXKKF\",\n  \"m.relates_to\": {\n    \"rel_type\": \"m.reference\",\n    \"event_id\": \"$firstEventId\"\n  }\n}\n\nFor simplicity, all payloads mentioned below will be shown without those extra keys.\nThe to_devices sent don't have to be encrypted, as the entire idea of verification requests is that\nthey could be out in the open. The client may, however, chose to do so anyways, if e.g. their function\nfor sending to_device messages defaults to sending them encrypted. Whether room messages are encrypted\ntypically depends on whether the room they are sent in is encrypted or not.\nm.key.verification.request\nSending this starts a verification request. It sends all the verification methods you know (in the\ncase of SAS that is only m.sas.v1), along with the current timestamp in milliseconds.\n{\n  \"methods\": [\"m.sas.v1\"],\n  \"timestamp\": 1590314157821\n}\n\nA receiving client is expected to reject the request if it is more than 10 minutes in the past or more\nthan 5 minutes in the future.\nm.key.verification.ready\nSending this indicates that you accept the key verification request and additionally reveals which\nmethods you support yourself. That way both verification partners will be able to figure out which\nmethods they have in common.\n{\n  \"methods\": [\"m.sas.v1\"],\n}\n\nm.key.verification.start\nSending this indicates that you are starting verification with a specific method. The exact payload\nis dependent on the verification method.\n{\n  \"method\": \"m.sas.v1\",\n  // additional keys specific to m.sas.v1\n}\n\nm.key.verification.done\nSending this indicates that the verification process is fully done.\n{}\n\nm.key.verification.cancel\nSending this cancels the verification (timeout, key mismatch, user cancellation, etc.). It has a\nhuman-readable reason, along with a cancellation code.\n{\n  \"reason\": \"The verification timed out\",\n  \"code\": \"m.timeout\"\n}\n\nA list of all cancellation codes and their use can be found in\nthe Client-Server Spec.\nRecap\nTo recap, the general verification process of Alice wanting to verify Bob works as follows:\n\nAlice sends Bob an m.key.verification.request along with the methods she supports.\nBob receives that request. His device asks him if he wants to verify with Alice. He hits accept.\nBob sends an m.key.verification.ready along with the methods he supports.\nAlice receives Bob's methods, and based on that and her own, she sends\nan m.key.verification.start for a method that they have in common.\nBob also sends an m.key.verification.start, which happens to be the same method as alices\nAs Alices user ID is lexicographically smaller (@alice:example.org vs @bob:example.org), the\nstart command sent by Alice is used.\nThe specific verification method follows here.\nWhen Alice and Bob are fully done with verification, they send each other an m.key.verification.done.\n\nTaking a look at SAS\nOkay, now that we took a look at how the verification process framework works in general, lets take a\nlook at SAS specifically.\nFor legacy reasons there are unfortunately clients that directly want to start SAS verification with\nm.key.verification.start, so that will need to be handled. If such a start request comes in, and\nit is SAS, prompt the user if they want to accept the verification or not. Then simply continue with\nthe SAS flow as normal.\nThe general idea of SAS verification is that both parties wanting to verify each other, Alice and Bob,\ngenerate an ephemeral public/private keypair and exchange the public keys. Using\nElliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)\nthey both generate the same key, provided that there was no man in the middle. This generated\nkey is then compared, using either emoji or numbers. After it is verified that they both match up on\neither side, it is then known that the output of ECDH is the same. Thus the ephemeral public keys for\nECDH sent to each other got successfully verified. With these keys, a secure channel can be formed,\nwhere the actual device keys that want to verify to each other are sent over. Upon receipt, the\nverification process is complete!\nIn practice, this works as follows: Alice sends Bob a m.key.verification.start along with a bunch\nof different parameters she supports (hash method, emoji/number verification, which specific ECDH to\nuse, etc.) and Bob will reply with a m.key.verification.accept, which will, based on the capabilities\nAlice advertised and based on what Bob knows he can do himself, determine which exact method to use.\nAfterwards, they both generate and send to each other the ephemeral public keys for ECDH, and the\nemojis or numbers are displayed on screen. Once they both verified that they match using some secure\nthird-party channel like meeting up in person, they will send each other a m.key.verification.mac,\ncontaining a MAC of the keys they should verify. After verifying them, they both send each other a\nm.key.verification.done and they are verified!\nSAS introduces a few more cancellation codes, specific to SAS verification,\nas seen in the client-server spec.\nm.key.verification.start\nThis sends a bunch of parameters that the sending device supports. Please note that you will have to\nremember this object while performing a commitment check (explained in the next section), of the one\nthat includes the metadata of transaction_id and from_device keys, omitted in these examples.\n{\n  \"method\": \"m.sas.v1\",\n  \"key_agreement_protocols\": [\"curve25519-hkdf-sha256\"],\n  \"hashes\": [\"sha256\"],\n  \"message_authentication_codes\": [\"hkdf-hmac-sha256\"],\n  \"short_authentication_string\": [\"emoji\", \"decimal\"]\n}\n\nCommitment generation\nA commitment is an additional verification process. It is the hash (based on the hash method\nspecified) of the concatenated ephemeral public key you generate and the canonical json of the\nm.key.verification.start body. Libolm provides both the hashing method and the public/private key\ngeneration. Code for calculating the commitment could look as follows:\nvar sas = olm.SAS(); // save for later. This will generate our ephemeral public/private keypair\nvar canonicalJson = \"\"; // the canonical json of the `m.key.verification.start` request\n\nvar commitment = \"\";\nif (hashMethod == \"sha256\") {\n  var olmutil = olm.Utility();\n  commitment = olmutil.sha256(sas.get_pubkey() + canonicalJson);\n  olmutil.free();\n} else {\n  throw \"Unknown hash method\";\n}\n\nm.key.verification.accept\nThis accepts the m.key.verification.start request, and sends the parameters that both parties support.\nAlong with that, it also sends a commitment, as defined above.\n{\n  \"method\": \"m.sas.v1\",\n  \"key_agreement_protocol\": \"curve25519-hkdf-sha256\",\n  \"hash\": \"sha256\",\n  \"message_authentication_code\": \"hkdf-hmac-sha256\",\n  \"short_authentication_string\": [\"emoji\", \"decimal\"],\n  \"commitment\": \"the-commitment-calculated\"\n}\n\nm.key.verification.key\nThis sends the ephemeral public key to each other. If you haven't generated it yet (due to not having\ncalculated the commitment), do so now with var sas = olm.SAS(); and read it with sas.get_pubkey();.\nBe sure that if you received the commitment, you use the received public key to verify the commitment\nyou received earlier. The public key is both added to the sas object with sas.set_their_key(payload[\"key\"]);\nand also saved in a separate variable, as you'll need it later, as unfortunately the sas object does\nnot allow for it to be retrieved again.\n{\n  \"key\": \"your-public-key\"\n}\n\nDisplay Emojis / Numbers\nBased on the agreed upon key_agreement_protocol and which short_authentication_strings are supported,\nthe user should now be prompted with the emojis/numbers, so that they can verify that they match. For\nthat, you will have to generate bytes to derive the emojis from for comparison. For that, a \"SAS info\"\nis created. For the key agreement protocol curve25519-hkdf-sha256 it works as follows:\nThe SAS info is MATRIX_KEY_VERIFICATION_SAS| concatenated with the user ID of whomever started the\nverification plus | plus the device ID who started the verification plus | plus the SAS public key\nwho started the verification plus | plus the user ID who received the verification plus | plus\nthe device ID who received the verification plus | plus the SAS public key of who received the verification\nplus | plus the transaction ID. In code that could look as follows:\nvar ourInfo = '${client.userID}|${client.deviceID}|${sas.get_pubkey()}|';\nvar theirInfo = '${request.userId}|${request.deviceId}|${theirPublicKey}|';\nvar sasInfo = 'MATRIX_KEY_VERIFICATION_SAS|' +\n    (request.startedVerification\n        ? ourInfo + theirInfo\n        : theirInfo + ourInfo) +\n    request.transactionId;\n\nThe key agreement protocol curve25519 is deprecated and should not be implemented. As such, it isn't\noutlined here.\nGenerate bytes\nOnce you have that SAS info, you use it to generate bytes through sas.generate_bytes(sasInfo, bytes).\nFor emoji verification, 6 bytes are needed, for number verification 5 are needed. You could, however,\nalways generate 6 bytes and, for number verification, only use the first 5.\nIf both parties said they can display emoji, display those! If one party only supports numbers, then\ndisplay numbers. It might be a good idea to have a button to switch back and forth between emoji and\nnumbers, just in case.\nNumbers\nTo get the numbers you compare, you need to generate 5 bytes using the above method. Split these into\nthree chunks of 13 bits each, discarding the last bit. Then add 1000 to each number, meaning they can\nbe in the range of 1000 to 9191. It is expected to to display the numbers with some separator in between,\ne.g. 1337-4242-9001.\nEmoji\nTo get the emoji to compare, you need to generate 6 bytes using the method above. Split these into 7\nchunks of 6 bits each, discarding the last 6 bits. Then use the appropriate table\nin the client-server spec to\ndisplay the emoji, along with their name.\nEmojis / Numbers match: Calculating the MAC\nOnce the user says that their emojis / numbers match, that means that they have a secure channel! A\nMAC is then calculated out of the device IDs and the public keys you want the other party to verify.\nFor now, only send your own public key using that method. Later on in this guide, you will also send your\nmaster cross-signing key. For that, a base information is created, which is the concatenated string of\nMATRIX_KEY_VERIFICATION_MAC, your own user ID, your own device ID, the other user's ID, the other\ndevice's ID, and the transaction ID. Note how, unlike SAS, no | delimiter is used and the order\ndoes not depend on who started the verification:\nvar baseInfo = 'MATRIX_KEY_VERIFICATION_MAC' +\n    client.userID +\n    client.deviceID +\n    request.userId +\n    request.deviceId +\n    request.transactionId;\n\nNext calculate the MAC of your device IDs and the fingerprints that you want to send:\nString _calculateMac(String input, String info) {\n  if (messageAuthenticationCode == \"hkdf-hmac-sha256\") { // this is from the m.key.verification.accept call\n    return sas.calculate_mac(input, info); // the same sas object we used previously, from libolm\n  } else {\n    throw \"Unknown message authentication code\";\n  }\n}\n\nMap&lt;String, String&gt; mac = {}; // create the map for the MACs\nList&lt;String&gt; keyList = []; // the list / array holding all the key Ids to verify\n\n// now add all the keys we want to verify\nvar deviceKeyId = \"ed25519:${client.deviceID}\";\nmac[deviceKeyId] = _calculateMac(client.fingerprintKey, baseInfo + deviceKeyId); // client.fingerprintKey is here the public key string for our device\nkeyList.add(deviceKeyId);\n\n// now we still need to sort the key list\nkeyList.sort();\nvar keys = _calculateMac(keyList.join(\",\"), baseInfo + \"KEY_IDS\");\n\n// send off the stuff!\n\nm.key.verification.mac\nSends the MAC of the keys to verify off to the other party.\n{\n  \"mac\": { // is the \"mac\" object calculated above\n    \"ed25519:CCKDF\": \"&lt;calculated MAC here&gt;\"\n  },\n  \"keys\": \"&lt;MAC for keys here&gt;\" // is the calculated \"keys\" string above\n}\n\nReceiving / verifying the MAC\nAfter receiving the MAC and having the user verify that the emoji match (and thus also sending\nyour own MAC), you have to verify that the received MACs are valid, and only verify the keys if the\nMACs are valid. For that, generate the base info from the perspective of the other party; essentially\nplacing other person's information before your own:\nfinal baseInfo = 'MATRIX_KEY_VERIFICATION_MAC' +\n    request.userId +\n    request.deviceId +\n    client.userID +\n    client.deviceID +\n    request.transactionId;\n\nThen generate the key list out of the dictionary keys of the mac object received and verify that\nthe MAC matches up:\nfinal keyList = payload[\"mac\"].keys.toList();\nkeyList.sort();\nif (payload[\"keys\"] != _calculateMac(keyList.join(\",\"), baseInfo + \"KEY_IDS\")) {\n  await request.cancel(\"m.key_mismatch\");\n  return;\n}\n\nThen verify the MACs of the keys themselves by iterating over the objects, and calculating the MACs\nof the keys again as above. You should have the public key yourself already, as you are just verifying\nif the key matches. If you received the MAC of a key you don't know, just ignore it. It is likely to\nbe a cross-signing key that you don't know how to handle yet. If only one of the MACs mismatch,\nhowever, don't verify any devices and cancel the entire request.\nFinally send a m.key.verification.done, and you are done!\nRecap\nSo, the entire SAS verification flow in short is as follows:\n\n(Optional) Alice sends Bob a m.key.verification.request along with the methods she supports, including\nm.sas.v1.\n(Optional) Bob receives that request. His device asks him if he wants to verify with Alice. He hits accept.\n(Optional) Bob sends a m.key.verification.ready along with the methods he supports, including m.sas.v1.\nAlice receives Bob's methods, and based on that, and the ones she knows how to do herself, she sends\na m.key.verification.start for m.sas.v1. This will contain a bunch of parameters for how the\nSAS will specifically work. Alice's device notes down the canonical json of the request for later\ncommitment verification.\nBob could also send an m.key.verification.start for m.sas.v1. As Alice user ID is lexicographically\nsmaller it is discarded, though.\nBob received the m.key.verification.start, and generates his own ephemeral keypair with var sas = olm.SAS();. He then\ncalculates the commitment using the canonical json of the m.key.verification.start request, before sending a\nm.key.verification.accept back to Alice, along with specific parameters to use for this SAS\nverificaton.\nAlice receives the m.key.verification.accept and stores the commitment to verify it later. She now creates her own\nephemeral key pair with var sas = olm.SAS(); and sends Bob the public key, via m.key.verification.key.\nBob receives the public key from Alice and sends his own public key. Bob's device displays\nthe emoji / numbers for verification now.\nAlice receives Bob's public key, and can finally verify the commitment she saved earlier. If all\nmatches, Alice's device will now display the emoji / numbers for verification.\nIf the emoji / numbers both match up, they will send each other an m.key.verification.mac with\nthe MAC'd information of the keys that should be verified.\nFinally, if all checks out, they send each other a m.key.verification.done and\nthe verification process is concluded.\n\nThings to look out for\n\nAlways verify that an incoming message has a valid, known transaction ID.\nAlways verify that an incoming message is no more than 10 minutes in the past.\nAlways stop the verification process as soon as you receive a m.key.verification.cancel, be\nit for whatever reason.\nDon't just blindly assume that methods, message_authentication_code, etc. are as outlined here.\nMore might be added in the future (e.g. to fix a discovered security flaw), as such always verify\nwhich ones you actually support and act accordingly.\nDon't forget to sas.free(); your generated SAS object all at the end of verification or when timing\nout or when it is being canceled.\nDon't forget to calculate and verify the commitment!\nIt might be a good idea to generalize the code handling the verification flow so that you can easily\nadd other methods than m.sas.v1 later on.\n\n2. Display verification status based on signatures\nDon't worry, after having implemented SAS this should be a breeze, it's way simpler and way less of a\nhassle to implement!\nGeneral ideas of Cross-Signing\nThe general idea of cross-signing is that instead of every device having to verify every other device,\npeople will only have to verify other people, and you will have to verify each of your own new sessions\n(logins) only once. For this, each user has three keys: A master key, a self-signing key and a\nuser-signing key. The master key will sign both the self-signing and the user-signing key. The\nself-signing key will then sign your own device keys, and the user-signing key will sign other people's\nmaster keys. The purpose of splitting this up into three keys is that in the case of either the\nself-signing key or the user-signing key getting compromised, you can easily exchange them, while\nstill keeping the master key. As the master key is only used for signing your own user-signing and\nself-signing key, it is rarely used, so the attack surface to obtain it is minimal. Optionally, device\nkeys themselves can sign their own master key.\n\nGraph from jcgruenhage's blog, licensed as CC-BY-SA-4.0.\nSo, in addition to the device keys of others, we also need to fetch their cross-signing\nkeys. We can then verify their signatures!\nCross-Signing keys\nIn addition to device keys, cross-signing keys are introduced. Instead of being identified by a\nkey ID, they are identified via their public key. In order to prevent collisions, homeservers\nmust make sure that no user has a key ID that is the same as a cross-signing key's public key. That\nis handy, as it means that as clients, we don't have to care about that part!\nKeeping track of cross-signing keys\nKeeping track of cross-signing keys should be simple if you already do so for device keys. When a\nuser is flagged as out-of-date, you should already query their keys again with POST /_matrix/client/r0/keys/query\nand update your device_keys dictionary accordingly, just as before. This endpoint should now also\nreturn the master_keys, self_signing_keys and user_signing_keys of a user, given they are using\ncross-signing. Simply update and store this information locally as well. The format of these are\npretty similar to the device_keys dictionary:\n{\n  \"self_signing_keys\": {\n    \"@bob:example.org\": {\n      \"user_id\": \"@bob:example.org\",\n      \"usage\": [\"self_signing\"],\n      \"keys\": {\n        \"ed25519:base64+self+signing+public+key\": \"base64+self+signing+public+key\"\n      },\n      \"signatures\": {\n        \"@bob:example.org\": {\n          \"ed25519:base64+master+public+key\": \"signature+of+self+signing+key\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIn this example we have Bob's self-signing key which has a signature of Bob's master key. The usage\narray additionally indicates the usage of the key, which is master, self_signing or user_signing.\nWhile for cross-signing there should only be one item in usage, in the future some other keys might be added\nthat could have multiple uses. As such, an array is used here to future-proof things.\nThe master_keys and user_signing_keys sections look the same.\nChanges to key verification\nNow, there is a slight change you need to perform to the key verification, specifically SAS, that we previously\nimplemented: In the m.key.verification.mac reply, there will be a dictionary of MACs to verify certain\nkeys. These don't only contain device keys, but also contain cross-signing keys, identified by\ned25519:base64+master+public+key, etc. Be sure to flag those cross-signing keys as verified, too.\nGetting the verification level based on cross-signing status\nIf you want to know if a device key is verified, just recursively check all of the valid signatures\nof the keys, until you hit a key that is already verified! This means that given a signature chain as\nfollows (assuming you are Alice):\nAlice' Master Key --&gt; Alice' User-Signing Key --&gt; Bob's Master Key --&gt; Bob's Self-Signing Key --&gt; Bob's Tablet\nAnd you have previously (via e.g. emoji verification) verified Alice's (your own) master key, and want\nto know if Bob's Tablet is verified, you propagate that chain backwards, provided all the signatures\nare valid, until you hit your verified master Key.\nVerifying a signature\nLibolm to the rescue! It has a method which makes verifying signatures easy! If you have key A and want\nto verify the signature that key B added, you will have to do the following:\n\nIn the key A signatures dict, find the entry for key B and note down the signature.\nCreate the string for verification: take key A's complete dictionary, strip off of the unsigned\nand signature dictionaries and convert it into canonical json.\nUse olmutil.ed25519_verify(key_b_pub_key, canonical_json, signature); to verify the signature:\nnote that this will throw an error if invalid, and none if valid.\nThat's it, you have verified the signature!\n\nCheck if a user is verified\nTo see if a user is verified, simply check if their master key is verified! You can find the master\nkey of a user by looking for a cross-signing key which has master within their usage array.\nIf a user is verified but all of their devices are not, it is a good idea to display a warning.\nThings to look out for\n\nNever trust invalid signatures. Just treat them as if there was no signature at all.\nSignature loops will exist. Add infinite recursion protection to your signature loop checking.\nWhile signature checking doesn't seem to be expensive, it might be a good idea to cache the results\nin-memory while the program is running.\nBe sure to query the keys for a user if you are told in the sync loop they need updating (if you\nimplemented this correctly previously, nothing changes here).\nInstead of recursing until you have found a valid key, you could also recurse until you find your own,\nverified master key. This in practice, however, does not allow easy migration between device-device verification and\ncross-signing verification. Recursing until you hit a verified device is thus preferred.\n\n3. Implementing SSSS\nSSSS is short for Secure Secret Storage and Sharing, which provides a method of storing secret data\non the server, without the server administrator or anyone else having access to that data. As such,\nthis is optimal for storing the private keys for cross-signing on the server so that all your devices\ncan use them later on to generate signatures, and thus verify other people.\nUnfortunately there doesn't seem to be any help from libolm for implementing SSSS so this will\nbecome rather cryptographic-y to implement. You will mainly need to find libraries for the following\nfunctions:\n\nAES-CTR encryption and decryption\nSHA256 HMAC calculation\nBase58 encoding and decoding\nPBKDF2\n\nAs the \"sharing\" aspect is simpler to implement, here it will be implemented first. It can later on\nalso be easily used to debug &amp; verify the functionality of the \"secure secret storage\" part. It is,\nhowever, still crucial to look at the general structure of the SSSS first.\nTODO: This section doesn't list yet how to create keys, add this later on.\nGeneral Structure of SSSS storage\nSSSS depends on keys with which the actual secrets are being encrypted to be stored. These keys need\nto be provided by the client. There is, however, metadata information on the keys in a users account_data.\nFor that, there are entries m.secret_storage.key.&lt;keyId&gt;, where the keyId is the unique ID of said\nkey. In addition, there is an m.secret_storage.default_key which denotes the default key to use.\nThe m.secret_storage.&lt;keyId&gt; objects contain a MAC and an IV to easily verify if you have the correct\nkey, and, in case if there is also a password associated with it, some information on how to generate\nthe key out of the password. More specific on that later.\nSecrets, such as the private keys for cross-signing, can only be strings (not binary data) and are\nstored encrypted in the account data of your account. For example, the m.cross_signing.master entry\nin account data is the private key of your master cross-signing key. Each secret can be encrypted by\nmultiple SSS keys. Inside the encrypted object there is a mapping of key ID to the ciphertext, iv\nand MAC of the secret. A content could look as following:\n{\n  \"encrypted\": {\n    \"awesomeKeyId\": {\n      \"iv\": \"supercooliv\",\n      \"ciphertext\": \"secretciphertext\",\n      \"mac\": \"macthingy\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nCaching of secrets\nYou have to access some secrets comparatively often. As fetching from the store requires to get a key\nfor said secret, that requires user interaction. As such, if a client can store a secret reasonably\nsecurely client-sided, the client could cache some secrets locally. As this introduces an attack surface\nof a third party manually reading out the clients cache, but also improves user experience to not have\nto ask the user for their secret store passphrase, each client will have to decide which secrets to\ncache and which not, based on what kind of security it can offer. For cross-signing the needed secrets\nwould be m.cross_signing.self_signing, m.cross_signing.user_signing and for online key backup that\nwould be m.megolm_backup.v1. Blindly caching all secrets is a security risk, as some secrets such\nas m.cross_signing.master are highly sensitive and shouldn't be stored in plaintext on any disk, ever.\nYou should always keep a whitelist of what secrets to cache, never a blacklist, as in the future some\nnew highly-sensitive secret may be added.\nAs a secret might change in the future, it might be a good idea to store in the secret cache some more\ninformation along with the secret - perhaps its ciphertext with key id? So that if either key id or\nciphertext changes, you know that you'll have to fetch the secret from the store again, and your cache\nis out-of-date.\nSharing\nThe same limitations of caching apply to sharing: It only makes sense to request secrets or share\nsecrets that are cacheable, as else potentially sensitive data is leaked, or it requires user interaction\nto load those secrets in the first place anyways.\nSecrets can only be requested from other devices of your account that you already have verified, be\nit via cross-signing or directly. As such, it might be a good idea to request all cacheable secrets\nafter successfully completing verification with yourself, as far as that also verifies your own master\nkey (else the other client likely doesn't have cross signing and thus requesting secrets doesn't make\nmuch sense). For that you would also want to add a short delay prior requesting secrets, just to be\nsure that the other device has already finished processing the verification.\nYou request a secret by sending an m.secret.request, and you receive it back via an m.secret.send\nto_device event. Please keep in mind that m.secret.send has to be encrypted! To do your part in the sharing\nof secrets, you should also appropriately reply to a sharing request of another of your verified devices,\nprovided you have that secret cached.\nm.secret.request\nThis requests a secret from another device, or cancels a pending request.\n{\n  \"action\": \"request\", // or request_cancellation\n  \"name\": \"m.cross_signing.self_signing\", // the name of the secret you are trying to receive\n  \"requesting_device_id\": \"&lt;your own device id&gt;\",\n  \"request_id\": \"&lt;unique string to identify this request&gt;\"\n}\n\nm.secret.send\nThis sends / shares a secret with another device\n{\n  \"request_id\": \"&lt;same request id as received in m.secret.request&gt;\",\n  \"secret\": \"&lt;contents of the secret&gt;\"\n}\n\nAsking for a secret\n\nOnly ask your own, verified devices for a secret. Be reasonably sure that they might have it (e.g.\nthe other device sent you your master key to verify).\nWhen receiving a secret, verify that it was encrypted\nWhen receiving a secret, verify that it was from one of the devices you sent the request to (possible\nvia sender_key of the encrypted to_device content).\nOptionally, validate the secrets you received: In the case of the cross-signing and the online key\nbackup secrets, calculate the public key out of the received private key and compare them with the\nadvertised values.\nSend a request cancellation to all other devices you sent the request to but haven't heard back from\nyet.\n\nSharing a secret\n\nMake sure the request is coming from ourself\nMake sure that that particular device is verified\nMake sure we have the secret cached\nMake sure the request hasn't been canceled yet\nMake sure that the shared secret is verified\n\nOpening keys\nTo be able to access stored secrets, or store some yourself, you need to be able to access the SSSS\nkeys. This is done either by passphrase or by keyfile, afterwards the m.secret_storage.key.&lt;keyId&gt; is\nused to verify the validity of the key.\nKeyfile\nThe contents of the keyfile is just base58-encoded data. They consist of two prefix bytes, 0x8B and\n0x01. Additionally they contain a parity byte all at the end, which is all other bytes XOR'd onto\neach other. The key itself is base58-encoded chunked into characters of four. As such, the key can\neasily be decoded like the following:\nUint8List decodeRecoveryKey(String recoveryKey) {\n  // don't forget to strip all spaces before base58 decoding!\n  final result = base58.decode(recoveryKey.replaceAll(' ', ''));\n\n  // check the parity byte\n  var parity = 0;\n  for (final b in result) {\n    parity ^= b;\n  }\n  // as we xor'd ALL the bytes, including the parity byte, the result should be zero!\n  if (parity != 0) {\n    throw 'Incorrect parity';\n  }\n\n  // check if we have the correct header prefix\n  var OLM_RECOVERY_KEY_PREFIX = [0x8B, 0x01];\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; OLM_RECOVERY_KEY_PREFIX.length; i++) {\n    if (result[i] != OLM_RECOVERY_KEY_PREFIX[i]) {\n      throw 'Incorrect prefix';\n    }\n  }\n\n  // verify that the length of the key is correct\n  var OLM_PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH = 32; // can also be fetched from olm somehow...\n  if (result.length !=\n      OLM_RECOVERY_KEY_PREFIX.length + OLM_PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH + 1) {\n    throw 'Incorrect length';\n  }\n\n  // and finally, strip the prefix and the parity byte to return the raw key\n  return Uint8List.fromList(result.sublist(OLM_RECOVERY_KEY_PREFIX.length,\n      OLM_RECOVERY_KEY_PREFIX.length + OLM_PRIVATE_KEY_LENGTH));\n  }\n}\n\nPassphrase\nThe passphrase block of the key information in the account data specifies information on how to\ngenerate the key off of the password. It an look as follows:\n\"passphrase\": {\n  \"algorithm\": \"m.pbkdf2\", // currently only this one is supported\n  \"iterations\": 500000,\n  \"salt\": \"&lt;some-random-string&gt;\",\n  \"bits\": 256 // optional, defaults to 256\n}\n\nOut of this information we need the iteration, the salt and the number of bits for PBKDF2. Simply use\nthese parameters with the hash algorithm SHA-512 to generate a key:\nUint8List keyFromPassphrase(String passphrase, _PassphraseInfo info) {\n  if (info.algorithm != 'm.pbkdf2') {\n    throw 'Unknown algorithm';\n  }\n  var generator = PBKDF2(hashAlgorithm: sha512);\n  return Uint8List.fromList(generator.generateKey(passphrase, info.salt,\n      info.iterations, info.bits != null ? info.bits / 8 : 32));\n}\n\nImportant: Some PBKDF2 implementations take the length in bytes (like here), while others take\nthe length in bits. Divide by 8 appropriately, and only when needed.\nValidating the generated key\nTo know if the right keyfile was supplied or if the user entered the right password, we need to verify\nthe resulting keys validity. For that, the other information of the keys object in account data is\nrelevant:\n{\n  \"algorithm\": \"m.secret_storage.v1.aes-hmac-sha2\", // some old accounts might use a different algorithm, which is not covered in this guide\n  \"iv\": \"&lt;base64 encoded iv&gt;\",\n  \"mac\": \"&lt;bae64 encoded MAC&gt;\"\n}\n\nTo verify the key, encrypt 32 bytes of 0 with a blank name and the IV of the key information. Compare\nthe resulting MACs with each other. Be sure to compare the unpadded Base64-encoded MACs, so strip\nall the trailing ='s! The encryption itself will be outlined below.\nbool checkKey(Uint8List key, AccountData keyData) {\n  var info = keyData.content;\n  if (info['algorithm'] == 'm.secret_storage.v1.aes-hmac-sha2') {\n    if ((info['mac'] is String) &amp;&amp; (info['iv'] is String)) {\n      // ZERO_STR are 32 bytes of zero. We encrypt with our generated key, a blank name and the iv of the event\n      var encrypted = encryptAes(ZERO_STR, key, '', info['iv']);\n      // stripping all the trailing = of the MACs prior comparing\n      return info['mac'].replaceAll(RegExp(r'=+$'), '') ==\n          encrypted.mac.replaceAll(RegExp(r'=+$'), '');\n    } else {\n      // no real information about the key, assume it is valid\n      return true;\n    }\n  } else {\n    throw 'Unknown Algorithm';\n  }\n}\n\nEncrypting and decrypting\nBoth encrypting and decrypting is done with AES-CTR. Out of the secret key and the name of the secret\nusing HKDF with SHA-256 both the actual AES key and the key for\nthe MAC integrity is generated. IVs are randomly generated 16 bytes, with bit 63 set to 0. In the\naccount data events of the secrets, the MAC, the IV and the ciphertext are all base64 encoded.\nNote: AES-CTR is a stream cipher, not a block cipher. As such, the input data is unpadded. If your\nlibrary (incorrectly) does not properly handle that due to an invalid block, simply append prior\nen/decryption 0's to your data to fill up the input to a full number of blocks. One block here is\ntypically 16 bytes in size. After en/decrypting, strip the extra bytes again. Please note that this\nmethod will not work with block ciphers (e.g. XTS), it is something specific to stream ciphers, such\nas CTR.\nDeriving the keys using HKDF\nAs key deriving is needed for both encrypting and decrypting it makes sense to implement this first.\nIf you have a working HKDF implementation, you can use that. If not, you can implement it yourself.\nHKDF is a series of specific HMAC-SHA256 MACs, as following:\n_DerivedKeys deriveKeys(Uint8List key, String name) {\n  var zerosalt = Uint8List(32); // generate 32 bytes of zero\n  // hash the key with the zeros as secret\n  var prk = Hmac(sha256, zerosalt).convert(key);\n\n  var b = Uint8List(1); // generate one byte\n  b[0] = 1; // and set it to one\n  // use the previously resulted MAC as key, and hash the name, with the one-byte added to the end\n  // the result is the aes key\n  final aesKey = Hmac(sha256, prk.bytes).convert(utf8.encode(name) + b);\n\n  b[0] = 2; // set the byte to 2\n  // use the first computed MAC as a key, this time hashing the aes key plus the name plus the byte two\n  // the result is the HMAC key\n  var hmacKey = Hmac(sha256, prk.bytes).convert(aesKey.bytes + utf8.encode(name) + b);\n\n  // this just returns the raw, derived aes and HMAC keys in an object\n  return _DerivedKeys(aesKey: aesKey.bytes, hmacKey: hmacKey.bytes);\n}\n\nDecrypting\nNow, to decrypt, you just create a MAC with the HMAC key of the raw ciphertext, and compare it with\nthe MAC stored in the account data secret. If it matches, you decrypt using AES-CTR. The name here\nis the name of the secret we want to decrypt. The resulting code could look as follows:\nString decryptAes(_Encrypted data, Uint8List key, String name) {\n  // derive our keys using the before written function\n  var keys = deriveKeys(key, name);\n\n  // decode our ciphertext, as it is base64 encoded\n  var cipher = base64.decode(data.ciphertext);\n\n  // HMAC our cipher with the generated HMAC key, base64'ing it afterwards\n  var hmac = base64.encode(Hmac(sha256, keys.hmacKey).convert(cipher).bytes);\n\n  // compare the resulted MAC with with the one stored, unpadding both encoded values\n  if (hmac.replaceAll(RegExp(r'=+$'), '') != data.mac.replaceAll(RegExp(r'=+$'), '')) {\n    throw 'Bad MAC';\n  }\n\n  // decrypt the cipher with the generated aesKey, using AES-CTR and the supplied IV\n  var decipher = AES(Key(keys.aesKey), mode: AESMode.ctr, padding: null)\n      .decrypt(Encrypted(cipher), iv: IV(base64.decode(data.iv)));\n\n  // and return the decrypted secret\n  return String.fromCharCodes(decipher);\n}\n\nEncrypting\nEncrypting is rather similar. If no IV is specified, you have to randomly generate 16 bytes and set\nbit 63 to 0, as mentioned above. Again, we derive our AES and HMAC keys off of the supplied key and\nthe name. Then the ciphertext and the HMAC is computed, which is can be then stored later on. The name\nhere is the name of the secret we want to encrypt. The resulting code could look as follows:\n_Encrypted encryptAes(String data, Uint8List key, String name, [String ivStr]) {\n  Uint8List iv;\n  if (ivStr != null) {\n    // if we have an IV already, let's just use this\n    iv = base64.decode(ivStr);\n  } else {\n    // if we don't have one, generate a random 16-byte IV\n    iv = Uint8List.fromList(SecureRandom(16).bytes);\n  }\n  // And don't forget to set bit 63 of the IV to zero\n  iv[8] &amp;= 0x7f;\n\n  // derive our AES and HMAC keys using the before written function\n  var keys = deriveKeys(key, name);\n\n  // get our plain string (utf8) into bytes\n  var plain = Uint8List.fromList(utf8.encode(data));\n\n  // encrypt our plain text, using unpadded AES-CTR, with our aesKey and our (possibly generated) IV\n  var cipher = AES(Key(keys.aesKey), mode: AESMode.ctr, padding: null).encrypt(plain, iv: IV(iv)).bytes;\n\n  // calculate the HMAC of the resulting cipher, using the hmacKey\n  var hmac = Hmac(sha256, keys.hmacKey).convert(cipher);\n\n  // base64 the iv, the cipher and the MAC, returning it all\n  return _Encrypted(\n    iv: base64.encode(iv),\n    ciphertext: base64.encode(cipher),\n    mac: base64.encode(hmac.bytes),\n  );\n}\n\nStoring a secret\nTo store a secret, just encrypt it and save the outcome to the account data, using the format mentioned\nabove.\nDebugging hints\nDebugging can be hard. If you successfully encrypt and decrypt a secret using your methods, how do\nyou know that you followed through implementation correctly and didn't just e.g. derive the keys wrong?\nTo mitigate that, you could receive a secret (e.g. m.cross_signing.self_signing) via sharing from\nanother device, and then compare that received value with what is stored in SSSS. If your decryption\nworks properly, they should match up. If you then can successfully encrypt and decrypt something,\nthat means your encryption is working, too.\nAs using a keyfile is simpler in implementation than using password, you could also test with keyfile\nfirst, and only after that is working fine, debug any errors you might have in deriving the key from\nthe password.\nThings to look out for\n\nOnly cache a whitelisted set of secrets, that is m.cross_signing.self_signing,\nm.cross_signing.user_signing and m.megolm_backup.v1.\nWhen fetching a secret from the store that is cacheable - cache it!\nOnly share secrets with own devices you trust.\nOnly request secrets from own devices you trust.\n\n4. Signing of other keys\nAt this point you already display the verification status of others based on cross signing and are\nable to access your own private keys - either cached in some way, or you decrypt them from SSSS, or\nyou request them from other devices via SSSS as outlined above.\nThis means that now you have the ability to sign other peoples keys! This is an important step - that\nway when you verify other people, you can also sign their master key, so that other of your own devices\nwill see all of their other devices verified.\nWhich keys to sign\nThis step is rather simple: When successfully verifying either another of your own devices or another\nperson via interactive verification, you take all the devices you verify and (potentially) all the\ndevices you receive, be it device keys or cross signing keys, and sign them with one of your own keys:\n\nIf you receive your own master key, you sign it with your own device key\nIf you receive a device key of your own account, you sign it with your own self-signing key\nIf you receive another persons master key, you sign it with your own user-signing key\n\nAll other keys received, that is device keys of other people, are not signed.\nHow to sign a key\nTo sign a key, you take the device key object, or the cross signing key object, remove the unsigned\nand signature keys and sign the canonical json encoded object. Afterwards you upload them to the\nserver.\nFor example, you want to sign the following device key:\n{\n  \"user_id\": \"@alice:example.com\",\n  \"device_id\": \"JLAFKJWSCS\",\n  \"algorithms\": [\n    \"m.olm.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2\",\n    \"m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2\"\n  ],\n  \"keys\": {\n    \"curve25519:JLAFKJWSCS\":\n        \"3C5BFWi2Y8MaVvjM8M22DBmh24PmgR0nPvJOIArzgyI\",\n    \"ed25519:JLAFKJWSCS\":\n        \"lEuiRJBit0IG6nUf5pUzWTUEsRVVe/HJkoKuEww9ULI\"\n  },\n  \"signatures\": {\n    \"@alice:example.com\": {\n      \"ed25519:JLAFKJWSCS\":\n          \"dSO80A01XiigH3uBiDVx/EjzaoycHcjq9lfQX0uWsqxl2giMIiSPR8a4d291W1ihKJL/a+myXS367WT6NAIcBA\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"unsigned\": {\"device_display_name\": \"Alices mobile phone\"}\n}\n\nThen you strip the signatures and unsigned keys:\n{\n  \"user_id\": \"@alice:example.com\",\n  \"device_id\": \"JLAFKJWSCS\",\n  \"algorithms\": [\n    \"m.olm.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2\",\n    \"m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2\"\n  ],\n  \"keys\": {\n    \"curve25519:JLAFKJWSCS\":\n        \"3C5BFWi2Y8MaVvjM8M22DBmh24PmgR0nPvJOIArzgyI\",\n    \"ed25519:JLAFKJWSCS\":\n        \"lEuiRJBit0IG6nUf5pUzWTUEsRVVe/HJkoKuEww9ULI\"\n  }\n}\n\nAnd then the canonical json you need to sign is:\n{\"algorithms\":[\"m.olm.v1.curve25519-aes-sha2\",\"m.megolm.v1.aes-sha2\"],\"device_id\":\"JLAFKJWSCS\",\"keys\":{\"curve25519:JLAFKJWSCS\":\"3C5BFWi2Y8MaVvjM8M22DBmh24PmgR0nPvJOIArzgyI\",\"ed25519:JLAFKJWSCS\":\"lEuiRJBit0IG6nUf5pUzWTUEsRVVe/HJkoKuEww9ULI\"},\"user_id\":\"@alice:example.com\"}\n\nYou can easily sign a key with libolm:\nString sign(String canonicalJson, Uint8List key) {\n  final keyObj = olm.PkSigning();\n  try {\n    keyObj.init_with_seed(key);\n    return keyObj.sign(canonicalJson);\n  } finally {\n    keyObj.free();\n  }\n}\n\nKeep in mind that the keys coming from SSSS are base64 encoded and olm needs a raw byte array, so you\nwill have to base64 decode that!\nUploading signatures\nAfter creating the signatures, you need to upload them! For that you bundle all the key objects with\nonly your new signatures together and POST them to /_matrix/client/unstable/keys/signatures/upload.\nThe payload is bundled by user ID, mapped to device ID or cross signing public key, which then contains\nthe key objects with the new signatures. An example payload could thus look as following (taken from\nthe spec):\nPOST /_matrix/client/unstable/keys/signatures/upload HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"@alice:example.com\": {\n    \"HIJKLMN\": {\n      \"user_id\": \"@alice:example.com\",\n      \"device_id\": \"HIJKLMN\",\n      \"algorithms\": [\n        \"m.olm.curve25519-aes-sha256\",\n        \"m.megolm.v1.aes-sha\"\n      ],\n      \"keys\": {\n        \"curve25519:HIJKLMN\": \"base64+curve25519+key\",\n        \"ed25519:HIJKLMN\": \"base64+ed25519+key\"\n      },\n      \"signatures\": {\n        \"@alice:example.com\": {\n          \"ed25519:base64+self+signing+public+key\": \"base64+signature+of+HIJKLMN\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"base64+master+public+key\": {\n      \"user_id\": \"@alice:example.com\",\n      \"usage\": [\n        \"master\"\n      ],\n      \"keys\": {\n        \"ed25519:base64+master+public+key\": \"base64+master+public+key\"\n      },\n      \"signatures\": {\n        \"@alice:example.com\": {\n          \"ed25519:HIJKLMN\": \"base64+signature+of+master+key\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"@bob:example.com\": {\n    \"bobs+base64+master+public+key\": {\n      \"user_id\": \"@bob:example.com\",\n      \"keys\": {\n        \"ed25519:bobs+base64+master+public+key\": \"bobs+base64+master+public+key\"\n      },\n      \"usage\": [\n        \"master\"\n      ],\n      \"signatures\": {\n        \"@alice:example.com\": {\n          \"ed25519:base64+user+signing+public+key\": \"base64+signature+of+bobs+master+key\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThings to look out for\n\nOnly sign the keys mentioned above, do not sign any other keys.\nUse the correct key to sign the correct key type - self_signing for your own things, user_signing\nfor other users and your own device key for your own master key.\nIf you don't have the self_signing or user_signing keys cached, you might have to propmpt the user\nto open their SSSS with their recovery passphrase / key.\nIf you are doing the first verification with an own device you don't have any cross-signing keys\nyet. Signing the other persons device key doesn't make much sense, as it is likely already signed.\nInstead, only sign your own master key in that specific case. In a following section will be discussed\nhow you can detect whether you should do this behaviour - for now you could only sign other own\ndevice keys if you have your own self_signing key cached.\nDon't forget to request SSSS secrets over share requests when verifying an own device and you don't\nhave them yet.\n\n5. In-room verification\nThe idea of cross-signing is that users verify other users. So far we only talked about devices\nverifying devices, though. For that, in-room verification is introduced. In-room verification is\ntypically used when verifying other users. To not confused the user it should be considered to\nhide device verification for other users all-together, and to only show device verification for\nverification with yourself.\nStarting in-room verification\nIn-room verification happens in a direct message room between two users. So, when Alice wants to verify\nBob she has to find an existing direct message room she has with Bob, and, if there is none, create\nit and invite him.\nAfterwards, as with the to_device verification flow, messages are sent in the room specific to the\nverification flow chosen. There are, however, a few changes.\nSending a verification request\nInstead of sending an event with type m.verification.key.request, a normal message event with the\nmsgtype of m.verification.key.request is sent. As normal room messages already have an origin_server_ts\nthe timestamp field is omitted. As transaction ID the event of this message sent is used. Additionally,\na from_device and to field are added. A body is present as fallback for clients that do not\nsupport in-room verification.\nAs the content of such an m.room.message for Alice to start an in-room verification request with Bob\ncould look as follows:\n{\n  \"methods\": [\n    \"m.sas.v1\"\n  ],\n  \"from_device\": \"MPLIJIXIIF\", // The device ID of Alice device starting the request\n  \"msgtype\": \"m.key.verification.request\",\n  \"to\": \"@bob:example.org\", // Bobs mxid\n  \"body\": \"Attempting verification request. (m.key.verification.request) Apparently your client doesn't support this\"\n}\n\nSending other payloads\nNext messages are sent with the type being the type of that specific step, e.g. instead of sending\na message as m.room.message as above, you send it as m.key.verification.accept. The from_device\nproperty is still added as usual.\nAs transaction ID the event ID of the original request is used. That, however, is added in an m.relates_to\nblock as follows:\n{\n  // other content of that specific type\n  \"from_device\": \"DEVICE_ID\",\n  \"m.relates_to\": {\n    \"rel_type\": \"m.reference\",\n    \"event_id\": \"$event_id_of_the_original_request\"\n  }\n}\n\nThings to look out for\n\nDon't allow to directly verify other users devices\nUse in-room verification to verify other users, not specific devices\nDon't use in-room verification for self-verification, use device verification for that\nIf Alice starts an in-room verification with Bob and Bob has two devices, only one of the devices,\nprobably the one Bob uses to accept the verification, should send verification messages.\n\n6. Miscellaneous cross-signing things\nApart from bootstrapping cross-signing there are a few miscellaneous things that you can optionally\nimplement to smoothen out the cross-signing experience for the user, things that don't justify their\nown section. As such, they are listed here.\nDetect if you are verified for others\nYour client might want to introduce a popup or something saying \"This session isn't verified for others.\nPlease verify it with one of your devices.\". For that, you need to detect if that is the case.\nTo do so, you have to check the valid signature of your own device to your own master key. It should\nlook as following, where -&gt; denotes \"is signed by\":\nOwn device -&gt; Own self-signing key -&gt; Own master key\nYou could re-use the same recursive method to determine if a device is verified as previously implemented,\nbut only cut off if it reaches at your own verified master key, not at any verified key.\nMigration of previous verifications\nLet's say Alice and Bob previously met, before cross-signing and had manually verified their devices\nspecifically. And now, both have enabled cross signing. Alice could detect Bobs master key as verified\nwith the following signature chain, where -&gt; denotes \"is signed by\":\nBobs master key -&gt; Bobs device key, previously verified\nAlice could then, based on this trust establishment, sign bobs master key with her own user-signing\nkey, thus bootstrapping a cross-signing relationship from Alice to Bob.\nSelf-Verification\nLet's say you log into a new device but don't have any other device to verify with around. Don't worry,\nthis is where self-verification comes in: You prompt the user their SSSS passphrase / recovery key\nand use that to verify and sign yourself:\n\nAsk for SSSS credentials\nDecrypt your master key (m.cross_signing.master), generate the public key out of it and compare\nit with your own advertised master ed25519 key. You can do this with libolms olm.PkSigning(),\nproperty init_with_seed. Keep in mind that you have to base64-decode the secret of SSSS!\nDecrypt your own self-signing key, and sign your own device key with it.\nSign your own master key with your own device key.\nUpload the signatures.\nFetch all entries from SSSS that you want to cache and cache them.\n\n7. Bootstrapping SSSS and cross-signing\nBy now your client should be able to cross-sign other devices, use SSSS if it is set up and sign other\npeople via verification. To set up all the things that means to bootstrap them, you still rely on\nother clients, such as element.\nBootstrapping is actually pretty straight-forward: You create all the keys, encrypt the cross-signing\nkeys and set the events. So, a rough roadmap of what to do can look as following:\n\nCreate a new SSSS key, be it via a randomly generated key or from a passphrase\nGenerate a new, random, key ID for that key\nSet the information for that key in your account data\nSet the new key as default key\nDo other things (generate cross-signing keys, etc.) with that new key\n\nCreating the SSSS key information\nCreating the key information for the new m.secret_storage.key.&lt;keyid&gt; event is basically just doing\nwhat you did before to verify if an entered key is correct, but now using the data to set the account\ndata event. In the case of a passphrase you will have to generate a salt and iteration times yourself.\nAll keys have 256 bits.\nImportant: Make sure that all random things generated here, be it keys or salts, are as securely\nrandom as possible. Many languages have libraries for creating more securely random data than the\ndefault pseudo random number generator.\nKey from passphrase\nA reasonably-secure iteration number for PBKDF2 is 500000 (That is five-hundred thousand). The salt\nneeds as much random data as our hash function. While PBKDF2 uses sha512 as hash, the generated key\nis only 256 bits long, so 256 bits should be reasonably secure. To make sure that the salt is usable,\nyou can just base64 the randomly generated salt.\nAfter that, you use PBKDF2 to get the key from the passphrase, and calculate the MAC and IV.\nCode for generating the key could look as follows:\n// \"passphrase\" is the passphrase by the user\n\nvar passphraseInfo = {\n  \"algorithm\": \"m.pbkdf2\",\n  \"iterations\": 500000,\n  \"salt\": base64.encode(SecureRandom(32).bytes), // we use secure random! 32 bytes = 256 bits\n  \"bits\": 256,\n};\nvar generator = PBKDF2(hashAlgorithm: sha512);\nvar key = Uint8List.fromList(generator.generateKey(passphrase, passphraseInfo[\"salt\"],\n      passphraseInfo[\"iterations\"], passphraseInfo[\"bits\"] / 8));\n\nGenerating a random key without a passphrase\nJust generate a 256-bit long key.\nvar key = SecureRandom(32).bytes; // 32 bytes = 256 bits\n\nCalculating the key information\nYou still need an IV to be able to calculate the MAC you later on use to verify the key. For that,\ngenerate 16 bytes and base64-encode them. Afterwards you just generate the MAC like you would for\nverifying the key, and then store the account data event.\n// \"key\" is the key\nvar iv = base64.encode(SecureRandom(16).bytes);\n// ZERO_STR are 32 bytes of zero. We encrypt with our generated key, a blank name and the iv of the event\nvar encrypted = encryptAes(ZERO_STR, key, '', iv);\nvar info = {\n  \"algorithm\": \"m.secret_storage.v1.aes-hmac-sha2\",\n  \"iv\": iv,\n  \"mac\": encrypted.mac,\n  \"passphrase\": passphraseInfo,\n};\n\nGenerating the key ID\nThe key ID is just a short, random string which doesn't contain a dot. For that, you can e.g. generate\na few random bytes and base64 encode them. Make sure no key with such an ID exists yet! After you have\nthe key ID, set your key information object to account data m.secret_storage.key.&lt;keyId&gt;.\nTo set the newly generated key as default key, simply set the m.secret_storage.default_key account\ndata to the key ID (NOT the full account data type):\n{\n  \"key\": \"&lt;keyId&gt;\"\n}\n\nBootstrapping cross-signing\nNow that you bootstrapped SSSS, it is time to bootstrap cross-signing! For that, you generate an\ned25519 keypair for master key, self-signing key and user-signing key. Afterwards you store the\nbase64-encoded private keys in SSSS, generate the key objects with the public keys for uploading,\nsign the self-signing and user-signing key with the master key, and upload them. While you are at it,\nyou can also sign your own device with the newly generated self-signing key and sign the newly\ngenerated master key with your own device key. Don't forget to mark the master key you just generated\nas verified!\nFortunately libolm gives us methods for creating an ed25519 keypair. We already showed how to sign\nkey objects with libolm above, when creating new signatures after verifying.\nvar master = olm.PkSigning();\ntry {\n  var masterPrivateKey = master.generate_seed();\n  var masterPublicKey = master.init_with_seed(masterPrivateKey);\n  // generate key object (and save for later)\n  var json = {\n    \"user_id\": \"@alice:example.com\",\n    \"user\": [\"master\"], // adjust to \"self_signing\" and \"user_signing\" for the other keys\n    \"keys\": {\n      \"ed25519:$masterPublicKey\": masterPublicKey,\n    },\n  };\n\n  // self_signing and user_signing ONLY! Generate signature:\n  var signature = signWithMasterKey(json);\n  json[\"signatures\"] = {\n    \"@alice:example.com\": {\n      // as it was the *master* key that made the signature, we always need to put the master key\n      // here\n      \"ed25519:&lt;base64-of-master-public-key&gt;\": signature,\n    },\n  };\n\n  // store in SSSS\n  var secret = base64.encode(masterPrivateKey);\n  storeInSsss(\"m.cross_signing.master\", secret); // adjust to \"m.cross_signing.self_signing\" and \"m.cross_signing.user_signing\" for the other keys.\n} finally {\n  master.free();\n}\n\nAfter you generated all the json key objects you can POST them to /_matrix/client/unstable/keys/device_signing/upload.\nKeep in mind that this endpoint uses user-interactive authentication, so you will also have to send\nan additional auth array with the needed information to complete stages. Hereby master_key holds\nthe master key object, self_signing_key the self-signing key and user_signing_key the user-signing\nkey. An example request could look as following (taken from the spec):\nPOST /_matrix/client/unstable/keys/device_signing/upload HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"master_key\": {\n    \"user_id\": \"@alice:example.com\",\n    \"usage\": [\n      \"master\"\n    ],\n    \"keys\": {\n      \"ed25519:base64+master+public+key\": \"base64+master+public+key\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"self_signing_key\": {\n    \"user_id\": \"@alice:example.com\",\n    \"usage\": [\n      \"self_signing\"\n    ],\n    \"keys\": {\n      \"ed25519:base64+self+signing+public+key\": \"base64+self+signing+master+public+key\"\n    },\n    \"signatures\": {\n      \"@alice:example.com\": {\n        \"ed25519:base64+master+public+key\": \"signature+of+self+signing+key\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"user_signing_key\": {\n    \"user_id\": \"@alice:example.com\",\n    \"usage\": [\n      \"user_signing\"\n    ],\n    \"keys\": {\n      \"ed25519:base64+user+signing+public+key\": \"base64+user+signing+master+public+key\"\n    },\n    \"signatures\": {\n      \"@alice:example.com\": {\n        \"ed25519:base64+master+public+key\": \"signature+of+user+signing+key\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nChanging SSSS passphrase / key\nAlong with bootstrapping you can implement other things, such as the ability to change the SSSS passphrase.\nWhen doing so, keep in mind that keeping an in-tact SSSS is crucial for having a functional account,\nas such an algorithm is needed where any single step can fail and no data at all is lost. For this,\nit is helpful to utilize that an encrypted SSSS secret in account data can be encrypted by multiple\nkeys at once, by setting multiple ciphertexts:\n{\n  \"encrypted\": {\n    \"firstKeyId\": {\n      \"iv\": \"supercooliv\",\n      \"ciphertext\": \"secretciphertext\",\n      \"mac\": \"macthingy\"\n    },\n    \"secondKeyId\": {\n      \"iv\": \"othersupercooliv\",\n      \"ciphertext\": \"othersecretciphertext\",\n      \"mac\": \"othermacthingy\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNow, the following algorithm could be used to change the SSSS passphrase:\n\nScan all account data for things that look like they could be stored SSSS secrets\nGather all needed SSSS keys needed to decrypt them (typically only one - the current default)\nPrompt the user to unlock all of those keys\nDecrypt and cache all secrets\nPrompt the user for a new passphrase / key\nGenerate the new SSSS key\nRe-encrypt all cached secrets with the new SSSS key, putting the new ciphertext there in addition\nto the old ciphertext\n(Optional) Re-verify that all account data events have been set correctly, e.g. by attempting to\ndecrypt with the new key and comparing with the cached secrets\nSet the new key as default key\nRemove from the account data events the old ciphertext, as only the new one is needed anymore\n\n","id":"/docs/legacy/e2ee-cross-signing/","title":"Implementing more advanced e2ee features, such as cross-signing"},"/docs/legacy/elizabot/":{"body":"In this article, we'll use Matrix, a Raspberry Pi and JavaScript to bring back\nchatbot software from the 1960s: ELIZA.\nWhat is ELIZA?\nELIZA is a computer program written between 1964 and 1966, which imitates the\nconversation style of a psychotherapist of the era. It behaves like what we\nwould now call a chatbot, but there was no such concept at the time - in fact\nthere were only the first glimpses of text chat as we would recognise it today.\nThe original program was designed and at the MIT Artificial Intelligence\nLaboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum. ELIZA was first implemented on the IBM 7094\nand written in MAD-SLIP, where\nMAD was a popular\nprogramming system for IBM mainframes of the time, and\nSLIP was a\nlist-processing extension of Weizenbaum's own creation.\nSeeing the results, in which users were highly willing to interact with ELIZA,\nWeizenbaum was disturbed by just how effective the apparently simple bot was. He\nwas motivated to write a book explaining the way people tend to anthropomorphise\ntechnology by applying their own experiences to their usage.\n2005, online JavaScript version appeared\nIn 2005, Norbert Landsteiner created a\nJavaScript program which he made available as elizabot.js, and made ELIZA\navailable online through a web interface: https://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/.\nNow we'll make this available on Matrix.\nMaking the bot\nUsing the library\nFor this project I have chosen to use an adaptation of the elizabot.js library:\neliza-as-promised, which\nexposes the bot as a promise-based node.js module. This module makes working\nwith ELIZA very simple. First we create an instance of the bot object:\nconst Eliza = require('eliza-as-promised');\nvar eliza = new Eliza();\n\nWe can get an initial greeting as follows:\nconsole.log(eliza.getInitial());\n\nThe getResponse() function takes a string from the user, and returns a\nPromise with a response, with either a reply or final field. If the\nresponse is a reply, we can give another string to get a response, if the\nresponse is final, the session is over. For example:\neliza.getResponse(\"Help me Eliza!\")\n.then((response) =&gt; {\n    if (response.reply) {\n        console.log(response.reply);\n    }\n    if (response.final) {\n        console.log(response.final);\n        process.exit(0);\n    }\n});\n\nUsing Matrix to make a modern Chatbot\nMatrix is an open standard for real-time communication over IP. It is often used\nto enable Instant Messaging. Matrix is not just  Open Source, it is also\ndesigned to be interoperable, which makes it easy to take existing projects and\nintegrate them.\nMatrix provides a decentralised architecture, in which servers connect to one\nanother, but as a user your client connects to a single homeserver, as described\nin the diagram below.\n\nHowever, for this project we only need to look at the Client-Server API, which\nis the way in which clients and servers communicate with one another. To make it\neasier to connect the ELIZA library to Matrix, I chose to use a JavaScript\nlibrary designed to access the Matrix Client-Server API: matrix-bot-sdk\nfrom TravisR.\nCode Walkthrough\nFirst, we'll need a new instance of the Bot SDK, which we can obtain from NPM as\nfollows:\nnpm install matrix-bot-sdk\n\nThen, in our application code, we will instantiate and start a new client. Note\nthat you can obtain an access token for the bot using\nElement.\nvar access_token = \"...\";\nconst MatrixClient = require(\"matrix-bot-sdk\").MatrixClient;\nconst AutojoinRoomsMixin = require(\"matrix-bot-sdk\").AutojoinRoomsMixin;\nconst client = new MatrixClient(\"https://matrix.org\", access_token);\nAutojoinRoomsMixin.setupOnClient(client);\nclient.start().then(() =&gt; console.log(\"Client started!\"));\n\nI also added the AutojoinRoomsMixin at this point, which instructs the bot to\naccept any room invitation it receives.\nKnowing that we can use\neliza-as-promised to create\nnew instances of Eliza, let's start by doing so whenever the bot joins a new\nroom.\nvar elizas = {};\nclient.on(\"room.join\", (roomId) =&gt; {\n    elizas[roomId] = {\n        eliza: new Eliza(),\n        last: (new Date()).getTime()\n    }\n    client.sendMessage(roomId, {\n        \"msgtype\": \"m.notice\",\n        \"body\": elizas[roomId].eliza.getInitial()\n    });\n});\n\nWhat's happening here? First we make a new object to contain a mapping of room\nIDs to Eliza objects. When we get a room join event, we assign a new Eliza\nobject and the current time to the room ID. Next, we use the newly created\nobject to send the initial greeting to the room, using the same call to\ngetInitial() we used earlier.\nNext, we'll accept messages from the user and provide a response:\nclient.on(\"room.message\", async function (roomId, event)  {\n    if (event[\"sender\"] === await client.getUserId()) return;\n    if (! event.content || ! event.content.body) return;\n\n    elizas[roomId].eliza.getResponse(event.content.body)\n        .then((response) =&gt; {\n            var responseText = '';\n            if (response.reply) { responseText = response.reply; }\n            if (response.final) { responseText = response.final; }\n\n            client.sendMessage(roomId, {\n                \"msgtype\": \"m.notice\",\n                \"body\": responseText,\n                \"responds\": {\n                    \"sender\": event.sender,\n                    \"message\": event.content.body\n                }\n            }).then((eventId) =&gt; {\n                if (response.final) {\n                    client.leaveRoom(roomId);\n                }\n            });\n    });\n});\n\nIt looks like a lot of code, but in fact we can break down what is happening\nhere quite simply.\n\nWhen an event is received in a room, we react to the event with a function\nthat takes the roomId and event received as parameters.\nIf the user is our own, or the event does not contain a body, we must\nreturn.\nWe use the roomId to access the specific Eliza instance, as previously\ncreated.\nAs above, we call getResponse() on the Eliza object, and we pass the\nmessage string we just received.\nWe handle the promise returned by getResponse() by extracting the response\nstring into responseText, and use that string as a message to send back\ninto the room as a response.\nFinally, if the response text we took from our Eliza is \"final\", we have\nEliza leave the room. (The bot can always be re-invited!)\n\nThat all the code needed to get a working version of the bot running. If you\nlook at https://github.com/benparsons/elizabot, you can find a simple\nimplementation as described here in simple.js, and a more robust\nimplementation in index.js.\nDeploying on a Raspberry Pi\nTo run the bot, we simply run node index.js. However, part of this project is\nto get the bot running on a Raspberry Pi - and for convenience the way to do\nthis is to have it run as soon as the device boots. Luckily, there are standard\nways of achieving this, one of which is to use systemd. Open a shell on your\nPi (possibly using a\ngraphical desktop if one is installed, or using ssh) and enter this command to\naccess the correct directory:\ncd /etc/systemd/system\n\nNow, we'll use vim to create a file describing the service we want to create:\nvim elizabot.service\n\nFinally, enter the following text (you may need to change paths depending on\nwhere your script is located):\n[Unit]\nDescription=Elizabot\nAfter=multi-user.target\n\n[Service]\nType=idle\nExecStart=/usr/bin/node /home/pi/elizabot/index.js &gt; /home/pi/elizabot/log.log 2&gt;&amp;1\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n... and run the following to enable the service:\nsudo systemctl enable elizabot.service\n\nNow, whenever you plug in your Pi, your bot will be launched and ready to go. Of\ncourse, it is quite possible to run this software on a server, but having a\nseparate box makes it more fun. The physicality of a Raspberry Pi means it gets\nmore attention and understanding from people who see it.\n\nTo learn more about Matrix development, take a look at the Matrix Guides\n page, and join us in the \n#matrix-dev:matrix.org room!\n","id":"/docs/legacy/elizabot/","title":"Using Matrix to make Chatbot software from the 1960s available in 2018"},"/docs/legacy/faq/":{"body":"Frequently Asked Questions\nIntro\nBasics\nWhat is Matrix?\nMatrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time\ncommunication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC\nsignalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard\nHTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the\nconversation history.\nThe Matrix.org Foundation defines the standard, and provides open source\nimplementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, Client\nSDKs and Application Services to help\nyou create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of\nexisting ones.\nWhat is Matrix's mission?\nMatrix’s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications:\nletting users message and call each other without having to care what app the\nother user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.\nThe longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data\nsynchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and\ndevices to easily communicate with each other, empowering users to own and\ncontrol their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.\nWhat does this mean for users?\nThe aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can\ncommunicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are\nusing, using whichever client app &amp; server\n you chose, and use a neutral identity system like an\ne-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.\nWhy are you called Matrix?\nWe are called Matrix because we provide a structure in which all communication\ncan be matrixed together.\nNo, it’s nothing to do with the film (although Third Room\n builds virtual worlds on top of Matrix 😎).\nWhat does Matrix provide?\n\nOpen Standard HTTP APIs for transferring JSON\nmessages (e.g. instant messages, WebRTC signalling), including:\n\nClient-Server API\n - defines how Matrix\ncompatible clients communicate with Matrix homeservers.\nServer-Server API\n - defines how Matrix\nhomeservers exchange messages and synchronise history with each other.\nApplication Service API\n - defines how to\nextend the functionality of Matrix with 'integrations' and bridge to other\nnetworks.\nModules\n - specifies\nfeatures that must be implemented by particular classes of clients.\n\n\nOpen source implementations of:\n\nClient SDKs (Javascript, Web (React), iOS, Android, Rust)\nHomeservers (Synapse)\nApplication Services (bridges to IRC, Slack, Skype, Lync and more...)\n\n\nThe actual ecosystem and community of everyone running Matrix servers and\nservices\nLoads of 3rd party contributions of clients, SDKs, servers and services.\nYou can find the full list of Matrix enabled projects at\nhttps://matrix.org/try-matrix\n\nWho and how?\nWhat kind of company is Matrix.org?\nThe Matrix.org Foundation is a non-profit UK Community Interest\nCompany, incorporated to act as the neutral guardian of the standard on behalf\nof the whole Matrix community. It is an open initiative which acts as a neutral\nand independent custodian of the Matrix standard.\nThe Foundation defines the manifesto, mission and values of the project, the\nopen governance process that determines how the specification develops, and\nprovides a safety-net to ensure the project stays independent and true to its\ngoals.\nHow is Matrix.org funded?\nMatrix.org is currently funded by the community, through a combination of\ncommunity support (via Patreon, [Liberapay]\n(https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg), Bitcoin and Ethereum), corporate\nsponsorship, and grant funding.\nCurrent Elliptic-level supporters on Patreon and corporate sponsors can be found\non our supporters page.\nIf you would like to support the core Matrix team as a member of the community,\nyou can do so via:\n\nPatreon\nLiberapay\nBitcoin (address: 1LxowEgsquZ3UPZ68wHf8v2MDZw82dVmAE)\nEthereum (address: 0xA5f9a4f9E024F6D727f7afdA9257e22329A97485)\n\nIf you would like to sponsor the team as a corporation, or are interested in\npaying for prioritised or custom development, please get in touch\n.\nFor the first three years of Matrix's development (2014-2017), most of the core\ncontributors worked for Amdocs, who paid for them to\nwork fulltime on Matrix. In July 2017, Amdocs considered the project to be\nsufficiently successful that it could now self-support and so stopped funding.\nThe majority of the core team is now employed by Element\n, an independent company set up to hire the team and\nsupport Matrix's development. Other contributors are funded by their own\nemployers or donate their own time to the project.\nWho is building Matrix?\nThe core team is ~12 people with extensive experience in building custom VoIP\nand Messaging apps for mobile network operators. Most of us work for Element,\nbut there are an increasing number of contributors from other companies and\nfolks all over the internet.\nConcept\nWhy have you released this as open source?\nWe believe that any open standard defining interoperable communication needs to\nbe justified, demonstrated and validated with transparent open source\nimplementations. For Matrix to achieve its mission of making all communications\nservices interoperable we believe it needs to be truly open, giving people\naccess to take all the code we produce and to use and build on top of it.\nWhat do you mean by open?\nMatrix is an open standard, meaning that we have freely published the details\nfor how to communicate interoperably using the Matrix set of HTTP APIs. We\nencourage anyone and everyone to use the APIs and build their own projects\nwhich implement them and so benefit from interoperability with the rest of the\nMatrix ecosystem. We also ensure the standard is not encumbered by any known\npatent licensing requirements.\nMatrix is also open source, meaning that we have released the source code of the\nreference servers, clients and services to the public domain under the Apache\nLicence v2, to encourage anyone and everyone to run their own servers and clients, and enhance them and\ncontribute their enhancements as they see fit.\nWhat does federated mean?\nFederation allows separate deployments of a communication service to communicate\nwith each other - for instance a mail server run by Google federates with a\nmail server run by Microsoft when you send email from @gmail.com to\n@hotmail.com.\ninteroperable clients may simply be running on the same deployment - whereas in\nfederation the deployments themselves are exchanging data in a compatible\nmanner.\nMatrix provides open federation - meaning that anyone on the internet can join\ninto the Matrix ecosystem by deploying their own server.\nHow is this like e-mail?\nThe history of email is\ninstructive when thinking about the importance of interoperability.\nEarly email systems behaved as isolated communities which only allowed you to\nexchange mail with users on the same system. If you got your email from one\nservice and your friend from another, then you couldn't message each other.\nThis is basically the situation we're in today with VoIP and IM.\nWhy has no one done this before?\nThere have been several attempts before including RCS.\nAll of these have had some level of success, but many different\ntechnological/usability/economic factors have ended up limiting their success.\nUnfortunately, we've not ended up in a world where everyone has a SIP URI or\nJabber ID on their business card, or a phone that actually uses RCS.\nTake a look at the Comparisons section for a more detailed look at how Matrix\ncompares to other projects.\nPractical\nWhat can I actually do with this?\nA typical client provides a simple chatroom interface to\nMatrix - letting the user interact with users and rooms anywhere within the\nMatrix federation. Text and image messages are supported, as well as voice and\nvideo calling via WebRTC in one-to-one rooms and via Jitsi elsewhere.\nHow can I get involved?\nThere are plenty of ways to get involved. First, create a user account and come say hi on #matrix:matrix.org!\nThen...\n\nInstall synapse and tell us how you get on.\nCritique what has been proposed.\nWrite clients.\nWrite bridges! Run bridges!\nNose around in the repositories in our GitHub organizatio\nn and send us some pull requests to fix some\nbugs or add some features!\nYou could even try to write a homeserver (but be warned, Matrix's architecture\nmakes homeservers orders of magnitude harder than clients or bridges.)\n\nSee our contributor guide\n for full details on how to contribute to the project. All are welcome!\nWhere can I get support?\nThe point of entry for everything matrix is #matrix:matrix.org\n aka #matrix on irc.libera.chat.\nIf you're a developer and are looking to get involved with building something on\nMatrix, try #matrix-dev:matrix.org.\nIf you host a Synapse homeserver, you can get support in the \n#synapse:matrix.org room.\nHow do I create a link to a Matrix room or user?\nYou can link to a Matrix room or user by going to matrix.to\n, and typing in the room alias or ID for linking to rooms, or a user's Matrix\nID for linking to users. There is also a matrix: URL scheme for Matrix rooms\nand users, similar to email's mailto: scheme, or XMPP's xmpp: scheme.\nUsage\nAs a user\nWhat clients are available?\nThere are many clients available, ranging from the glossy mass-market to the geeky command-line. There's even an emacs macro.\nThe most popular and established client is Element, available on web, desktop, Android and iOS.\nTo get a list of all the clients we're aware of, head to the clients page\n\nWhat bridges to other networks are available?\nThere are a large number of 'bridges' which integrate existing communication\nnetworks into Matrix. This list is growing rapidly, and you can find bridges\nboth written by the Matrix core team and contributed by the wider community.\nWe maintain a list of all the bridges we heard about.\nHow do I get an account and get started?\nThe quickest way is to pick a client and sign up.\nClients can access any homeserver—you don't have to use matrix.org, though\nhistorically it is the largest public homeserver. anchel.nl lists free public\nhomeservers, and a few other resources for\ngetting started.\nHow can I get a rooms list from matrix.org?\nIf you're using Element, you can use the \"Explore\" screen, which you open from a\nbutton next to the search box on the right.\nIt you're working on a client, you can use the Client-Server API to get a list\nof public rooms.\nTech\nHow do I Matrix-enable my existing app?\nIf your app doesn't have any communication capability already, you'll want to\nuse one of the Matrix client SDKs to add it in. These come\nin different levels of sophistication - ranging from a simple HTTP API wrapper\nthrough to reusable UI components.\nCan I write a Matrix homeserver?\nYes. Matrix is just a spec, and implementations of the spec are very welcome! Synapse is the most well-distributed homeserver, but Dendrite and Conduit are\nother projects aiming to implement the server component.\nWhy HTTP? Isn't it bad? Why don't you use websockets/CoAP/HTTP2/etc?\nHTTP may not be the most efficient transport, but it is ubiquitous, very well\nunderstood and has numerous implementations on almost every platform and\nlanguage. It also has a simple upgrade path to HTTP/2, which is relatively\nbandwidth and round-trip efficient.\nFor these reasons it has been chosen as the mandatory baseline of the exchange,\nbut it is still entirely possible to use other protocols for communication\nbetween clients and server (see for example this websocket transport spec\nproposal), and it's also possible in the future that negotiation of more\nefficient protocols will be added for the federation between servers, with\nHTTP+JSON remaining as the compatibility baseline.\nSelf-hosting\nHow do I join the global Matrix federation?\nYou can choose a client and create a user account on an existing homeserver.\nTo host your own, start by looking at recommended guides for installing\nSynapse.\nCan I run my own identity server?\nSee also: What is an identity server?\nYes - the reference implementation is sydent and you can run your own ID server\ncluster that tracks 3rd party to Matrix ID mappings. This won't be very useful\nright now, though, and we don't recommend it.\nIf you want your server to participate in the global replicated Matrix ID\nservice then please get in touch with us. Meanwhile, we are looking at ways of\ndecentralising the 'official' Matrix identity service so that identity servers\nare 100% decentralised and can openly federate with each other. N.B. that you\ncan use Matrix without ever using the identity service - it exists only to map\n3rd party IDs (e.g. email addresses) to matrix IDs to aid user discovery.\nWhy can't I rename my homeserver?\nCurrently, the homeserver name is assumed never to change. This means that if\nyou rename your server, other servers will think it's a different server.\nPerhaps in the future we will add an API for changing the homeserver name, but\nfor now this is not supported.\nDetail\nPosition in the world\nWhy do you think existing apps will ever join this officially?\nWe firmly believe it is what is right for the consumer. As people begin to use\ninteroperable communications tools, service providers will see the benefit and\ncompete on quality of service, security and features rather than relying on\nlocking people into their walled garden. We believe as soon as users see the\navailability and benefits of interoperable services they will demand it.\nWhy aren't you doing this through the IETF? or W3C? or 3GPP?\nWe do recognise the advantages of working with existing standards bodies. We\nhave been focused on writing code and getting it out, and the standard has been\nevolving rapidly since initial release in September 2014. Once the standard has\nmatured sufficiently it may well be appropriate to work with an official\nstandard body to maintain it going forwards.\nWhat is the current project status?\nA very quick recap by-the-numbers (updated May 2020):\n\nStarted out in Sept 2014\nReleased Matrix 1.0 in June 2019\n~17M global visible accounts\n~4.6M messages per day\n~7.2M unbridged accounts\n~500K unbridged messages per day\n~5.1M rooms that Matrix.org participates in\n~20,000 federated servers\n~3000 msgs/s out, ~30 msgs/s in on Matrix.org\n~400 projects building on Matrix\n~70 companies building on Matrix\n\nAs of September 2019, the Matrix ecosystem has dozens of independent homeserver\nhosts, many bridges and is under active development.\nWhy Apache Licence?\nSee also: What do you mean by open?\nThe Apache Licence is a permissive licence. We want the Matrix protocol itself\nto be free and open, but people are free to create both free and commercial\napps and services that uses the protocol. In our opinion, any Matrix-service\nonly enhances the Matrix ecosystem.\nComparisons\nWhat is the difference between Matrix and IRC?\nWe love IRC. In fact, prior to the point where Element was stable enough for\ndaily use IRC was our primary communication tool. Between us we've written\nIRCds, IRC bots and admined dreamforge, UnrealIRCd, epona, ircservices and\nseveral others. That said, it has some limitations that Matrix seeks to improve\non:\n\nText only\nNo history\nNo multiple-device support\nNo presence support\nFragmented identity model\nNo open federation\nNo standard APIs, just a rather limited TCP line protocol\nNon-standardised federation protocol\nNo built-in end-to-end encryption\nDisruptive net-splits\nNon-extensible\n\nIRCv3 exists and is addressing some of these issues; this\nis great news and we wish them well. It's almost a contradiction in terms to\nget competitive between openly interoperable communication projects - in fact\nthere there already exist mature Matrix-IRC bridges. matrix-appservice-irc\n is currently used to\nbridge with Libera.Chat and many other IRC networks.\nWhat is the difference between Matrix and XMPP?\nWe think of Matrix and XMPP as being quite different; at its core Matrix can be\nthought of as an eventually consistent global JSON database with an HTTP API\nand pubsub semantics - whilst XMPP can be thought of as a message passing\nprotocol. You can use them both to build chat systems; you can use them both to\nbuild pubsub systems; each comes with different tradeoffs. Matrix has a\ndeliberately extensive 'kitchen sink' baseline of functionality; XMPP has a\ndeliberately minimal baseline set of functionality. If XMPP does what you need\nit to do, then we're genuinely happy for you! Meanwhile, rather than competing,\nan XMPP Bridge like Matrix.org's own purple-matrix has potential to let both\nenvironments coexist and make the most of each other's benefits.\nThe whole area of XMPP vs Matrix is quite subjective. Rather than fighting over\nwhich open interoperable communication standard works the best, we should just\ncollaborate and bridge everything together. The more federation and\ninteroperability the better.\nHow does Matrix compare with something like Trillian or Pidgin?\nTrillian and Pidgin and similar aggregating IM clients merge all your IM\nactivity into a single app. However, your history and identity is still\nfragmented across the networks. People can't find you easily, and your history\nis fragmented (other than on the device where the client runs). And rather than\nbeing able to chose the right app for the job when communicating with people,\nyou are pushed towards relying on a specific aggregation app.\nMatrix lets you get the best of both worlds by linking to all the different\nnetworks (XMPP, AIM, ICQ, Lync, Skype etc) on the serverside, using bridges\nwhich can be run by anyone. Matrix then provides a simple standard HTTP API to\naccess any of these networks, and lets you choose whichever client you prefer\n(either as a 'native' Matrix client or using a non-Matrix client from one of\nthe networks which has been bridged in).\nMore Detail\nWhat is a client?\nUsers in Matrix use one or more clients to communicate. This could be any\ncombination of a web client, a command line client, a mobile client - or\nembedded clients built into existing apps. It could even be a piece of\nhardware (e.g. a drone) that is Matrix enabled.\nCan I use Matrix without installing a Matrix client?\nYes! An ever increasing number of protocols are being bridged into Matrix, so if\nyou use something like IRC on Libera.Chat you may well be indirectly benefiting\nfrom Matrix, as others may be connected into the IRC channel via Matrix.\nWhat is a homeserver?\nA user's client connects to a single homeserver, which stores the communication\nhistory and account information for that user, and shares data with the wider\nMatrix ecosystem by synchronising communication history with other\nhomeservers.\nWhat is a MXID?\nMatrix user IDs (MXID) are unique user IDs. They are in the format\n@username:homeserver.tld (this format is used to avoid confusing them with\nemail addresses.) They are intended to be fairly hidden (although right now\nthey are not) - instead you will find and identify other users via 3PIDs.\nWhat is a 3PID?\nThird-party IDs (3PIDs) are IDs from other systems or contexts, such as email\naddresses, social network accounts and phone numbers.\nWhat is an identity server?\nUsers in Matrix are identified internally via their 3PID namespaces such as\nemail addresses or phone numbers should be used publicly to identify Matrix\nusers, at least for invitation purposes. A Matrix \"Identity\" describes both the\nuser ID and any other existing IDs from third party namespaces linked to their\naccount.\nMatrix users can link third-party IDs (3PIDs) to their user ID. Linking 3PIDs\ncreates a mapping from a 3PID to a user ID. This mapping can then be used by\nMatrix users in order to discover the MXIDs of their contacts.\nIn order to ensure that the mapping from 3PID to user ID is genuine, the\nintention is for a globally federated cluster of trusted \"Identity Servers\"\n(IS) be used to verify the 3PID and persist and replicate the mappings. Usage\nof an IS is not required in order for a client application to be part of the\nMatrix ecosystem. However, without one clients will not be able to look up user\nIDs using 3PIDs.\nThe precise architecture of identity servers is currently in flux and subject to\nchange as we work to fully decentralise them.\nWhere do my conversations get stored?\nEach replicated across all of the homeservers whose users are participating in a\ngiven room.\nWhat are redactions?\nSince events are extensible it is possible for malicious users and/or servers to\nadd keys that are, for example offensive or illegal. Since some events cannot\nbe simply deleted (e.g. membership events) we instead 'redact' events,\nessentially stripping the event of all keys that are not required by the\nprotocol. Redacting an event cannot be undone, allowing server owners to also\ndelete the offending content from the databases.\nCan I log into other homeservers with my username and password?\nCurrently, no. We are looking at options for decentralising or migrating user\naccounts between multiple servers, and might add this feature at a later\nstage.\nWhat are spaces?\nSpaces are a collections of rooms. #community:matrix.org\n is the official matrix community\nspace containing rooms managed by the core Matrix team.\nSpaces are the replacements for the deprecated communities which were also known\nas groups. Other than groups a space itself is a Room\nArchitecture\nHow does Matrix actually work architecturally?\nFor an introduction to the Matrix architecture, see \nhttps://spec.matrix.org/latest/#architecture.\nWhat is a room?\nFor a more thorough introduction see: \nhttps://spec.matrix.org/latest/#room-structure.\nA room is a conceptual place where users can send and receive events. Events are\nsent to a room, and all participants in that room with sufficient access will\nreceive the event.\nBridging\nWhy don't you use separate homeserver instances to improve bridging performance?\nFor example:\n\nIs there any merit in a proposal that the current matrix.org Freenode bridge\ncould be taken off matrix.org and put on a new HS (at a new server-name\ndomain such as freenode.matrix.org) so as to not be bogged down in\nperformance?\n\nThe Matrix.org Foundation currently runs one homeserver: matrix.org. This\nhomeserver is operationally intensive and can sometimes suffer from slow\nresponse times. However running two homeservers would not improve performance,\nbecause the work done to maintain one homeserver would need to be duplicated.\nAlso, the traffic on the bridge instance would be intensive just by itself.\nRunning two intensive homeservers, where optimisations such as caching and\nfederation traffic batching would need to be duplicated would have a marked\ndecrease in overall performance.\nRunning the bridge on another homeserver means the same traffic will be hitting\nmatrix.org, except it now has to be handled by the federation inbound workers\ntoo. Now you have two hosts handling the same amount of traffic. You might see\na benefit to federated homeservers, but the new homeserver will struggle just\nas much with inbound/outbound federation slowness as it does now with\nbridging.\nFurther, it may turn out that the ongoing work on Synapse to introduce shared\nmaster processes actually makes it so much more efficient that whole benefit of\ncreating two homeservers is now moot.\nEncryption\nWhat does End-to-End (E2E) encryption mean?\nEnd-to-End encryption describes a scenario where a message is encrypted at the\ndevice or client of the sender, and is only decrypted by the device or client\nof the receiver, with no decryption or reading performed on the server.\nWhat is the status of E2E?\nEnd-to-End Encryption is fully supported in Matrix. New rooms have encryption\nenabled by default, and all existing rooms can optionally have End-to-End\nEncryption turned on.\nWhich matrix clients support E2E?\nHead to the clients section to get an up to date overview\nof what features they support (including E2EE).\nWhy are large public rooms like #matrix:matrix.org not encrypted?\nThere is no value in encrypting public rooms. If anyone can join the room then\nencryption does not protect the contents, and may offer inconvenience for some\nusers.\nThe Spec\nWhat is The Spec?\nThe Matrix Specification describes and prescribes the interaction between\nApplication Services and more.\nThe spec is available to read on matrix.org.\nTo contribute to the development of the Matrix Specification, see \nhttps://spec.matrix.org/proposals/.\nWhere is The Spec?\nYou can view the spec at https://spec.matrix.org.\nHow can I contribute to The Spec?\nTo contribute to the Matrix Specification, first take a look at the\ndocumentation as it is currently written, then review\nthe process for new proposals. You should\nstart by writing a publicly-accessible proposal describing your change.\nTo see the proposals currently under discussion,join us in \n#matrix-spec:matrix.org.\nWhat is the process for adding Spec proposals?\nSee the documentation at https://spec.matrix.org/proposals. In summary:\n\nProduce a publicly-accessible proposal describing your change\nMake a new issue at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues\n, and include the metadata as described\nGather feedback as widely as possible from the community and core team on the\nproposal\nShow an implementation to prove that it works well in practice, iterate where\nneeded.\nMake a new spec PR which includes the changes as implemented against the\nmain branch of this repository\n\nWhat's an MSC?\n\"MSC\" refers to Matrix Spec Change, each proposal is assigned an MSC number to\nmake referencing them easier.\nMSC numbers are taken from GitHub issues on the matrix-doc repo. To see a list\nof all active MSCs, and to understand how to contribute your own, see\nhttps://spec.matrix.org/proposals.\nVoIP\nHow do you do VoIP calls on Matrix?\nVoice (and video) over Matrix uses the WebRTC 1.0 standard to transfer call\nmedia (i.e. the actual voice and video traffic). Matrix is used to signal the\nestablishment and termination of the call by sending call events, like any\nother event.\nAre VoIP calls encrypted?\nWebRTC encrypts the media that's being sent. The signalling events that set up\n(and end) the call are encrypted if the room they were sent in has enabled\nencryption.\nDo I need a TURN server?\nVoIP calls should work if both parties are on public networks. However, in\npractice one (or both) devices are often behind NAT, and so having a TURN\nserver is important to help set up the call.\nSee this guide for setting up a TURN server with Synapse.\nSynapse\nWhat is Synapse?\nSynapse is a Matrix \"homeserver\" implementation developed by the matrix.org core\nteam, written in Python 3/Twisted. It is intended to showcase the concept of\nMatrix and let folks see the spec in the context of a codebase and let you run\nyour own homeserver and generally help bootstrap the ecosystem.\nHow do I install Synapse?\nTake a look at the Synapse Installation Guide. There are options for installing\nusing docker and/or ansible, plus manual installation instructions.\nWill Synapse share my chat data with other servers in the federation?\nFederation in Matrix means that data is only shared between servers of\nparticipating users of a room. If all users in a room are on your server, no\ndata is shared with other servers.\nWhy is the state_groups_state table so large? What is it storing?\nRoom state takes up a lot of space! To be specific, regular snapshots are taken\nof room states, so you can rapidly find out the state for historical events.\nWhy is it so important to record this, and to know the past room state including\nfull member list?\nIt's needed to enable access control and state resolution, for example the\nhomeserver needs to be able to decide:\n\n\"who can see this message at that point in time?\"\n\"what was the state of the room was when this message was received, and so is\nit allowed to be received?\" Synapse stores these snapshots approximately\nevery 100 messages, with deltas in between.\n\nDefinitions\nTermDefinition\nClientUsers in Matrix use one or more clients to communicate. This could be any combination of a web client, a command line client, a mobile client - or embedded clients built into existing apps. It could even be a piece of hardware (e.g. a drone) that is Matrix enabled.\nmatrixed togetherIn mathematics, a matrix is a lattice-like arrangement, in which expressions can be combined and treated as a single entity\nhomeserverEach account in the Matrix federation is associated with a single homeserver. The software running at this server stores the history and account information for that user. Homeservers synchronise message history with other homeservers.\nSynapseSynapse is a homeserver implemented in Python by the matrix.org core team. It is currently by far the most installed homeserver available.\ninteroperableA more general definition of interoperability is for systems to be able to freely exchange data with another by a known mechanism. In the case of matrix, we have openly documented how to communicate with our HTTP APIs.\nNew VectorNew Vector is a company formed to build Matrix.org. It is a continuation of the original project team, and is focused on development and maintenance of matrix.org.\nfederationFederation means that separate instances of a service communicate - the best example of this is email servers, in which it's possible to send mail between difference service providers. For Matrix, this means that data about rooms and message history is shared between servers of participating users.\nSIPSession Initiation Protocol is a communications protocol for signaling and controlling multimedia communication sessions in applications of Internet telephony for voice and video calls.\nXMPPXMPP is a communication protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML. We think of Matrix and XMPP as being quite different; at its core Matrix can be thought of as an eventually consistent global JSON database, whilst XMPP can be thought of as a message passing protocol.\nRCSRich Communication Services is a communication protocol between mobile-telephone carriers and between phone and carrier, aiming at replacing SMS messages with a text-message system that is richer, provides phonebook polling (for service discovery), and transmit in-call multimedia.\nbridgingBridging to Matrix means that it's possible to read and write to channels hosted outside matrix. For example, it's possible to speak in IRC and slack rooms.\nElementElement is a popular matrix client developed by the core matrix.org team. It's available as a web app, on Android and on iOS.\nclient SDKA client SDK makes it easier to develop client applications using matrix. See: How do I Matrix-enable my existing app?\nMXIDMatrix user IDs (MXID) are unique user IDs. They are in the format @username:homeserver.tld.\n3PIDThird-party IDs (3PIDs) are IDs from other systems or contexts, such as email addresses, social network accounts and phone numbers.\nthe specThe Matrix Specification describes the interactions between actors in the Matrix ecosystem, including Server-Server and Client-Server. You can see the spec here.\nsigilSigils refer the symbols uses at the beginning of many matrix identifiers. For example '@' is used for users, '#' for rooms, and '+' for communities.\ncommunityCommunities are collections of rooms. They have been replaced by spaces.\ngroupGroups are now known as communities, they are collections of rooms. They have been replaced by spaces.\nspaceSpaces are collections of rooms as rooms. They replace communites and groups.\nroomA room is a fundamental building bock of the matrix architecture: events are typically sent in the context of a room. A room is a conceptual place where users can send and receive events. Events are sent to a room, and all participants in that room with sufficient access will receive the event. See more detail.\nbotA bot is an autonomous agent. In the context of matrix, it means software which is able to make automated posts in rooms.\npubsubThe publish-subscribe pattern describes an architecture in which message senders push messages to a location, without needing to know who the subscribers will be. For Matrix, this means a client can send a message to a room without knowing the members, and the members can read that message.\nPostgresWhile Synapse can be installed using Sqlite, Postgres is preferred for any significant use.\n\n","id":"/docs/legacy/faq/","title":"FAQ"},"/docs/legacy/free-small-matrix-server/":{"body":"Canonical version of this article at\nhttps://gitlab.com/ptman/matrix-docs/tree/master/free-matrix-server\nIngredients:\n\nDomain\nServer\nSoftware\nConfiguration\n\nFree domain name\nGet one from Freenom or DuckDNS for free or any other place you wish.\nFreenom can be tricky to renew for free after the first year.

Users are\nable to participate in rooms that were created on any Matrix server since\neach server federates with other Matrix servers. This means you can talk to\nanyone on any server. It also means you can host your own server, giving you\ncontrol over all of your data.

Go to app.element.io to get started - this will\nallow you to sign up for a new account on Matrix.org, and get chatting right\naway. There are also native Element apps for Android and iOS.\nDon’t like web based clients? Not a problem!

Because Matrix provides robust,\npublicly-audited end-to-end encryption, we can be confident when we share a\nlocation, that the message we are sending is only going to be readable for\nthe people in the room.\nIn addition to the messages we are sending, though, we need to consider other\nways our information might leak out.  In particular, when we are drawing maps\non the screen, we need to talk to an additional server to fetch the map\ninformation, and the sections of map we are looking for (known as 'tiles')\ncan reveal our approximate location if they get into the wrong hands.\nElement is funding the hosting of a tile server that will be used by default\nby the Element clients, and will not share information with your homeserver,\nmeaning that there is separation between the people who see which tiles are\nbeing requested, and the people who have access to metadata like the pattern\nof your Matrix activity.\nBut Matrix is all about giving you control over your own information and\ninfrastructure, so here is a guide that will help you enjoy fully-featured\nlocation sharing in the Element client, while ensuring that all the tile\nrequests go to servers that you control.\nWe will describe how to run\nOSM tile server stack,\nand how to add the config Element needs to use it to display maps.\nNot production ready\nNote: this is not a guide on how to host a robust, production-ready map tile\nserver for many users. To do that you will need serious hardware, and further\nresearch on how to provide high availability, monitoring and everything else\nyou will need in your own hosting environment.\nThis guide should give you the information you need to run a tile server\nlocally, so you can begin learning what you need to bring one up in production.\n(For a little more of what you will need for production-readiness, see\nSelf-Host a Matrix Map Server,\nwhich includes some ansible scripts and hardware requirements.)\nPrerequisites\nThis guide is built on Docker, so you\nwill need an environment that supports Docker, or a compatible container\nengine.\nThe setup below was tested on a modern (2022) laptop running Ubuntu Linux\n21.10, but should run fine on any Docker-compatible Linux, and maybe even\nelsewhere. For production use by large numbers of users, you will need very\npowerful machines, and lots of bandwidth.\nAll the map information we use below is freely available under open licenses\nfrom OpenStreetMap and\nGeofabrik, and we think what we recommend\ncomplies with their terms of use - please let us know if not!\nRunning the tile server\nThe OSM tile server stack\nis a map tile server that provides tiles via HTTP, and provides a simple web UI\nto browse the map data:\n\nDownload the raw data\nIn order to run a tile server, we need some map data, that we will then process\nand provide as map tiles.  (Tiles are images of a particular area of the map,\nwhereas the raw data contains the exact locations of roads, buildings etc.)\nYou can download map data (PBF files) from\ndownload.geofabrik.de.  For example, to\ndownload data for the UK, run this command:\nwget 'https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/great-britain-latest.osm.pbf'\n\nImport it\nOnce we have the data, we need to import it into the tile server. Run these\ncommands:\n(Change \"great-britain\" to match what you downloaded.)\ndocker volume create openstreetmap-data\ndocker volume create openstreetmap-rendered-tiles\ndocker run \\\n    -v $PWD/great-britain-latest.osm.pbf:/data.osm.pbf \\\n    -v openstreetmap-data:/var/lib/postgresql/12/main \\\n    -v openstreetmap-rendered-tiles:/var/lib/mod_tile \\\n    -e THREADS=24 \\\n    overv/openstreetmap-tile-server:1.3.10 \\\n    import\n\nThis expects the downloaded PFB file to be in the current directory, and saves\nthe imported data into the two docker volumes created by the first two\ncommands.\nThe import process may take quite a while. On a reasonably powerful 2022 laptop\nthe UK data took 39 minutes to import.\nIf you are running your tile server as a service, you will probably want to\nautomate the process of downloading new data and importing it. Updating should\ninvolve re-running the download command from \"Download the raw data\", then\nre-running the import command above.\nRun the tile server\nOnce the data has been imported, you can run your server like this:\ndocker run \\\n    -p 8080:80 \\\n    -v openstreetmap-data:/var/lib/postgresql/12/main \\\n    -v openstreetmap-rendered-tiles:/var/lib/mod_tile \\\n    -e THREADS=24 \\\n    -e ALLOW_CORS=enabled \\\n    -d overv/openstreetmap-tile-server:1.3.10 \\\n    run\n\nThis should launch the docker container in the background, which you can check\nwith docker ps.\nTest it\nOnce the server is running, you can grab a single file by going to\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8080/tile/0/0/0.png,\nor interact with the web UI at\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8080.\nWhen you first start the service, it will take a lot of CPU and be quite\nunresponsive, but after a few minutes it should perform reasonably smoothly.\nProviding the JSON file the client needs\nOnce the tile server is running, we need to provide the config so that Element\n(and any similar clients) can use it.\nElement uses the MapLibre GL library to render maps,\nand MapLibre requires a style file that describes how to find map tiles.\nHere's how it looks:\n\nThe style file is quite simple. To describe a tile server on this machine,\nwe need to create a file style.json like this:\n{\n  \"version\": 8,\n  \"sources\": {\n    \"localsource\": {\n      \"type\": \"raster\",\n      \"tiles\": [\n        \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/tile/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\"\n      ],\n      \"tileSize\": 256,\n      \"attribution\": \"Maps Copyright 2022 &amp;lt;a href=\\\"http://www.geofabrik.de/\\\"&amp;gt;Geofabrik GmbH&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=\\\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\\\"&amp;gt;OpenStreetMap Contributors&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"layers\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"locallayer\",\n      \"source\": \"localsource\",\n      \"type\": \"raster\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWe need this file to be served up by the tile server, but that is easily done\nby slightly modifying the command we use to run it.\nFirst stop your tile server.  Use docker ps to find the CONTAINER ID of your\ntile server, then use docker kill &lt;CID&gt; (substituting in the CONTAINER ID\ninstead of &lt;CID&gt;) to stop it.\nNow re-launch the tile server, asking it to serve up our style file as well:\ndocker run \\\n    -p 8080:80 \\\n    -v $PWD/style.json:/var/www/html/style.json \\\n    -v openstreetmap-data:/var/lib/postgresql/12/main \\\n    -v openstreetmap-rendered-tiles:/var/lib/mod_tile \\\n    -e THREADS=24 \\\n    -e ALLOW_CORS=enabled \\\n    -d overv/openstreetmap-tile-server:1.3.10 \\\n    run\n\n(Notice the extra line mentioning style.json.  This assumes style.json is\nin the current directory.)\nNow if I edit the config of my Element client to point to that style file,\nit will use our tile server to display its maps.\nIf you are self-hosting Element Web, you can add this to the top level of its\nconfig.json file:\n{\n   ... other config ...\n   \"map_style_url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/style.json\",\n   ... other config ...\n}\n\nAlso, if you run a home server, the Element client will prefer a tile server\nyou specify in your .well-known area over its own config setting.  You should\nserve up a file from your server root called /.well-known/matrix/client\ncontaining information like this:\n{\n  ... other info ...\n  \"m.tile_server\": {\n    \"map_style_url\": \"http://mytileserver.example.com/style.json\"\n  }\n  ... other info ...\n}\n\nOnce you have one of those settings in place, your Element client should use\nyour very own tile server every time it displays a map!\nFurther reading and acknowledgements\njulian posted an excellent guide building on this one, which includes ansible\nscripts and some comments on the hardware needed:\n\nSelf-Host a Matrix Map Server\n\nThis guide was constructed by reading the following links.

If you'd prefer to use TypeScript, then do!\nSetup\nLet's make a new folder, and import our only npm dependency. The following\nexamples are all meant to be run in a bash terminal.\nmkdir matrix-js-echo-bot\ncd matrix-js-echo-bot\nnpm install matrix-bot-sdk\n\nCreate a new file named \"index.js\", and let's get started.\nInstantiation\nIn our js file, start by importing the minimum we'll need for this example:\nconst sdk = require(\"matrix-bot-sdk\");\nconst MatrixClient = sdk.MatrixClient;\nconst SimpleFsStorageProvider = sdk.SimpleFsStorageProvider;\nconst AutojoinRoomsMixin = sdk.AutojoinRoomsMixin;\n\nCreate a new account for your bot on a homeserver, then get the access_token.\nThe simplest way to do this is using Element, take a look at these\ninstructions. Set some variables to\nstore the homeserver and access_token. This is all the authentication you\nneed!\nconst homeserverUrl = \"https://matrix.org\"; // make sure to update this with your url\nconst accessToken = \"YourSecretAccessToken\";\n\nNow we'll configure a storage provider - matrix-bot-sdk provides the\nSimpleFsStorageProvider, which is ideal for most cases:\nconst storage = new SimpleFsStorageProvider(\"bot.json\");\n\nWhen the bot starts, the SDK will create a a new file called \"bot.json\" to store\nthe data it needs.\nFinally we're ready to start the client! As you'd expect, we'll use the\nvariables we've already specified.\nconst client = new MatrixClient(homeserverUrl, accessToken, storage);\n\nThere is one more thing we need to do. We'll include a mixin which instructs the\nbot to auto-accept any room invite it receives. This makes testing much more\nconvenient.\nAutojoinRoomsMixin.setupOnClient(client);\n\nFinally, let's start the Client:\nclient.start().then(() =&gt; console.log(\"Client started!\"));\n\nIf you're keeping up, your code should look something like:\nimport {\n    MatrixClient,\n    SimpleFsStorageProvider,\n    AutojoinRoomsMixin\n} from \"matrix-bot-sdk\";\n\nconst homeserverUrl = \"https://matrix.org\"; // make sure to update this with your url\nconst accessToken = \"YourSecretAccessToken\";\nconst storage = new SimpleFsStorageProvider(\"bot.json\");\n\nconst client = new MatrixClient(homeserverUrl, accessToken, storage);\nAutojoinRoomsMixin.setupOnClient(client);\n\nclient.start().then(() =&gt; console.log(\"Client started!\"));\n\nLet's run it:\nnode index.js\n\nThis should now join and sit idle, but join any room you invite the bot to.\n/sync loop\nRight now, while it's just listening to invites and nothing else, what is the\nbot actually doing? It's calling the /sync endpoint in a loop. Calling this\nendpoint returns all new events since some previous point.\nLeave the script running and open bot.json, which is the file we specified for\nstorage. This file contains a field syncToken, which is being occasionally\nupdated - the SDK uses this field to give a token to the homeserver, which uses\nit to know which events to send back.\nReceiving and Sending events\nIn order to echo messages, our bot must first be able to read them. The\nclient.on() method of our MatrixClient takes two arguments: one for the event\ntype, one for a callback to handle the event:\nclient.on(\"room.message\", (roomId, event) =&gt; {\n    if (! event[\"content\"]) return;\n    const sender = event[\"sender\"];\n    const body = event[\"content\"][\"body\"];\n    console.log(`${roomId}: ${sender} says '${body}`);\n});\n\nIn this way we can inspect an the contents of an event and render them. We\nchoose to exit early in the case that event[\"content\"] is empty because this\nwill usually mean the message was redacted.\nTo send a message, we use the client.sendMessage() method. This takes two\narguments: the roomId, and a JSON object containing the contents of the message\nto send, for example:\nclient.sendMessage(roomId, {\n    \"msgtype\": \"m.text\",\n    \"body\": \"This is message text.\",\n});\n\nNote, it's also possible to use client.sendText() to achieve the same result,\nas in\nclient.sendText(roomId, \"This is message text.\")\n\nThe reason for showing client.sendMessage() is to make it clear that the\nmessage format is just the same as you'd find in the spec\n.\nImplementing echobot functionality\nTo work, an echobot needs only to listen for incoming messages, read the message\ntext, and use it to reply. Let's demonstrate that now.\n\nRead the message as in the example above\nInspect the body text, if it starts with \"!echo\", send back the remaining\ntext\nStrip out the \"!echo\" tag\nSend a message containing the result\n\nclient.on(\"room.message\", (roomId, event) =&gt; {\n    if (! event[\"content\"]) return;\n    const sender = event[\"sender\"];\n    const body = event[\"content\"][\"body\"];\n    console.log(`${roomId}: ${sender} says '${body}`);\n\n    if (body.startsWith(\"!echo\")) {\n        const replyText = body.substring(\"!echo\".length).trim();\n        client.sendMessage(roomId, {\n            \"msgtype\": \"m.notice\",\n            \"body\": replyText,\n        });\n    }\n});\n\nConclusion\nIt's extremely simple to listen to messages with matrix-bot-sdk create an\nechobot! There are many more features, you can see the MatrixClient class is\nvery well documented\n.\nNext in this series, we'll explore Rich Replies, and take a look at the kick\nand ban functions for room administration.\nPS, use TypeScript\nThis SDK uses TypeScript, which provides a lot of benefits. In this example, we\nused JavaScript, but it's just as easy to use TypeScript and maybe preferable,\nsince it is the language matrix-bot-sdk is written in.\nFirst let's install tsc, which compiles from TypeScript to JavaScript:\nnpm install typescript\n\nNow, start tsc in watch-mode (-w), and leave it to compile our code:\nnpx tsc --watch *.ts\n\nNow, whenever we create a new TypeScript (.ts) file, it will be automatically\nwatched and compiled to JavaScript.\nWhen you have your .js file(s), you can run them with node &lt;filename&gt; as\nnormal.\n","id":"/docs/legacy/matrix-bot-sdk-intro/","title":"Usage of matrix-bot-sdk"},"/docs/legacy/matrix-bot-sdk-room-admin-features/":{"body":"Intro\nmatrix-bot-sdk has features which enable bots to perform administration of\nMatrix roooms - tasks like kicking, banning and inviting users. Of course, the\nbot must have the appropriate permissions for the room in order for this to\nwork.\nYou should read Usage of matrix-bot-sdk for a more fundamental introduction to\nthe SDK.\nKicking\nKicking a user means that user is removed from the room by force, but is not\nbanned - so they are able to re-join.\nOnce you have your client object running (see\nusage-of-matrix-bot-sdk#instantiation\n), you\ncan use the kickUser() method. There are three parameters:\n\nthe user ID (MXID) you want to kick\nthe room ID they will be removed from\n(optional) a string explaining why they were kicked\n\nvar userId = \"@theirmxid:theirserver.tld\";\nvar roomId = \"!theroomid:servername.tld\";\nvar message = \"Get out!\";\nclient.kickUser(userId, roomId, message);\n\nBanning\nBanning means the user is kicked from a room and unable to re-enter. The method\nis very similar to Kicking in that it has three parameters:\n\nthe user ID (MXID) you want to ban\nthe room ID they will be removed and banned from\n(optional) a string explaining why they were banned\n\nvar userId = \"@theirmxid:theirserver.tld\";\nvar roomId = \"!theroomid:servername.tld\";\nvar message = \"Get out, and don't come back!\";\nclient.banUser(userId, roomId, message);\n\nInviting\nInviting a user to join a room - much friendlier than kicking or banning them!\nInviting a user needs only two parameters:\n\nthe userId to invite\nthe roomId you're inviting them to join\n\nvar userId = \"@theirmxid:theirserver.tld\";\nvar roomId = \"!theroomid:servername.tld\";\nclient.inviteUser(userId, roomId);\n\nReading the members list\nHow about if we want to know who is currently in (joined to) a room? We can use\nthe getJoinedRoomMembers() method, which takes only a roomId as a param. To\nget a result from this method, we should await it:\nvar roomId = \"!theroomid:servername.tld\";\nconst members = await client.getJoinedRoomMembers(roomId);\n\nmembers will now contain an array of strings we can inspect.\nResponding to a keyword\nIn usage-of-matrix-bot-sdk#implementing-echobot-functionality\n,\nwe showed how it's possible to read the content of messages and respond to\nthem. To reiterate:\nclient.on(\"room.message\", (roomId, event) =&gt; {\n    if (! event[\"content\"]) return;\n    const body = event[\"content\"][\"body\"];\n\n    if (body &amp;&amp; body.indexOf(\"keyword\") !== -1) {\n        client.sendMessage(roomId, {\n            \"msgtype\": \"m.text\",\n            \"body\": \"response to keyword\",\n        });\n    }\n});\n\nHere we read the contents of a message, check for the presence of the\nstring \"keyword\". If we find that string, we send a response to that message.\n\nNote the very subtle bug/issue with this snippet as written: Since the\ncallback doesn't check the sender, and it sends the string \"keyword\" in the\nreply, this would actually respond to itself forever!\n\nReacting to a keyword with a kick\nNow that we've seen kicks, and we've seen reading a message to decide how to\nrespond, we can make a (very crude) automoderator:\nclient.on(\"room.message\", (roomId, event) =&gt; {\n    if (! event[\"content\"]) return;\n    const body = event[\"content\"][\"body\"];\n\n    if (body &amp;&amp; body.indexOf(\"keyword\") !== -1) {\n        client.kickUser(event[\"sender\"], roomId, \"no!\")\n    }\n});\n\nIt's as simple as taking the event[\"sender\"] field, and passing it to\nkickUser(). Now, any time anyone says \"keyword\", they'll be kicked.\nUsing promises to know if a request succeeded\nmatrix-bot-sdk is promise-based, so you can chain .then() and .catch () methods to your Matrix calls to respond after they return:\nclient.kickUser(userId, roomId, \"no!\")\n    .then(() =&gt; {\n        client.sendMessage(roomId, {\n            \"msgtype\": \"m.text\",\n            \"body\": `please don't say that in here`\n        });\n    });\n\nPutting it all together absurdly\nI was inspired by this bash.org Quote, in which a\nuser baits two bots:\n\none bot is baited into saying a forbidden keyword\nand is immediately banned by an overzealous automoderator\n\nI created a series of bots to endlessly recreate the scene in Matrix:\n\nreplies with a specific string when asked\nchecks for the presence of (1), requests the string when it sees them\nkicks anyone who says a word that happens to be included in (1)'s string\ninvites (1) when they are seen to be absent\n\nThis uses several concepts from this guide to create an endless silly scene.\n\nYou can find the code for this strange project here\n.\nConclusion\nmatrix-bot-sdk can do a great deal when it comes to room administration.

In this way, matrix-enact is effectively a\nsimple, read-only Matrix client. Let's see how it was built.\nThis article will introduce two important concepts in Matrix, specifically in\nthe Matrix Client-Server API:\n\nguest access\nthe /context endpoint, which gets messages before and after a given event\n\nNot using the matrix-js-sdk\nAlthough written in JavaScript (and Reactjs), this project does not use the\nmatrix-js-sdk, it makes direct HTTP calls to the Matrix Client-Server API.\nBecause there are only three endpoints we need to hit, we can keep the project\nvery light by not including an SDK.\nGet Guest access_token\nMatrix allows for guest access\n by\nproviding an interface to register a new guest user and be immediately given an\naccess token. To do this we call the /register endpoint with a query param\nkind set to guest. In matrix-enact, this looks like:\nimport axios from 'axios';\nvar url = \"https://matrix.org/_matrix/client/r0/register?kind=guest\";\nconst res = await axios.post(url, {});\nconst { data } = await res;\n// data.access_token will contain the access token, we must store it\n\nOnce we have the access token, we use it in the same way as if logged in with a\nnormal user.\nTranslate a Room Alias to a Room ID\nIn the UI, the user can enter either a room alias or a room ID. Whichever they\nenter, to get message content from a room we need the ID. This means we need to\ndetect if an alias has been entered, and if so get the correct room ID for that\nalias:\n// we know that if the first character is a '#', we have an alias not an id\nif (this.state.roomEntry[0] === \"#\") {\n    var getIdUrl = \"https://matrix.org/_matrix/client/r0/directory/room/\";\n    getIdUrl += encodeURIComponent(this.state.roomEntry);\n    const res = await axios.get(getIdUrl);\n    const { data } = await res;\n    // data.room_id contains the room id for the alias\n}\n\n/context endpoint\nWe use the /context endpoint to get chronological history of a room timeline.\nLooking at this section of the Client-Server API we see:\n\nThis API returns a number of events that happened just before and after the\nspecified event. This allows clients to get the context surrounding an\nevent.\n\nTo get messages from this endpoint we need to provide a room id and the event id\nwe want context for. Check out the comments in the code below to follow along.\nasync loadScriptFromEventId(startEventId) {\n    // first we construct the url as per the CS API\n    const url = `https://matrix.org/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/${encodeURIComponent(roomId)}/context/${encodeURIComponent(startEventId)}?limit=100&amp;access_token=${this.state.accessToken}`;\n\n    axios.get(url).then(res =&gt; {\n        // make an array to store the events from the response\n        var newEvents = [];\n\n        // we only want the events that follow our start events\n        newEvents = newEvents.concat(res.data.events_after);\n\n        // and we only want events that contain a body field, i.e. that are messages\n        newEvents = newEvents.filter(e =&gt; e.content.body);\n\n        // finally, since we're using React for this app,\n        // we store these messages in the state object\n        this.setState({events: this.state.events.concat(newEvents)});\n    });\n}\n\nLoop until we have enough messages\nNotice the previous URL we hit when calling /context. We specified a limit\nvalue of 100. In fact, 100 is usually the limit enforced by the homeserver.\nThis limit refers to the number of events, not the number of messages -\nremember that we are filtering them in the code above.\nIf we say that we want our script to be 50 lines long, but after filtering we\nare left with only 30 messages, what should we do? Get more events after the\nlatest one, and append the new events to our script. Knowing that we have taken\na value from the form to be stored in state.messageCount, and in the previous\nsection we inserted message events into state.events, we can compare these\ntwo variables, and if needed, call loadScriptFromEventId() again with the\nlast known event.\nif (this.state.messageCount &gt; this.state.events.length) {\n    // get last known event\n    var lastEvent = res.data.events_after[res.data.events_after.length - 1];\n    this.loadScriptFromEventId(lastEvent.event_id);\n} else {\n    this.setState({events: this.state.events.slice(0, this.state.messageCount), statusMessage: \"Done\"});\n}\n\nUsing the Web Audio API\nThe Web Audio API is a massive topic, out of the scope of this article. We'll\ncover just enough to be able to show the \"happy path\" of performing\nText-to-Speech (TTS) sequentially.\nTo deliver a line as audio, the fundamental code is as follows:\nvar utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance();\nutterance.text = \"some string\";\nvar someVoice = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()[0];\nutterance.voice = someVoice;\nwindow.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);\n\nTo find out when an utterance ends, attach a function to the onend event:\nutterance.onend = function() {\n    // do something when the line ends\n};\n\nKnowing that we can perform TTS on strings we provide, and that we can call a\nfunction when a line ends, from here it's easy to see how we can use the list\nof messages to \"enact\" the message history.\nUsing the Web Audio API with React\nWe will:\n\nassign each user a random voice from TTS voices available in the current\nbrowser\ntrigger each line sequentially and with the correct voice, thus giving the\nimpression of a script being performed\n\nLet's create a nextLine() function in our App component, and use this to\ninsert lines associated with \"Parts\", meaning that each part is a separate user\nwith an assigned voice.\nnextLine() {\n    var line = this.state.line;\n    if (! this.state.events[line]) return;\n    var newPart = this.state.events[line].sender;\n    if (! this.state.parts.find(p =&gt;{return p.name === newPart;})) {\n        this.setState({\n        parts: this.state.parts.concat([{\n            name: newPart,\n            voice: voices[getRandomInt(0, voices.length)]\n        }])\n        })\n    }\n    this.setState({\n        script: this.state.script.concat(this.state.events[line]),\n        line: this.state.line + 1,\n        nextText: \"Continue\"\n    });\n}\n\nBy incrementing the line counter, we progress through the script, adding a\nline at a time to the correct Part.\nDuring rendering, the App renders an array of Part Components, which in turn\nrender an array of lines, filtered for that particular Part:\nconst lines = this.props.script.map((line, lineNumber) =&gt; {\n    line.lineNumber = lineNumber;\n    return line; \n}).filter(l =&gt; l.sender === part.name);\n\nKnowing that in React, the constructor for a Component is called only once, we\nperform the TTS process itself inside the constructor method:\nclass Line extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    var utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance();\n    var nextLine = this.props.nextLine;\n    utterance.text = this.props.lineText;\n    utterance.voice = this.props.part.voice;\n    synth.speak(utterance);\n  }\n}\n\nFinally, we'll use what we already learned about the onend event to insert the\nnext line:\nclass Line extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    var utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance();\n    var nextLine = this.props.nextLine;\n    utterance.onend = function(a) {\n      nextLine();\n    };\n    utterance.text = this.props.lineText;\n    utterance.voice = this.props.part.voice;\n    synth.speak(utterance);\n  }\n}\n\nIn this way, nextLine() is called in a loop, meaning that the lines are added to\nReact sequentially, and spoken aloud as they are added.\nConclusion\nThis article covered a lot of ground:\n\nMatrix Guess access\nthe /context/ API endpoint\nfiltering content from Matrix events\npassing these strings to the Web Audio API\n\nTo learn more about Matrix development, check out the\nMatrix Documentation.\n","id":"/docs/legacy/matrix-enact/","title":"Creating a simple read-only Matrix client"},"/docs/legacy/moderation/":{"body":"Introduction\nMatrix is an open protocol and network for decentralised communication, where\nusers can participate in public and private chat rooms through servers\n(‘homeservers’) and clients of their choice, similar to email.  The goal is to\nprovide a free and open global network for interoperable e2e-encrypted\ncommunication, without sacrificing usability, and so liberate users from being\ntrapped in the proprietary communication silos which have become commonplace\ntoday.\nA large open communication network (much like email or the web itself) comes\nwith an interesting set of challenges around moderation. For Matrix, this boils\ndown to:\n\nensuring that moderators of chatrooms have the necessary tools to enforce\nwhatever code of conduct they require\nensuring that server administrators can enforce terms of service on how their\nservers are used\nensuring that users themselves are empowered to filter out content they do not\nwish to see.\n\nWe consider effective content management to be the single biggest remaining risk\nto the long-term success of Matrix as a project, and we’re investing as much\ntime as we can into building out and improving our moderation &amp; reputation\ntools.  We would like to focus on this even more, and are currently looking for\ndedicated funding to achieve this - please email us at funding-at-matrix.org if\nyou have the interest and resources to sponsor this work.\nModerating rooms\nRedactions (aka Removing messages)\nThe first line of defence when moderating a room is the ability to remove\nundesirable content as a moderator.  Matrix implements the concept of\nredactions (called ‘remove message’ in Element’s UI), which allows a moderator\nto send a ‘redaction event’ to a room which requests all the participating\nservers to remove the human-readable information about a given message.  Users\ncan also redact their own messages from a room.  Redactions may be applied both\nto normal room messages as well as to remove the human-visible aspects of state\nevents (e.g. offensive display names, avatars, etc).\nRedactions are a best-effort system - there is no way to force other servers or\nclients to actually uphold them, and indeed if a room is bridged to a system\nwhich doesn’t support them (e.g. IRC) then the messages will inevitably remain\nvisible.\nIt is common for servers not to immediately delete redacted messages from their\ndatabase - this is a deliberate moderation feature, letting server admins\nhandle redaction-abuse (e.g. users sending and then immediately redacting\nobnoxious messages) by checking their databases if needed.\nIf you're using Element, clicking on a user to bring up more information about\nthem will show a 'remove recent messages' button (shown below) which allows you\nto redact the user's events. It'll only get the events that Element has\ndownloaded and cached, but can help when a room is being spammed by a bad\nactor.\n\nManaging abusive display names, avatars etc\nAs well as being able to redact abusive content, moderators can also\noverride ‘state events’ such as room names, topics, etc.  This is generally\njust a matter of using Room Settings to update the necessary data.  In future\nwe will also support the special case of overriding profile changes - however,\noverriding another user’s profile is considered bad etiquette (even as a\nmoderator) - it is better to redact.\nPower levels\nThe next line of defence when moderating a room is the concept of ‘power\nlevels’. Every user in a room has a power level - a number generally between 0\nand 100.  The higher the number the more power the user has that room.  By\ndefault, the creator of the room gets the highest power level of 100\n(typically called ‘Admin’), and newly joined users get a power level of 0.  You\ncan change the power level of less powerful users than yourself - for instance,\nan Admin (with power 100) could promote a normal user to a power level of 50\n(typically called ‘Moderator’).  You cannot give users a higher power level\nthan your own.  You can demote yourself, but be aware that this is irreversible\nunless there are other users in the room with high enough power to subsequently\nre-promote you.\nIn Element, Admins are shown in the membership list with a golden shield, and\nModerators are shown with a silver shield.  Other clients use similar\nmetaphors.\n\n\nTo change the power level of a given user in Element, you can use the dropdown\nin their user info panel, having selected them from the membership list or\ntimeline.  Alternatively you can change their level directly from the message\ncomposer by typing /op @username:domain 50 or similar.\nPower levels are used to define who has permission to do what actions in a room.\nBy default, the power levels for a public chatroom are as shown below:\n\nUsers with sufficient power to change settings (i.e. Moderator, by default) can\nedit the power level configuration for a given room in Element via Room\nSettings using this interface.\nFor instance, if you wanted to stop normal users from being able to talk in a\nroom, a moderator or admin could change the “Send messages” power level for\nthat room from 0 to 50.  This would mean that only moderators and higher can\nspeak.  Alternatively, if you wanted to mute a particular user in a room\nwithout changing any of the settings, you might set them to a negative power\nlevel, so they didn’t even meet the “Send messages” threshold of 0.\nFor the full spec of power levels, please see:\nhttps://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest.html#m-room-power-levels\n.\nIf you’re wondering where the term comes from, you should watch more anime\n...\nKicking and banning users\nThe next line of defence in policing your rooms is the ability to remove users.\nBy default, moderators with power level 50 or higher have permission to remove\nusers with lower power from rooms.  You can either kick or ban, specifying an\noptional reason which should be visible in the room’s timeline:\n\nThis can be done via the Kick or Ban buttons from the user info panel, or by\ntyping /kick @user:domain.com &lt;reason goes here&gt; or /ban @user:domain.com &lt;reason goes here&gt; in the message composer.\nThe act of kicking a user temporarily removes them from the room.  If the room\nis publicly joinable, the user can immediately rejoin it.  If the room is\ninvite-only, the user will need to be re-invited to join.\nThe act of banning a user stops them from joining a room until the ban is\nremoved.  Banning automatically kicks the user from the room (unlike IRC).\nUnlike other systems, bans are enforced purely on the basis of a user’s matrix\nID rather than by IP address or other parameters.  This is a deliberate choice,\nfor several reasons:\n\nWe cannot reliably determine IP addresses of users on other servers, given\nother servers cannot be trusted to report such information accurately.\nWe want to protect users’ privacy, and do not want to expose IP addresses to\nroom admins/mods elsewhere in Matrix, even if we could do so reliably.\nMatrix IDs are permanent long-lived IDs, similar to an email address, and\ncannot be spoofed (unlike IRC nicks or similar).  If a user is banned, they\nhave to register a whole new account to circumvent it, typically passing\nthrough a CAPTCHA, generally mitigating bot flooding attacks.\nTypical Matrix users have many clients on many different IPs, to the point\nthat IP bans would be ineffectual at best.\n\nWe don’t currently support banning based on patterns of matrix IDs.  This is\nbecause we want to keep the logic for enforcing bans to be as simple and\nbug-free as possible (as it is on the critical path of the room state\nresolution algorithm), and because in general matrix IDs do not follow any\nspecific pattern.  This may be reviewed in future.\nThere isn’t currently a way of bulk-banning or bulk-kicking users from within\nElement, although one can use a simple script to do so. [TODO: release our\nbulk-banning script.]\nBanning servers from rooms (Server ACLs)\nThe next line of defense in moderating a room is stopping unwanted servers from\nparticipating.  This is done by setting a ‘server ACL’ (access control list) on\na room.  It’s important to understand that despite the name, server ACLs block\na server from participating in a room - rather than blocking them from\ninteracting in general with a server\nThe typical reason to exclude a server from a room is if it is a source of\nmalicious traffic - e.g. if it does not enforce a CAPTCHA on account\nregistration, thus easily allowing bots or users to register and circumvent\nroom bans or flood traffic, or if the server is behaving in a buggy or\nmalicious manner (e.g. being a source of bots or spam itself).  One might also\nwant to ban servers whose terms of service are incompatible with the code of\nconduct of your rooms from participating in your rooms.  Finally, server ACLs\nonly work if all the servers in the room uphold the ACL, otherwise old or buggy\nservers will leak traffic on behalf of the ACLed server into the room.\nTherefore if you use server ACLs in a room, you have to also ban any servers\nwhich empirically do not uphold the ACL.  [TODO: release our server-ACL\nenforcing scripts]\nSetting server ACLs on a room is a relative rare operation, and Element does not\ncurrently provide a user interface for doing so.  Instead, these can be set\neither by script or by manually creating a server ACL state event via\nElement/Web’s developer tools UI.  You must be at least a moderator(by default)\nto set server ACLs.  To set via devtools, type /devtools at the message\ncomposer in the room in question, and create or edit the room’s\nm.room.server_acl state event.  (Click on the red ‘message event’ button to\ntoggle to state event mode).  To ban servers named evil.com and *.evil.com from\nparticipating in the room, you would enter:\n\nIf enforcing server ACLs on a room, it is wise to prevent servers whose names\nare numeric IP addresses from participating in the room, as well as preventing\nall subdomains of the problematic server from participating.  This ensures that\na malicious admin cannot create a new server on a numeric IP or a subdomain in\norder to circumvent the ban, and will instead have to source an alternative top\nlevel domain.\nServer ACLs can also be used to restrict the set of servers which are allowed to\nparticipate in a room (e.g. if a sensitive conversation must be restricted from\never leaving a given set of servers, as might happen if someone accidentally\ninvited a remote user to it).\nFor further detailed info about server ACLs, see\nhttps://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest.html#server-access-control-lists-acls-for-rooms\nA note on state resets\nIn room version 1, a bug existed which caused room state(e.g. membership, power\nlevels, bans/kick data) to intermittently be reset to a historical value due to\na bad merge conflict resolution - a so-called\n'state reset', or the 'hotel california bug'. This was improved in room version\n2 onwards and room state should no longer diverge. However, many old rooms\nstill use the original buggy v1 algorithm. It is possible to upgrade the room\nversion in Element via the undocumented /upgraderoom 6 command - but please\nnote there are severalUX bugs\n which make\nthis process a bit rough sometimes.\nBridged rooms\nModerating rooms which are bridged to other chat systems is a somewhat special\ncase, as it’s hard to accurately bridge all possible moderation semantics into\nMatrix, and different bridges have different levels of sophistication.  As a\ngeneral rule, bans are generally best applied on the native platform where the\ntarget exists.  For instance: when bridging a Matrix room with IRC, no effort\nis made to synchronise bans between the two platforms, given the entirely\ndifferent banning criteria.\nIf an IRC user is kicked from the Matrix side of the bridge, then if the kicking\nuser is a chanop on the IRC side, they will be kicked there also - and vice\nversa.  However, if the user is then banned on the Matrix side, it will just\nstop users with that IRC username from participating in the Matrix view of the\nroom, and does not result in a change of chanmode +b on the IRC side. However,\nif a Matrix user is banned from a room on the IRC side, then the bridge will\nstop the user from being able to re-join the Matrix room.\nPolicy servers\nIn the early days of Matrix we proposed the concept of ‘active application\nservers’, aka ‘policy servers’, which could be used for imposing arbitrary\npolicy decisions on a given room beyond the semantics given by power levels.\nThis would allow a central point of control to apply whatever logic it liked to\nwhat messages may be sent within a room.  In practice, this idea has not\nprogressed beyond the idea phase, especially as it undermines Matrix’s core\nprinciples of decentralisation, and does not play well with E2E encryption.\nHowever, such a system could be used in future if more exotic room moderation\nsemantics were required.\nOutstanding issues\n\nSupport for bulk redactions (looping over individual redactions is a viable workaround however)\nAbility for room moderators to delete content from the media repository when redacting the event which refers to it. (this can be improved in future)\nUI for setting server ACLs (https://github.com/vector-im/Element-web/issues/7084)\n\nModeration tooling\nLarger communities often have many rooms which need moderation, and generally\nhave a single set of rules or Code of Conduct for members to follow. This also\nmeans that a ban in one room is usually applied in all of the community's\nrooms. Mjolnir is a set of tools to\nhelp make this process easier for community moderators by subscribing to\nban lists (MSC2313) and\napplying the rules across the resources it is protecting. Currently the project\nis capable of protecting individual rooms through the Mjolnir bot and a whole\nhomeserver through its Synapse antispam module.\nEnforcing server terms of use\nThe previous sections cover off the tools a room admin has available to enforce\nthe code of conduct for a given room.  An entirely separate problem is\nempowering server admins to control how users use their server - particularly\nto comply with any legal or policy requirements their server might have.\nConsenting to Terms and Conditions\nFirstly, as a server administrator, you need to ensure your users know the terms\nof use they are bound by when using the server.  The server should provide\nterms of use which users must click-through on registration.  This is\nconfigured in Synapse via the user_content config options - see\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/consent_tracking.md\nfor details.\nWe publish the policy documents for use of the Matrix.org server at\nhttps://github.com/vector-im/policies/tree/master/docs/matrix-org - please\nfeel free to use these as the basis for your own server’s terms of use if\nneeded.\nRemoving users, rooms and content\nCurrently, administration of matrix servers is done by implementation-specific\nAPI, although we are working on providing a web GUI for administration as well\nas providing a standardised admin API as part of the Matrix spec.  The\ndocumentation of the API exposed by Synapse is:\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/master/docs/admin_api.\nThe most important admin features from a moderation perspective are deactivating\nabusive users from your server, removing abusive rooms, and removing abusive\ncontent.\nDeactivating users is done by calling the /deactivate API - see\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#deactivate-account\nfor details. An example is:\ncurl -X POST -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" \"https://matrix.org/_synapse/admin/v1/deactivate/$user\" --data '{}'\n\nIf you're using Element, when you go to view more information about a particular\nuser there will be a 'deactivate user' button (shown below) which does this for\nyou. Note that only users on your homeserver can be deactivated, provided you\nhave the admin permissions to do so.\n\nRemoving abusive rooms is done by calling the /shutdown_room API, e.g:\ncurl 'https://matrix.org/_synapse/admin/v1/shutdown_room/!roomid:matrix.org' \\\n-H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" -XPOST \\\n-d'{\"new_room_user_id\": \"@abuse:matrix.org\", \"message\": \"This room has been removed from the matrix.org homeserver due to violating the terms of use.\", \"room_name\": \"Room unavailable\"}'\n\nThis removes all local users from the room, routing them into a new room\n(called ‘Room unavailable’ in this example), repoints any local aliases to the\nnew room, and blacklists the server from participating in the original room\ngoing forwards. This is particularly useful if the room in question is spamming\ninvites at your users: blocking the room will stop the invites from getting\nthrough, and allow your users to reject the invite they had prior.\nRemoving abusive content en masse from a room is done by calling\nthe /admin/quarantine_media API, e.g.\ncurl 'https://matrix.org/_synapse/admin/v1/quarantine_media/!room_id:matrix.org' -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" -XPOST\n\nThis flags all content in the room as quarantined in the media repository and\nstops it being served to other clients or servers until the server admin can\ninvestigate and delete.\nBanning clients by IP\nWhile we deliberately do not expose client IP addresses to room admins, it is of\ncourse critical for server admins to be able to restrict access to their\nservers based on IP to handle abuse.\nSynapse exposes the history of a given user’s IP to the server admin via\nthe /admin/whois API, for instance:\ncurl 'https://matrix.org/_synapse/admin/v1/whois/@test:matrix.org' -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" | jq .\n{\n  \"user_id\": \"@test:matrix.org\",\n  \"devices\": {\n    \"\": {\n      \"sessions\": [\n        {\n          \"connections\": [\n            {\n              \"ip\": \"192.168.0.1\",\n              \"last_seen\": 1413627439458,\n              \"user_agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/600.1.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.1 Safari/537.85.10\"\n            },\n            ...\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSee\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/admin_api/user_admin_api.rst#query-account\nfor full details of this API.\nSynapse does not currently provide tools to block connections by IP - instead we\nsuggest this is done in the load balancer or firewall in order to drop the\nconnection as early as possible.\nBanning servers\nSynapse supports a module-like system which can be used to block servers from\ndoing certain actions, such as sending invites to your users.\nt2bot/synapse-simple-antispam\n is one example of how this\nworks - see the code for a bit more information on what is possible. Although\nthis won't prevent servers from interacting with your server, it can help with\nreducing the amount of spam/malicious content.\n“Defederating” your server from another server is currently done on a room by\nroom basis - either using server ACLs if you have control of the room in\nquestion, or by using the /shutdown_room API if you do not.\nIn future, this may be refined to let servers automatically\nimplement /shutdown_room semantics on any room which matches a given pattern\n(e.g. whose room admins are on a given server).\nModerating the room directory\nEach Matrix server maintains a publicly viewable directory of rooms.  By\ndefault, any user can publish rooms to the directory, which can be an abuse\nvector.\nThe server admin can limit which users are allowed to publish rooms to the\npublic room directory via the room_list_publication_rules config option in\nSynapse.\nThe server admin can moderate the directory by delisting rooms by calling\nthe /directory/list/room API with visibility: private (\nhttps://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#put-matrix-client-r0-directory-list-room-roomid).\nModerating room aliases\nRooms in Matrix are joined via an alias which resides on a given server -\ne.g. #matrix:matrix.org.  It is common for a room to have multiple aliases,\nwhich in turn may be spread across different servers.  For\ninstance, #matrix:matrix.org is also #matrixhq:tchncs.de and many others.\nBy default, any user can create room aliases, which can be an abuse vector -\nparticularly given the risk of alias squatting, or creating publishing abusive\naliases to point at existing rooms.\nThe server admin can limit which users are allowed to create room aliases via\nthe alias_creation_rules config option in Synapse.\nThe server admin can moderate the aliases that exist on their server by calling\nthe /directory/room API with DELETE: (\nhttps://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#delete-matrix-client-r0-directory-room-roomalias).\nElement/Web also exposes the ability to delete a room alias from the Room\nDirectory view as an easter egg for server administrators - shift-clicking on\nthe entry in the Room Directory will call the above API to remove the alias and\nthe room from the directory.\nOutstanding issues\n\nIn addition to the existing admin API, it would be good to have a server admin\nGUI for the various server admin functions above.\nAbility to block a server from federating to your server (as rooms are\nreplicated over all participating servers and do not have a single owner,\nthe criteria you would use to block rooms “from a server” en masse is not\nwell defined. One could be found if needed however.)\n\nHandling unwanted content as a user\nNo matter how great your room moderators and server admins happen to be, it is\ninevitable that in a massive open network like Matrix there will be content\nthat you as a user do not wish to see - whether it’s yet to be moderated, or\nbecause it’s irrelevant, or you personally find it objectionable, etc.\nModerators and server admins often depend on support from the wider community\nto identify issues that need to be addressed.\nReporting bad content\nWe provide two mechanisms today to let users report abusive content to their\nserver admin (i.e. content which is against the terms of use of their server).\nIn Element, this is the “Report Content” menu button, which calls the /report\nAPI (\nhttps://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest.html#module-report-content)\non the server to flag the message in question.\nAlternatively, server admins should advertise an abuse email address for\ngathering reports of abusive content (e.g. abuse-at-matrix.org is Matrix.org’s\nabuse contact address).\nBlocking users\nAnother vital tool is the ability to block users from contacting you.  Matrix\nsupports this through the ‘ignore’ feature\n(https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest.html#ignoring-users),\nwhich is available in the user info panel in Element/Web and equivalent on\nElement/Mobile.\nFiltering the room directory\nCurrently the room directory for a large server can contain a massive number of\nentirely unrelated rooms.  A common request is to provide tools to let the user\nfilter this list to only rooms they are interested in.  We are currently\nlooking into ways of doing this - options on the table include:\n\nRemoving the per-server room directories in favour of per-community room\ndirectories, and leaving the problem of discovering communities as separate\nto Matrix\nLetting users tag rooms when publishing them in the community, providing a\nblunt filtering mechanism (e.g. to filter out rooms by default which have\nexplicitly been tagged as NSFW)\nUsing decentralised reputation data to let the user decide which view of the\nroom directory to see (e.g. “show me rooms which folks +matrix:matrix.org\nhave upvoted”)\n\nUsing reactions to filter content\nIn the medium/long term, we are hoping to rely more extensively on reputation\ndata gathered from emoji reactions to help users curate their content filters.\nIt’s critical to understand that this is similar but different to Reddit or\nHackerNews style upvoting/downvoting - in that in Matrix you would be\nmaintaining and curating your own personal filtering criteria, rather than\nbeing obligated to use a single official centralised filter calculated by\nReddit/HN/etc.\nWe are currently in the process of implementing emoji reactions in Matrix, and\nthe current UX proposal looks roughly like this:\n\nCritically, this provides upvote/downvote semantics on a given message on the\naxes both of whether you agree with the content, and whether you like it\n(as well as supporting specifying freeform emoji).\nWe believe this will provide a way to gather contextual reputation data within a\ngiven chat room - providing a basic web-of-trust of which users are aligned\nwith one another in a given room, letting reputation data be(optionally) shared\nthrough the transitive web of trust.  Users could choose to publish their own\nreputation data (i.e. what content they have upvoted/downvoted) to help others\nseed their content filters, and then these published reputation could be used\nto label communities which emerge based within the web-of-trust.\nFor instance, if Alice publishes her reputation data (which happens to be the\nresult of her curating useful content in Rust development rooms) and Bob\npublishes his reputation data (which happens to be the result of him curating\nhis NSFW room collection), then Charlie as a new user might choose to bootstrap\nhis own filters by subscribing to +100% of Alice’s reputation and -100% of\nBob’s.  His room directory results (and possibly other content in future, if\nthis scheme works) would then be biased towards the preferences he’s specified.\nAlice and Bob can end up being figureheads of their respective communities, and\nCharlie can continue to refine his filtering choices by placing his own\nupvotes/downvotes as well as changing the blend of reputation data he\nsubscribes from elsewhere, as his preferences evolve.  The Matrix client can\nalso help Charlie visualise the behaviour of his filters as he uses the app -\ne.g. “90% of people have downvoted this room” or “Your filter is hiding 98% of\nthe room directory. Do you want to broaden your horizons?” etc.\nThis model should also be robust against voting rings and sybil attacks, as\nsybils (be they human or bot) will naturally form a clique, which should then\nbe identifiable as a community which the user can filter out.  The user could\nfilter it by explicitly downvoting themselves, or by subscribing to a\nreputation source which has already downvoted the sybils, or by learning their\nreputation via their web-of-trust (i.e. if your friends and chosen reputation\nsources have already downvoted sufficient sybils, then your filters would\nreflect the downvotes automatically).\nSimilarly, moderators for a given room could choose to publish their official\nreputation data in order to quantify the code-of-conduct for their room -\nperhaps deriving it from an existing reputation source (e.g. the matrix core\nteam could publish one for the rooms they moderate), or simply by seeding it\nbased on the moderators’ upvotes/downvotes within that room or community.\nThus users could choose which content filters to adopt, and visualise how they\nare applied, and curate whatever view of Matrix they desire.  Obviously this is\nvery much an area of active research, but we are hoping to find financial\nsupport to experiment with implementing this.\nAfter all, the challenge of filtering objectionable/misleading content on the\ninternet is not specific to Matrix, nor even to decentralised systems, and we\nhope that this work will be directly applicable elsewhere.  It is also becoming\nmore of a legal concern, with certain governments mandating content filtering\nrules to messaging providers - meaning that servers running in affected\nterritories may be legally obligated to provide their users with content\nfiltering tools of this nature.\nSee #matrix-reputation:matrix.org\n and\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1rijGLs9-RJ9Mz2Yk5wWycMbErrCDK1VJkACdUPMN0-M/\nfor more details on this.\nOutstanding issues\n\nAbility for users to apply their own personal filters to content in Matrix\ndoes not yet exist, whether by curating their own preferences or subscribing\nto a blend of someone else’s.\n\nConclusion\nMatrix provides a comprehensive set of moderation tools today, with scope for\nfurther refinements in future as detailed in the ‘outstanding issues’ sections\nabove (as of April 2019). As the Matrix.org team, In practice we use the\nfeatures above to relatively successfully admin one of the largest servers on\nthe network (matrix.org itself, with ~70K concurrent users), and to moderate\none of the larger communities on the network (+matrix:matrix.org\n; ~30 rooms with over 10K users\npresent).\n","id":"/docs/legacy/moderation/","title":"Moderation in Matrix"},"/docs/legacy/online-events/":{"body":"Starting in 2020, Team Matrix planned to start running regular meetup events, \nwith speakers, talks, Q+A, beer, pizza etc.\nWe hosted one, in London, in February. Around that time and immediately \nafterward, much of the world shut down due to a global pandemic, and hosting \nin-person meetups became infeasible.\nRather than drop the idea, we decided to make use of the technologies we \nregularly promote to host a virtual meetup event. The idea being to try to \nrecreate the fun and atmosphere of a real meetup in a decentralised way.\nThe resulting event, when viewed in directly in Element, appears as below, or\nwatch the full recording.\n\nUse Jitsi for Video\nIt's important to us, wherever possible, to use open tools. Jitsi Meet is an \nopen-source, self-hostable video conferencing platform.\nInstalling Jitsi is a much-documented experience that I won't delve into here, but for our purpose we used our \ninstallation at https://jitsi.modular.im.\nFirst, we want to get our speakers all connected. To do this, we created a new \nroom on Jitsi (the name doesn't matter), and made sure to add a password, since \nthis is not the default. All the speakers for the session will connect to this \nroom.\n\nNext, we configured the Jitsi Meet server to stream to YouTube, and also made \nthe stream available directly via a video control on https://stream.matrix.org.\nNote that we did not make the call itself available for the entire audience to \njoin - this would likely have been a impossible moderation task, and would not \nhave added to the experience.\nConfiguring the Live stream\nJitsi itself comes with the ability to stream to YouTube, but only YouTube, through the\nJibri component. An open-source\nalternative is to capture the jitsi meet screen and broadcast it as a video stream using\nOBS to capture the screen.\nFor the streaming server, one option is to use the\nnginx RTMP plugin set up to receive a stream\nvia RTMP and then convert this into an HLS stream for viewing on the web. This can also relay\nthe stream to another RTMP server so you can make the stream available on another platform\nlike YouTube. \nWhen you start streaming to your RTMP server, it will create a playlist file. Some players\nand browsers support this natively, but to make it playable in any web browser, you'll need\nto use a Javascript player like Google's shaka player.\nThis gets your stream up and running, but if you are expecting a larger audience you can also\nlook at putting caching web servers in front of the nginx to cache the media (*.ts) files.\nUse Matrix for live chat\nWe created a dedicated \"watching\" matrix room, where users could join to talk \nto each other about the streamed presentations. They can also talk to each \nother more generally about the topics - or about anything else. We were pleased \nto see conversations flowing, since these \"unofficial\" exchanges are a big part \nof in-person meetups we wanted to recreate.\nThe other thing the viewers can do in the room is ask questions of the \nspeakers. To do this, the host pulls questions out of the room, and collects \nthem ready to ask the presenter. In our event, we waited until the end of the \npresentations, but a host could choose to interrupt the speaker to ask.\nWith a dedicated room created, it's possible to add a widget to the room \ncontaining only the video embed. To do this, make a page (like\nhttps://stream.matrix.org) which contains ONLY the video, then create a\nnew custom widget in the matrix room in Element.\n\n\n\n","id":"/docs/legacy/online-events/","title":"Running online events with Open Source communication tools"},"/docs/legacy/python-nio/":{"body":"This article concerns matrix-nio, and\nasyncio. We'll build a\nsimple \"echo bot\", meaning a bot which replies to messages with the text it has\njust read. Note that this article does not cover E2EE with matrix-nio.\nInstantiation and Login\nFirst create a new venv, and install matrix-nio via pip. On the command line,\nrun:\npython3 -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install matrix-nio\n\nNext, create a new Python file, and open it for editing. We'll import everything\nwe require for this tutorial:\nfrom importlib import util\nimport asyncio\nfrom nio import (AsyncClient, SyncResponse, RoomMessageText)\n\nWe're importing asyncio so we can use the AsyncClient class from matrix-nio.\nCreate a new instance of AsyncClient by passing the homeserver and username as\narguments:\nasync_client = AsyncClient(\n    \"https://matrix.org\", \"%%YOUR-USERNAME-HERE%%\"\n)\n\nThen login, and await the response:\nresponse = await async_client.login(\"%%YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE%%\")\nprint(response)\n\nOf course, we are using an async client, and awaiting the response. Because of\nthis, we must call the async_client.login() from an async method, like so:\nasync def main():\n    response = await async_client.login(\"%%YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE%%\")\n    print(response)\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n\nNote that for versions of Python before 3.7 the asyncio syntax must be:\nasync def main():\n    response = await async_client.login(\"%%YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE%%\")\n    print(response)\n\nloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\nloop.run_until_complete(main())\n\nThe remainder of this tutorial assumes you are running everything from an\nasync method.\nThe response string should look like:\nLogged in as @pyconweb-bot:matrix.org, device id: ZBLAJHLKVP.\n\nGet into a /sync loop\nTo get updates from a Matrix homeserver to the client, the client makes a\nrequest to the /sync endpoint. In the matrix-nio AsyncClient, this is wrapped\nby the sync() method. We can get the latest updates:\nsync_response = await async_client.sync(30000)\n\n30000 means we will wait up to 30 seconds before returning. sync_response will\nnow contain a Python object containing a mapping of the (JSON) response from\nthe Matrix homeserver\n.\nWe'll inspect this response in the next section.\nIn fact, we expect there to be updates regularly, so let's create a very simple\nloop:\nwhile (True):\n    sync_response = await async_client.sync(30000)\n    print(sync_response) # note that this could be LARGE!\n    # do some reading from sync_response\n\nIn this way, every time there is a response (i.e. new events) from the\nhomeserver, they are made available in sync_response for processing, and we\nloop again.\nExplore the sync response object\nsync_response can contain multitudes\n,\ndepending on the rooms this user is part of, or has been part of.\nsync_response.rooms.join contains updates for the rooms which the current\nuser is \"joined to\" (meaning, is a member of.)\nOf these joined rooms, we are (perhaps!) most interested in the events on the\ntimeline. These are stored in timeline.events, see below:\nif len(sync_response.rooms.join) &gt; 0:\n\n    joins = sync_response.rooms.join\n    for room_id in joins:\n        for event in joins[room_id].timeline.events:\n            print(event)\n\nMessage events are a specific type of event which contain an Instant Messenger\nmessage. We can check the type before proceeding:\nfor event in joins[room_id].timeline.events:\n    if isinstance(event, RoomMessageText):\n        print (event.body)\n\nIn these cases, where the event is a message to a room, the body field will\ncontain the message text.\nIsolate specific message event objects\nKnowing that we can get the message text from an event, we can read it to\ndetermine a response. Let's make a new variable and have it store some string\nwe'll check for:\nresponse_string = \"!replybot\"\n\nNow let's suppose we're in our /sync loop, and just received an event. We can\nfilter messages that are meant for our bot as follows:\nif len(sync_response.rooms.join) &gt; 0:\n    joins = sync_response.rooms.join\n    for room_id in joins:\n        for event in joins[room_id].timeline.events:\n            if hasattr(event, 'body') and event.body.startswith(response_string):\n                print(event)\n\nUse room_send\nTo send messages, matrix-nio provides a room_send() method. There are three\narguments:\n\nthe room_id\nthe message type, we will use \"m.room.message\"\na JSON object representing the content of the message\n\nLet's improve the example above, by sending back a message to echo the ones we\nisolated above:\njoins = sync_response.rooms.join\nfor room_id in joins:\n    for event in joins[room_id].timeline.events:\n        if hasattr(event, 'body') and event.body.startswith(response_string):\n            response_body = event.body.replace(response_string, \"\").strip()\n            content = {\n               \"body\": response_body,\n               \"msgtype\": \"m.text\"\n            }\n            await async_client.room_send(room_id, 'm.room.message', content)\n\nNow whenever the bot receives a message \"!replybot some message\" it will send\nback \"some message\".\nUse of /sync next_batch tokens\nFinally, let's consider the importance of next_batch tokens. Whenever you\nreceive a response from the /sync endpoint, the response will contain\na \"next_batch\" field, which you then pass on the next request to ensure you\nhave the latest messages. matrix-nio keeps track of this automatically, so it\ndoesn't get repeated messages. However, when you stop the program and call the\n.sync() method again, how can you tell it where to start from? First let's\nget the latest next_batch token:\nasync def main():\n    response = await async_client.login(\"%%YOUR-USERNAME-HERE%%\", \"\")\n\n    while (True):\n        sync_response = await async_client.sync(30000)\n        print(sync_response.next_batch) # this is the token\n\nThen we'll write the token to a file:\nasync def main():\n    response = await async_client.login(\"%%YOUR-USERNAME-HERE%%\", \"\")\n\n    while (True):\n        sync_response = await async_client.sync(30000)\n\n        # we write the token to a file here\n        with open(\"next_batch\",\"w\") as next_batch_token:\n            next_batch_token.write(sync_response.next_batch)\n\nOnce that token is written, we know we can re-use it for the first /sync/\nrequest next time:\nasync def main():\n    response = await async_client.login(\"%%YOUR-USERNAME-HERE%%\", \"\")\n\n    # we read the previously-written token...\n    with open (\"next_batch\",\"r\") as next_batch_token:\n        # ... and well async_client to use it\n        async_client.next_batch = next_batch_token.read()\n\n    while (True):\n        sync_response = await async_client.sync(30000)\n        with open(\"next_batch\",\"w\") as next_batch_token:\n            next_batch_token.write(sync_response.next_batch)\n\nConclusion\nWith this, you can see that in very few lines, it's possible to write a working\nMatrix bot in Python, using matrix-nio.\nThe content in this article was first presented as a workshop at PyConWeb\n2019.\n","id":"/docs/legacy/python-nio/","title":"Usage of matrix-nio (Python Matrix client library)"},"/docs/legacy/stateres-v2/":{"body":"So you don't have a PhD in Mathematics and you want to implement State\nResolution v2! This document aims to\ndemystify not just the how but also the why of resolving state conflicts in\nMatrix room versions 2 and later, along with a bit of pseudocode to demonstrate\nthe implementation.\nIn Matrix, rooms don't belong to a specific server, but instead are replicated\nacross all servers that are participating in a given room. As a result, each\nserver in a room needs to be able to work out the room state independently and\nall servers in a room need to be able to arrive, as far as possible, at the same\nstate when doing so. Doing this is what allows a room to \"appear\" the same for\nall users, regardless of the homeserver they are joining from.\nState resolution is the act of taking two or more different sets of state and\nworking out the final consistent state that we deem truthful. The idea is that\nall homeservers will agree on what state looks like for a given room by\nfollowing the same state resolution algorithms.\nWhen resolving state, we adhere to the following guidelines:\n\nHigher power levels should take precedence over lower ones, e.g. the actions\nof an administrator should overrule those of a moderator\nEarlier events should be processed before later ones where possible\n\nIt's worth mentioning that concepts such as \"earlier\" and \"later\" are difficult\nto define in Matrix and this is a significant part of what makes state\nresolution difficult to do. In State Res v2, we have a couple of new concepts\nfor defining when an event is \"earlier\" or \"later\" than another event - these\nare covered in the sections below on ordering events.\nDefining state\nFirst of all, a state event is a Matrix event which contains a state_key. The\nstate key defines what the state applies to (or is often an empty string if\nthe state should apply to the entire room). Examples of state events are\nm.room.create, m.room.join_rules, m.room.power_level, m.room.member etc.\nGiven that state events are also a part of the room history, state can be\ndifferent at different points in time. Therefore, the state at a specific event\ncontains a snapshot of all state events that apply to the room at the time of\nthat given event and won't include state events that came after it. In the case\nof state events, the state at the time of that given event includes the changes\nin state as provided by the event.\nA state tuple is a (event type, state key) tuple. For example:\n\n(\"m.room.power_levels\", \"\") for room power levels\n(\"m.room.join_rules\", \"\") for room join rules\n(\"m.room.member\", \"@neilalexander:matrix.org\") for neilalexander's room\nmembership\n\nEach state event attempts to update a (event type, state key)-&gt;event key-value\nmapping in a given room, thus allowing for key-value data to be stored per room.\nDefining control events and normal state events\nIn addition to the above, we also define control events as being a subset of\nstate events which specifically have the power to add or remove abilities from\nanother user. These are:\n\nSetting room power levels: m.room.power_levels where the state_key\nequals \"\"\nSetting room join rules: m.room.join_rules where the state_key\nequals \"\"\nKicking a user: m.room.member with \"leave\" content but where the\nsender (the admin/mod) does not match the state_key (the kicked user)\nBanning a user: m.room.member with \"ban\" content but where the\nsender (the admin/mod) does not match the state_key (the banned user)\n\nAny state event that does not match the above definition is, instead, classed\nas a normal state event. These include, for example:\n\nSetting room topic: m.room.topic where the state_key equals \"\"\nSetting room avatar: m.room.display_avatar where the state_key\nequals \"\"\nUsers joining or leaving: m.room.member with \"join\" or \"leave\"\ncontent where the sender is equal to the state_key\n\nConflicted and unconflicted state sets\nThe ultimate goal of state resolution is to take some conflicted inputs and\ngive unconflicted output, and to do so in a consistent way such that all\nservers will agree on the same state. In effect, we may have been given multiple\nsets of state due to forks in the room and, when we combine them together, we\ncan end up with multiple different values for one or more given state tuples.\nThe goal is to ensure that our final state only contains a single value for each\nstate tuple.\nForks typically happen when servers that are participating in a room are no\nlonger able to keep each other up-to-date over federation. It's possible that\nusers on different servers will continue to send any number of events into the\nroom, including state events, resulting in state drifting across those servers.\nWhen the servers are able to federate again, i.e. after network connectivity is\nrestored, then we can work out the conflicted and unconflicted state by merging\nthe forks.\nConflicted state happens when:\n\nWe have more than one different value for a given state tuple in each fork\nWe have only one value for a given state tuple but it happened in only one\nfork and not the other\n\nUnconflicted state happens when:\n\nWe have only one value for a given state tuple because it is the same in all\nforks\nWe have only one value for a given state tuple because it happened before\nthe fork\n\nEvents in the input set that are unconflicted are considered to be truthful,\ntherefore apart from expecting that they pass auth, we don't do any further\nstate resolution on them. An unconflicted event will always appear in the\nfinal resolved state.\nEvents in the input set that are conflicted are the opposite - to begin with,\nwe have multiple events claiming different values and don't know which to\nbelieve. We perform state resolution on them to decide which of those values we\nwish to select, and only the selected values appear in the final resolved\nstate.\nSince we only want to perform state resolution on the conflicted set, start by\nworking through the set of input events, including their auth events and sorting\nthem into conflicted and unconflicted buckets:\nvar conflicted_events:   list(event)\nvar unconflicted_events: list(event)\n\nPartial state\nWe refer to the state as partial when we have not yet completed the state\nresolution algorithm, therefore the result is incomplete. In the first stage,\nthe partial state is equal to the unconflicted state:\nvar partial_state: map(event_type -&gt; map(state_key -&gt; event))\n\nfor each unconflicted_events as e:\n    partial_state[e.event_type()][e.state_key()] = e\n\nLater, the resolved state blocks from the conflicted state will be layered\nonto the partial state, eventually bringing us to a complete resolved state.\nResolved state\nThe final resolved state of a room is worked out from doing these things:\n\nStarting with the unconflicted state as our \"base layer\"\nWorking out the sequence of control events using reverse topological\nordering and then layering those on\nWorking out the sequence of normal state events using mainline ordering and\nthen layering those on\nReapplying any unconflicted state keys which may have been overwritten in\nthe previous steps\n\nAuth differences\nNow that we have a set of conflicted events, we also need to make sure that we\nhave enough information to satisfy the auth checks, regardless of which event we\neventually resolve to.\nFor example, imagine the case that Alice gives some power to Bob (in event A),\nBob gives some power to Charlie (in event B) and then Charlie changes the ban\nlevel (in event C):\n\nHowever, in another fork, event A is known (so Bob has received power from\nAlice) but B was not, therefore in the fork, Charlie never received power and\ntherefore was not authorised to change the ban level. When the two forks\nconverge, we would need to know about B in order to successfully authorise\nC.\nThe auth difference therefore contains all auth events that were not common to\nboth forks - if an auth event appears in only one fork but not the other then\nthat auth event must appear in the auth difference:\nvar auth_difference:     list(event)\nvar auth_sets:           map(fork_id -&gt; list(event))\n\nfor each conflicted_events as e:\n    found = true\n    for each auth_sets as auth_set:\n        if e not in auth_set:\n            found = false\n\n    if not found:\n        auth_difference.append(e)\n\nThe full conflicted set is effectively the conflicted events combined with the\nauth difference:\nvar full_conflicted_set: list(event)\n\nfull_conflicted_set = conflicted_events + auth_difference\n\nReverse topological ordering of control events\nNow that we have calculated the full conflicted set, which also includes the\nauth difference, we now can start to work out the order in which power was\ngiven or taken away from specific users.\nWhen resolving state conflicts, it's important to work out who really had power\nto do certain things at a given point in time. Working this out for control\nevents takes priority over working out the order of normal state events - those\nwill be sorted based on the power levels from this step.\nTo work out the timeline of control events, we implement reverse topological\nordering, which results in a list of events in which the order guarantees that\nauth events always come before the events that refer to them. This is done\nusing an adaptation of Kahn's algorithm.\nKahn's algorithm\nSince an event's auth chain forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we can say\nthat each auth event is a \"node\" in the graph and each relationship between two\nevents is an \"edge\". In our case, two nodes in the auth DAG have a relationship\nwhen one event refers to another event as an auth event.\nMore precisely, we would say that an event that refers to other auth events\nhas one or more outgoing edges and that an event that is relied on by other\nevents has one or more incoming edges.\nThis allows us to make a couple of assertions: that an event that has no\nincoming edges happened most recently, and an event that has no outgoing edges\nhappened least recently.\nIn our case, Kahn's algorithm works on three main components:\n\nThe unsorted input list of events, including the auth events\nA map, where we count how many incoming edges each node has\nThe sorted output list of events, effectively the result of the algorithm\n\nAssuming the following data structures, we can populate the event map and\nincoming edges with initial values:\nvar output_events:  list(event)\nvar event_map:      map(event_id -&gt; event)\nvar incoming_edges: map(event_id -&gt; integer)\n\nfor each full_conflicted_set as e:\n    event_map[e.event_id] = e\n    incoming_edges[e.event_id] = 0\n\nThe Matrix-specific details of our implementation of Kahn's algorithm lie in the\ntie-break between events. The tie-break ensures that we get a deterministic\nordering and that we also meet our two guidelines from the beginning: that we\nwill always try to prefer events from the more powerful, and we will always try\nto process older events first. When sorting, you can assert that x &lt; y by\nrunning the following tests in order:\n\nThe effective power level at x is greater than the effective power level\nat y\nThe event origin server timestamp of x is less than the event origin\nserver timestamp of **y **(that is, event x is older than y)\nThe event ID of x is less than the event ID of y, as computed by a\nlexicographical comparison, as a fallback\n\nTo ensure that the algorithm is deterministic (that is, running in the same\norder) for a given set of inputs, we must ensure that the map of incoming edges\nhas been sorted using the above rules before we do anything with it:\nfunc sorted_incoming_edges() returns list(event):\n    sort incoming_edges where x &lt; y when:\n        x.power_level &gt; y.power_level or\n        x.origin_server_ts &lt; y.origin_server_ts or\n        lexographic_compare(x.event_id, y.event_id) &lt; 0\n    return incoming_edges\n\nOnce the incoming edges have been sorted, iterate through the input list to\ncount how many incoming edges each event has and update the incoming edges map\nwith those values:\nfor each input_events as e:\n    for each e.auth_events as a:\n        incoming_edges[a.event_id] += 1\n\nThen look for events that have no incoming edges and insert them into the\nbeginning of the output list—note that we differ from a pure implementation of\nKahn's algorithm here as we specifically require the incoming edges map to be\nsorted (as above):\nwhile len(incoming_edges) &gt; 0:\n    for each sorted_incoming_edges() as id, count:\n        if count == 0:\n            output_event.prepend(event_map[id])\n\n            for each event_map[id].auth_events as auth_event:\n                incoming_edges[auth_event.event_id] -= 1\n\n            remove(incoming_edges, id)\n\nEach time we add a node into the output list, we can \"remove\" its outgoing\nedges. This means that every auth event referred to by this event has one less\nincoming edge. Once it has been exhausted, we also remove the event from the\nincoming edge map, so that we won't try to process it again.\nNow we repeat the process, continuously, until the algorithm eventually exhausts\nthe entire incoming edges map. Once the map is empty, all edges have been\nremoved and the earliest events will appear at the beginning of the output list.\nThe output list is now sorted such that all referred events now appear before\nthe events that refer to them. It is sorted in reverse topological order.\nIteratively apply resolved control events\nNow that our control events have been sorted into reverse topological order,\nwhere the first events in the list are the \"oldest\", we can now start to layer\nthese resolved control events in order to build the partial state.\nTo build up the partial state, start at the oldest event and loop through the\nlist, performing auth checks on each\nevent by using the\ncurrent partial_state as an allowed set of auth events. We define this process\nas the function auth_against_partial_state.\nIt is expected that partial_state is an empty list for the first iteration, as\nthe oldest event (which is the room create event) does not require auth events.\nThe partial state (and, by extension, the selection of allowed auth events) will\ngrow with each iteration.\nIf the event passes auth checks then update the partial state to include the\nnewly authed event before moving onto the next iteration:\nfor each output_event as e:\n    if auth_against_partial_state(e):\n        partial_state[e.event_type][e.state_key] = e\n\nEvents that fail the auth check should be ignored and should not find their way\ninto the partial state.\nCreating the power level mainline\nOnce the control events have been applied to the partial state, the remainder of\nthe normal state events should be ordered and processed based on the ordering of\ntheir power level auth events. This is done using a technique called mainline\nordering.\nThe power level mainline is created by following the path of power level\nevents, starting from the resolved m.room.power_level event from the partial\nstate, back to the point that the room was created:\nvar resolved_power_level_event: partial_state[\"m.room.power_level\"][\"\"] as event\nvar power_level_mainline:       list(event)\n\nfunc mainline_iterate(e as event):\n    power_level_mainline += e\n    for each e.auth_events as auth_event:\n        if auth_event.event_type == \"m.room.power_level\":\n            mainline_iterate(auth_event)\n\nWe refer to the time period between any two given power level events as an\nepoch.\nIn the below illustration, the \"resolved\" event is the event that appears in the\npartial state from the previous section.\n\nMainline ordering of normal state events\nSince the mainline will be ordered based on when the power level changes\nhappened, and other state events use power level events as auth events, it is\npossible to sort the order of normal state events based on which mainline power\nlevel event they most closely refer to, or by definition, which epoch the event\nhappened in.\nNote that events may appear that refer to power level events which don't appear\nin the mainline, in which case it is necessary to step through the power level\nevents iteratively until you encounter one that is on the mainline. It is\nreferred to as the closest mainline event:\nfunc get_closest_mainline_event(e as event) returns event:\n    var closest_mainline_event: event\n\n    func closest_iterate(e as event):\n        if e in power_level_mainline:\n            closest_mainline_event = e\n        else:\n            for each e.auth_events as auth_event:\n                if auth_event.event_type == \"m.room.power_level\":\n                    closest_iterate(auth_event)\n\n    closest_iterate(e)\n    return closest_mainline_event\n\nIn the following illustration, Event B happens in a more recent epoch than\nEvent A as the closest mainline event referred to by Event A is older\n(closer to the room's create event) than the closest mainline event referred to\nby Event B:\n\nTo sort the events, we use a method very similar to that used in the reverse\ntopological ordering of control events, only instead of initially sorting by\npower level, we use the position of the nearest mainline power level event on\nthe mainline. When sorting, you can assert that x &lt; y by running the\nfollowing tests in order:\n\nThe closest mainline event to x is later in the mainline then the closest\nmainline event to y (for example, in the above diagram, A is less\nthan B as B refers to a more recent mainline power level event)\nThe event origin server timestamp of x is less than the event origin\nserver timestamp of y\nThe event ID of x is less than the event ID of y, as computed by a\nlexicographical comparison\n\nTo ensure that the algorithm is deterministic (that is, running in the same\norder) for a given set of inputs, we ensure that the normal state events have\nbeen sorted using the above criteria:\nfunc sorted_normal_state_events() as list(event):\n    sort normal_events where x &lt; y when:\n        x.position_on_mainline &lt; y.position_on_mainline or\n        x.origin_server_ts &lt; y.origin_server_ts or\n        lexographic_compare(x.event_id, y.event_id) &lt; 0\n    return normal_events\n\nIn the event that multiple candidate events refer to the same mainline power\nlevel event, the remaining two tests will allow the sorting to be deterministic.\nIteratively apply resolved normal state events\nNow that our normal state events have been sorted into mainline order, where the\nfirst events in the list are the \"oldest\", we can now start to layer these\nresolved normal state events on top of the partial state.\nJust as with the control events, each normal state event should be authed\nagainst the partial state, before applying the valid events to the partial\nstate:\nfor each sorted_normal_state_events() as e:\n    if auth_against_partial_state(e):\n        partial_state[e.event_type][e.state_key] = e\n\nAny event that fails to auth against the current partial state should be ignored\nand should not be applied to the partial state.\nRe-apply unconflicted state\nNow that all of the events from the original conflicted set have been resolved\nand applied, we complete one final pass over the partial state by re-applying\nthe original unconflicted set. Ordinarily, nothing from the conflicted set\nshould overwrite anything from the unconflicted set, but pulling in auth events\nmay bring in additional state.\nReapply the unconflicted state events onto the partial state to complete the\nstate:\nfor each unconflicted_events as e:\n    partial_state[e.event_type][e.state_key] = e\n\nAt this point, the partial state is now effectively complete, therefore it now\nrepresents the final resolved state.\nFinishing up\nNow that you have completed all of the above steps, you have successfully\nimplemented State Resolution v2!

This post is primarily intended for bridge developers to refer to\nwhen building bridges.\nTypes of rooms\nPortal rooms\nBridges can register themselves as controlling chunks of room aliases namespace,\nletting Matrix users join remote rooms transparently if they\n/join #_oftc_#wherever:matrix.org or similar.  The resulting Matrix room\nis typically automatically bridged to the single target remote room. Access\ncontrol for Matrix users is typically managed by the remote network’s side of\nthe room. This is called a portal room, and is useful for jumping into remote\nrooms without any configuration needed whatsoever - using Matrix as a ‘bouncer’\nfor the remote network.\nPlumbed rooms\nAlternatively, an existing Matrix room can be can plumbed into one or more\nspecific remote rooms by configuring a bridge (which can be run by anyone). For\ninstance, #matrix:matrix.org is plumbed into #matrix on Libera Chat,\nmatrixdotorg/#matrix on Slack, etc.  Access control for Matrix users is\nnecessarily managed by the Matrix side of the room. This is useful for using\nMatrix to link together different communities.\nMigrating rooms between a portal &amp; plumbed room is currently a bit of a mess, as\nthere’s not yet a way for users to remove portal rooms once they’re created, so\nyou can end up with a mix of portal &amp; plumbed users bridged into a room, which\nlooks weird from both the Matrix and non-Matrix viewpoints.\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/387 tracks this.\nTypes of bridges (simplest first):\nBridgebot-based bridges\nThe simplest way to exchange messages with a remote network is to have the\nbridge log into the network using one or more predefined users called bridge\nbots - typically called MatrixBridge or MatrixBridge[123] etc.  These relay\ntraffic on behalf of the users on the other side, but it’s a terrible\nexperience as all the metadata about the messages and senders is lost.  This is\nhow the [telematrix]\n(https://github.com/SijmenSchoon/telematrix) matrix&lt;-&gt;telegram bridge currently\nworks.\nBot-API (aka Virtual user) based bridges\nSome remote systems support the idea of injecting messages from ‘fake’\nor ‘virtual’ users, which can be used to represent the Matrix-side users as\nunique entities in the remote network.  For instance, Slack’s inbound webhooks\nlets remote bots be created on demand, letting Matrix users be shown\ncosmetically correctly in the timeline as virtual users.  However, the\nresulting virtual users aren’t real users on the remote system, so don’t have\npresence/profile and can’t be tab-completed or direct-messaged etc.  They also\nhave no way to receive typing notifs or other richer info which may not be\navailable via bot APIs.  This is how the current [matrix-appservice-slack]\n(https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack) bridge works.\nSimple puppeted bridge\nThis is a richer form of bridging, where the bridge logs into the remote service\nas if it were a real 3rd party client for that service.  As a result, the\nMatrix user has to already have a valid account on the remote system.  In\nexchange, the Matrix user ‘puppets’ their remote user, such that other users on\nthe remote system aren’t even aware they are speaking to a user via Matrix. The\nfull semantics of the remote system are available to the bridge to expose into\nMatrix.  However, the bridge has to handle the authentication process to log\nthe user into the remote bridge.\nThis is essentially how the current matrix-appservice-irc\n bridge works (if you\nconfigure it to log into the remote IRC network as your ‘real’ IRC nickname).\nmatrix-appservice-gitter\n is being extended to\nsupport both puppeted and bridgebot-based operation. It’s how the experimental\nmatrix-appservice-tg bridge works.\nGoing forwards we’re aiming for all bridges to be at least simple puppeted, if\nnot double-puppeted.\nDouble-puppeted bridge\nA simple ‘puppeted bridge’ allows the Matrix user to control their account on\ntheir remote network. However, ideally this puppeting should work in both\ndirections, so if the user logs into (say) their native telegram client and\nstarts conversations, sends messages etc, these should be reflected back into\nMatrix as if the user had done them there. This requires the bridge to be able\nto puppet the Matrix side of the bridge on behalf of the user.\nThis is the holy-grail of bridging because both the Matrix account and the third\nparty account are accurately represented on their respective networks, with all\nuser metadata intact. This is in contrast to a relaybot which would appear as a\nseparate user from whom it represents.\nSeveral obstacles exist to the proper implementation of double-puppeted bridges.\nOn the Matrix side, we need an elegant way of having the bridge auth with\nMatrix as the matrix user (which requires some kind of scoped access_token\ndelegation). On the third-party network, unique problems exist depending on the\nlimitations of that particular network network. For example, many third party\nnetworks will lack the ability to represent other Matrix users than the one\nbeing puppeted (see hybrid relaybot).\nmatrix-puppet-bridge is\na community project that tries to facilitate development of double-puppeted\nbridges, having done so, without a bridgebot feature, for several networks\n. A downside to\ntheir approach is the assumption that an individual will run the bridge on\ntheir own homeserver, thus working around the problem of sharing auth\ncredentials on a shared homeserver.\nHybrid Relaybot Puppet Bridge\nThis type of bridge is a combination single or double puppet bridge which tries\nto solve the problem of representing other users by means of the bridgebot\ntechnique. mautrix/telegram works in\nthis way.\nServer-to-server bridging\nSome remote protocols (IRC, XMPP, SIP, SMTP, NNTP, GnuSocial etc) support\nfederation - either open or closed.  The most elegant way of bridging to these\nprotocols would be to have the bridge participate in the federation as a\nserver, directly bridging the entire namespace into Matrix.\nWe’re not aware of anyone who’s done this yet.\nOne-way bridging\nOne-way bridging is rare, but can be used to represent a bridge that is bridging\nfrom the remote system into matrix. This is common when the remote system does\nnot permit message posting, or is simply not capable of handling posting\noutside their system. The users bridged from the remote system often appear as\nvirtual users in matrix, as is the case with matrix-appservice-instagram\n.\nSidecar bridge\nFinally: the types of bridging described above assume that you are synchronising\nthe conversation history of the remote system into Matrix, so it may be\ndecentralised and exposed to multiple users within the wider Matrix network.\nThis can cause problems where the remote system may have arbitrarily complicated\npermissions (ACLs) controlling access to the history, which will then need to\nbe correctly synchronised with Matrix’s ACL model, without introducing security\nissues such as races.  We already see some problems with this on the IRC\nbridge, where history visibility for +i and +k channels have to be carefully\nsynchronised with the Matrix rooms.\nYou can also hit problems with other network-specific features not yet having\nequivalent representation in the Matrix protocol (e.g. ephemeral messages, or\nop-only messages - although arguably that’s a type of ACL).\nOne solution could be to support an entirely different architecture of bridging,\nwhere the Matrix client-server API is mapped directly to the remote service,\nmeaning that ACL decisions are delegated to the remote service, and\nconversations are not exposed into the wider Matrix. This is effectively using\nthe bridge purely as a 3rd party client for the network (similar to Bitlbee).\nThe bridge is only available to a single user, and conversations cannot be\nshared with other Matrix users as they aren’t actually Matrix rooms.\n(Another solution could be to use Active Policy Servers at last as a way of\ncentralising and delegating ACLs for a room)\nThis is essentially an entirely different product to the rest of Matrix, and\nwhilst it could be a solution for some particularly painful ACL problems, we’re\nfocusing on non-sidecar bridges for now.\n","id":"/docs/legacy/types-of-bridging/","title":"Types of Bridging"},"/docs/legacy/understanding-synapse-hosting/":{"body":"In this tutorial we’re going to deploy a synapse instance with docker-compose.\nThis tutorial is about getting a first hands-on experience with Synapse, but it\nis NOT a guide to deploying Synapse in production. Some best practices are\nmissing for a production server. If you want to deploy Synapse to production,\nyou most probably want at least:\n\nMonitoring\nBackups\nJoining the Matrix rooms or subscribing to the mailing-lists/RSS feeds to know\nwhen one of the components you use has a new release\n\nFor production setups, please see the relevant doc on\nhttps://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/\nDefining What We Want\nWhen deploying our own instance, we need to define what domain we want for our\nuser IDs and room aliases, and take care about not leaving the door open to\nabusers, even in small experimental deployments.\nHow Our MatrixID Will Look Like\nTwo very important concepts for the end-user in matrix are user IDs and room\nIDs.\n\nA typical user ID would be @john:example.org. It’s made of a username\n(john) and a provider domain (example.org).\nA typical room address would be #myroom:example.org\n\nInstead of example.org, we will want our own domain. In many cases, the root\ndomain is already used to serve a website or another service. Some people\ndecide to use a subdomain, like matrix.example.org, resulting in Matrix IDs\nfollowing the format @john:matrix.example.org.\nWhile this works in practice, the matrix. subdomain looks redundant: we’re\nalready chatting on Matrix, no need to tell me the person is on Matrix. It’s\npossible to keep serving Synapse on matrix.example.org but to still have\n@john:example.org Matrix ID, thanks to delegation of incoming traffic.\nLet’s be careful nonetheless: it’s not possible to change the domain of an\ninstance! Once you deploy it with a domain, it’s forever. This is why we are\ngoing to set-up delegation of incoming traffic from the beginning, even if we\ndon’t have anything else served on the root domain at the moment.\nNot Leaving the Door Open\nWhen setting up a Synapse instance, leaving registrations completely open\nwithout any sort of verification is a good way to get our server abused as a\nspam vector and added to many other servers’ blocklist.\nYou probably either want to close registrations entirely, add email or captcha\nverification, or even better: only allow registrations for email addresses\nmatching a certain pattern (e.g. to restrict registrations to everyone in your\norganisation as long as they have a @example.org email address).\nIn any case, by default Synapse won’t start if you leave registrations\ncompletely open without verification and without bypassing that security\nsetting. In our example we’ll close registrations entirely, and create accounts\nmanually.\nGeneral Concepts\nOn the infrastructure level, we will need to have a machine exposed to the\nInternet, and a domain name. The simplest way to get these is to rent a VPS at\na provider and buy a domain at a registrar. Renting the VPS and buying the\ndomain will not be covered in this tutorial. For the sake of transparency, we\nused a VPS from the German provider Netcup, and bought\na domain from Gandi.\nWe’re also going to deploy Synapse using docker containers: one for Synapse\nitself, one for the database Synapse relies on, one for a web server required\nto set-up delegation of incoming traffic, and one for the reverse proxy.\nThe reverse proxy we’re going to use is traefik. It’s the entry door for\nincoming traffic on our server. We will use it to secure connections by\nretrieving a certificate automatically, and to route the calls to the proper\ncontainers.\nFinally, given containers are stateless, we will need to rely on volumes to\npersist the data. This is where the data and configuration files are stored.\nThe Bare Minimum We Need\nA VPS with a public IP\nCapacity planning is a notably difficult task when hosting a service. In the\ncase of Matrix, the CPU, RAM and disk space usage grows essentially with the\nnumber of high traffic rooms your users are in.\nA 100 users deployment in a closed federation can still be considered a fairly\nsmall deployment. A five users deployment in open federation and with users in\nlarge traffic rooms such as Matrix HQ can be more resource intensive.\nWe’re not going to cover how to monitor resources usage and how to scale a\ndeployment in this tutorial: the goal is to get a first hands-on deployment for\nfun, so we’re going to deploy it on a reasonably small VPS.\nDocker and docker-compose\nWe assume you know what docker and docker-compose are, and that they are\ninstalled on a fresh server. You can find the documentation for docker and\ndocker compose on docker’s documentation centre.\nA domain name\nIn this particular example we chose Gandi, but any registrar will do. Synapse\nneeds a domain name to be able to build Matrix IDs and room aliases, and you\nneed to be able to at least add A records (and ideally AAAA, which we’re not\ngoing to cover in this tutorial for the sake of simplicity).\nLet’s Get Our Hands Dirty!\nThe Global Architecture\n\nAdding DNS records\nAssuming your domain name is example.org, you need to add A records to your VPS\nfor the following domains:\n\nexample.org\nmatrix.example.org\n\ndocker-compose structure\nA docker-compose file is used to describe what containers we want to set-up,\nwhat volumes they are going to rely on, and how to reach each container from\nthe outside world.\nHere is a dummy docker-compose file that only starts a nginx instance, for\nreference:\nversion: '3'\n\nservices:\n\n  nginx:\n    image: \"nginx:1.23.1\"\n    restart: \"always\"\n    volumes:\n      - nginx_conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d\n\nvolumes:\n  nginx_conf:\n\nSetting up a database\nLet’s start by going to our home directory, and create a directory called\ninfra. In that directory, we are going to create a docker-compose.yaml file\nwith the following content. This will create a PostgreSQL database for our\nSynapse instance.\nversion: '3'\n\nservices:\n\n  synapse_db:\n    image: docker.io/postgres:14-alpine\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      - POSTGRES_USER=synapse\n      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=aComplexPassphraseNobodyCanGuess\n      - POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS=--encoding=UTF-8 --lc-collate=C --lc-ctype=C\n    volumes:\n      - synapse_db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n\nvolumes:\n  synapse_db_data:\n\nAn important note here: storing credentials in plain text in the docker-compose\nfile is a bad practice. If you want to use this set-up in the longer run,\nplease check docker compose and secrets.\nWe can now start the container by running docker-compose up -d. We can check\nthe container is running with docker ps:\n[root@v2202112135873173933 infra]# docker ps\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS      NAMES\n8abcc08fa546   postgres:14-alpine   \"docker-entrypoint.s…\"   14 seconds ago   Up 13 seconds   5432/tcp   infra-synapse_db-1\n\nIt may look like the database is open on the Internet… but it’s actually not.\nThe container is listening on port 5432 on docker’s internal network.

To do so, let’s get the shell inside the postgresql container by running docker exec -it infra_synapse_db_1 /bin/bash. We should now be able to use the built-in SQL client by running psql -U synapse -W. We will be prompted for our password. We need to use the POSTGRES_PASSWORD declared in the docker-compose file. The output should look like as follows\nbash-5.1# psql -U synapse -W Password: psql (14.4) Type \"help\" for help.\n\nsynapse=#\n\nWe can close the sql client by simultaneously pressing the Ctrl and D keys,\nwhich will get us back to the postgresql docker container prompt. We can exit\nit too by pressing Ctrl and D once again.\nSetting up Synapse\nIt’s now time to set up Synapse itself! First of all, we need to generate a\nsample configuration file for our homeserver. To do so, let’s ask a disposable\nsynapse container to generate the sample configuration file for us. You only\nneed to edit the value of the SYNAPSE_SERVER_NAME to the value you want for the\nserver part of your Matrix IDs, and SYNAPSE_REPORT_STATS depending on whether\nyou want to report anonymous stats or not.\n[root@v2202112135873173933 infra]# docker run -it --rm --mount type=volume,src=infra_synapse_data,dst=/data -e SYNAPSE_SERVER_NAME=example.org -e SYNAPSE_REPORT_STATS=yes matrixdotorg/synapse:v1.63.0 generate\nSetting ownership on /data to 991:991\nCreating log config /data/example.org.log.config\nGenerating config file /data/homeserver.yaml\nGenerating signing key file /data/example.org.signing.key\nA config file has been generated in '/data/homeserver.yaml' for server name 'example.org'. Please review this file and customise it to your needs.\n\nThe container generated several files. The first one we’re going to have a look\nat is the homeserver.yaml file, which contains all the basic information to\nallow our server to run. Docker volumes data is located in\n/var/lib/docker/volumes/your_volume_name/_data. We asked this container to\ngenerate the files in the infra_synapse_data volumes. Let’s have a look at\n/var/lib/docker/volumes/infra_synapse_data/_data/homeserver.yaml and see what\nit contains:\nserver_name: \"example.org\"\npid_file: /data/homeserver.pid\nlisteners:\n  - port: 8008\n    tls: false\n    type: http\n    x_forwarded: true\n    resources:\n      - names: [client, federation]\n        compress: false\ndatabase:\n  name: sqlite3\n  args:\n    database: /data/homeserver.db\nlog_config: \"/data/example.org.log.config\"\nmedia_store_path: /data/media_store\nregistration_shared_secret: \"REDACTED\"\nreport_stats: true\nmacaroon_secret_key: \"REDACTED\"\nform_secret: \"REDACTED\"\nsigning_key_path: \"/data/example.org.signing.key\"\ntrusted_key_servers:\n  - server_name: \"matrix.org\"\n\nWhat a pleasant surprise, it’s fairly short! Synapse indeed tries to have safe\nand sane defaults, and allows administrators to add options to tweak their\nconfiguration if they needed. The complete reference of every single option and\nwhat they do can be found at\nhttps://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/index.html\nAnd the good news is that we are just going to edit the database section: we’re\ngoing to make Synapse connect to the PostgreSQL database we have set up\nearlier. According to Synapse’s documentation,\nwe need to edit the database section so it looks like the following instead of\nthe sql3 default:\ndatabase:\n  name: psycopg2\n  txn_limit: 10000\n  args:\n    user: synapse\n    password: aComplexPassphraseNobodyCanGuess\n    database: synapse\n    host: infra-synapse_db-1\n    port: 5432\n    cp_min: 5\n    cp_max: 10\n\nWe can save the file. Let’s edit out docker-compose.yaml file to add Synapse,\nand give it the volumes it needs to persist data:\nversion: '3'\n\nservices:\n\n  synapse:\n    image: docker.io/matrixdotorg/synapse:v1.63.0\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      - SYNAPSE_CONFIG_PATH=/data/homeserver.yaml\n    volumes:\n      - synapse_data:/data\n    depends_on:\n      - synapse_db\n\n  synapse_db:\n    image: docker.io/postgres:14-alpine\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      - POSTGRES_USER=synapse\n      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=aComplexPassphraseNobodyCanGuess\n      - POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS=--encoding=UTF-8 --lc-collate=C --lc-ctype=C\n    volumes:\n      - synapse_db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n\nvolumes:\n  synapse_data:\n  synapse_db_data:\n\nWe can now start Synapse by entering docker compose up -d and monitor what is\nhappening with docker logs -f infra-synapse-1.

We have a Synapse instance using our PostgreSQL database. Now we need to\nexpose it properly on the internet, and set-up the delegation of incoming\ntraffic.\nServing the .well-known files\nSo far, we have configured our Synapse instance, but it’s not exposed on the\nInternet at all. It can only be accessed from within the docker network. While\nwe specified the Synapse instance is going to generate Matrix IDs\nwith “example.org” as a server part, we won’t expose the Synapse instance on\nthe root domain itself. If the domain was exclusively used for Matrix that\ncould work. But if we want to host a website on example.org, then we need to\nexpose our Matrix instance somewhere else.\nWe are going to expose our instance on matrix.example.org. We need a way to tell\nother members of the federation that even if our Matrix IDs are on example.org,\nthe actual technical server is on matrix.example.org: this is what delegation\nof incoming traffic is for.\nThis can be done by serving two static files:\n\nexample.org/.well-known/matrix/server and\nexample.org/.well-known/matrix/client\n\nOne simple way to do it is to set-up a nginx homeserver and to instruct it to\nserve those files directly in its configuration file. Let’s add the nginx\nserver in our docker-compose file:\nversion: '3'\n\nservices:\n\n  nginx:\n    image: \"nginx:1.22.0\"\n    restart: \"always\"\n    volumes:\n      - nginx_conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d\n\n  synapse:\n    image: docker.io/matrixdotorg/synapse:v1.63.0\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      - SYNAPSE_CONFIG_PATH=/data/homeserver.yaml\n    volumes:\n      - synapse_data:/data\n    depends_on:\n      - synapse_db\n\n  synapse_db:\n    image: docker.io/postgres:14-alpine\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      - POSTGRES_USER=synapse\n      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=aComplexPassphraseNobodyCanGuess\n      - POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS=--encoding=UTF-8 --lc-collate=C --lc-ctype=C\n    volumes:\n      - synapse_db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n\nvolumes:\n  nginx_conf:\n  synapse_data:\n  synapse_db_data:\n\nWe can then start the container for it to populate the nginx_conf volume with\ndocker compose up -d\nLet’s now edit the /var/lib/docker/volumes/infra_nginx_conf/_data/default.conf\nfile, to add the following at the bottom of the file right before the closing\n}:\n    location /.well-known/matrix/server {\n        access_log off;\n        add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;\n        default_type application/json;\n        return 200 '{\"m.server\": \"matrix.example.org:443\"}';\n    }\n\n    location /.well-known/matrix/client {\n        access_log off;\n        add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;\n        default_type application/json;\n        return 200 '{\"m.homeserver\": {\"base_url\": \"https://matrix.example.org\"}}';\n    }\n\nWe can now restart the nginx container with docker restart infra-nginx-1. Given\nthe server is not exposed outside of the docker network, we need to get a\nprompt inside the container to check the files are properly served. We can get\nit with docker exec -it infra-nginx-1 /bin/bash\nOnce inside the container, we can use curl to ask for these files:\nroot@66a61467b9ba:/# curl -X GET \"http://localhost/.well-known/matrix/server\"\n{\"m.server\": \"matrix.example.org:443\"}\nroot@66a61467b9ba:/# curl -X GET \"http://localhost/.well-known/matrix/client\"\n{\"m.homeserver\":{\"base_url\": \"https://matrix.example.org\"}}\n\nWe can now exit the container prompt by pressing the Ctrl and D keys\nsimultaneously.\nExposing on the Internet with a Reverse Proxy\nEverything is in place, now we only have to expose the relevant bits of our\ninfrastructure on the Internet! This mainly means the nginx server, and the\nSynapse instance. Of course, we want to keep our database private and only\naccessible by containers within the docker network.\nTo do so we’re going to rely on traefik, which adds a lot of sugar when it comes\nto routing external calls to the right containers. Traefik also handles the\nLet’s Encrypt certificates management to make sure the traffic remains\nencrypted and that our certificates never expire.\nThe first thing we need to do is to add a traefik container in our\ndocker-compose file, to map the docker socket to the traefik container so it\ncan do its magic, and to give it a volume so it can store the certificates and\nassociated keypairs. Our docker-compose file should look like below. Make sure\nto update the certificatesresolvers.letls.acme.email label to an email\naddress where you can be reached out to.\nversion: '3'\n\nservices:\n\n  traefik:\n    image: \"traefik\"\n    restart: \"always\"\n    command:\n      - \"--api=true\"\n      - \"--providers.docker=true\"\n      - \"--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false\"\n      - \"--entrypoints.web.address=:80\"\n      - \"--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443\"\n      - \"--certificatesresolvers.letls.acme.email=admin@example.org\"\n      - \"--certificatesresolvers.letls.acme.storage=/certs/acme.json\"\n      - \"--certificatesresolvers.letls.acme.httpchallenge=true\"\n      - \"--certificatesresolvers.letls.acme.httpchallenge.entrypoint=web\"\n    ports:\n      - \"443:443\"\n      - \"80:80\"\n    volumes:\n      - \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro\"\n      - \"traefik_certs:/certs\"\n\n  nginx:\n    image: \"nginx:1.22.0\"\n    restart: \"always\"\n    volumes:\n      - nginx_conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d\n\n  synapse:\n    image: docker.io/matrixdotorg/synapse:v1.63.0\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      - SYNAPSE_CONFIG_PATH=/data/homeserver.yaml\n    volumes:\n      - synapse_data:/data\n    depends_on:\n      - synapse_db\n\n  synapse_db:\n    image: docker.io/postgres:14-alpine\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      - POSTGRES_USER=synapse\n      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=aComplexPassphraseNobodyCanGuess\n      - POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS=--encoding=UTF-8 --lc-collate=C --lc-ctype=C\n    volumes:\n      - synapse_db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n\nvolumes:\n  traefik_certs:\n  nginx_conf:\n  synapse_data:\n  synapse_db_data:\n\nNow let’s check traefik is actually listening to the outside world with\nss -tunlp:\n[root@v2202112135873173933 infra]# ss -tunlp\nNetid         State          Recv-Q         Send-Q                 Local Address:Port                  Peer Address:Port         Process                                           \nudp           UNCONN         0              0                          127.0.0.1:323                        0.0.0.0:*             users:((\"chronyd\",pid=735,fd=5))                 \nudp           UNCONN         0              0                              [::1]:323                           [::]:*             users:((\"chronyd\",pid=735,fd=6))                 \ntcp           LISTEN         0              4096                         0.0.0.0:443                        0.0.0.0:*             users:((\"docker-proxy\",pid=110990,fd=4))         \ntcp           LISTEN         0              4096                         0.0.0.0:80                         0.0.0.0:*             users:((\"docker-proxy\",pid=111025,fd=4))         \ntcp           LISTEN         0              128                          0.0.0.0:22                         0.0.0.0:*             users:((\"sshd\",pid=14338,fd=3))                  \ntcp           LISTEN         0              4096                            [::]:443                           [::]:*             users:((\"docker-proxy\",pid=110997,fd=4))         \ntcp           LISTEN         0              4096                            [::]:80                            [::]:*             users:((\"docker-proxy\",pid=111032,fd=4))         \ntcp           LISTEN         0              128                             [::]:22                            [::]:*             users:((\"sshd\",pid=14338,fd=4))\n\nFantastic! But that’s only the first step: traefik does listen to the outside\nworld, but it doesn’t know where to route calls yet. For that we’re going to\nrely on labels. Let’s start with something straightforward: we’re going to\nroute all the calls to our root domain example.org to the nginx container\nserving the .well-known files.\nThe nginx section of our docker-compose file should look like below. Of course,\nadapt the labels to your own domain.\n  nginx:\n    image: \"nginx:1.22.0\"\n    restart: \"always\"\n    volumes:\n      - nginx_conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d\n    labels:\n      - \"traefik.enable=true\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.nginx.entrypoints=websecure\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.nginx.rule=Host(`example.org`)\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.nginx.tls=true\"\n      - \"traefik.http.routers.nginx.tls.certresolver=letls\"\n\nWe can then restart containers with docker compose up -d. Traefik might need a\nfew minutes to retrieve the certificates, but you should now be able to reach\nhttps://example.org/.well-known/matrix/server and\nhttps://example.org/.well-known/matrix/client from your browser! Wee!\nLet’s now expose Synapse on its technical URL as well by adding some labels in\nthe docker-compose file. The synapse section should look like below. Of course,\nhere again adapt the labels to your own domain.\n  synapse:\n    image: docker.io/matrixdotorg/synapse:v1.63.0\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      - SYNAPSE_CONFIG_PATH=/data/homeserver.yaml\n    volumes:\n      - synapse_data:/data\n    depends_on:\n      - synapse_db\n    labels:\n      - traefik.enable=true\n      - traefik.http.routers.synapse.entrypoints=websecure\n      - traefik.http.routers.synapse.rule=Host(`matrix.example.org`)\n      - traefik.http.routers.synapse.tls=true\n      - traefik.http.routers.synapse.tls.certresolver=letls\n\nWe can try to reach https://matrix.example.org… and it should answer!\n\nCreating an account, and logging in\nIt looks like our server is online, that’s fantastic! Let’s connect to our new\nMatrix account then! But wait… registrations are closed by default on Synapse.\nWe can’t register using a web client. Let’s get a prompt in the Synapse\ncontainer with docker exec -it infra-synapse-1 /bin/bash to manually register\na new user using the register_new_matrix_user -c /data/homeserver.yaml http://localhost:8008 command:\nroot@e752d46bc5f2:/# register_new_matrix_user -c /data/homeserver.yaml http://localhost:8008\nNew user localpart [root]: myuserid \nPassword: \nConfirm password: \nMake admin [no]: \nSending registration request...\nSuccess!\n\nVoilà! We can now head to https://app.element.io, select our example.org domain instead of matrix.org,\nand log in with this new account!

This makes developing clients to connect to Matrix servers really easy!\nBecause it's open, and uses simple syntax for messages, you can connect Matrix\nto anything that communicates over a standard HTTP interface - later projects\nin this series will explore ideas such as building bots, performing machine\nlearning on message content, and connecting IoT devices such as Philips Hue\nlights.\nMaking a Matrix Client\nLet's explore how we would make a very simple Matrix client, with only the\nability to perform an initial sync, and to get member lists and the timeline\nfor rooms of our choice.\nThis article will explore the Matrix Client-Server API, making use of the\nmatrix-js-sdk. Later articles may discuss making the underlying calls.\nSpecifically we will cover:\n\nlogin\nsimple syncing\nlistening for timeline events\naccess the MatrixInMemoryStore\nsending messages to rooms\nhow to respond to specific messages, as a bot would\n\nWe'll use Node.js as our environment, though the [matrix-js-sdk] can also be\nused directly in the browser.\nBefore we start, make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed: follow\ninstructions at nodejs.org for your platform. Then\ncreate a new directory to work in:\nmkdir my-first-matrix-client\ncd my-first-matrix-client\n\nLet's write JavaScript\nOnce you're ready, the first thing to do is install the matrix-js-sdk from\nNPM:\nnpm install matrix-js-sdk\n\nWe include the SDK in our source exactly as expected:\nimport sdk from 'matrix-js-sdk';\n\nLogin with an access token\nInstantiate a new client object and use an access token to login:\nconst client = sdk.createClient({\n    baseUrl: \"https://matrix.org\",\n    accessToken: \"....MDAxM2lkZW50aWZpZXIga2V5CjAwMTBjaWQgZ2Vu....\",\n    userId: \"@USERID:matrix.org\"\n});\n// note that we use the full MXID for the userId value\n\nIf you are logged into Element, you can find an access token for the logged-in\nuser on the Settings page.\nIf the homeserver you're logging in to supports logging in with a password, you\ncan also retrieve an access token programmatically using the API. To do this,\ncreate a new client with no authentication parameters, then call\nclient.login() with \"m.login.password\":\nconst client = sdk.createClient(\"https://matrix.org\");\nclient.login(\"m.login.password\", {\"user\": \"USERID\", \"password\": \"hunter2\"}).then((response) =&gt; {\n    console.log(response.access_token);\n});\n\nIn any case, once logged in either with a password or an access token, the\nclient can get the current access token via:\nconsole.log(client.getAccessToken());\n\nNote: it is essential to keep this access token safe, as it allows complete\naccess to your Matrix account!\nSync and Listen\nNext we start the client, this sets up the connection to the server and allows\nus to begin syncing:\nclient.startClient();\n\nPerform a first sync, and listen for the response, to get the latest state from\nthe homeserver:\nclient.once('sync', function(state, prevState, res) {\n    console.log(state); // state will be 'PREPARED' when the client is ready to use\n});\n\nOnce the sync is complete, we can add listeners for events. We could listen to\nALL incoming events, but that would be a lot of traffic, and too much for our\nsimple example. If you want to listen to all events, you can add a listen as\nfollows:\nclient.on(\"event\", function(event){\n    console.log(event.getType());\n    console.log(event);\n})\n\nInstead, let's just listen to events happening on the timeline of rooms for\nwhich our user is a member:\nclient.on(\"Room.timeline\", function(event, room, toStartOfTimeline) {\n    console.log(event.event);\n});\n\nAccess the Store\nWhen we created a new client with sdk.createClient(), an instance of the\ndefault store, MatrixInMemoryStore was created and enabled. When we sync, or\ninstruct otherwise our client to fetch data, the data is automatically added to\nthe store.\nTo access the store, we use accessor methods. For example, to get a list of\nrooms in which our user is joined:\n// client.client.getRooms() returns an array of room objects\nvar rooms = client.getRooms();\nrooms.forEach(room =&gt; {\n    console.log(room.roomId);\n});\n\nMore usefully, we could get a list of members for each of these rooms:\nvar rooms = client.getRooms();\nrooms.forEach(room =&gt; {\n    var members = room.getJoinedMembers();\n    members.forEach(member =&gt; {\n        console.log(member.name);\n    });\n});\n\nFor each room, we can inspect the timeline in the store:\nvar rooms = client.getRooms();\nrooms.forEach(room =&gt; {\n    room.timeline.forEach(t =&gt; {\n        console.log(JSON.stringify(t.event.content));\n    });\n});\n\nSend messages to rooms\nTo send a message, we create a content object, and specify a room to send to. In\nthis case, I've taken the room ID of #test:matrix.org, and used it as an\nexample:\nvar testRoomId = \"!jhpZBTbckszblMYjMK:matrix.org\";\n\nvar content = {\n    \"body\": \"Hello World\",\n    \"msgtype\": \"m.text\"\n};\n\nclient.sendEvent(testRoomId, \"m.room.message\", content, \"\").then((res) =&gt; {\n   // message sent successfully\n}).catch((err) =&gt; {\n    console.log(err);\n}\n\nKnowing this, we can put together message listening and message sending, to\nbuild a bot which just echos back any message starting with a \"!\":\nvar testRoomId = \"!jhpZBTbckszblMYjMK:matrix.org\";\n\nclient.on(\"Room.timeline\", function(event, room, toStartOfTimeline) {\n    // we know we only want to respond to messages\n    if (event.getType() !== \"m.room.message\") {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // we are only intested in messages from the test room, which start with \"!\"\n    if (event.getRoomId() === testRoomId &amp;&amp; event.getContent().body[0] === '!') {\n        sendNotice(event.event.content.body);\n    }\n});\n\nfunction sendNotice(body) {\n    var content = {\n        \"body\": body.substring(1),\n        \"msgtype\": \"m.notice\"\n    };\n    client.sendEvent(testRoomId, \"m.room.message\", content, \"\", (err, res) =&gt; {\n        console.log(err);\n    });\n}\n\nTake a look at the msgtype in the object above. In the previous example, we\nused \"m.text\" for this field, but now we're using \"m.notice\". Bots will often\nuse \"m.notice\" to differentiate their messages. This allows the client to\nrender notices differently, for example Element, the most popular client,\nrenders notices with a more pale text colour.\nFurther\nThere is much, much more to Matrix, the Client-Server API and the matrix-js-sdk,\nbut this guide should give some understanding of simple usage. In subsequent\nguides we'll cover more detail and also explore projects you can build on top,\nsuch as IoT controls and chatbot interfaces. For now you can take a look at\nother examples in the matrix-js-sdk itself\n, and also\nthe Matrix Client-Server API which it implements.\n","id":"/docs/legacy/usage-of-the-matrix-js-sdk/","title":"Usage of the matrix-js-sdk"},"/docs/legacy/whatsapp-bridging-mautrix-whatsapp/":{"body":"Matrix is:\n\nan open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time\ncommunication.\n\nIn this article we'll benefit from all three of these attributes:\n\ninteroperable: we'll see how Matrix can be made to interact with WhatsApp\ndecentralised: you can perform this on your own server while still enjoying\nthe benefits of being connected to the rest of the Matrix federation\nreal-time communication: we'll see how to send and receive messages in\nreal-time\n\nInstall your homeserver and install mautrix-whatsapp, the WhatsApp bridge\nFirstly, you need to have a Matrix homeserver installed. If you don't currently\nhave one, take a look at the instructions at [Installing Synapse]\ninstalling-synapse, and also in the Synapse README.\nNext, install mautrix-whatsapp by following the instructions at\nmautrix-whatsapp/wiki.\nIf you are starting from scratch, I suggest you take a look at\nmatrix-docker-ansible-deploy, as this project will enable you to deploy\nSynapse, mautrix-whatsapp and other components easily.\nFor example, if you have an existing deployment using\nmatrix-docker-ansible-deploy, you can add mautrix-whatsapp simply by adding\nthe following line to your configuration file:\nmatrix_mautrix_whatsapp_enabled: true\n\n... and re-running the setup:\nansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all\n\nEither way, you will soon have a functioning Matrix Synapse homeserver and\nmautrix-whatsapp installed with it. Next, we will set up an Android VM.\nSet up an Android VM\nThe best way to run an Android Virtual Machine is to use the Android Studio\ntools from Google. First, install Android Studio\n, making sure to follow the\npost-install steps, as they will install additional tools we need, including\nAVD Manager.\nOnce installed, run AVD manager by choosing Tools -&gt; AVD Manager from the\nmenu.\nFollow the steps to create a new virtual machine, in this example I have a Nexus\n5X running Android 9, but almost any configuration is fine here. Make sure that\nyou give the device access to the Play Store.\n\nInstall WhatsApp and sign-in\nLaunch the Virtual Device, the open the Play Store and sign in. Now use the Play Store to install WhatsApp on the Virtual Device.\nYou will be asked to verify your phone number, use your number on another device to complete this step.\n\nSetup mautrix-whatsapp bridge\nNow that you have WhatsApp working in a VM, and Matrix working on your server,\nit's time to bridge them together!\nPer the instructions at mautrix-whatsapp/wiki, you must start a new chat\nwith @whatsappbot:yourdomain&gt;. Type login to begin the authentication\nprocess.\nmautrix-whatsapp operates by using the WhatsApp Web feature of WhatsApp - which\nmeans it uses a QR code that you must now scan on the device running WhatsApp -\nwhich in your case is the AVD. In order to scan the presented QR code, set your\nAVD camera to passthrough the camera device on your host machine - see the\nimages below.\n\n\nOnce this is complete, you can type sync, to start bridging contacts, and\nsync --create to automatically create room invites.\nAnd that's it! You may need to take a little time to watch the sync happen,\nparticularly if you have a very large number of chats on the WhatsApp side, but\nthere is no further configuration needed.\nDemo!\n\n","id":"/docs/legacy/whatsapp-bridging-mautrix-whatsapp/","title":"Bridging Matrix with WhatsApp running on a VM"},"/ecosystem/":{"body":"To be filled with content, maybe\n","id":"/ecosystem/","title":"The Matrix Ecosystem"},"/ecosystem/bots/":{"body":"","id":"/ecosystem/bots/","title":"Bots"},"/ecosystem/bridges/":{"body":"An important idea in Matrix is Interoperability. This means that Matrix is open to exchanging data and messages with other platforms using an Open Standard. We refer to the connection to other platforms as bridging.\nFor a thorough examination of the different methods of bridging, and a discussion of the terminology involved, check out How do I bridge thee? Let me count the ways...\nPortal rooms: these control chunks of room aliases namespace. For example, #freenode_#channelname:matrix.org corresponds to #channelname on Freenode. In this way, Matrix users can transparently join IRC channels on Freenode. Portal rooms are typically managed by the remote network's side of the room.\nPlumbed rooms: these rooms are \"plumbed\" into one or more specific remote rooms by configuring a bridge (which can be run by anyone). For instance, #matrix:matrix.org is plumbed into #matrix on Freenode, matrixdotorg/#matrix on Slack, etc. Access control for Matrix users is necessarily managed by the Matrix side of the room. This is useful for using Matrix to link together different communities.\nBridgebot-style: in this case, messages in either direction are conveyed by a bot residing on the given platform. This is a sub-optimal experience because metadata is lost. For example, all messages might be sent by the same bot, but with the message text prefixed with the name of the original sender.\nPuppeting: solves the problems of Bot-based bridging by \"puppeting\", meaning controlling, a user on the other side of the bridge. This means that to native users, they see messages as being sent from the correct sender. Double-puppeting means this is done in both directions of the bridge. This is the most preferred way of implementing a Matrix bridge.\n","id":"/ecosystem/bridges/","title":"Bridges"},"/ecosystem/clients/":{"body":"\nClients are needed to chat using Matrix.\nHere is a
